The building is clean and well kept, but is beginning to require considerable repairs. Despite the drain put in last summer, the north wall still heaves with the frost, cracking the walls of the building.\n\nThe new carpenter shop is a great convenience, as is also the root house. There has been no frost in the roothouse to date, but a small fire has been kept going almost constantly all winter.\n\nThe chicken house is very satisfactory, and the hens are giving a good return if capital cost is not considered. The stable is very satisfactory, with the exception of the ventilation, which is insufficient.\nIndian Boarding School\n\nNorway House, Man.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNorway House,\nApril 21st, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that a few days ago I was asked by the Principal of the Norway House Residential School to take a look at the north wall of the building. This is the same wall upon which I have been reporting each year for about four years. The Principal stated that he was afraid it would fall down. I have no fear of that at present, but it heaves considerably, opens out the carpenter work at the top of the wall about three inches, and heaves the floor inside, with the stairways, etc., several inches, and is wrecking the building on each floor.\n\nLast summer Rev. T. Ferrier secured from the Commissioner authority to put in a drain from the building to the lake. Mr. Ferrier pointed out to me the need of something being done, with which I fully agreed. I was doubtful if a drain could be made where he decided, but he was certain. The Principal of the school was to put in the drain, and the tile was shipped out. I had no information on the matter. When the ditch was nearly half dug, and a lot of the tile in and the ditch filled, it was found that there was so much rock that it could not be continued, and they were compelled to abandon it.\n\nThey then came to me for instructions. I had none. However, I told them that the only way I knew of getting a drain without putting in a long one, was to turn their drain pipes into the old water main, let the water follow this to opposite the septic tank, and then carry it from that point to the point of discharge of the sewers. They turned their pipes into the old waterline, but did not alter the outlet. The outlet is now into a box near the lake at the intake, and on the same side, where the discharge filters out through sand and sawdust with which the box is filled, and into the lake. The doctor objects, and so do I, to this arrangement, as this line is broken, and passes under a couple of old sewer lines, where the soil is likely to be contaminated, and the water is likely also to be contaminated. It is not so objectionable in winter, but I think it should be changed this season.\n\nThe drain appears to be working well. It keeps the floor of the laundry and the boiler pits dry, where trouble has always been experienced. However, it does not appear to help the wall any. Whether it would another year,\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nIndian Office,\nRegina.\nI do not know, but I would be doubtful of its being of sufficient benefit to make some other protection of the wall necessary.\n\nMy previous suggestion for this wall was the addition of ten or fifteen feet to the kitchen on the North west corner of the building, and to put the foundation well below frost line, and down to the rock if possible. This would care for the North west side. For the North East I suggested a root house, which was required, built on the north of this wall, and the foundations well down as with the other extension. This could have opened into the room of the basement where the water tank is located. Last summer the roothouse was built in another place, so this cannot now be done.\n\nMay I say, that the outlet of the ditch should without fail be changed this summer, and also something should be done to protect this wall.\n\nIf a septic system is installed at the hospital this summer, as recommended and estimated for, one ditch and one pipeline might be arranged to carry both the outlet from the septic tank, and the diversion from this old line.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) Wm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 22, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nPursuant to your conversation when in the Department today, you are authorized to make whatever arrangements are advisable in connection with the undermentioned repairs and replacements at the Norway House Indian Residential School. The appropriation for the purpose is $3,000 and the Department has already made a $400 grant towards the cost of a boat. If the work cannot be satisfactorily completed for the sum of $2,600, you might let me have an interim report and recommendation.\n\n1. Jacking up and putting in suitable footings where necessary for the main building.\n\n2. Making suitable arrangements for the disposal of seepage water. In this connection I wish to refer you to the rough drawing which is enclosed and to official letter of the 19th ultimo, which authorized an expenditure of $400 for the hospital septic tank and outlet. It may be possible to use the hospital drain in connection with the disposal from the school. This is Mr. Indian Agent Gordon's suggestion. Please see the last paragraph of his letter to you of April 21st, last.\n\n3. The Principal has stated that the generator for the electric plant is beyond repair and should be replaced this year.\n\n4. It is stated that the steam piping should be overhauled with a view to making minor replacements. Rev. T. Ferrier, of Brandon, has promised to send to you information regarding the size of pipe at present in the school, so that a supply can go up with the plumber.\n\n5. The conductors from the eaves of the main building were never completed and it is the water from the roof that has caused some of the difficulty with the foundation. These conductors should be completed.\n\n6. Three hundred lineal feet of 2\" planking, 12\" wide, for horse stall floors, and four hundred feet of shiplap for lining the cold storage room.\n\nYou will remember that you suggested it would be advisable to send with the man who is to supervise the work at least one expert labourer with the materials that would be necessary to carry on.\n\nIn the purchase of materials and engagement of labour, please be guided by the instructions in the Deputy Superintendent General's No. 1-1-5 of the 14th instant. The Department will leave this matter entirely in your hands and will ask you to do only that work that is necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

This could probably be attended to by the man whom the Delco Light Company send up there to attend to the installation of a new battery in the hospital plant.\n\nIf we find that it is necessary to purchase a new generator, I shall be glad to have your authority for same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 16, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your No. 207-11A of the 6th instant, and in reply wish to state that you are authorized to either repair or replace the generator of the lighting plant at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nNorway House, Manitoba\nSaturday, July 31/26\n\nMr. W. M. Graham,\nCommissioner for Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is my report on the condition of the school foundations, and basement walls. The seepage water I can deal with at smaller cost and in a satisfactory manner, by making a seepage well and putting a small pump on it.\n\nI am taking care of all the water from the eaves by running the conductor pipes out as they should have been run in the first case. To deal with the old pipe line for seepage would mean opening this line right to the Lake, as it is choked at many places.\n\nOn two sides of the building, large sections of concrete pavement were laid, but for 3 or 4 feet from the walls this was either left out or broken out. The water has washed the earth into holes, and a lot of water gets down into the footings at these places. I propose to lay this concrete.\n\nI believe the method I am adopting is the cheapest and most satisfactory. The foundation walls have perished completely. The cause is poor concrete. These walls are full of building rubbish - pieces of wood, and every kind of dirt. All the spacing pieces between the forms were left in, and with the effect of weather they have broken up the walls. I am trying to get buttresses against some of the worst places. There is no reinforcement in the walls, and the worst possible mixture was used - it is more like a poor sand mortar than good concrete, with the result that the walls are shattered in all directions.\n\nI am going ahead with the septic tank. The sewer line has been laid - it remains to test the flow. I have given a list of material required to Mr. Gordon who is sending it in.\n\nI found that to wire you would cost 10\u00a2 per word for the first stage by wireless, and the message would be a long one.\n\nThe lighting plant at the school is not a Delco. There is no name on the generator, and I am told it was either second or third hand when purchased. I am enclosing a note Mr. Blackford has handed me re the lighting plant.\n\nMr. Gordon has not yet received the check to pay for the labour here.\n\nThere are a lot of different makes and sizes of radiators and piping through the school. Repairing this heating plant will require the services of a plumber and steamfitter.\n\nI am going ahead with the work at the school, and the septic tank at the hospital. The pipe and fittings arrived yesterday. I will have to send an order for more material for forms for the septic tank, etc.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) J. Mayoh.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., August 10th, 1926\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a report that I received from Mr. Jos. Mayoh, whom I sent to Norway House to look into the condition of the defective school foundation, and also the matter of drainage. The report will give you a pretty good idea of just what the situation is. It appears to me that it will be necessary to send a plumber up there to attend to the work that Mr. Mayoh cannot do.\n\nI am anxious for you to see this report personally, because it looks to me as though some very bad work has been done when this school was built; in fact it could not be much worse. Was there an Inspector on this building when it was under construction?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 20, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 207-11A of the 10th instant, with enclosures, with reference to the defective foundation at the Norway House Indian Residential School. I note that this part of the work was very poorly done when the building was erected. It is hard to understand this, as there was an inspector of construction. I note that it may be necessary to send a plumber to look after the repairs to the radiators and piping.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nNorway House, Man.\nAug. 26-1926\n\nSir:\n\nIn accordance with your request of Aug. 13 I made an inspection of the lighting plant at the Indian Boarding School at this place, & beg leave to report as follows.\n\nInspection\n\n(A) The Generator\n\nThis machine is an obsolete type & insufficient capacity for the job. It is now necessary to charge on two banks in parallel, & the voltage is too low to operate the lamps while this is being done. The rated voltage of this generator is fifty volts. This is only sufficient to charge a 32 volt battery. The total output of the plant is in the neighborhood of 1600 watts. The total possible load is about 6000 watts, the average load being about 3000 watts.\n\nThe bearings of this generator are worn out. The shaft is also badly worn.\n\nPLEASE USE BOTH SIDES.\nan attempt has been made to adjust these bearings, by sawing the bronze bushings & using shims to take up the play. This has not been entirely successful and there is considerable play and vibration at the present time.\n\n(3) The wiring \u2014 the wiring in this building is in a dangerous condition. It was probably not too well done in the beginning and many alterations have been made since. There are many uncovered joints, some of them dangerously close to the metal ceilings. Numbers of these joints are not even protected with tape.\n\n(4) General \u2014 the voltage of this plant is fifty seven. This is unusual and inconvenient. The supplies are not of a standard type for this country, in many cases, have to be ordered specially.\n\nFor example, the lamps are made in England, and are not ordinarily procurable in Winnipeg. The Hospital, an Indian Dept. building stands 400 feet off, and neither current...\nover supplies are interchangeable.\n\n(A) Recommendations\n\nThe Generator \u2014 This generator is, in my opinion, not worth the cost of repair or the freight to get it from Winnipeg. It cannot be repaired on the spot. It would be hardly practicable to leave the school without lights during the two or three weeks when it would be away for repair. If repaired it would still be of insufficient capacity.\n\nI recommend the installation of a 3 K.W. 110 Volt direct current generator, to be operated by the engine now in use, which is new & good.\n\n(B) The Wiring\n\nI recommend that a qualified electrician be employed to put the wiring throughout the building in a safe & satisfactory condition. This could be done by the man who installs the generator.\na suitable switchboard would be required, as the present one would not be satisfactory for the 110 volt current.\n\n(c) Battery - The present battery has a probable life of from two to three years. It is of 28 cells, furnishing 5.6 volts. To bring the volts to the required 110 volts it will be necessary to add 28 cells of the same capacity as those already in use, 160 amperes hour.\n\n(d) General\n\nIn my opinion the school and the hospital should be on a position to furnish current to each other, in the event of the plant at either building being temporarily out of commission. This would only mean the connection of the two buildings by a suitable line and a double pole double throw switch at each end of the line.\n\nIt strikes me that the ultimate solution of the power problem at this place will be a central plant which will furnish lights to all the Indian Depot buildings on this point and pump the water as well.\nBrandon Industrial School,\nSeptember 1st, 1926.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHerewith is a copy of the report of Mr. E. Maynard, re the electric and lighting at Norway House.\n\nI have word from Mr. Blackford, the principal in which he urges immediate action. He is now in Winnipeg making purchases for the winter and will be returning about the 7th. He has first hand information re the great necessity of making this improvement. If action is not taken, they may be in darkness before the winter is over.\n\nMr. Blackford informs me that the total cost of the improvements made by Mr. Mayho, whom Commissioner Graham sent to Norway House is about $700.00.\n\nI would appreciate very much if the Department would authorize the necessary requirements to have material and a man on the boat that leaves on the 7th. To accomplish this, instructions must be given by wire.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 4)\nTo Rev. T.

Graham, Esq. -\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, Sask. -\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith the copy of a letter that I received this p.m. from Mr. J.T. Blackford the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Norway House, operated under the auspices of the (Methodist formerly) now the United Church of Canada.\n\nThis letter has reference to the present condition of lighting plant of this school. This plant is evidently in a very unsatisfactory condition.\n\nI told Mr. Blackford that I would submit a copy of his letter to you with the least possible delay.\n\nThe season of navigation closes usually on or about the 10th October, and after that date any communication with Norway House, as to the delivery of freight, is closed until the 1st June the following spring, except at greatly advanced cost for freight charges via The Pas and to Mile 137 on the Hudson's Bay railway, thence by dog train about 120 miles to Norway House.\n\nThe condition of the plant indicates unreliability, and if the plant is not replaced, fixing it seems to be out of a possibility, a break down might be reasonably expected during the coming winter. Some provision to meet the situation for furnishing some means of lighting should be arranged. Coal Oil and Lamps should be provided if the plant is not put in shape.\n\nMr. Maynard's report indicates the condition of the plant, and I understand he has given a pretty correct statement, to put the plant in working shape seems to be very doubtful and the expense to do so seems to mean an excessive cost for the value received.\n\nI have indicated as fully as I can the outlook, for your information, so that you can deal with the matter as you deem best in good time. Your obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnclosures.\nWinnipeg, Man., Sept. 8th, 1926.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs navigation on Lake Winnipeg closes five weeks from now, I respectfully write to ask what, if anything, has been done towards putting the Norway House Residential School lighting plant in order. Over a year ago the Department of Indian Affairs was advised of the very unsafe, and inadequate, condition of this plant. To-day it is worse. Last winter we had to carry on our work in semi-darkness. There was much distress, and often danger, in consequence. The worry and responsibility this caused was so great that, as Principal, I absolutely refuse to carry it this coming winter.\n\nMight I press for an immediate consideration and answer, as I cannot return to Norway House until assurance is given that provision will be made in time to meet this very imperative need.\n\nI appreciate very much the consideration you have given us in the past.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Rev. T.

Graham which accompanied a copy of the letter of the Principal.\n\nI am submitting this, so that there would not be any delay in getting the matter placed where it would receive the necessary attention, that would result in having this problem solved as quickly as possible.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 23rd, 1926.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI am returning herewith the account which you submitted covering the cost of the equipment, labour, etc., for the electric lighting plant at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will forward this account to the official of this Department who placed the order with you, as it is necessary that the account be certified by him before payment can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co. Ltd.,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\nSir:-\n\nLast summer I sent Mr. Mayoh up to Norway House to put in shape the drainage and sewage lines in connection with the Boarding School, Hospital and Doctor's residence, and to install a Septic tank in the hospital. Since his return Mr. Mayoh has reported that the heating system and hot water service in the Boarding School is in very bad shape and requires a thorough overhauling and certain replacements.\n\nIn forwarding the Estimates for the Norway House Agency on October 26th., I stated in my covering letter with regard to an item of $10,000 for an addition to the School that I was not sure that this work should be proceeded with, as I had had no report as to the necessity for making this change. I beg to say that since writing that letter I have learned that this building, which is to provide additional kitchen and dining room space, is necessary, and it will serve as a protection to the foundation which has caused us so much trouble in the past. I believe that it will not cost anything like $10,000 to do the work, but I would strongly recommend that this amount be left in the Estimates, as the difference will be required to put the heating system in shape, which should be attended to next summer without fail. I would be glad to have word from you at an early date, stating that this has been allowed, so that preparations can be made the first thing in the Spring to have the work undertaken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 24, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter No. 207-11A of the 15th instant, recommending that provision be made in the Estimates for the next fiscal year of an amount of $10,000 to erect an addition and make repairs to the heating system at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I wish to state that these requirements have been noted for our Estimates for next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ltd., Winnipeg, Man., for service in connection with the lighting plant and overhauling the wiring at the Indian Residential School, Norway House.\n\nThe original estimate of cost has been exceeded. This was largely caused by the delay of the man to do the work which arose from the bad weather conditions that prevailed during the Fall. He was held up on the lake, both going and coming.\n\nThe wiring repairs exceeded the work calculated as it was in poor shape. A good job has been completed.\n\nThe Department authority was given by wire dated September 16th, 1926.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

C. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, dated December 14th, 1926, I made a request for a grant of $12,000 for the Norway House Boarding School plant. The requirements for the coming year are as follows:\n\n1. Repairing the foundation of the main building. An addition to the kitchen will aid in this foundation.\n\n2. The plumbing needs to be repaired throughout the entire building.\n\n3. The building needs painting outside.\n\n4. A new washing machine is needed for the laundry.\n\n5.

Oct 7th 1926\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI have attached an account for batteries that you advise me as \"already paid.\" I am wondering if this \"already paid\" does not apply to the first lot of batteries as these would be the same price.\n\nJ.G. Blackford\nOttawa, March 29, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing an account of the Globelite Battery Company, Limited, for one 28 cell battery supplied to the Norway House Indian Residential School. A former account from this company, dated September 21st, with freight charges of $3.95 added - a total of $200.85 - was paid. Consequently, when the enclosed account reached the Department for payment, it was sent back to the Rev. T. Ferrier, of Brandon, with the remark that I believed it already had been settled. I now understand from Mr. Blackford and from Rev. T. Ferrier that this was the second shipment of cells, that altogether 56 were supplied and that this account is in order. Please ascertain if the Globelite Battery Company of Winnipeg understand the matter this way and, if so, have them again submit this account in duplicate and you may certify to it. It should then be forwarded to the Department for payment if in order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJno. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nChambers of Commerce,\nPrincess St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nI find that the washing machine, power, at the Norway House Boarding School is in bad condition, has been repaired temporarily, but will last only a short time.\n\nI would recommend that a new washer be supplied to this school, similar to the one worn out, or to the one supplied to St. Joseph's school, Cross Lake, and that it be ordered in time to come out on the first boat from Selkirk, about May 26th.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Church authorities urged that funds be provided for a new power washing machine at the Norway House Indian Residential School. There is an item for general repairs in the Main Estimates. Mr. Indian Agent Gordon now writes that a new washing machine should be forwarded, if possible, on the first boat as the old one, although repaired temporarily, will soon be out of commission. The cost of a new washer is $400 F.O.B. Toronto. The freight to Norway House will add considerably to this price however.\n\nAs the matter appears to be urgent, I wish to recommend that you give authority to the purchase.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMarch 30, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nPlease purchase from Stanley Brock Limited, the following:\n\n1 - 56 x 54\" Globe wood washer, belt driven.\n\nThis washer is required for the Norway House Indian Residential School and will cost approximately $400.00, and you should arrange to have it shipped by the first boat.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nWith reference to my Estimates for the Norway House Indian Residential School for this Fiscal year, may I say that the most pressing work to be done is the painting of the building.\n\nThe Department's architect can figure from the plans of this building the exact surfaces to be covered, in case the work were let by contract. I am of opinion that the following quantities of paint would be required. I am giving colors as agreed on between the Principal and myself, and these colors are very nearly the colors now on the building, which would thus require the minimum of paint, two coats:\n\n- 40 gals \"Blind Green\"\n- 8 \" Buff\n- 10 \" Green cement paint, nearly same shade as above\n- 25 \" Brown roof stain\n- 20 gals. Raw Linseed oil\n- 8 \" Turpentine\n\nA carpenter would be required to go over the building to replace siding boards, etc., would probably require four days' work.\n\nAbout 400 ft. of clear 8\" shiplap would also be required for replacement. This is what was put on originally for siding.\n\nWhile, with the instruction of a good painter, the boys of the school could do some of the work, provided the work were done in June when the boys are at the school, yet there is so much trimming and sash work to do, and the amount of scaffold work would be so large, that the safest, and probably the most economical way to get the work done would be by contract.\n\nI would strongly recommend that this work be done this season, and as early as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department no doubt thought it was a duplicate account. Now, as the end of the fiscal year draws near, pressure is being brought to bear on Mr. Bunn for the settlement of the account.\n\nI would suggest that you forward a cheque in payment, and ask Mr. Ferrier to take up the matter of a refund, in which I will support him with the facts of the case.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.T.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter, number and date as marginally noted above.\n\nIn reply I offer the following in explanation.\n\nOn the 30th Sept., 1926, I received the following radiogram from Mr Agent Gordon at Norway House:-\n\n\"Duplicate shipment of battery for school.\n\"School assumes responsibility.\n\"Writing.\n\"Bulbs.\"\n\nThis came to hand at 5 p.m. on the 30th Sept., 1926.\n\nPrompt action made it possible to get the last boat of the season, by the radiogram.\n\nI was asked to duplicate a 28-cell battery, covered by Vchr #3834, and which I had shipped by instruction of Commissioner W.M. Graham, for the Indian Residential School at Norway House; this shipment completed a 56-cell new battery, and from what I knew of the conditions I knew that the second 28-cells were required to make a good job.\n\nI had no authority from any source, however as the school assumed the responsibility, knowing that the time to act was limited and the necessity for this unit urgent, I acted and took steps to ship the second 28 cells and received them in due course at the school and the result has been that good service from the school lighting plant has resulted.\n\nAs the School had assumed the payment, I left that part with them, what I did was help them out of a corner.\n\nI found that the amount was not paid on the 10th March, so I radiographed Mr Agent Gordon as follows:-\n\n\"Have Blackford remit Two hundred and 23/100 dollars for duplicate shipment battery.\"\n\nI had reply to this dated 11th March, 1927:-\n\n\"Blackford forwarding cheque for battery to you next mail.\"\n\nOn the 29th March I received the promised cheque from Mr. J.T. Blackford. I telephoned the Globelite people and I handed them the...\nthe cheque and two receipts in triplicate from them, these I expected to send to Mr. Blackford after the opening of navigation, so I am able to send them to you now to back up this explanation. Date of receipt is 30th March, 1927.\n\nOn the 1st April I received your letter of the 29th Mar., 1927, I was very busy and held over a reply, which probably was a mistake. Now I submit a voucher in favor of Mr. J.T. Blackford for the amount he has paid, and if the cheque comes to me I will deposit it to his credit and thus square him up, all this is subject to your approval.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, June 9, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, copy of the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of today's date to Mr. Commissioner Graham, which has reference to the repairs and replacements at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am pleased to state that funds are now available to proceed with the addition, which will provide more kitchen and dining room space, and for general renewing of the foundation of the main building. You may also arrange to have the plumbing at this school thoroughly overhauled and put in proper shape and do what painting and general repairing is required. I do not consider it advisable to prepare specifications and ask for tenders on this work because of the geographical situation of the school. You may make the best possible arrangements to have the work undertaken at once, as the shipping season is limited. You should be guided by the general instructions of my 1-1-5 of the 6th ultimo.\n\nThe church authorities request that a cement floor be placed in the boys' basement.

I know the house is very cold. Also a chimney is required for the kitchen.\n\nHe asks that the following material be purchased by the Department for this work.\n\n- Brick 250.\n- Lime 1 barrel.\n- Cement 20 sacks.\n- Stripping, 3500 lineal feet, 1\u00bd\" X 1\".\n- White paint 2 gals.\n- Maroon paint 1 gal.\n- Turps 1 gal.\n\nThe total cost of the material would be approximately, including freight, $175.00. would not exceed $200.00.\n\nThe work could be done by the school.\n\nThis house is the property of the Department, and as the work is required, I would recommend that the material be furnished if at all possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

To send an expert painter from Winnipeg and pay him for his time going and coming and then the standard wage for doing the work would make the cost very great. I took the matter up with Mr. Indian Agent Gordon and asked if he knew of anyone at Norway House who could do the work and he advises me that Mr. Blackford, the Principal, agrees that the school will undertake the work, provided the Department will pay for the labour involved, and also pay a member of the staff to supervise the work. Is it the Department's intention that we should pay members of staff extra for doing work of this kind? In the meantime as the season is getting short I have wired Mr. Blackford to proceed with the work, but stated that I did not consider it should be necessary to pay a member of the staff to supervise the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

He also reports that the siding on the school is in bad shape and that it is impossible to heat the building properly on that account. I am sending a supply of siding forward by the first boat and making arrangements to have the whole building re-sided.\n\nWhen the work of overhauling the plumbing is completed, and the building has been re-sided I think the Norway House School can be considered to be in good shape.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nActing on orders I received from you August 9th 1927, I proceeded to Norway House with men, material and tools, to carry out needed repairs to School Building there.\n\nOur staff was supplemented with all the suitable local labor obtainable.\n\nBOILERS:\n\nThe front head on No. 1 Boiler, which was badly corroded, was taken out and replaced with a new one. A complete new set of flues was also put in this boiler.\n\nNo. 1 boiler is now as good as new.\n\nNo. 2 boiler has also been put in good condition, being provided with new hand holes, and given a good cleaning.\n\nWATER COLUMNS:\n\nOn both boilers were set at the proper level, connections made with the boiler head and tees provided for cleaning, fitted with brass plugs.\n\nSUSPENSION OF BOILERS:\n\nThe brick work had settled, and the boilers were practically hanging on the steam connections. It was necessary that boilers be suspended. This was done by using steel rails, extending from inside concrete wall, to outside concrete wall. 7/8 steel rods were run under the boiler lugs and up through heavy places over the steel rails. Both boilers are thus suspended independently of the brickwork.\nBOILER CASTINGS:\n\nNew angle and T bars were provided for the back end and the front; fire arches raised and reset. New grates were put in where needed.\n\nBOILER BRICK WORK:\n\nBrick work removed for boiler repairs was replaced and new firebrick linings and bridge walls installed.\n\nBLOW OFFS:\n\nNew blow off cocks were put in and blow off pipes were run to drain separately and pipe ends left visible over catch basin.\n\nFEED VALVES:\n\nBoiler feed valves were extended from back to front of boilers.\n\nINSPECTION & PROTECTION:\n\nThese boilers now conform to the law. We were fortunate in procuring the services of an ex-provincial boiler inspector to do the boiler work.\n\nVENTILATION:\n\nThe ventilation was completely gone over, and where foul air vents were found at the ceiling these were extended to near the floor.\n\nThe main vent in attic was tightened up, and covered in the attic, and both fresh air intake and foul air outlet were provided with dampers.\n\nNEW RADIATION:\n\nAn additional 709 square feet of new radiation in twelve radiators was installed at points that previously had been cold, chiefly at entrances and in dormitories and sewing room.\n\nSTEAM PIPING:\n\nWhere new radiators were installed, and at other places where additional radiators had been installed, the steam mains were cut and proper sized Tees put in with flanges and connections made to radiators with a good seam.\nin size. Mains were properly graded, and, where necessary, radiator connections were shortened or lengthened as required.\n\n**Radiator Repairs:**\n\nAll defective radiator valves were replaced and all valves and flanges packed.\n\nNew nipples were fitted in all radiators of the push nipple type, and new gaskets were put in radiators of the screw nipple type.\n\nFloors were repaired under radiators that had rotted, due to leaking radiator nipples.\n\n**Basement Radiators:**\n\nAll basement ceiling radiators were lowered from 12 to 15 inches, and six extra radiators installed, two being brought down from the attic, the others being salvaged from the old entrance radiators.\n\n**Air Valves:**\n\nNew automatic air valves were put in where old ones were found defective, and each radiator was fitted with an additional air valve of the Hot Water type, to be used if the automatic for any reason refused to operate.\n\nNew Trane quick opening air vents were installed on the end of each steam main.\n\n**Hot Water Tank:**\n\nThe hot water tank was raised thirty inches and fitted with new supports.\n\nThe steam supply increased and raised, and a new steam coil fitted inside and the tank cleaned. The condensed water will now return to the boilers.\n\n**Jacket Heater:**\n\nA No. 908 Gurney Cottage Heater was installed to heat water during the summer.\n\n**Power Pump:**\n\nA complete set of new valves, seats and packing were put in the Gardner twin water pump. New linings and a...\nGAS ENGINES:\nRepairs and spare parts were supplied for the gasoline engine as well as what belting had worn out.\n\nGAS ENGINE EXHAUST:\nThe exhaust from gasoline engine was taken out of the laundry chimney, where it had blown out the centre division of chimney, and run to cement pit outside and vented to the roof. Thus exhaust is now silent.\n\nBAKERY:\nThe pressure tank, after being cleaned, was moved to the opposite side of tank room. The space thus provided was partitioned off and made a much needed baking room, well ventilated and outside of the laundry.\n\nLAUNDRY STOVE:\nBeing unable to buy a suitable new laundry stove, the old one was repaired, and the brick wall built back of it to protect the wall from fire.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS:\nA steam trap was provided for the laundry dryer. The heating in root house was repaired and put in good condition. Tools and material were left so that the resident mechanic could do emergency repairs.\n\nAIR COMPRESSOR:\nA new air compressor was installed and connected to the pressure tank. It was found impossible to maintain any safe degree of fire protection without it.\n\nFIRE LINE:\nThe fire line was overhauled, new washers put on valves, nozzles and hose provided where needed.\n\nDRAINAGE:\nThe rain water from the whole building is now taken away from the building entirely over the surface of the ground, open cement conductors being provided for the removal of water from the building.\nThe cement cistern in yard having cracked and become useless, was abandoned, as a cistern, but the pump suction pipe, was connected to new Sump pump, which allows of it being pumped out, and it acts to gather the surface water.\n\nA new Sump Pump was installed in lower back hall connected to Sump Pit, in boiler room pit; this, together with the Sump already provided at front of building and the old cistern, will allow the whole building foundations to be drained.\n\nAs the entrances are now properly heated and the foundation drained, no further heaving of walls should occur from this cause.\n\nWATER PIPE:\n\nThe cold and hot water pipes were repaired wherever found defective, new valves and taps installed where necessary.\n\nDRINKING FOUNTAINS:\n\nDrinking fountains were provided in boys and girls play rooms.\n\nLAVATORIES:\n\nA lavatory with two closets was reconstructed off the boys play room, and a one closet lavatory provided off the laundry for the girls.\n\nNew closets and flush tanks were put in throughout the building where needed and the others repaired wherever possible.\n\nCleanouts were put in drain in laundry and also at other points to make all drains as accessible as possible.\n\nKITCHEN SINK:\n\nA galvanized steel wash sink was installed in the kitchen, fitted with a grease trap. Considerable drain trouble had developed for the lack of this trap.\n\nKITCHEN RANGE:\n\nNew fire brick linings and new dampers were put in\nBARN SUPPLY:\n\nThe water supply to the barn was dug up and repaired where it leaves the main building, and a weeping drain was put in from this point to boiler room sump pit.\n\nSEPTIC TANK:\n\nThe Septic Tank was thoroughly cleaned out, more than six wagon loads of sludge and scum were removed and buried.\n\nA manhole of proper dimensions had to be constructed to do this.\n\nNo pipes or septic tank fittings of any kind were found in this tank.\n\nA clear way was open for scum to flow direct into the outlet which had given serious trouble in the past. This was remedied by installing the proper pipes and fittings. No syphon, however, was or could be installed.\n\nCEMENT WORK:\n\nA new cement floor was laid in boys playroom and lavatory adjoining.\n\nA new floor was laid in boiler room and a cement sump pit constructed.\n\nBoiler pit was widened and a railing put up.\n\nCracks in all concrete walls were filled with cement.\n\nNew manhole constructed in septic tank.\n\nThe gravel for the cement work had to be hauled a long distance due to high water.\n\nSTAIRS:\n\nWhere frost and dampness had heaved the stairs and floors in the three entrances, new cement floors were put down and stairways levelled and repaired.\n\nIn removing the old boiler room floor, a bad horizontal crack was unearthed in the wall. This was filled and supported with concrete. A weeping drain was laid from this wall to the new sump pit.\n\nSIDING AND STRAPPING:\nsolidly, then double papered, vertically and horizontally strapped and siding securely nailed on. Wherever siding or paper had been omitted paper and boarding was provided, cold spots were closed up wherever found. Under front veranda where the ends of joists were exposed, double paper and timber was nailed in and the siding and paper extended down over.\n\n**DOOR FRAMES:**\n\nAll door framed, except front door, were taken out and replaced with frames made of 3 x 12, loose space behind door frames were filled up and made solid and frost proof. Doors were hung with heavy garage door hinges, heavy latches and self closing springs.\n\n**WINDOWS:**\n\nThe worst of the windows were stripped and made as tight as possible; but these windows are still a source of much cold.\n\n**FUEL ROOM:**\n\nA new bulkhead and door were provided for the fuel room, a frame put in and a door made at the foot of outside stairs to boiler room. Lack of this had caused undue freezeups in the boiler room in the past.\n\n**EAVESTROUGHING:**\n\nA new eavestrough with five conductor pipes was put as far around the building as the scaffold was erected; but owing to unfavorable weather, which delayed all outside work, our men were unable to get this all completed before the freeze-up and the leaving of the last boat. We regret this very much, as had the weather been so that the carpenters could have even put up the balance of scaffold we would easily have finished. What was usable of the old eavestrough from the building was put up on the carpenter shop.\n\n**PAINTING:**\n\nNo painting was done, all men available being employed.\nCASINGS:\n\nSome casings and corner boards are still to be put on.\n\nAll of which I have the honour to respectfully submit.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Early the next morning the Principal of the school left on the boat for Winnipeg. He had received the plans for the house in the evening but Joe Keeper not being resident in the school had not seen these nor have I. It will therefore be necessary to await Principal Blackford's return to the school before any further action can be taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, June 14, 1928.\n\n- WITH CHEQUE -\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the construction of the Principal's residence at the Norway House Indian Residential School. In this connection I beg to say that the Department received a telegram from the Inspector of Indian Schools & Hospitals, United Church of Canada, in which he stated that the Principal was in Winnipeg and required authority to purchase sufficient material to commence building operations and to ship by early boat. He was authorized to buy the lumber and cement.\n\nYou should carry out the instructions in letter of May 5th, last, for the erection of the building by day labour, with Joe. Keeper as foreman for the work. You should keep proper time sheets of the labour employed, which should be prepared in duplicates, signed by the men employed and forwarded to the Department. An accountable cheque, No. 1311 for $500, is being sent you to pay labour and the necessary time sheets are being forwarded under separate cover. Should you require a further advance later, you should requisition for same in due time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nBrandon Industrial School,\nJuly 4th, 1928.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Building the Principal's Home at Norway House:\n\nBy authority of a wire message from Dr. D. G. Scott, I purchased sufficient material to begin the construction of this building. I had a competent carpenter go over the plans provided by Mr. Orr and make an estimate of all the material required. The balance which has not been purchased consists of shingles, siding, windows, doors, bricks and interior finishes etc.\n\nIf Mr. Gordon, your agent, approves of the scheme, I would request the Department to authorize him to purchase this material and have it shipped at the earliest possible convenience. The first materials were purchased from the firms indicated by Dr. Scott. These firms have a list of the balance required and their prices are satisfactory. It is understood that the entire cost of this building shall not exceed $5,000.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGRD\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 4)\nWith reference to the building of the residence for the Principal at Norway House Indian Residential school, I understand from Mr. Blackford that the material has been ordered, with the exception of the heating and lighting plants, and the interior plumbing fixtures.\n\nI would recommend that plans be made for each of these systems, and a copy forwarded here, also one to Mr. Inspector J.R. Bunn, and that Mr. Bunn purchase, at as early a date as possible, the necessary fixtures and material, and ship them. Some of the work on these plants should be done before the interior lumber is put on the walls.\n\nI presume that the heating plant will be hot air. Should this be the case, I would recommend a wood furnace, and we have found the Pease \"Economy\" No. 21 very satisfactory.\n\nThe electric plant with which the house will be connected is in the school, and is 110 volt. Four hundred feet of outside wire will be required, besides the interior wiring.\n\nFor the water system, besides the interior fittings, 200 ft. of 1\" galvanized water pipe will be required.\n\nIf Mr. Inspector Bunn is supplied with plans, he can easily secure lists of the material required for the plants, and we can get the work done here.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm. Gordon\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 8th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your 6A of the 10th ultimo with reference to heating plant, lighting and plumbing fixtures for the principal's residence at the Norway House Indian Residential School. The Department does not consider it necessary to arrange plans for the heating, lighting and plumbing as the foreman and the principal, in conjunction with yourself, should be able to determine just what is required. The Department agrees that warm air heating would be satisfactory. You, in conjunction with Mr. Blackford, should arrange to have the plumbing and lighting fixtures purchased and installed to the best advantage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F.

Blackford, Principal, Indian Residential School, Norway House, Man., c/o Northern Fish Company, Selkirk, 6 - 5 gallon pump tanks, complete with non-freeze charges.\n\nThis equipment should be supplied at your lowest price, and your account, in duplicate, should be forwarded to Mr. Blackford, whose post office address is Norway House, Man. On receipt of the extinguishers, he will certify the account and forward it to the Department for payment. The price charged should include transportation charges and Government sales tax, if any.\n\nI would draw your special attention to the fact that this equipment should reach Selkirk, Man., at the earliest possible date, as the navigation season on Lake Winnipeg closes about the 15th of this month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

When the extinguishers arrive, Mr. Blackford should certify the account and forward it to you, so that you can attach it to a proper voucher form and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYou should notify Mr. Blackford to distribute these extinguishers throughout the building at strategic points where they will be readily accessible in case of fire.\n\nThe Pyrene Mfg. Company is being instructed to ship these extinguishers c/o of the Northern Fish Company, Selkirk, Man. I am instructing this firm to have the extinguishers reach Selkirk at the earliest possible date, and it is expected that they will arrive before the navigation season closes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would respectfully request that these amounts be provided for in the Estimates to come before the next session of Parliament.\n\nYour favourable consideration to this will be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTF:AMA.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., Litt.D., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto,\nDec. 11,\n1928.\n\nDear Dr. Scott: Re: Norway House Indian Residential School,\n\nManitoba.\n\nPursuant to the conversation we had when I was in your office on Friday last, I now draw your attention to the need of an addition being constructed to the Norway House Boarding School.\n\nI hope to be out to Norway House sometime this summer and will look into what is really required and prepare a sketch of what we think will suit. I may say that the junior class room is held in a small frame building situated on the boarding school property. This building is simply a poor frame structure and not large enough for what we require and accommodation for a class room will be included in the plans that we submit for this addition.\n\nWe are not expecting any provision to be made for this in the estimates to be placed before the coming session of Parliament but if it meets with your approval I shall be pleased to submit a pencil sketch to your architect and he can figure out the probable cost. I may say that this request has been strongly endorsed by the Lake Winnipeg Presbytery at its meeting in May last and as the Principal has a waiting list of prospective pupils I am of the opinion that the time has come when some extra accommodation should be provided.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nTF:ANA.\nOttawa, December 14, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to an addition at the Norway House Indian Residential School. You might arrange to have a sketch of what is required prepared during the coming summer. This should be submitted to the Department for consideration. I have also your letter with reference to clearing land on Hope Island for this school. A note has been made for estimates in this connection.\n\nI wish also to acknowledge your letters concerning improvements required at the other Indian residential schools under the auspices of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church. Consideration is being given as our Estimates for the coming fiscal year are being prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nInspector,\nIndian Schools & Hospitals,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nBrandon, Man.\nNorway House, Man.\n\nJanuary, 9th, 1929.\n\nFile 14B.\n\nDear Mr. Bunn:\n\nWe have a \"Flu\" epidemic, very mild, but meaning plenty of work just the same, as almost every house has it, and there is a heavy call for medicines etc.\n\nYou will have my wireless for Aspirin etc., There are no deaths yet which could be called \"Flu\", but three, which were likely hastened a bit by it, being old T.B. cases.\n\nThey have had a bad time at the school, as there were about 80 pupils in bed, and several of the staff. Then the sewers were choked. You know how rags etc. will get in. Then the engine, which pumps the water and runs the generator and other machinery, quit. It has been running for about 5 years I think, on an average of 4 hours per day, so that the cylinder is badly worn and would not hold compression. They (the shibil) are putting the other in for the time being, however they have a lot of wood to cut, heavy poles and the work is too heavy for our engines.\n\nI think they should have a new engine. This would be an International 10 h.p. capacity, and gives about the necessary power.\n\nIf one was sent to Mile 137, Wabowden on the H.B.R'y, they (the school) would bring it in from there. Perhaps you may be able to arrange for a new one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) Wm. Gordon,\n\nJohn R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office, Winnipeg.\n\nIndian Affairs.

These have been in use for many years, and have been repaired time and again, until now they are hopeless. Some beds have had to be discarded, with the result that some of the smaller children are sleeping two in a bed, which I consider objectionable.\n\nThe beds are hospital or institution beds, 6 ft. 4 in. long, and 3 ft. wide over all. The springs of course are shorter and narrower than this.\n\nI would recommend that 10 complete new beds be supplied, with springs and mattresses. Also that springs be supplied for 100 beds, either diamond link spring, or non sagging link fabric spring.\n\nThe Principal is having all of the beds thoroughly cleaned and re enamelled, and with the new springs they should then be in good condition.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nWm.

You should, upon receipt of this sample spring, inform the above Company if it is of the right size and satisfactory in all respects. They will then furnish this Department with a quotation for the supplying of the springs, new beds and mattresses required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nOttawa, June 14, 1929.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThis Department requires, for the use of the Indian residential school at Norway House, Man., the following, and I shall be pleased if you will furnish a quotation:\n\n100 Rust proof twisted link fabric springs for institution beds 6'4\" long and 3' wide over all.\n\n10 Institution beds, similar to your No. 4000, 6' long by 2'6\" wide, equipped with rust proof twisted link fabric springs.\n\n10 Mattresses for same, to be composed entirely of white layer cotton felt, with 4\u00bd\" band, covered with S.M. grade blue and white stripe ticking, similar to your Yellow Label, all materials throughout to be guaranteed new.\n\nThe beds for which the springs are required were purchased in 1914 from Moodie & Son, Selkirk, Man., and I shall be pleased if you will forward a sample spring of the dimensions you consider to be satisfactory for the size of the beds mentioned above to Mr. Gordon, Esq., Indian Agent, Norway House, Man., in order that there will be no error in placing the order for these springs. We are informing Mr. Gordon accordingly, and requesting him to notify you if the size of the sample spring which you forward is satisfactory. You should then furnish the Department with your quotation for the supplying of the above equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 4)\nJuly 9th, 1929.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nAttention Mr. J. D. McLean,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn June 14th, your file No. 123-5-5, you wrote us regarding fabrics, institution beds and mattresses required for the Indian Residential School at Norway House. Upon receipt of your letter we immediately wrote Mr. Wm. Gordon, Indian Agent, Norway House, as you suggested. We felt, however, that as the fabrics were required for beds delivered about fifteen years ago it would be advisable to have a bed, complete with fabric, returned to us, in order that there might be no mistake in fitting same properly. We asked Mr. Gordon to send the sample bed, complete with fabric, to us, at our expense, and same has just been received. We find that the fabric used at the time these beds were made is known as our \"V.S.O. Diamond Link\", consequently, it would be more satisfactory to supply the same type of fabric instead of our regular Simmons' Twisted Link. The reason for this is that the punching in the spring frames is spaced differently for the different types of fabric. We therefore beg to quote you as follows:\n\n100 V.S.O. Fabrics, complete with helicals for attaching same to frame, $2.25 Each\n\n10 #4000 Institution Beds, complete with our regular rust-proof Twisted Link Fabrics, 7.50 Each\n\n10 Mattresses for same, similar to Yellow Label, 6.25 Each\n\nThe above prices are F.O.B. Norway House - Sales Tax Included.\n\nTrusting to be favored with your valued order which we can ship immediately from our Winnipeg factory, we remain.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSIMMONS LIMITED,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6268, file 581-5, part 4)\nOttawa, July 13, 1929.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the fabric springs and mattresses required for the institution beds at the Norway House Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that, in view of your report, it will be satisfactory to supply the same type of fabric as was previously in the beds. The Department will approve of your forwarding to Norway House the following:\n\n100 V.S.O. Fabrics, complete with helicals for attaching same to frame, @ $2.25 each.\n\n10 #4000 Institution Beds, complete with your regular rust-proof Twisted Link Fabrics 7.50 \"\n\n10 Mattresses for same, similar to Yellow Label, @ 8.25 \"\n\nThis equipment should be supplied at the prices quoted which, we note, are f. o. b. Norway House, Sales Tax included. After shipment has been made, please forward your account, in triplicate, to Mr. William Gordon, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man. He will certify and send same to the Department for payment. I have to request that you will notify Mr. Gordon when shipment is being made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMessrs. Simmons, Limited,\nGomes & Sutherland Sts.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nboxed frames, and as is usual are fitted loosely, and considerable cold comes in round the sash and also through the boxes. I understood the Yates people were to put the building in good shape, and do whatever was necessary. It would appear, however, that there is still much to be done. I do not know what can be done to make these windows tight and warm. The same difficulty has no doubt arisen in other buildings of the Department, and a solution has doubtless been found. I presume something might be done with metal weather strip.\n\nThe Principal also asks that eavestroughing be put on the new residence for the Principal. Here is another difficulty. A glance at the plan of the house will show that the rafters are ornamental, being slated at the end, which meant considerable work and expense. This slot would make the putting on of eavestroughing more difficult, having little to nail to, and besides the ornamental work, which cost considerable, would be entirely lost. The matter of eavestroughing should have been considered before this work was done.\n\nThe work on the school building should certainly be done this summer. On August 27th last year, in reply to a letter from the Commissioner, I gave the above information regarding the unfinished work at the school. I did not put this work in the Estimates, as I understood it was to be done last year.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nSome time ago I received a letter from the Principal of the Norway House Boarding School, in which he asks information regarding the painting of the School this summer, also the completion of the eavetroughing, left unfinished by the Yates firm two years ago. He also complains that the windows of the building have been in bad condition for years.\n\nThe paint for the building was supplied in 1927, but the arrangements for repairs to the building with the Yates people delayed the work of painting, as new siding was being put on. This work has not yet been done. It should be done without delay, as the new siding is getting very dry, and will absorb a great deal of oil. I have always recommended the employment of any experienced painter as foreman on this job, a man who would understand how to get about the building to the best advantage, and there is considerable trimming to do, which is very slow work for inexperienced hands.\n\nAs regards the eavetroughing, conductor pipe was not put up, except two at the front. The pipe is on hand. Six joints in the eavetroughing were not soldered. Two inside turn elbows in eavetroughing were not put in. These may be made here, as the material is on hand. The proper soldering of the troughing is the most difficult job, and it would be difficult to get a man here who could do it. It should have been done when the workmen were here, and while the scaffolding was up, and I do not understand why it was left undone. The Yates people also left four openings which they made through the floors of the second balcony and into the walls, without closing them. I think we can find sufficient flooring here to do this.\n\nThe windows of the building are of the weight type, with\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have your 6A. of the 16th instant, with reference to repairs and painting at the Norway House Indian Residential School. You are authorized to engage an experienced painter as foreman for this work. The older boys at the school should give whatever help they can. If a second man should be employed to have the work done quickly and properly, you may make the arrangements. I am forwarding, under separate cover, an accountable cheque for $200 with which to pay the labour.\n\nThe Department requests you to make an effort to secure a local man to complete the eaves troughing and conductor pipes. It is possible that someone has had experience along this line. I am satisfied that Joe Keeper could handle this, if he is available. This work should be attended to as soon as you can make the necessary arrangements. You should also see that the four openings in the floors of the second balcony and in the walls are closed. I note that you can find sufficient flooring at the school for this purpose. The fixing of the windows will be a fairly expensive job, and you might make a note of this for next year's estimates. I regret I cannot authorize eave troughing for the Principal's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm.

That this institution be enlarged to accommodate 130 pupils.\n2. That the boys' dormitories be located in the new part of the building and the girls' dormitories would then be in the front of the present building and separated altogether from the boys' floors.\n3. Accommodation should be provided for both children's and staff's dining rooms, kitchen and class rooms on the main floor.\n4.

Someone had mentioned to him that the school might be painted this summer, and he came to me after I had written to the Department and asked for the job, at regular painters wages which I understood were 20\u00a2 per square yd. for two coats, and 35\u00a2 per square yd. for three coats. I told him that I would let him know if the work was to be done. Immediately on receipt of your letter, I spoke to the Principal, and he stated that there would be no boys available for the work, as it was then into haying and harvest time. Under the circumstances, I considered that the work by the yard would be the most satisfactory, as the men would then be lodging and boarding themselves. I telegraphed to John Wallenius, who was in Port Arthur, and he came as quickly as he could, beginning the work August 16th. He brought a man with him to assist in the work.\n\nThe painters repaired several places in the walls where the siding was broken, and claim to have repaired the eavestroughing, but as we have had no rain, we cannot tell if it still leaks. The painting was a hard job, as the roof was very dry and soaked in a great deal of paint. The walls were new siding two years ago, but were in bad shape, having gone so long unpainted. Some of the siding was flat grain, and the grain had opened up, leaving it very rough. The job is reasonably well done, as well as could be expected under the circumstances. I considered it advisable to pay for the work on inside of balconies, and for extra windows by the hour, as some was one, some two, and some three coat work.\n\nI am glad this work has been done, the building is much improved in appearance and will certainly last longer.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

S. Williams,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nNorway House, Man., May 20, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Norway House Residential school is overcrowded and some provision should be made to remedy this. Additional accommodation or reduction of the number of pupils are the logical remedies. The smaller boys and girls are sleeping in dormitories altogether too small. Both the boys and the girls have to sleep together in single beds in these dormitories. This condition of affairs should not be tolerated. Might I also suggest at this time that more thought be applied to provide more recreation for the girls of the school. Is it not possible that swings, rings, may-pole apparatus etc. could be supplied for them.\n\nW. N. Turpel, M.D.\nMedical Superintendent.\nOttawa, June 12, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Medical Officer for the Norway House Indian Residential School has drawn attention to the overcrowded conditions in the dormitories. He states that at the present time the smaller boys and girls are sleeping in dormitories which are too small to provide sufficient air space. He also states that both in the boys' and girls' dormitories the pupils sleep together in single beds.\n\nThe Department considers that this condition of affairs should not exist and that children should not be required to sleep together in single beds. If there is not sufficient accommodation in the dormitories to provide a single bed for each pupil the only recourse would be to decrease the enrolment until such time as more accommodation can be provided. I may say that it is hoped next year to provide an addition to this school. I shall be pleased to have a report at your earliest convenience regarding the conditions mentioned by the Medical Officer as to the overcrowding in the dormitories.\n\nThe Medical Officer recommends that more recreation be provided for the girls and that certain playground equipment be supplied. You should request the Principal to see that proper facilities are provided and an opportunity given the pupils to obtain a necessary and adequate amount of recreation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This information stated that the goods in question had been ordered on the 8th November, 1929, by the Rev'd Father Baillargeon, the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Monora, (R.C.), so to get from the Rev'd Principal his authority to purchase was my next step. I then sent the invoices I had received to Mr. Indian Agent Edwards and asked him to call of the Rev'd Principal and view this authority.\n\nOn the 2nd June, I received a reply from Mr. Edwards to the effect that the School authorities would pay this account themselves, and I also received the enclosed note from the Reverend Principal, which explains itself, as to authority &c.\n\nThis will close this matter I presume.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJno.

These batteries have served for a period of about four years, and cannot be expected to last another season. I would respectfully recommend that a new set of batteries, 110 voltage--150 ampere hour, be supplied to this school this summer.\n\nI would also recommend that a new concrete floor be placed in the engine-room. The constant vibration of the engine for years has cracked and loosened the old floor so that the engine now vibrates too much, and is liable to injury. This floor should be laid down during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Amt.

By having this milled before shipment, a very considerable time will be saved, and consequently a considerable saving in wage costs. The sash are 1 1/2\" thick, so the rabbiting should be exact.\n\nI would also ask for two rolls of floor felting as being the most suitable material to be placed between the boards, to act as a pad and to insure the stoppage of air.\n\nInspector Bunn will be able to secure this material in Winnipeg, properly milled, and ship it on an early boat, when I will get Joe Keeper at work promptly, getting the work done as soon as possible. The fitting of the sash will occupy considerable time.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSee back sheet.\nOttawa, July 16, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nIt is necessary to have certain repairs carried out to the windows at the Norway House Indian Residential School. Mr. Agent Gordon has forwarded a list of the material that will be required. I shall be pleased if you will arrange for the purchase and for the shipping of it by an early boat to Norway House. The material required, as stated by Agent Gordon, is as follows:\n\n- 60 pcs. 8\" x 3\" x 12 ft. to size when fully dressed.\n- 60 \" 3\" x 3\" x 12 \"\n- 60 \" 4\" round x 12 \"\n\nThe first mentioned should be full 8\" wide when dressed, full 3\" thick, and should be rabbetted 3\" wide and 3/8\" deep for window stop, on one side, at a distance of 12\" from one edge. By having this milled before shipment, a very considerable time will be saved, and consequently a considerable saving in wage costs. The sash are 12\" thick, so the rabbeting should be exact.\n\nBesides the above, you should also arrange to forward 2 rolls of floor felting, 3 gallons paint - light buff colour, and one gallon white paint. The above materials should be purchased by you as cheaply as possible. Please obtain accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost of the goods and for the transportation to Norway House. You should certify these accounts, in the usual manner, and forward them to the Department for payment. I shall be pleased if you will arrange for the purchase and shipment of the above materials at an early date and notify Mr. Agent Gordon when shipment is made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

In this connection I have to say that the Department is requesting Mr. Inspector Bunn to arrange for the purchase and forwarding of the materials, as mentioned by you, to Norway House at an early date. When the materials are received, you should arrange to have the work performed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nSir:\n\nIt would appear that our water levels are not going to rise to any considerable extent this season. We have very low water.\n\nFor this reason I would ask authority to extend the crib on the water line some 40 feet farther. Last November we had to extend the pipe, as the water was too shallow where it ended, and the pipe would have frozen early in the winter. We also had to build a fire at the end of the crib, thaw the ground in the crib for some distance, and we then covered all with sawdust, then hay, and the whole line where it ran under the ice, with several feet of reeds. We were then favored with a heavy fall of snow, which covered all to a considerable depth. Flank cribbing will not withstand the heavy seas to which the crib is subjected.\n\nI would ask for an allowance of $150.00 in cash, to pay for getting logs, and for labor constructing crib and filling with sawdust and earth.

Proper time sheets, in duplicate, for the labour employed should be kept by you. On these returns full particulars should be filled in as called for under the various headings, and the time sheets should be signed by the individual labourers employed and certified by yourself. A supply of returns for the purpose is enclosed herewith. The Department is arranging with the Bank of Montreal to forward you $150 in cash to pay for the materials and for the labour in constructing the crib. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed. When the work is finished, you should forward to the Department the time sheets as requested above accounting for the expenditure of the advance sent you to pay for the labour, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mr. Beaton of the Home Mission Board, United Church of Canada, have recently visited the Round Lake and Norway House Indian Residential Schools. They are seriously concerned regarding the danger of fire in these frame buildings and have asked the Department to give favourable consideration to the installation of a fire gong in each school. The Department believes that this request is reasonable and I should be grateful if you would make the necessary arrangements. I consider one gong on a central floor, with buttons on the first and top floors, are sufficient for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to Department No. 123-5-5 of the 21st November last, concerning the suggestion to install a fire gong system at the Norway House Indian Residential School, I have to state that I have just received a letter from Mr. Wm. Gordon, Indian Agent, stating that the school has already a very satisfactory system which is just what is now proposed. It would appear that the members of the Home Mission Board who visited Norway House have been mis-informed.\n\nThe Agent does make a comment however on the use of the pole fire escapes on the ground that they are not altogether satisfactory for little children. I have written in reply however, stating that these are now generally installed in all our residential schools, and I visited one recently where the small children slid down the poles as confidently as the older children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

BEATON, B.A.,\nASSOCIATE SECRETARY, BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS, UNITED\nCHURCH OF CANADA, 299 QUEEN ST. WEST, TORONTO 2, Ont.\ndated January 31, 1931\n\nRe: NORWAY HOUSE:\n\nI notice that you are not planning to ask even\nfor a small grant for minor repairs in connection with\nthe Residential School there. My impression of that old\nbuilding, after going over it very carefully last year,\nis that there should be a small sum of a few hundred\ndollars available annually for repairs. It would, for\ninstance, be vastly improved by a serious attempt to\nrepaint the walls and furniture in the dining-room and\nby a relacquering of most of the beds in the dormitories.\nWhen I was there I discussed with Mr. Gordon the possib-\nility of improving the storm windows by stripping them,\nand we had Joe Keeper look over the building in order to\nget an estimated idea of how much it would cost. I do\nnot know whether the stripping has actually been done or\nnot. As I intimated to you in my conversation, I think\nthe fire alarm arrangements, with only one song in a\nbuilding of that size, are entirely inadequate, and that\nsteps should be taken immediately to install a system\nsimilar to the one provided in Mount Elgin.\nNorway House, \"an.\nMarch 23rd, 1931.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have a request from the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School for the following furnishings and supplies, and would recommend that these be supplied as far as possible:\n\n50 single bed mattresses, 3 ft. wide.\n\n1 typewriter carriage, for No. 12 Remington, Standard, 23\" carriage.\n\n1 copy \"Indian Residential Schools, Cash, Receipts & Expenditure Book\".\n\nPlayground equipment:\n\n1 Portable, straight, 16 ft. slide.\n\n1 Giant Stride, about eight handles.\n\n1 Circular Travelling Ring, about eight rings.\n\nThe mattresses now in use, many of them are in very bad shape, and beyond repair.\n\nA wide carriage for the typewriter would be a great convenience in the filling out of forms, such as Quarterly Returns, etc.\n\nThe Cash Book now in use is almost filled up. It is ruled for expenditures under different headings. I presume the Department has a standard form for all schools.\n\nA suggestion that playground equipment be supplied has already been approved. The catalogue which we had here was an American one. The above can no doubt be supplied from Canadian firms.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 5)\nOttawa, April 17, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, relative to the request of the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School to be supplied with 50 single mattresses, 3 feet wide. In this connection I have to request that you will inform the Department as to the length of the beds for which the mattresses are required. I may say that institution beds are usually furnished in 2\u00bd feet widths, and it is considered that mattresses in this width would be satisfactory. When we have information as to the sizes required and the number of each size, consideration will be given to placing the order for supplying same.\n\nRelative to the request for a wide carriage for the Remington typewriter on hand, I have to say that it is not the policy of the Department to furnish wide carriages for typewriters. It is found that in using these carriages for ordinary correspondence there is considerable strain on the machine.\n\nRegarding the playground equipment asked for, I have to say that the Department does not provide slides, giant strides and travelling rings.\n\nA book for cash receipts and expenditures has been forwarded to the Principal's address.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Eight of the beds are 30 inches wide, the remaining are old beds and are the full 36 inches. Of course, 30 inch mattresses would answer the purpose but could not be made to look as neat and tidy as a mattress the full width of the bed.\n\nWith regard to the wide carriage for the typewriter I quite agree that the wide carriage is a strain on the machine when there is a considerable amount of correspondence done. In the case of our schools, however, there are some forms that cannot be completed on a narrow carriage typewriter and which require considerable time to make out by hand when three or four copies are necessary. There is also, of course, the greater possibility of making mistakes.\n\nRegarding the playground equipment asked for I am sorry that this cannot be furnished as I am satisfied that the use of such would tend to better health among the children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 7, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to request that you will arrange for the purchase and forwarding, for the use of the Norway House Indian Residential School, of the following mattresses:\n\n42 Mattresses for Institution Beds, 6' x 3', 5\" x 2\".\n\nThese mattresses should be equal in all respects to the following specification:\n\nFilling: To be of white layer linter cotton felt, finished with stitched rolled edge, diamond tufted, and to weigh not less than 35 pounds, 4\u00bd\" box.

I would suggest that you communicate with Mr. J. R. Bunn, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Commercial Building, St. Boniface St., Winnipeg. You should give him full particulars regarding the toilet tanks, bowls and covers required also the quantities and colours of the burlap.

G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nSir:\n\nIn your letter No. 123-5-5 dated September 22nd, permission was granted for the purchase of a laundry stove for the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nI was unable to get quotations on the kind of stove required by the school, and was informed that it would take at least six weeks to have one brought in from the East. On October 8th, I received a letter from Agent Gordon stating that as it was impossible to obtain a stove locally, navigation would be closed before one could be brought in, and it would be well to leave the matter in abeyance until next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 3, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, regarding the purchase of a laundry stove for the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that you were unable to obtain quotations on the type of stove required and that before a stove could be obtained, navigation will be closed. The purchase and delivery of a stove may, therefore, remain in abeyance until next spring, at which time Mr. Agent Gordon or yourself should again refer the matter to the Department for consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nI have a request from the Norway House Residential School for the following lumber, for repairs as stated below:\n\n150 sq. ft. shiplap lumber, 4\" preferred. V-joint would be better for the purpose.\n\n150 lineal ft. Flooring, Maple or fir-7/8 inch X 4 inch. Better would be 100 lin.ft. maple,\n50 \" ft. fir.\n\nThe shiplap or V-joint is to cover a wall in the boys' playroom. This has been plastered, but it is impossible to keep plaster on it, as it is continually getting broken. If covered with lumber and painted, it will be more presentable, and will last.\n\nThe flooring is to close some openings in veranda floors made by workmen when the Yates contract was being done. These holes were never closed. Fir would do for these openings, as the veranda floors are fir. The maple is required for patching the floor in the class room. Each winter this floor has heaved in places, swelling and buckling. Last winter the senior teacher took out some boards. To get these out, they were cut to pieces. Now there are large cracks in the floor, which are unsightly as well as unsanitary.\n\nI would recommend that the lumber be supplied by the Department, the work to be done by the School.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 25, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, requesting that the Department provide a supply of shiplap lumber to cover a wall in the boys' playroom and a quantity of flooring to repair verandah floors and floor in classroom, at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nWhile certain funds are available for repairs, etc., at this school, it will be necessary, before authority can be granted for the purchase referred to above, that you furnish an estimate of the cost, delivered at Norway House. Before any expenditure can be incurred, it is required that the Department apply to the Representative of the Treasury for the necessary Encumbrance Requisition, on which all costs must be definitely stated. In this connection I would refer you to circular letter of the 16th ultimo, re \"New Financial Procedure and Encumbrance System\". Please state, also, if you can arrange for the purchase of the shiplap and flooring at Norway House or the nearest available source of supply.\n\nIn future, when forwarding any requests for material, supplies or equipment, it is necessary, before same can receive consideration, that an approximate estimate of the cost be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nSir:-\n\nWith further reference to Department letter No. 123-5-5 dated November 3rd, 1932, I would like to be advised if it will be in order to proceed with the purchase of the stove mentioned therein, for the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, May 1, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 207-11A U. of the 26th ultimo, relative to the purchase of a laundry stove for the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our Appropriation for the current fiscal year has been considerably reduced, I regret that the Department will be unable to authorize the expenditure required in supplying the stove.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 123-5-5, dated April 25th, received at this office on June 2nd, regarding a small quantity of material for repairs at the Norway House Indian Residential School, would say that it is impossible to secure this material locally and inconvenient to secure prices, but would estimate as follows, to be purchased in Selkirk or Winnipeg:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 200 ft. V-joint       |          |            | $7.00 |\n| 50 lin.ft. Fir Flooring, 13/16 in thick, 2\u00bd\" face | @ 2\u00a2 per lin. ft. | $1.00 |\n| 100 lin.ft. Maple Flooring, 13/16\" thick, 2\u00bd\" face | @ 3\u00bc\u00a2 per lin. ft. | $3.25 |\n| Freight on above      |          |            | $3.00 |\n\nAmounting to $14.25\n\nI would suggest an allowance of $15.00 to cover as I am uncertain of the exactitude of the prices.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 4, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to request that you will arrange for the purchase and forwarding, for use at the Norway House Indian Residential School, of the following lumber and flooring material, viz.:\n\n200 ft. V-joint\n50 lin. ft. Fir Flooring, 13/16 in. thick, 2\u00bd\" face,\n100 lin. ft. Maple Flooring, 13/16\" thick, 2\u00bc\" face.\n\nYou should make the purchase from a firm on the list to receive consideration and have same shipped to the school. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost, and also receipts for any freight charges prepaid. I enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $15.00 for the above purpose. When forwarding vouchers for payment, you should state on each copy that the expenditure was authorized by E. R. No. 724.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th ultimo, I have to inform you that Mr. Inspector Hamilton, Winnipeg, is being requested to arrange for the purchase and forwarding of the quantity of fir and maple flooring and V-joint as mentioned in your letter. He has been requested to arrange for shipment to the school and to pay the freight charges. He will forward accounts direct to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent inspection of the Norway House Agency, I visited the United Church Residential School, and while there, the Principal pointed out the necessity of a laundry stove. This matter was taken up last year, but nothing was done until too late in the season to have the stove shipped.\n\nThe present stove should not be used, as it is unsafe. The stove is badly burned out, and hot ashes and fire can escape from various places along the side and front. I would certainly recommend that a new stove be supplied.\n\nThe present stove was purchased from Gurney Foundry Company Limited, Toronto, and the Number is 48.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Affairs,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 22, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the necessity for a laundry stove for use at the Norway House Indian Residential School, to replace the present one, which is unsafe and beyond repair.\n\nWhile our funds are extremely limited, it is thought that a stove, of a type that would be suitable for the laundry, could be obtained at a moderate cost. I would request, therefore, that you arrange for the purchase of a stove considered suitable from a firm in Winnipeg on the approved list and have it forwarded to Norway House. Please obtain an account in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment. You might arrange with the firm from whom purchase is made to prepay the freight charges; obtain a receipt for the amount and include same in their account. This receipt should be attached to the voucher which you forward for payment.\n\nI should be pleased if you would arrange to have the stove forwarded before navigation closes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nAugust 24th, 1933.\n\nDear Mr. McGill:\n\nI have the honor to report that I visited the Norway House Boarding School on August 9th, 1933.\n\nThe children were absent on holidays. A few of the staff were present, and were busily engaged in cleaning and kalsomining the dormitories.\n\nIt is difficult to know the exact work being done at such an Institution unless one could visit it when the children are in residence. The Principal's wife is matron and also supervises the sewing room. I understand two Indian girls assist her in connection with the sewing room work. This department in any school I consider one of the most important and should be supervised by a qualified seamstress. Each and every Indian girl, on leaving our boarding schools, should be able to do all sewing necessary for a family, be able to cook properly, and also do well, all laundry work. I am sure the Department grant, if properly used, is sufficient to provide a competent and efficient staff.\n\nThe kitchen walls are in bad condition and before long will no doubt need replastering.\n\nThe laundry is in the basement, and all equipment appeared in good condition. The question of a laundry stove is urgent and a special letter in regards to it was addressed to the Department immediately on my return.\n\nThe furnace room\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\nThe furnace room floor needs repairing. The expense in this connection would only entail eight or ten bags of cement. This room was in a very untidy condition and as I pointed out to the Principal, was the most likely source for a fire. Chips and dirt littered the floor, and wood was piled only a few feet from the jacket heater. The room was a duplicate of the one at the MacKay School, and unless more care is exercised, we will be fortunate to escape another fire. I instructed the Principal to have the place swept and to keep the floor clean and free of all rubbish. I do not think any wood should be piled in the furnace room, but should be kept in the wood room provided for that purpose. I advised the Principal to this effect, but he felt it would be too unhandy for the one in charge. I do not think we can emphasize too strongly the need for care in the prevention of fire and I am writing Mr. Gordon asking him to report if my instructions have been carried out.\n\nI found two of the fire hose in poor condition. They were split in several places and new hose should be provided. Fire extinguishers are kept at various points throughout the building. The dormitories all open on the balconies where pole fire escapes are provided. No trouble should be experienced by the children in getting out especially if fire drill is observed. I am also asking Mr. Gordon to attend certain fire drills and report on what takes place.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe outbuildings are in fair repair, and meet quite well all requirements.\n\nThe garden this year is excellent and a splendid supply of vegetables will be obtained.\n\nCows are kept and at present 10 are being milked. The supply of milk meets fairly well with what is required by the school.\n\nPigs are raised, and at present 17 are being made ready for winter use. This meat, along with fish and beef, gives a varied diet for the children.\n\nThe batteries for the lighting plant are in poor condition, sediment has collected in many of the jars, which sediment is from the positive plates. These batteries charge up quickly, but just as quickly lose their charge as the positive plates are practically gone. It may be possible to manage this winter, but on the other hand, new batteries may be necessary at any time. At least, a new set should be provided in estimates for next year.\n\nAt some future date I hope to visit this school at a time when the children are in residence, and will then submit a more detailed report.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector,\nManitoba Inspectorate.\nOttawa, August 30, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your report of the 24th instant on your inspection of the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nYou were authorized, by official letter of the 22nd instant, to arrange for the purchase and forwarding of a laundry stove.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of ten bags of cement to repair the furnace room floor. This material should be obtained from a firm on the approved list and forwarded to the school. It is to be understood that the work will be carried out by the staff, without expense to the Department.\n\nIt is noted that you found two of the fire hose in poor condition. No doubt, you are aware of the length and size of the hose. I would request that you arrange for the purchase of two lengths of hose and the nozzles and couplings that may be required.\n\nAll the above named materials should be forwarded before navigation closes. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost, with receipts for freight charges. You should certify and forward the accounts for payment.\n\nYour remarks regarding the condition of the furnace room have been noted, and the Department is pleased that you have instructed the Principal to have the room kept free from all rubbish. It is noted, further, that you have written Mr. Agent Gordon in this connection. The Principal should see that every precaution is taken to overcome fire hazard. The Department notes that fire extinguishers are kept at various points throughout the building. It is hoped that these are in serviceable condition. It is noted that you have given instructions to the Agent to see that fire drill is carried out.\n\nThe need for new batteries for the lighting plant has been noted. The Department will have no funds to provide this equipment this year and it is hoped that the present batteries will stand up during the coming winter. This requirement will be kept in mind when next year's Estimates are being prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. G.

These will be shipped as soon as navigation opens.\n\nOur file shows that the last set of batteries was supplied in September, 1930. Do you consider that the engineer at the school is qualified to handle the lighting system in such a manner as will avoid replacing the batteries at too frequent intervals?\n\nYou might let me know the number of sewing machines at present in use in the school and their condition.\n\nPlease advise the Department if the paint required is for interior or exterior painting.

Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter 123-5-5, of April 30th last, re a new set of storage batteries for the Norway House Residential School, would say:\n\nThe last set of batteries were supplied in Sept. 1930, and have done duty for almost four years, as the summer months of June, July and August call for very little light.\n\nOur batteries in this district, for at least eight months of the year, require a daily charge, and about alternate days for the other four months. This means approximately 300 charges per year. The batteries now in use have thus received approximately 1140 charges. Is not that rather more than batteries are guaranteed to stand?\n\nThe present engineer at the school is a good man, and I consider quite competent to care for the batteries properly, and he is also conscientious and painstaking.\n\nI am writing another letter with regard to the sewing machines and paint.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm.

I submit as a result the following minimum requirements if the new Principal is to have any kind of a chance:\n\n1.

Labor repairing furnace fire boxes, and putting asbestos above furnace\u2014$75.00.\n\n7. Kalsomine, $50.00\n\n8. Paint for interior decorating. $100.00\n\n9. 10 desks for junior class room. No. 4, double.\n\nThe School budget will assume responsibility for the labor in repairing engine, save troughs, painting, decorating, and general repairs, though this cannot be done by the present staff, and additional help must be secured. The budget will also be made to cover additional horses, kitchen equipment, living room furniture, and a host of other needs.\n\nThere are a good many other things which might be listed, as you know, but they can wait for another year. I would suggest that as the buying of these things must be done immediately, that Dr. McGill give us a grant of $1000.00, and let Mr. Chapin, in consultation with you, get the purchasing and work under way next week.\n\nThanking you for your cooperation, which I deeply appreciate,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely\n\nSigned\n\nK.J. Beaton\n\nI handed a copy of this note to Dr. McGill, and he stated that he would write the Department.\n\nMay I say that the school building and equipment has been allowed to run down a great deal during the past few years. Too much economy has been practised for the good of the institution. Repairs which should have been made, and with little cost, could have been made, have been neglected. I should like to see the place put in as good condition as possible. I am of the opinion that the new Principal will take good care.\nof the buildings and equipment under his charge.\n\nWith regard to the residence, I think it is a shame that a new house, and a good house, should have been allowed to get into the condition that this one has. With the wife of the Principal as matron of the school, and with a number of children, and with the Indian girls allowed more or less the run of the house, it certainly is in need of redecorating. Added to this, the chimney from the furnace smokes, and the fireplace cannot be used. It appears that the chimney will have to be torn down to the floor of the house, and rebuilt, as the outlet from the fireplace is too direct, and the bend in the furnace flue is too short, being a very abrupt double bend. It will mean that the fireplace must take up more room on the floor, and the mantle must be higher, to allow for a more moderate bend in the flue. The estimate for this work is $200.00 for material and labor.\n\nThe jacket heater at present in use is not large enough to provide the necessary hot water for the laundry. The boiler is 8 ft. by 30 inches in diameter. The heater is \"Cottage Boiler,\" Gurney Foundry Co., coil, 21\" wide, 42\" high, 40\" long. Something about twice the capacity would be satisfactory.\n\nThe Dryer for the laundry, also the Mangle,- I do not know just what is desired, but the Department will be fully informed as to what is being installed in the newer schools, and what should be satisfactory for a school of this size, with the capacity of our power and lighting plant.\n\nI am enclosing a list of the engine parts required. Also sewetroughing, conductor pipe, elbows, with some bakum, and also fire cement for setting fire brick in furnaces.\n\nI enclose also a list of paint, and Alabastine required for redecorating the walls of the building, (interior). This is badly needed.\n\nI have been putting in the Estimates each year for emergency repairs for this institution. A sum of $1000. If this amount were allowed us, we could cover most of the items as outlined. Or if purchases were made by the Department, we could probably get started to build in the fire brick and repair the chimney. It will be noted that the suggestion is that the school budget will take care of the labor, with the probable exception of the rebuilding of the residence chimney.\n\nI am anxious to see the new Principal get a chance to make good on the school work. He is a capable, hard working, conscientious man, who will surround himself with a good staff, and with proper equipment, should make the institution more of a success than it has been for some years. He was Asst. Principal in this school, under Mr. Daws, some years ago, so has experience to fall back on, also he has been in Indian Missionary work where he has had to do all kinds of work, for some thirteen years.\n\nI hope the Department may be able to make a suitable grant for this work.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm.

Mr. Gordon, Mr. Beaton and I went over this school together, and the building is certainly in a wretched condition, showing unmistakable evidence of gross abuse.\n\nMr. Beaton's letter is self-explanatory and I am forwarding it to you for such action in the matter that you may consider necessary and possible.

The old story of lack of money is again in the front, and, after carefully considering the Agent's letter, a radiogram is being sent to him this morning, authorizing an expenditure of $350.00 for purchase of materials for painting, rebuilding chimney and repairs to engine.\n\nThe equipment requested will have to remain in abeyance for the moment, owing to lack of funds, but, when you come to Ottawa, we will again discuss it and see if anything further can be done. It at all possible, I would appreciate your being in Ottawa on Wednesday instead of Thursday. It is just possible that I will have to leave Ottawa on Wednesday night.\n\nThe question of employing a night watchman at this school for the winter months will also be discussed when you come, and, at the moment, I do not see any reason why this cannot be allowed.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nPERSONAL.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJuly 28th, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan;-\n\nRE: NORWAY HOUSE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI have just returned from spending a month among our missionaries and teachers in Northern Manitoba, and there are a good many things that I want to talk over with you some time before the end of next week.\n\nI want this morning, however, to call your attention to the necessity of immediate action in regard to letters already received by the Department from Dr. McCall and Mr. Gordon, concerning the serious condition of the Norway House school building. We were fortunate in having Dr. McCall there during his recent tour and he very kindly gave us half a day to look over the building and discuss the minimum requirements in the way of additional machinery and repairs. It would be quite easy to provide a list of repairs and equipment running into five or six thousand dollars. I am enclosing a copy of the letter which I wrote to Mr. Gordon at Dr. McCall's request, after we had gone over the building with Mr. Chapin, the new principal. You will find this elaborated in a little more detail in Mr. Gordon's letter to the Department, which I have not seen, but which I am confident carries a true picture of the situation.\n\nI write to impress upon the Department the great necessity of urgency. I was in Winnipeg on Monday and Tuesday, and made several attempts to get in touch with Mr. A. G. Hamilton, the Inspector. There was no one in the office, so I presume the stenographer must be on holidays and Mr. Hamilton out on a tour of inspection. As the children will be coming back August 15th, I took the responsibility for going to Ashdown's and ordering the alabastine. This was shipped on the boat last Monday, and will arrive at Norway House today. Even at that, since the staff have agreed to do the work it will be a very difficult matter to get the dormitories, class-rooms, dining-room, &c., finished before school opens. I asked the manager at Ashdown's to send the bill to Mr. Chapin, who will be in Winnipeg for another week, and he will establish contact with Mr. Hamilton before he leaves.\n\nI am taking it for granted that, as in previous years, the purchase of the laundry machinery will probably be done directly from the Department and that all the other matters will be attended to through Mr. Hamilton's office.\n\nI wish to emphasize the great importance of having\nMr. Philip Phelan.\n\nJuly 28/34.\n\nA competent man sent up to re-build the fire boxes in the furnaces of the school, and re-build the chimney in the principal's residence. The risk from fire which has been run in that wooden building during the last two years is incalculable. I complained about the necessity of re-building these furnace fire boxes when I came back from Norway House three years ago, in a lengthy conversation which I had with Mr. Russell Ferrier. At the same time we discussed the necessity of the Department giving a grant for a night-watchman for all of these industrial schools using frame buildings. I was greatly surprised to find on returning to Norway House this time that the grant for night-watchman there had never gone through. I think you will find Dr. McGill sufficiently impressed, when he returns to the office, with the urgency of this matter that there will be no difficulty in securing the comparatively small sum, say $500.00 a year, which will be necessary to hire a competent man.\n\nIf you and Dr. Stone are both going to be in Ottawa next Thursday, I should like to go down and discuss with you a number of problems. In the meantime, I am anxious that the materials and equipment asked for in connection with Norway House shall be purchased at the earliest possible date. The season up there is very short and fires are necessary by the first of September. One cannot count on boat transportation from Winnipeg after September 15th.\n\nThanking you for your personal attention to this important matter, which I greatly appreciate,\n\nI am,\n\nYours cordially,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB: GWF.\nMr. Wm.

Mr. Chapin is returning on August 6th and is very anxious that the Department have a suitable man ready at that time who can do the necessary repair work to the furnace and also rebuild the chimney in connection with the principal's residence.\n\nThe Department, of course, are aware that the navigation period to Norway House is very short and in view of this I would recommend that I receive authority by wire to employ a man to do the above mentioned work.\n\nMr. Chapin has already purchased a quantity of kalsomine and forwarded same in order that the cleaning of the school might be accomplished during the summer holidays.

(RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have recently had a letter from the Rev. Mr. Chapin, Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, emphasising the need of the 10 desks asked for when submitting his list of requirements to Mr. Gordon, Indian Agent, on July 13th, 1934. Mr. Chapin states it is absolutely necessary to have the desks if the half day system is to be carried out. The desks will cost approximately $120.00 F.O.B. Winnipeg, which price covers the cost of #4 double steel desks. A cheaper grade, of course, can be secured, but the difference is very slight.\n\nIf these desks are allowed, I would ask that authority be granted by wire as the navigation season is drawing to a close and there is little time left to make the necessary arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nA. G.

F. MacKenzie\n\nOttawa, August 27, 1934.\nOttawa, August 28, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, relative to the request which you received from the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, to be supplied with 10 school desks, and giving an estimate of the cost. In reply I have to confirm the following radio-telegraph message to you of yesterday's date:\n\n\"May purchase ten desks for Norway House School from firm on approved list. Have firm prepay freight. Forward certified accounts and freight receipt.\"\n\nYou should arrange for the purchase of 10 desks of the size and type required, from a school supply house or firm on the approved list, and arrange to have the desks forwarded to Norway House before navigation closes. It is considered more satisfactory to have the firm from whom the desks are purchased prepay the freight charges. A receipt for the freight charges should be obtained and forwarded with the account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the desks and including the freighting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

(RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNovember 21, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. BUSKARD,-\n\nI have your memorandum of the 19th instant, with attached correspondence between the Canada Seating Company, Winnipeg, and Mr. Inspector Hamilton's office, regarding an order which was placed by the latter for the supplying of ten double school desks, required for use at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nAt the end of August, last, Inspector Hamilton stated that the above number of desks were urgently required and requested that authority for the purchase be granted him by wire, as the navigation season was drawing to a close and he wished to forward the desks by the last boat from Selkirk. He was authorized, by wire, to arrange the purchase, from a firm on the approved list. He obtained quotations as follows:-\n\nCurrie School Equipment, Limited, Winnipeg - $10.40 each\nCanada Seating Company, Winnipeg - 10.65 \"\n\nThese prices were f.o.b. Winnipeg. Both firms quoted on a similar type of desk. Mr. Hamilton placed the order with the Currie School Equipment, Limited, 604 McIntyre Block, Winnipeg - this firm having quoted the lowest price.\n\nAs requested, I return herewith the papers which accompanied your memorandum.\n\nEncl.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nNorway House Residential School, Man.:\n\nRemodel and refurnish kitchen, with the exception of the stoves.\n\nRecover dining room tables and provide new benches.\n\nInstall a steam-pressure plant for hot water and laundry purposes.\n\nNew roof for school verandah; present roof leaking badly in all directions.\n\nFill all cracks on outside with oakum or putty, and paint the whole exterior, including roof.\n\nRefurnish staff bedrooms with proper beds; at present using same type of cots provided for children.\n\nPurchase 50 new mattresses for children's beds.\n\nThese are imperative needs. The Department should also look forward to enlarging and improving the present outside classroom at Norway House, so as to provide teaching accommodation for both teachers and leave the present classroom in the main building as an auditorium.\n\nIn this connection, I would also suggest that serious consideration be given to uniting the teaching of the children from the Reserve with those in residence, bringing the whole programme of education on the Reserve under the direction of the Principal of the school.\nNorway House, Man:\n19th December 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that yesterday I inspected the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nOn the day of my visit there were 22 pupils present in the Primary Room, and 12 present in the Senior Room. I was informed that these numbers were much below the usual attendance, owing to the pupils practicing in preparation for the annual Christmas Tree Concert.\n\nThe registers in both class rooms were not entered up to date. The importance of marking these registers each day was impressed upon both teachers, and they promised to see that this was done in the future.\n\nDuring the past two months, considerable painting, kalsomining and repair work has been done in the kitchen, pupils' dining room, dormitories &c; and a great improvement has been made.\n\nI would respectfully draw the attention of the Department to the dining tables in the pupils' dining room. These are not only very poorly constructed affairs, but I consider them highly unsanitary. The tops of these tables are nothing but old boards, covered with table oilcloth which also is in very worn condition, and certainly cannot be kept in a clean and sanitary condition. I would strongly recommend that new tables be supplied to replace those now in use; also new seating benches, as the benches now in use are also in very bad shape. I would suggest that dining tables and benches built according to the same specifications as those supplied -\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nsupplied to the new Indian Residential School at Birtle when it was furnished in 1931, would be most suitable. No doubt the Department's Architect, Mr R.G. Orr, will have the construction details of these on hand. I would urge that the Department give favorable consideration to this matter, in order that arrangements might be made to have the necessary materials shipped to Norway House as soon as navigation opens.\n\nThe pit in front of the furnaces had about eighteen inches of water in it this morning, but the cause of this, a broken water pipe below the ground, has already been located and repaired.\n\nThe meals served at the time of my visit were of good wholesome food, and of good variety.\n\nI found the discipline both in the school main building, and in the class rooms to be good.\n\nThe boys' playroom is in very poor shape, but I do not see that anything can be done with it at the present time, to improve it very much. It would require cement work and plastering. This room is, for some reason, very difficult to keep warm.\n\nThe toilets in the boys' basement were not as clean and tidy as they might have been. I would suggest that if one of the women members of the staff were to be put in charge of the boys, there might possibly be some improvement effected in this direction, as a woman would be more careful to insist on cleanliness in such matters.\n\nI consider that the school has a very efficient staff.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 17, 1935.\n\nSir\n\nI have your letter of the 19th ultimo, reporting on your inspection of the Norway House Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted that the school has an efficient staff, that good discipline is maintained, and that the meals served the pupils consist of a good variety of wholesome food.\n\nYou should impress upon the Principal and the teachers the importance of keeping the daily registers in the classrooms entered up to date and also the matter of keeping the toilets in the boys' basement in a cleanly and tidy condition. The Principal should insist that the staff and pupils keep the toilets in a sanitary condition.\n\nRegarding the need of new tables and benches for the pupils' dining room, I would request that you state the number of tables and benches that would be required. You should also give the size - length and width - of the tables. This would depend on the space available for the length. When we have full information, prices will be obtained for the manufacture of the tables in Winnipeg. They would be of the same type as those supplied for use of the Birtle Indian Residential School. They could be shipped from Winnipeg, knocked down, and assembled when they reach the school.\n\nIt is expected that the Department will have certain funds for repairs and equipment for this school during the coming fiscal year. The authorities of the\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nUnited Church of Canada, under whose auspices the school is conducted, have requested that the following repairs and equipment be provided:\n\n(1) Remodel kitchen.\n\n(2) New roof for school verandah.\n\n(3) Fill all cracks on outside of school building with oakum or putty and paint whole exterior.\n\n(4) Refurnish staff bedrooms with proper beds.\n\n(5) Supply 50 new mattresses for children's beds.\n\nIn connection with these requests, you should inform the Department, early in April, next, which of the above items you would recommend be carried out. You should give full particulars regarding the repairs required and, if possible, an estimate of the cost.\n\nRegarding the equipment for the staff bedrooms and the new mattresses for children's beds, please give length and width required and the number of each size.\n\nYou state in your letter that the boys' playroom requires certain repairs. Please give full particulars, with an estimate of the cost.\n\nWhen we have full information, consideration will be given as to the amount of repairs and equipment that can be supplied\u2014which will depend on the funds available in our appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\nNorway House, Man.\n25th January 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 123-5-5 of the 17th instant having reference to the Norway House, Indian Residential School.\n\nI have impressed upon the Principal and both the class-room teachers the importance of marking the registers daily, and keeping them up to date at all times. I may say that I have made another inspection of this school recently, in connection with which a separate report is being submitted, and I found both registers in good order and marked up to date.\n\nWith reference to the toilets in the boys' basement, I beg to say that a connection has been made with the boilers, which are close by, and now, by the use of a hose with a nozzle attached, these toilets are cleansed frequently with steam from the boilers, which appears to be quite effective.\n\nRegarding the new tables and benches for the pupils' dining room, I beg to say that this matter has been carefully considered by the Principal and myself and after experimenting with the floor lay-out, it is found that the following sized tables would be most suitable:\n\n1 - Table 3'-0\" X 6'-0\"\n3 - \" 3'-0\" X 10'-0\"\n1 - \" 3'-0\" X 11'-0\"\n3 - \" 2'-9\" X 10'-0\"\n\nIn connection with benches for the dining room, I would recommend that these be made in two lengths\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\nfor the 10 and 11 foot tables, rather than have them made in single units the full length of the tables. If this is approved, the following benches would be needed:\n\n2 - Benches 6'-0\" long\n24 - \" 5'-0\" \"\n4 - \" 5'-6\" \"\n\nIt is noted from your letter that the above tables would be manufactured in Winnipeg and shipped to Norway House knocked down, to be assembled on arrival here.\n\nWith reference to the repairs and equipment requested by the authorities of the United Church for this school, as enumerated under five headings in your letter, I beg to say that these matters are being looked into, and the Department will be advised thereon early in April next as instructed, and full information forwarded.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\nNorway House, Man:\n25th January 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that on the 22nd instant,\nI inspected the Norway House Indian Residential School,\nin the afternoon.\n\nAt the time of my visit, there were 26 pupils present in the junior class-room, comprising grades 1 and 2. The reading aloud, especially of the grade 2 pupils, was very good, and it was quite noticeable that these pupils were beginning to get a little expression into their reading, and getting away from the characteristic monotone, in which Indian pupils usually do their reading. The pupils' writing was also very creditable.\n\nIn the senior class-room there were 10 pupils present, of grades 5 and 6, and a few of grade 4. The reading and book work of these pupils were also good.\n\nOn the occasion of my previous inspection in December last, both class-room teachers and the Principal were impressed with the importance of keeping the registers marked daily, and on this visit, I found both class-room registers marked up to date and in good order.\n\nI made a second visit to the junior class-room the following morning, the 23rd instant, to see the beginners at their work, and was impressed with the interest shown by both teacher and pupils in their work. Lessons in reading, writing, spelling, as well as singing were gone through while I was there, and both teacher and pupils acquitted themselves well.\n\nIn the pupils' dining room, the tables had\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\nhad been recovered with new table oilcloth since my last visit, which improved them somewhat, but even in the short time these new coverings had been on, they were showing holes through the corners. The matter of new tables and benches, however, for the dining room, is about to be settled, according to Departmental letter No; 123-5-5 of the 17th January, to which I have replied, giving the definite requirements, to-day. Good wholesome meals are always served. The bread is baked of half white flour and half Graham flour, which makes a very nourishing food.\n\nWith reference to the boys' playroom in the basement; as stated in my last report, this is in poor condition, and, having reference to the above mentioned Departmental letter of the 17th instant, and the paragraph therein making special mention of this room, I beg to say that I do not consider that any expense should be incurred in repairs, until some arrangement can be devised for heating the room. At present, the radiators for the heating of this room are of the hanging type, and are close to the ceiling, with the result that the room, especially in very cold weather, is too cold for the boys to be in. The Principal and I considered the possibility of having the radiators put down on the floor, but the difficulty then, would be to get drainage from them back to the boilers, which are practically at the same level. There is, however access to the sewer in one corner of the floor in this room, if that could be used for the drainage of the radiators. The radiators themselves were quite warm, but the room itself was almost as cold as outdoors; a portion of pipe on one wall, about five feet from the floor being thickly covered with frost. The toilets in this basement were much cleaner than on my last inspection. The Principal had arranged to have a pipe connection with the boiler made, leading into this place, and with a hose and nozzle, these toilets are now cleaned with steam and hot water from the boilers.\n\nIn all the dormitories, as well as in many other places in the building, I found that there was much water on the floors, due to the air valves on the radiators leaking. There are 95 radiators in the building, with 77 of these valves, and I believe that not more than one third of these valves are working properly. They are, I think, of an old-fashioned type. I would recommend that 70 new valves of a reliable and efficient type, be provided for the radiators.\nradiators, to eliminate the constant flooding of the floors.\n\nThe bed clothing in the dormitories was all clean, and in good condition. A number of the beds are in bad shape, but recommendations in this connection will be made to the Department early in April next, as instructed in the aforementioned Departmental letter.\n\nThe activities of the school staff in cleaning up and improving the interior of the building has been continued since my last report, and further improvement is noticeable, even in the attic, where the bulk of the supplies such as clothing &c; is kept.\n\nAll the members of the staff show keen interest in their various duties, and perform them efficiently.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lezenby.\nIndian Agent.\nFeb. 13, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the new tables and benches required for the Norway House School, I beg to advise that Inspector Hamilton has been instructed to obtain prices for this equipment in Winnipeg, and you will be further advised when an order has been placed.\n\nWith regard to the paragraph of your letter of the 25th in which you refer to the boys' play room in the basement, I beg to say that it would not be practicable to place the radiators on the ground and discharge the condensation into the drain. The only way to properly drain the heating radiators which are installed below the water line of the boiler would be by providing a condensation pump and receiving tank on the return line; the pump requires to be operated by electric power and such an arrangement would hardly be satisfactory at Norway House.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. G.

Something will have to be done anyway.\n\nThe health of the children however, is the most important factor and we find that the laundry work in its present state, is the hardest thing in the institution on the health of the girls. The better equipment would relieve this strain, enable the work to be done properly without drudgery, and more than yield its returns in the safeguarding of the health of the girls in this department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned:- R.T.Chapin\nNorway House, Man:\n26th February 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that today I inspected the Norway House Indian Residential School, and found everything about the institution to be clean and orderly, with the exception of the boys' playroom, which, as I have mentioned in previous reports, is in poor shape.\n\nThere were 24 pupils present in the Junior Classroom, and 12 in the Senior Classroom, at the time of my visit, and the registers in both rooms were marked up to date.\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter 123-5-5 of the 13th instant; the second paragraph; in connection with the radiators in the boys' playroom, I beg to say that I find that there is a radiator in the toilet just off this playroom, and on the same floor level, a radiator which is fastened to the wall, about two feet above the floor. This radiator is equipped with a special type of valve attached to the pipe at the bottom of the radiator, through which the water, but not the steam, drains directly into the sewage system below the floor. There are two radiators thus equipped, on the same floor level, and if the radiators which now hang from the ceiling in the playroom, could be brought down to the same level as these, and equipped with the same type of valve, the playroom would be much more efficiently heated I think. I could not make out the name of the valve mentioned, & the time, but I will try and have one of them disconnected and examined, and will further advise you. The Principal informed me that now the weather is not so cold, he intends doing considerable work in the way of repairing, and painting in this playroom in the month of March.\n\nOn going into the sewing room, I found a large\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\nlarge pile of boys' overalls there to be repaired, most of which work has to be done by hand, as the school has no sewing machine of the type necessary for this heavy sewing. There are five sewing machines; two of which are in good condition, one in fair condition but requires frequent adjusting, and two of no use. I would strongly recommend that if possible, this school be furnished with a sewing machine of the type used for heavy sewing, such as the repairing of overalls, as there is much of this kind of sewing to do.\n\nThe meals served to the pupils are of good wholesome food, and in good variety.\n\nThe Principal and all the members of the school staff show keen interest in their work, and are constantly endeavouring to make improvements wherever possible.\n\nSince my last inspection of this school, the Principal has taken up with me the matter of some new equipment for the laundry, namely: a steam pressure plant, with steam drier and mangle. I asked him to embody this request in a letter, and attached hereto you will find a copy of the letter. I understand that the Rev; Mr Beaton of the Home Mission Board of the United Church, has already taken this matter up with the Department at Ottawa, and would recommend that the matter receive the Department's favourable consideration, as this equipment is certainly needed.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nMarch 13, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the request for laundry machinery for the Norway House School, I would ask you to furnish me with a rough sketch showing the laundry room with the location of the existing laundry machinery.\n\nI would also like to have your report as to the condition of the existing machinery, and where the high pressure boiler would be located providing one is authorized.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nNorway House; Man:\n19th March 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No; 123-5-5 of the 13th instant, with reference to the proposed high pressure boiler for the Norway House Residential School laundry.\n\nI have been carefully over this matter with the Rev; R.T.Chapin, the Principal of the school, and I am submitting herewith two rough sketches in connection therewith.\n\nSheet No; 1 shows the lay-out of the laundry, and the positions of the various machines &c;\n\nWith regard to a location for the proposed high pressure boiler; we find it impossible to set this in the boiler room - presuming the boiler would be of the same, or similar type to the one at the Birtle Residential School - and there are several objections to having it located in the laundry itself; chief of which are the additional heat it would cause, and the carrying in of the wood fuel; the ashes &c;\n\nSheet No; 2 shows the only location for the boiler that is available, and which I think would prove very satisfactory. The red circle shows the proposed location of the boiler, with the smoke pipes from it leading into the main chimney. This room, with the exception of that small part of it used for the batteries, is not used for anything in particular, and the batteries could be moved into the engine room and the temporary partition taken down -\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of India Affairs\nOttawa Ont;,\ndown. The small outside shed shown, is not in use, and this could be taken down, and the doorway leading into it could be made into an opening through which fuel for the boiler could be taken in from outside the building. The distance from the door of this room to the corner of the corridor, is 22' 6\", and from the corner to the door of the laundry is 10' 0\".\n\nThe steam pipes from the pressure boiler to the laundry could be carried along the ceiling of the corridor, where there are one or two other pipes being carried to radiators in the laundry.\n\nWith regard to the existing machinery in the laundry; the washer and the extractor and the set of tubs are all in good condition. The dryer, marked \"Steam Coils\" on the sketch, is however, in very poor shape, and is not a great deal of use.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby.\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nApril 8, 1935.\n\nMemorandum: Schools Branch.\n\nWith reference to the request for laundry equipment at the Norway House Indian Residential School, I would recommend that they be furnished with a belt driven 36\"x 48\" Drytex Tumbler, as manufactured by the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. Ltd., the present obsolete steam coil dryer to be removed from the laundry and the Drytex Tumbler to be installed in its place.\n\nI would also recommend that they be furnished with a 10 H.P. high pressure steam boiler to provide steam pressure required to properly operate their washer and tumbler. It will probably be necessary to have a steam fitter sent from Winnipeg to make the installation. The high pressure steam boiler is manufactured in Winnipeg by the Vulcan Iron Works Limited.\n\nArchitect.\nCADWELL AUTOMATIC\n\nA thoroughly trustworthy automatic air valve.

Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nApril 5th,\n1935.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Residential School,\nNorway House\n\nYou will remember that the last time I was in Ottawa I had with me a list of furnishings required in the Norway House Indian Residential School and, at your request, I took it away to secure more definite information as to the size of the beds. I am now in receipt of a communication from the Principal, Rev. R. T. Chapin, from which I have compiled a list which I think is fully explanatory.\n\nI understand from Mr. Chapin that the information concerning the valves for the radiators has gone forward from Mr. Lazenby, the Indian Agent, and that what I am enclosing may be entirely unnecessary. I am sending it merely because I promised to do so when we discussed the matter.\n\nThe letters we are receiving from the North seem to indicate an early break-up and I should think that navigation on Lake Winnipeg would likely begin some time about the third week in May.\n\nI also have from Mr. Chapin a copy of the drawings which he has forwarded to the Department concerning the alterations in the kitchen, pantry and children's dining-room. The tables for the dining-room have already been ordered, according to the information you gave me previously, through Mr. A. G. Hamilton, the Inspector in Winnipeg, and are being built according to these specifications.\n\nI hope you will be able to tell from these drawings what the kitchen and dining-room will look like after the alterations are completed. I understand from Mr. Orr that the plan of the Norway House School was not drawn in his Department. Sometimes I wonder if it were drawn by anybody who knew the first principles of residential school construction. Personally, I cannot conceive of a more awkward layout than the one which has been in use and which it is now proposed to change. It will not be a very large item of expense to make the alterations in the kitchen, pantry, &c., as the work can be done by the school staff and all that will be needed is hardware and materials. I cannot see how even a beginning can be made on the re-arrangement of the kitchen until after the children are dismissed for summer holidays in June. I hope to see you in the meantime, as I have\npromised Captain Scott, of Coqualeetza, to go to Ottawa with him on the 27th or 28th April.\n\nWith very kind regards,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEJB.MLT\nEngl.\nApril 9, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nIt is proposed to furnish the following laundry equipment for use at the Norway House Indian Residential School, Norway House, Man., (reserve No. 17 - Federal District of Nelson, viz.:)\n\n1 belt-driven 36\" x 48\" Drytex Tumbler, as manufactured by the Canadian Laundry Machinery Company, Ltd., to replace the present obsolete steam coil dryer.\n\n1 - 10 h.p. high pressure steam boiler, to provide steam pressure required to properly operate the laundry equipment.\n\nThe best source of supply for the above equipment is Winnipeg.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 581-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter No; 123-5-5 dated the 17th January 1935, paragraphs 4 to 7 inclusive, I beg to say that with the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, I have gone carefully into the needs of this school with regard to repairs and equipment as asked for by the authorities of the United Church, and recommend the following:\n\nHaving reference to the above mentioned Departmental letter, paragraph 4, No 1. Remodel Kitchen:- I am attaching hereto, several rough sketches prepared by the school Principal, showing what is proposed in connection with remodelling the kitchen.\n\nSketch No; 1 shows the lay-out of the kitchen and the pupils' dining room as it will appear after the remodelling is completed, and the new tables and benches (which I am now advised are ready for shipment from Winnipeg), are in place.\n\nSketch No; 2 shows the front and end elevations of a cupboard to be placed in the corner of the pupils' dining room. The measurements and other details are given.\n\nSketch No; 3 shows the front ad end elevations, and the top, of three tables, to be made to the same design, but all of different measurements. Tables 1 and 2 have sliding doors on both sides, while table 3 has the sliding doors on one side only, being built against the wall. The positions of these tables in the kitchen is shown on sketch No; 1.\n\nSketch No; 4 shows two cupboards designed for the pantry, one cupboard having closed doors on top, and the other having open shelves.\n\nSketch No; 5 shows the details of a cupboard for the kitchen, to replace a small shabby affair that is there at present. Its position in the kitchen is shown on sketch No; 1.\n\nThe details given on the above mentioned sketches will give, I think, the information required, excepting as to cost of materials and labour, of which I have not been able to arrive at an estimate that is likely to be reliable, lacking the necessary information. I would recommend that the remodelling of the kitchen on the lines given above, be approved by the Department.\n\nWith reference to the proposed painting of the exterior\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont;,\nexterior of the school building, it was decided that in view of the probable carrying out of the proposed installation of a high pressure boiler &c; for the laundry, that this work could be left in abeyance until next year.\n\nRe; Refurnishing Staff Bedrooms; the following are needed:\n\n3 - Only.

Pupils' Beds 2' 6\" Wide, 6' long. Complete with springs, and fitted with sliding shoes instead of Castors\n\n30 - Only. Mattresses for pupils' beds 3' wide, 6' long\n10 - Only.

(I.S.Measurement)\n\n10 - Gallons White Enamel. To enamel 95 pupils beds.\n\nRe; Re-roofing Verandah: Attached hereto is a rough sketch, showing the shape of this roof, with measurements. The roof is now covered with sheet galvanized iron, which is rusted through in numerous places, having been on since the school was first built. It is thought that it might be well to replace this sheet iron with a covering of felt, tar, and gravel. In any case, I would recommend that this work be done, as it is an urgent need; but would rather leave the decision as to the type of roof to the Department's architect.\n\nIn my inspection report regarding this school, under date of the 25th January last, paragraph 8, I made mention of the unsatisfactory valves on the heating radiators about the building, and the constant flooding of the floors. To eliminate this, I would recommend the purchase of the following valves:\n\n70 - Only. Radiator Valves, \"Dole Syphon Automatic\" No; 1. Page 1618. Ashdown's Catalogue.\n\nI also beg to report that recently when\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 581-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nwhen I was at the school, the men were busy cleaning out one of the boilers, and had the two hand holes open. There are two of these in each boiler; one at each end, and the metal of the boilers surrounding these holes has rusted away, until two of the holes are now larger than the plugs which should close them. Owing to the unevenness of the boiler plate around these holes it is very difficult to get the plugs tight enough to keep the steam in. The boilers of course never have much steam pressure on them. I do not know how these defects can be remedied unless it might be done by having a piece of the boiler plate surrounding the holes cut out with an acetylene torch, and another piece of plate welded in. In any case, it seems to me that some sort of remedial measures will need to be taken very soon, otherwise it will be impossible to use the boilers at all.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nF.G.

Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\nOttawa, May 10, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the repairs required in remodelling the kitchen, building and installing cupboards and re-roofing the verandah, at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will state how you would recommend this work be carried out. Can you obtain the lumber and materials required, as well as competent labour, at reasonable cost at Norway House? If it is not possible to obtain the materials at Norway House, full details should be given of what is required, in order that the purchase can be made in Winnipeg, or elsewhere. It is hoped, however, that the material for these repairs can be obtained locally and also that the school staff can do the greater part of the labour. When we have the information as requested above, regarding these repairs, you will be further advised. If you can give any estimate of the cost of materials and labour, the Department will be pleased to receive same. I may add that it is considered a covering of felt, tar, and gravel would be satisfactory in replacing the galvanized iron sheeting at present on the roof.\n\nThe remodelling of the kitchen, on the lines mentioned by you, appears satisfactory. However, the work that can be authorized will depend entirely upon the cost involved in carrying out the work as shown on the sketches which you enclose.\n\nIn view of the other expenditures that are being incurred\n\nP.

Mr. Inspector Hamilton has been requested to arrange with the Vulcan Iron Works to send a steam fitter to Norway House, to install the high pressure boiler and make the necessary connections to the existing laundry machinery and the Drytex tumbler.\n\nI may add, further, that the fire extinguishers and refills will be ordered here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, May 10, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Agent Lazenby has forwarded the enclosed requisition for equipment required for the stationary engines and also for pipes, fittings, tools, paints, cement, etc., for use at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nAs the best source of supply for these materials is in Winnipeg, I have to request that you will arrange for the purchase, from firms on the approved list, and for the forwarding of the items mentioned to the school. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, from the merchants from whom you make the purchase. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nIf there is not sufficient information on the requisition, you should communicate with Mr. Agent Lazenby for further particulars. This purchase should receive your early attention, in order that the materials and supplies can go forward to the school as early as possible after navigation opens.\n\nThe Department wishes to thank you for any trouble you take in the purchase and forwarding of these supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We have since ascertained that this company operates from Winnipeg, and we are therefore asking you to make delivery to them at Winnipeg. While we have inserted in the order the prices you quoted for delivery at Selkirk, you will, no doubt, allow for the difference in the freight charges between Winnipeg and Selkirk.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.C.

Chapin, Principal of the Indian Residential School, at that point.

Limited,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Office of the Purchasing Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nMany thanks for your order #1343 to be shipped to Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nThere is just one item on this that we are not quite clear on - 95 sets of Sliding Shoes on which we advised in our letter of May 18th that we could not locate this style (AA No. 6) and were quoting on the steel sliding shoes, sample of which we sent you.\n\nAre we to understand that what you require is our #55 socket and #3364 sliding shoe at .35\u00a2 per set?\n\nWe note your instructions to deliver this to the Selkirk Navigation Company, Winnipeg, and this is being done; the freight cost we figured on the prices of this order amounted to $41.25 and we presume you wish this to be deducted from the face of our invoice, and pay the freight cost to the Selkirk Navigation Co.\n\nPlease advise by return mail and oblige.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSIMMONS LIMITED,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSales Manager,\nATLANTIC DIVISION\n\nIndian Affairs.

The description of the sliding shoes in the order was inadvertent. The intention was to order 95 sets #55 socket and No. 3384 sliding shoe. Will you please therefore correct the order.\n\nIn regard to delivery to The Selkirk Navigation Company Limited, Winnipeg, it is noted that the freight to Selkirk from Winnipeg would have amounted to $41.25. Please therefore show this credit on your invoices when submitting them. No payment, however, should be made to The Selkirk Navigation Company as the Department has already written them advising them that you will deliver the consignment to them, and that we will in due course adjust their charges with them direct.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.C.

Hamilton, with the request that he submit them to some firm in Winnipeg for estimate.\n\nI am now advised by Mr Hamilton that the McDonald-Dure Co; of Winnipeg have quoted a price of $369.00, which includes all the necessary materials, made up ready for assembling, for the tables, cabinets, tilting bins &c; as per the plans and specifications.\n\nIn addition to the $369.00, there will be the transportation from Winnipeg to Norway House, which would be, according to McDonald-Dure Co;, 1200 pounds @ 60\u00a2 per pound, $72.00, making a total cost F.O.B. Norway House, of $376.20, though the weight of 1200 lbs is an estimate only, and might possibly be slightly more, depending upon the condition of the lumber. The labour of assembling and installing can of course be done by the school staff, and I would recommend that the purchase be approved, and that the sum of $380.00 be appropriated to cover.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

For your information, I enclose copy of a letter which is today being directed to Mr. Hamilton, authorizing him to have these materials forwarded. It is understood that the labour of assembling and installing and the other work required in remodelling the kitchen will be carried out by the school staff, without expense to the Department.\n\nThe Department has received the enclosed accounts from the Imperial Oil, Limited, Selkirk, Man., covering credits on empty barrels. It is considered that these credit notices should have been forwarded to the Principal of the School. I would request that you hand them to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. G.

G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following short report on the United Church Indian Residential School at Norway House, inspected August 5th, 1935.\n\nThe children were all on holiday, consequently I will confine my remarks largely to the buildings.\n\nSince my last visit a year ago, the Principal, the Rev. R. T. Chapin, has effected many changes. The building has been thoroughly cleaned and a large amount of rubbish removed.\n\nSchool will open August 15th and by that time practically the entire interior of the school will have been painted or kalsomined.\n\nMr. Chapin is most grateful for the assistance rendered by the Department. The new tables were badly needed - in fact, indispensable. The tables and benches have been well put together and are now being painted.\n\nThe new boiler and drytex tumbler are installed, but not yet in use as certain necessary changes to the drive shaft have yet to be made. Mr. Stevens, the engineer, will carry out the work.\n\nThe new cupboards and tables, authorized for the kitchen, have not yet arrived, but will perhaps be on the next boat. These improvements, when installed, will be a great help to the kitchen matron.\n\nThe new beds and mattresses for the staff were needed and will be greatly appreciated. The mattresses supplied.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nsupplied for the boys arrived in good condition.\n\nMr. Chapin has secured cement and expects, before winter, to have a new floor laid in the boys' playroom. This room is in the basement of the school and the present floor is in a disgraceful condition. The walls and ceiling will also be cleaned and painted.\n\nThe toilets throughout the building were all in good working order. Those in the boys' basement, which were filthy on the occasion of my last visit, were clean, and the offensive odor almost entirely eliminated.\n\nThe outbuildings are in good repair.\n\nThe milk cows number 12 head. They are not a good type and I doubt if any are heavy producers. A few good shorthorn cattle would be a worthwhile investment. They would no doubt produce more milk than the inferior type of cattle carried and the steers would greatly reduce the meat bill.\n\nA start is being made, both in keeping poultry and pigs, but as the grain necessary for feed must all be shipped in by boat, I doubt if the undertaking will be profitable and this line of work for any graduates who remain in the north is of little, if any, value.\n\nThe school garden is good, although some of the potato crop is suffering from too much moisture.\n\nThe yards about the school are tidy and show a big improvement over last year. The fences and gates are all in good repair.\n\nThe school building is badly in need of exterior painting. However, the balconies should be levelled before this work is undertaken. If there is no money obtainable now for these improvements, I trust it will be provided.\nbe provided for in the 1936 Estimates.\n\nMr. Chapin took over a big task when he became Principal of this school. He has certainly not spared himself and I am confident that, as a result of his efforts, the school will be placed on a much higher level. He is deeply grateful to the Department for assistance granted and states that he has been greatly encouraged because of the kindly co-operation.\n\nThe school will open within a few days and it is expected almost 100 children will be enrolled. I will try to arrange my next trip north at a period when the school pupils are in residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G.

Ltd., Winnipeg, together with a detailed invoice, which I trust will now meet the requirements of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nAfter Mr. Montgomery's visit to Norway House, I received a letter from P.G. Lazenby, the Indian Agent, pointing out that the electric wiring in the Norway House Indian Residential School was reported by Mr. Montgomery, the electrician, to be in very poor condition and that the building should be re-wired.\n\nI have since discussed this matter with Mr. Montgomery and he points out that there is always a grave danger from fire in old exposed electric wiring. The wire often becomes exposed at the joints and other places where it passes through partitions. Mr. Montgomery stated that this was not work which their Company (Mumford Medland Ltd.) would care to undertake, but suggested that it might be advisable next year to secure the services of a competent electrician and have new wiring installed and the same enclosed in conduit pipe. I have been unable to get any estimate in connection with the work, but Mr. Montgomery is of the opinion that it would cost in the neighbourhood of three or four hundred dollars.\n\nOn account of the isolated position of the school, I think every precaution should be taken and I would recommend, if it is not too late, that provision be made in next year's Estimates for this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 22, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 207-11A.U., of the 14th instant, with reference to a communication you received from Mr. Agent Lazenby, regarding the condition of the electric wiring in the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is giving the matter consideration in the preparation of the Estimates for the coming fiscal year. The amount required to renew the wiring - $400.00 - has been included, for the Minister's consideration. However, I am unable to state definitely whether the item will be left in our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G.

Hamilton, Winnipeg Man.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that I inspected the Norway House United Church Indian Residential School, with the exception of the class rooms, on the 4th instant, and the class rooms to-day.\n\nOn the 4th instant, the Principal reported to me that the gasoline engine, which has been in use for driving all the machinery; electric light generator, water pump, laundry machinery &c; had broken while running. I went to the school, and found that the crank shaft of this engine had broken in two, while it was running, and had caused considerable other breakage, besides the shaft itself. As they had another engine of similar type and horse power which was in use outside the building for work such as filling the silo etc., it was decided to install this one. The school engineer happened to be away on two days leave of absence at the time the above accident happened, and it was necessary to loan them the engineer from the agency staff to put things right.\n\nI found the dormitories clean and well aired; the beds and bed clothing also clean and in good condition.\n\nThe laundry was in good working order in every way. The newly installed high pressure boiler, and Drytex Tumbler are working perfectly.\n\nThe sewing room was in good shape. The recently installed heavy type sewing machine is very much appreciated and has eliminated a great deal of heavy sewing by hand on the overalls etc.; The Principal took the heads of two of the other sewing machines with him to Winnipeg this summer and had them put in first class condition also.\n\nThe kitchen has been recently equipped with a series of new cupboards and tilting bins, which has vastly improved this department of the school. Food stuffs and the kitchen equipment is now properly and efficiently cared for.\n\nThe pupils' dining room has also been greatly improved with the installation this summer of new tables and benches. The meals served to the pupils consist of good wholesome food, of good variety.\n\nThe heating radiators have been equipped\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\nwith new valves, and this has eliminated the former nuisance of water leaking over the floors.\n\nA considerable amount of painting has been done about the interior of the building, which has also greatly improved the appearance and cleanliness of the place.\n\nSeveral changes were made in the staff personnel after the summer vacation, and the new members appear to be getting into the work very well. The staff as a whole are efficient, keenly interested in the work, and are all working together in harmonious fashion.\n\nWhen I visited the senior class room on the 12th instant, there were 29 pupils present. Grades 2, 3, and 7 are taught in the mornings, and grades 4, 5, 6, and 8 in the afternoons. The register was marked up to date. The reading of the pupils was but fair. They do not speak English; which, however, is a very common fault among Indian pupils. The book work was also fair as a whole. The writing was good, but figure work was poor and somewhat untidy, though the work was good as far as correctness was concerned. I discussed this room and its teacher, with the Principal afterwards, and suggested that the teacher might work up a little more enthusiasm in his work, and so endeavour to infuse a little enthusiasm into the pupils. Both teacher and pupils appeared to be rather inclined to be 'easy-going'.\n\nI visited the Junior class room and the Rossville Day School this afternoon. Since the close of summer vacation, the Rossville Day School and the Junior classes of the Residential School are being taught as one, in the Rossville school building. At the time of my visit, there were 32 pupils present, 13 of these being pupils of the Rossville Day School, and 19 being pupils from the residential school. There are 44 pupils on the residential school on the roll, and 17 day school pupils, two separate rolls being kept. There had been 41 pupils of the residential school in class today, out of an enrollment of 44. The registers were both marked up to date. The teacher of this room is Miss Edythe Smith-Windsor, new to the work since the holidays. The teacher is efficient, and the work of the pupils is creditable. Both teacher and pupils show considerable interest in their work.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

It is separated from the mainland by perhaps 600 yards of water. The buildings on it belong to the Department of the Interior. They housed the members of the Forestry staff before the Natural Resources were taken over by the Province of Manitoba. With the exception of one residence, the buildings are now unoccupied and falling into decay. Among them is a bunk-house, 20 by 48 feet, originally used by members of the Air Force.\n\nOur people have written, asking whether or not the Department of the Interior would be willing to transfer this building to the Department of Indian Affairs. The members of the church and the boys in the residential school would assume responsibility for taking it down, transporting it across to Rossville, and putting it up somewhere on the school site, to be used as a community centre. There is no auditorium in connection with the School at Norway House and no adequate gymnasium or play-room. The latter is a very great lack in a country which has such long winters as Norway House. All expenses in connection with the moving and reconstruction of the building would be borne by the Indian people and the missionaries.\n\nIf it is impossible to transfer this building from one Department to another in this way, will you please enquire from the Department of the Interior whether or not they would be willing to sell it to The United Church of Canada for a nominal sum. I think our local church at Norway House would probably be willing to pay a small sum of $50 or $50 for the building and move it on to the church site. That would provide the community centre, but it would put the senior pupils of the Residential School at a decided disadvantage in getting the use of the building.\n\nI would very greatly appreciate your good offices in finding out at the earliest possible date what can be done about this matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKJB.MT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 6)\nOttawa, March 11, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose copy of a communication from Reverend Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A., Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, Toronto, addressed to Mr. Sutherland, of this Department, requesting the transfer of a bunk-house, located on Forestry Island, Norway House, Man., to be used as an auditorium in connection with the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nThis school is the property of the Department and is conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada. The enclosed letter will furnish particulars regarding the request of the Board for the transfer of the building. Should this bunk-house be of no further service for the purpose for which it was used, this Department would be pleased if your Department would approve of the transfer of the building, to be rebuilt on the school site, where it could be used as a community centre and as an auditorium, in connection with the Indian Residential School.\n\nI should be pleased to have your reply, at an early date, stating what your Department is prepared to do regarding the request of the Reverend Kenneth J. Beaton.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq., B.

You should also give particulars regarding the furnishings for the staff rooms, to the amount mentioned.\n\nIt should be understood that the amounts mentioned represent the total available for this school during the current fiscal year. As it will be necessary to purchase the paint and other materials required in Winnipeg, you will see that full particulars should be given concerning the requirements.

He would engage and pay a helper that would be mutually satisfactory to your representative and ours.\n\nRegarding fire alarm system, we quote you on a new system comprising 6\" diameter 110 V. D.C. gong one on each of first, second and third floors, with \"break the glass\" signal on first, second and third floors, also boiler room. Wiring for this system would be in iron conduit so that wires could be removed and replaced if necessary at some future time.\n\nCost of signal system Ninety Four Dollars, ($94.00)\n\nTrusting the above proposals will enable you to proceed, and awaiting further opportunities to be of service, we are,\n\nGratefully yours\n\nKUMMEN-SHIPMAN ELECTRIC LTD\n\nPer (Sgd) F.T.

Hamilton at Winnipeg, with the request that he would procure quotations, from Winnipeg firms, as to what the various costs would be. I have now received particulars from Mr Hamilton, as follows:\n\nRe: Painting the exterior of the Residential School, The Taylor Painting & Decorating Co. Ltd of 331 Donald Street, Winnipeg, quote a price of $755.00 for the labour only. The paint would cost approximately $175.00, making a total, for the exterior, for materials and labour, of $930.00. The paint etc. for the interior would cost approximately $56.00.\n\nRe: re-wiring the building, Mr Hamilton secured two quotations; one from Schumacher-MacKenzie Ltd, quoting on two separate types of wiring, namely, in BX armoured cable $825.00; and open wiring and cleats, $530.00. I am enclosing a copy of their letter to Mr Hamilton in which they detail the two separate jobs. The other firm who quoted, was Kummen-Shipman Electric Limited, of Winnipeg, and they also quote on the same two types of wiring as follows:- BX armoured cable $543.00, plus an additional $94.00 for the installation of the fire alarm system, making a total of $637.00. Using the same number of outlets for open wiring on ceilings and wood moulding on walls, the cost would be $467.00, plus additional $94.00 for the fire alarm system, being a total of $577.00. I am enclosing a copy of their letter to Mr Hamilton also for your information.\n\nFollowing are approximate costs for other items requisitioned for, for this school, in my letter to the Department of the 17th April:-\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Plumbing supplies etc.        | $132.00|\n| Eavestroughing, Tools, etc.   | $175.00|\n| Repairs for engines           | $80.00 |\n| Dressers & Writing Tables     | $55.00 |\n| Chairs                        | $54.00 |\n| Lumber, Firebrick, Cement &   | $66.00 |\n| Ten Test                      | $21.00 |\n\nWith reference to repairing the school verandah - roof -\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 6)\nroof, Mr Hamilton advises that the Winnipeg Paint & Glass Co. recommend the use of Liquid Gum instead of tar, which would cost 75\u00a2 per gallon. This comes in 40 gallon barrels; and one gallon is sufficient to cover from 80 to 100 square feet. To use this gum, with 2 or 3 ply roofing, to re-roof the school verandah, would cost approximately $40.00.\n\nNo quotation was obtained on the cost of the casting required for the washing machine, as Messrs Stanley Brock Ltd had to write to the factory for this.\n\nThe foregoing quotations, apparently, do not include the following items shown on the list forwarded to the Department with my letter of the 17th April:\n\n- 2 - Hollow Iron Posts for the class room.\n- 3 - Quarts Pyrene Liquid\n- 4 - Acid & Soda refills, 2\u00bd gal.\n- No; 14 copper wire, lamp cord, toggle switches, rosettes, cleats, screws &c;\n- 1 - Case Glass 12 X 10\n- 1 - \" \" 12 X 14\n- 1 - C \" \" 12 X 20\n- and the 'Corbin' Door Checks.\n\nI may say that the four section wall radiator, shown on the 4th page of the requisition, was deleted, and does not figure in any of the foregoing quotations.\n\nIt will be seen therefore, that the foregoing quotations considerably exceed the amounts appropriated for the various works as per your letter of the 4th May, with the exception of the furnishings for the staff rooms, which can be procured for $21.00 less than the amount appropriated. The school Principal, Rev. R.T. Chapin states that the drag harrows can be eliminated, as they are not of very great importance for this year now.\n\nIt is difficult to say what, if anything, can be deleted from the requisition in order to reduce it, as everything asked for is of considerable importance. However, the order of importance might be shown as follows;\n\n- Engine Repairs & Plumbing Repairs & Tools.\n- Re-wiring the building (To reduce fire hazard)\n- Painting exteriors of buildings\n- Paint for interior of building\n- Lumber, Firebrick, Cement & Ten Test\n- Furnishings for staff rooms.\n\nI shall be glad if, after reviewing the foregoing, the Department will advise me what work may be undertaken.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

Hamilton of Winnipeg, on authority of Departmental letter No; 123-5-5, dated 4th August 1936.\n\nIn connection with this account, I beg to say that on first receiving the invoice, the price charged for the Alligator Belt Lacing, namely $5.00 per box, appeared excessive, and I therefore brought the matter to the company's attention, and received the credit memo attached to the invoice.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nNorway House, Man:\n28th October 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that on the 23rd October, I inspected the Norway House Indian Residential School, including the senior class room, but not the junior class room, which is conducted in conjunction with the Rossville Indian Day School.\n\nSince my last inspection of this school, before the summer vacation, the outside of the building has been given one coat of paint, which has considerably improved the appearance of the place. The building, being frame construction, and not having been painted for a considerable number of years, was so dried out, that one coat of paint scarcely made any impression in some places. It should have at least two more coats of paint to properly preserve it and protect it from the weather. The old system of electric wiring has been removed, and a new system, in flexible conduit installed, including a fire alarm signal system. This has considerably reduced the fire hazard. Several items of new furniture have also been provided for the various staff rooms, such as chairs, dressers &c.\n\nThe dormitories were clean and tidy, and well aired, with ample room for their occupants.\n\nThe sewing room was orderly, and clean, with a number of the girl pupils present, taking instruction in sewing.\n\nThe bathrooms and toilets were all clean, and in good working condition.\n\nThe kitchen was clean, tidy, and in good order, with a number of the senior girls at work under the direct supervision of the dietician. The food served to the pupils is good, wholesome, and of good variety.\n\nIn the basement, I found that the high pressure boiler, which was newly installed a year ago, was being dismantled. On making inquiry as to what the trouble was, I was informed that the water had been allowed to get too low while the boiler was in operation, resulting in leaking flues. On making further investigation a day or two later, I found that it has been the practice lately, to leave one or other of the Indian boys in charge of this boiler, and it is my opinion that the lower end of the guage glass had been allowed to get plugged up, which would result in the water remaining in the glass, when the water in the boiler itself was very much lower than the bottom of the glass, thus whatever inexperienced boy was in charge, would think by looking at the glass, that there was plenty of water in the boiler when there was not. I discussed this matter\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\nwith the Principal, and strongly advised him to see that the school engineer was in direct charge of this boiler when it was in operation in the future, in order to avoid any possibility of accident. This boiler operates at a pressure of from 50 to 70 lbs., and it is very unwise, in my opinion, to leave an inexperienced Indian boy in charge of it while it is in operation.\n\nThe laundry was busy at the time of my visit, and the various machines were all operating well. The bakery is badly in need of a new oven, and this has been requisitioned for through the estimates for next year.\n\nIn the senior class room, there were 18 pupils present; 9 boys and 9 girls. There are 45 pupils on the roll, 26 of whom attend in the afternoons, and 19 in the mornings. The teacher of this class, Mr Harry Meadows, and the pupils, show keen interest in their work. The discipline was very good, and the pupils were attentive, and prompt in their answers to questions.\n\nThe fire equipment is good, having been much improved by the recent installation of the new alarm signal system. The fire escapes consist of two sliding poles of metal. Fire drill is carried out at intervals of about one month, and at these drills, the building is usually emptied in from three to four minutes.\n\nA copy of this report is being forwarded to Mr Inspector A.G. Hamilton for his information.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 3rd, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nMr. Agent Lazenby's letter of October 28th, reporting on his inspection of the Norway House Indian Residential School on October 23rd, reached the Department on the first instant.\n\nPart of his report reads, as follows:\n\n\"In the basement, I found that the high pressure boiler, which was newly installed a year ago, was being dismantled. On making inquiry as to what the trouble was, I was informed that the water had been allowed to get too low while the boiler was in operation, resulting in leaking flues. On making further investigation a day or two later, I found that it has been the practice lately, to leave one or other of the Indian boys in charge of this boiler, and it is my opinion that the lower end of the gauge glass had been allowed to get plugged up, which would result in the water remaining in the glass, when the water in the boiler itself was very much lower than the bottom of the glass, thus whatever inexperienced boy was in charge, would think by looking at the glass, that there was plenty of water in the boiler when there was not. I discussed this matter with the Principal and strongly advised him to see that the school engineer was in direct charge of this boiler when it was in operation in the future, in order to avoid any possibility of accident. The boiler operates at a pressure of from 60 to 70 lbs., and it is very unwise, in my opinion, to leave an inexperienced Indian boy in charge of it while it is in operation.\"\n\nThe Department agrees with Mr. Lazenby that it is very undesirable to leave the boiler in charge of an inexperienced Indian boy. It will be expected that, in future, a qualified member of the school staff will oversee the operation of this boiler.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nRev. R. T. Chapin, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nNorway House, Man.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, December 3rd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th of October, which reached the Department on the first instant, I enclose, for your information, a copy of official letter of today's date to the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nP. G. Lasenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nMy dear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI am sending you a copy of the estimate of needs for the fiscal year beginning April 1st, 1937, which I am sure you have already received through Mr. Indian Agent Lazenby, concerning the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nI have deliberately refrained from putting prices opposite the first three items, because I presume the Government has a fixed price with the manufacturers of this equipment.\n\nI went over this list very carefully with the Principal of the School and can assure you that there is nothing asked for which is not absolutely necessary. In connection with the first item - Storage Batteries, - I would like to renew a suggestion that I have already made on at least two previous occasions, namely, that it would pay the Government to install one electric light plant, with a Diesel engine, to care for the hospital, the agency, the school, and the Government residences at Norway House. The initial cost might seem large, but the Diesel fuel is so much cheaper than gasoline and the engines have three or four times the length of life that a gasoline engine has, so that over a period of ten years it would be an economy measure. If the plant were equipped with two Diesel engines, as our hospital at Port Simpson is and as the new hospital at Bella Bella is, the batteries would be eliminated altogether. Their renewal every three or four years is a very expensive item.\n\nWhile I am talking about the Norway House School, may I return once again to the question of the enormous risk which the Government is running by having 105 children and a staff in that old frame building without a night watchman. It certainly would be a sad day for the Department of Indian Affairs and the Church, if a fire broke out there in the depth of winter and the public were made aware of the fact that the small grant necessary to keep a night watchman on the job from October to May had been refused.\n\nWe very deeply appreciate the grants that have been made towards this School since Mr. Chapin became Principal and we are grateful for Dr. McGill's letter in which he expresses satisfaction at the improvement in conditions, as evidenced by the Inspector's reports, since the occasion of his last visit.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKJB.MLT\n\nEnc.\nSeptember 7th, 1936.\n\nESTIMATE OF SCHOOL NEEDS FOR 1937\n\n1 Set Storage Batteries, 110 Volt System $7.00\n\n1 New Bake Oven, 150 Loaf Capacity\n\n1 Kitchen Sink, 2 compartment, 2 drain boards\n\nEngine and Machine repair parts $50.00\n\nLumber for repairs $25.00\n\nInside Paint and Alabastine $60.00\n\n5 Single Dormitory Beds, 30\" x 72\" $50.00\n\nCement, 30 sgs, for manholes on sewer line, laundry floor, courts $30.00\n\nFarm Harrows, Lawn Mower $25.00\n\nTentest, for back porches $20.00\n\nMiscellaneous $200.00\n(2 iron posts for classroom, 3 toilet bowls, 1 basin, 1 pedestal drinking font, 1 bubbler drinking font, 5 radiator sections, 2 manhole covers, 3 door checks, 5 doz. 110 volt lamps, sundry pipe fittings.)\n\n1 Set Double Harness $45.00\n\n1 Laundry Stove with Galvanized Tank $20.00\n\nCopied - JGA.\nOttawa, December 9th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt has been decided to allow $40.00 a month for a night watchman at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nImmediately on receipt of this letter, you should instruct the Principal to appoint a night watchman and the allowance of $40.00 a month will be made for him until April 30th, 1937.\n\nThe voucher covering the allowance made by the Department can be forwarded at the end of each month.

This is a high pressure boiler and, according to the Provincial laws, should only be operated by an engineer holding a certificate. Certainly a responsibility of this nature should not be shifted on to the pupils of the school as the danger to life is too great. A boiler of the type supplied should give service for many years, but, if handled in the manner indicated by Mr. Lazenby, will soon be useless or require expensive repairs.\n\nI think this matter should be brought to the attention of the Principal of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This reads in part:\n\n\"I have your communications re Fibre Soaps, I would like to know a little more about it and its cost, perhaps give it a years trial in one of our washrooms. In one of our girls' washrooms there are five basins side by side, about two inches between the porcelain.

R.T. Chapin; Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, that Mr James Gilmour has been engaged as Night Watchman for this school for the winter months, beginning 1st November; his duties to finish 30th April 1938.\n\nMr Chapin requests that the Department will approve of this appointment, and provide the salary for the night watchman as was done last winter, as per official letter No; 123-5-5 dated 9th December 1936, the amount being $40.00 per month.\n\nWill you kindly advise me of the decision of the Department in this matter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.:\nOttawa, December 10, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 4th, the Department will make an allowance at the rate of $40. a month for the period November 1, 1937, to April 30, 1938, in order to assist the Principal of the Norway House Residential School in engaging a night watchman.\n\nVoucher covering the allowance made by the Department can be forwarded at the end of each month. You should use a similar voucher to that used last year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP.G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nWhen I visited the school a second time, on the 12th instant, I went downstairs to see the high pressure boiler, which had not been operating when I visited the school on the 9th instant. I found that this boiler was carrying a pressure of 60 lbs per square inch, and two Indian boys were in charge of it. One of these boys was probably 20 years of age; a graduate of the school, and employed there, named Hedley Ross. This boy, while no doubt a handy sort of boy in many ways, is not a qualified engineer, and in my opinion, should not be left in charge of this boiler. In connection with this matter, I beg to refer you to my inspection report regarding this school dated 28th October 1936, and the official letter of the Department, No: 123-5-5, dated 3rd December 1936 addressed to the Principal of the school, regarding the operation of this boiler. Mr. R.L. Stevenson, a member of the school staff, has a 3rd class engineer's certificate, and should, in my opinion, as I previously said, always be in direct charge of this boiler when it is in operation.\"\nOttawa, December 15, 1937.\n\nEX'D.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn official letter of December 3, 1936, the Department pointed out to you that it is very undesirable to leave the boiler at the Norway House Indian Residential School in charge of an inexperienced Indian boy. I further understand that the Provincial laws of Manitoba require that a high pressure boiler be operated by an engineer holding a certificate.\n\nWhen Indian Agent Lazenby visited the school on the 9th instant, he found that the boiler was carrying a pressure of 60 pounds per square inch and that two Indian boys were in charge of it, although Mr. R.L. Stevenson, a member of the school staff has an engineer's certificate.\n\nIn future, the Department will expect that this boiler will not be operated unless under the supervision of Mr. Stevenson or some other qualified person.\n\nI would appreciate receiving from you an acknowledgement of this letter, indicating that the Department's instructions will be carried out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R.T. Chapin, B.A.,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nNorway House, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nI received a copy of a report submitted to the Department by Mr. F.G. Lazenby, on the Indian Residential School at Norway House, dated November 13th.\n\nI wish to draw to the Department's attention the last paragraph on the first page. Mr. Stevenson, who is supposed to be in charge of the boiler room, is a reliable man but I do not approve of making boys responsible for a boiler carrying a pressure of 60 lbs.\n\nI would request that the Department bring this matter to the attention of the principal of the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

I understand, however, that the measurement of serial 1215 M 7173 is 34\" by 36\".

Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThrough you may I urge the Department with the necessity of immediately procuring the washing machine requisitioned for this year for this School. The present one in use is likely to give way entirely with each week's washing, the wood is so rotten and breaking away.\n\nIf the delay is in view of the intended change of power and putting of motors on all machines, so this machine may be sent complete with motor attached, might I suggest that if the motor is secured for either D.C. or A.C. it could be sent immediately and we could use it on the present system for the time being.\n\nThere is not the same rush for the other items requisitioned as long as they get in this summer - which is getting along.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter handed to me by the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, regarding the immediate necessity of procuring the new washing machine requisitioned for.\n\nThe washing machine was requisitioned for through the Estimates for the current year, and on the 25th March last, at the Principal's request, I wrote a special letter to the Department requesting that this item be shipped if possible, by the first available boat in the spring after the opening of navigation.\n\nOn receiving the attached letter from the Principal, I went to the school and examined the washing machine, and found that it is rapidly falling to pieces, and will not last for many more washings. It has been tinkered up as best can be managed to hold it together, but nothing much more can be done with it.\n\nIt is urgently necessary that a new washing machine be supplied as soon as possible, and I should be glad if the Department can give early attention to this requisition.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazendy,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.,\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 23, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant regarding the new washing machine for the Norway House Indian Residential School, I may say that an order for this machine was placed with Stanley Brock Limited, Winnipeg, Manitoba, on the 6th instant.\n\nThe firm was instructed to ship this machine at the earliest possible date. If it has not already reached the school, it should be there in the near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nP. G.

The Principal, Rev. R.T. Chapin, and some of the men of the staff, were already on the roof when I got there, and with two fire extinguishers, had extinguished the blaze; one inside the attic, and the other outside on the roof. Very little damage was done, and this can be repaired with a board or two. The fire was discovered by the Matron, Mrs Carefoot, who happened to look up the inside of the dumb waiter, which runs up from the kitchen, alongside the chimney, and she saw smoke at the top. She immediately started the fire alarm, and all the pupils were quickly evacuated from the building without any trouble or panic.\n\nThe Principal and I made a careful examination of the chimney, but could not find any crack or hole in it through which a spark could get out. The walls of the chimney are two bricks thick. There is a sheet metal 'saddle' on the roof where the chimney comes through, to run the rain water off at each side of the chimney, but this 'saddle' is not grouted into the wall of the chimney, but simply placed against it on the outside. It is thought that a spark from the top of the chimney must have been whirled by the wind, down between the chimney wall and the metal saddle, on to the shingle roof below, and with possibly a draft blowing in as well, this spark has set fire to the roof, (see sketch).\n\nThis metal saddle should have been set into the wall of the chimney properly, but this was not done when it was built. It cannot be done now, owing to the sub-zero weather, but will be done as soon as possible in the spring. As a temporary measure, the metal saddle is being replaced, with a packing of asbestos between it and the chimney, so that there will be no orifice through which any more sparks can get in.\n\nIt was fortunate that the fire took place in the daytime, and that it was so promptly discovered and dealt with, as the building is entirely of frame construction, and if a fire were to get any sort of start, it would burn like tinder.\n\nThe water pipe which serves the fire hose, and which runs up inside the building, projects right through into the attic, where the pipe is capped at the top.

R.T. Chapin, Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, has asked that a new Kitchen Sink be provided as soon as possible, for the school kitchen, as the present one is worn out, and is beyond repair. It has been patched up quite a number of times, and nothing more can be done with it now.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey's letter, No. 123-5-5 of the 1st April 1938, stated that the sum of $1,000.00 had been appropriated for repairs, improvements, and purchase of new equipment for this school for the present fiscal year. To date, the following expenditures are, (in round figures), all that have been made; for this school.\n\n| Item                        | Amount |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Washing Machine             | 491.00 |\n| Pump Repairs (Gardner)      | 150.00 |\n| Boiler valves etc.          | 89.00  |\n| (Kipp Kelly)                |        |\n| Plumbing, Pipe etc.         | 70.00  |\n| (Ashdown)                   |        |\n| Paints, Alabastine etc. (?) | 85.00  |\n\nBal.: Unexpended: - 115.00\n\n$ 1,000.00\n\nIt would be much appreciated if a new kitchen sink could be purchased out of the unexpended balance of $115.00 from the present year's appropriation, instead of taking it out of the appropriation for next fiscal year, and have the sink shipped out to Norway House on the first boat leaving Winnipeg when navigation opens, about the end of May next.\n\nI asked the Principal to let me have the details of the sink needed, and received from him the attached letter and cut. The Principal informs me that General Steelwares Ltd. of Winnipeg would be likely to have the type of sink required, and I consider that sink made of either stainless steel or monel metal, would eliminate any further trouble for many years to come. Would you kindly advise me if the sink asked for might be purchased.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

This room was clean and tidy, and well kept.\n\nAll the dormitories were clean and in good order. There are a few minor repairs to be made this summer to the plaster of the walls of the junior boys' dormitory. The blankets on the beds in this dormitory are getting quite shabby, but the Principal advised me that he had a new stock of blankets on order, which would arrive on the opening of navigation. Some of the bed springs in all the dormitories were in poor shape.\n\nThe sewing room; laundry; and bakery were all in good order in every way, and efficiently managed.\n\nThe kitchen was clean and orderly, and well managed in every way. The only defect in the kitchen is the metal sink, which is in very poor shape, and which I brought to the attention on the Department in my letter of the 24th February last.\n\nAll the pupils were fairly well clothed, and clean.\n\nIn the class room, there were 29 girls present, there being 58 pupils on the roll, the balance of the pupils being taught at the Rossville Day School. The register was well kept, and marked up to date. Several of the boy pupils were at manual training in the carpenter shop. The class room work of the pupils present, was creditable; their book work being neat, clean, and well done.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.:\nSir,\n\nI beg to be advised if there is on file at the Department's offices, a plan of the Norway House Indian Residential School, which, I understand, was built in 1914.\n\nWhat is actually desired, is that part of the plan which shows the lay-out of the school sewage system.\n\nThe principal of this school called at the office this morning, and advised me that the sewer pipes are apparently getting badly worn out. A block in one of the pipes occurred a few days ago, and when a cleaning rod was pushed down the pipe for about 40 or 50 feet, the end of the rod went through the side of the pipe. The broken pipe was located, and found to be badly corroded and so worn that the cleaning rod went right through the side of it.\n\nThe principal stated that they had had much more trouble with the sewage system this winter than ever before, and it would appear that at no distant date, the system will need to be renewed, and if a plan were available, showing the lay-out of the pipes, it would facilitate matters when occasion arose to dig any of them up. At present, no one knows where or how the pipes are laid.\n\nThe principal also advised me that their septic tank had been giving a great deal of trouble too, and from the description given to me by the school engineer, of the construction of this tank, I imagine that it is not properly constructed. However, they are going to clean this tank out shortly, and I have asked to be supplied with a sketch of a cross section of the tank, and when I have this, I will again take the matter up with the Department.\n\nIn the meantime, it will be appreciated if a plan of the sewage system can be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

It is altogether likely that the plan will reach you in the course of a few days.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\nOttawa, June 12, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Plan of Norway House Indian Residential School\n\nThis Branch is in receipt of a letter from Mr. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba, in which he states:\n\n\"I beg to be advised if there is on file at the Department a plan of the Norway House Indian Residential School, which I understand was built in 1914. What is actually desired is that part of the plan which shows the lay-out of the school sewage system\".\n\nMr. Lazenby's request has been discussed with Mr. Dudley and it is my understanding that you have on file a plan of the Norway House School. If such is the case, it would be appreciated if you sent forward a copy to Indian Agent Lazenby.\n\nDirector.\nSir,\n\nI beg to request that the installation of the Chlorinator and Water Pressure Pump in the Norway House Indian Residential School might be proceeded with as soon as possible after the opening of navigation, about 1st June next.\n\nWhen in Ottawa, I discussed the matter with Mr Philip Phelan, who advised me that the sum of $800.00 had been included in the Estimates for the new chlorinating plant.\n\nAs the Chlorinator itself should not cost more than about $350.00, it was suggested that with the balance a new pressure pump might be provided, to replace the present one, which is very old, and obsolete. The present pump is a Gardner-Denver, and when it operates, it vibrates the whole building, although many methods have been tried to reduce this. In addition, whenever repairs are required for this pump, there is always considerable difficulty in procuring them, as the pump has no serial number, or other mark of identification, apart from the name of the makers.\n\nWhen I was in Ottawa, a gentleman from the engineering branch, (whose name I omitted to note, but would probably be known by Miss Walton), came to the office on two occasions to discuss the matter of this pump with me. On his second visit, he brought a quotation of $925.00, F.O.B. Montreal, for a Fairbanks Morse Pump of 5,000 gallons per hour capacity, plus $35.00 for automatic control.\n\nThe pressure tank at the school is a very large one, being six feet in diameter, and 20 feet long, and therefore a pump with a good capacity is required. This pump could be operated with the motor that operates the present one, so that there would be no change in that respect.\n\nMr Phelan advised me to bring this matter to the attention of the Department immediately after the beginning of the new fiscal year.\n\nI may say that all particulars regarding the chlorinators were left with Dr Stone when I was there.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDep't of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 7)\nOttawa,\nJune 17, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of April 25 with reference to the installation of a chlorinator and water pressure pump in the Norway House Indian residential school.\n\nI understand that Dr. Stone has recently written to you in connection with the installation of chlorinating equipment that would serve both the school and the hospital at Norway House. Until your reply is received no further action will be taken with reference to the recommendation contained in yours of April 25.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP.G.

While we are paying the voucher which you submitted, it will be necessary to deduct this amount from the per capita allowance of the Norway House Residential School. This involves a considerable amount of bookkeeping and there is always a possibility of a mistake being made.\n\nYou should therefore consult the Principal of the Norway House School with a view to determining in what manner freight on empty barrels will be paid in future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Stevenson, the engineer, has for many years past lived in a small log building, which is now in very bad shape, and just about ready to fall. Mr Stevenson is a married man, with wife and one girl, and as he purposes staying on at the school as engineer for another ten years at least, some new provision will need to be made for a dwelling house for him.\n\nThe present house in which Mr Stevenson lives, is of course a part of the school property, and is located in the school grounds.\n\nIt is considered that a small dwelling, somewhat similar to the enclosed cut, would be adequate.\n\nWould you please advise me if provision may be made in the Estimates for the next fiscal year, for the construction of such a house for the purpose mentioned. If so, steps will be taken to find out the approximate cost.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.:\nDear Sir:\n\nI find there is a set of 56 Globelite batteries at Norway House Indian Residential School, which are surplus to their requirements.

Chapin, the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, advises me that some time ago, he received a letter, dated May 15th 1939, from the United Church Offices in Toronto, from which the following is a quotation:\n\n\"At the end of March we received from the Department a cheque for $152.00, being a refund on account of barrels returned.\"\n\nThis is apparently a refund, at $8.00 each, on the 19 empty gasoline barrels I returned to the Imperial Oil Ltd on October 6th 1938, with which the school had nothing to do, as these were barrels used entirely by the agency, for the old lighting plant, motor boats etc. The school was to receive credit for empty fuel oil barrels, up to 120, in connection with the new lighting plant, which commenced operation on 4th October 1938.\n\nOn the 21st May 1939, there were 22 empty fuel oil barrels returned to Imperial Oil Ltd, and 20, to British American Oil Co: Ltd, making 42 in all, for which the school was to receive credit, and these were the first shipments of empty barrels which were to be credited to the school. I have just shipped out to these two oil companies a further 18 empty barrels for the credit of the school. The cheque for $152.00 has evidently been credited to the school in error, as they were not entitled to it.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDep't of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Onti,\n\nP.G.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that today I inspected the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nThis school building, being of frame construction, and old, is of course showing signs of wear and tear, being out of line in several places, and so on. The interior, however, during the past summer, has been practically entirely re-decorated; walls, ceilings, floors etc., having been painted, kalsomined, or varnished as requirements indicated. A new hot water storage tank; jacket heater; and kitchen sink were purchased for the school. The tank and the kitchen sink were received on the last boat of the season, but the jacket heater did not arrive, although I was advised by Mr. Inspector A.G. Hamilton, that all these things were to be shipped together, from the one firm from whom they were purchased. The kitchen sink has been installed, but the hot water storage tank has not been installed as yet, and the Principal advises me that they will continue with the old tank, until the jacket heater is received and install both at the same time. Provided of course, the old tank does not again develop leaks in the meantime. The outside of the building is badly in need of painting, for which purpose an item was included in the Estimates for the next fiscal year. The dormitories were all clean and tidy, and well aired. The wash rooms also were very clean and neat, as also were all the other departments, kitchen; laundry, bake-room etc.\n\nThe class room register was marked up to date, and there are 58 pupils on the roll, 30 of them being present at the morning session; the other 28 attend the class room in the afternoons. The 58 pupils are divided into the following grades:\n\n| Grade | Pupils |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 7      |\n| II    | 6      |\n| III   | 17     |\n| IV    | 8      |\n| V     | 10     |\n| VI    | 4      |\n| VII   | 2      |\n| VIII  | 1      |\n| IX    | 1      |\n| X     | 1      |\n\nThere are no Grade 8 pupils on the roll, and at the time of my visit, pupils of grades 1, 2, 4, and 5 were present in the class room. The book work of these pupils was good, being neat, clean, and accurate. Their reading - however -\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.;\nhowever, was only fair. I suggested to both the teacher and the Principal, that more attention could well be given to this aspect of the class-room work.\n\nThere are two fire escapes, both of the sliding pole type, and both are easily accessible, and the fire alarm system is electric, recently new, and in good condition. Fire drill has been carried out weekly until the winter set in, and since that time, at least once a month, and sometimes oftener. The usual night watchman has been employed since November 1st. In connection with the employing of the night watchman, I may say that I wrote to the Department on October 13th last, requesting authority to employ the night watchman at the usual allowance of $40.00 per month, but our mail service was suspended the following day, so that no reply has been received, and I do not know as yet if my letter was received at the Department. However, as the employing of a night watchman is absolutely necessary at this school, and there has been one for some years past, the same man as usual was given the duty beginning November 1st.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G. Lazenby.\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith Voucher No; 274, amounting to $275.50, in favour of J.C.Davis Limited, 408 Film Exchange Building, Winnipeg, Man: for one Storage Tank, one Jacket Heater, one Kitchen Sink, and 2 Bags of Asbestos Cement, for the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nThe purchase was made by Mr Inspector A.G. Hamilton, on authority of Departmental letter No; 123-5-5 dated 18th September 1939.

However, on Nov. 13/39 we received their cheque #19125 in the amount of $160.00 for twenty empties.\n\nBoth these cheques went forward to the Receiver General - see our Form 527, Numbers 9 and 15, dated August 15th and November 15th.\n\nOn investigation of the extra six empties for which credit was received, it was found that these had been taken over by the principal of the school from Forestry Island, on instructions of the salvage officer, and had been instructed to return the empty drums to the B.A. Oil company for the credit of the Royal Air Force, to whom they had belonged. The British American Oil Company now state-\n\n\"The credit was apparently put into the Indian Affairs Branch account in error and payment of these six drums has apparently also been made to your Dept. in error.\" In order to adjust this matter, therefore, it would appear that we should receive a cheque from your Dept. for $48.00.

Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Lazenby:\n\nYours of the 23rd to hand re the Department's letter concerning Alex Duncan's wages and repairs for power plant engines.\n\nWe are quite ready to assume our share of costs but may I ask why repairs for the engine should be charged against per capita grant? I should think this should be charged against the grant made to the school annually for building and repairs. Repair parts for our school engines when we were running our own separate plant were always included in this grant.\n\nRegarding the payment of part of Alex Duncan's wages, again we want to pay our share. But if we pay 60% of his wages should we not be required to pay only the same proportion of the wages of the second man in the power house? It would be hardly fair for us to pay him his full wages, value of $40. per month, and also 60% of Alex Duncan's wages. We have been working on the assumption that we supply one man and the Department the other. The man we had went into the hospital and from the first of January this year we have had one of the senior boys on the job, giving him a small allowance. However from now on again we will be paying regular wages as this boy has graduated from the school, and we expect the other man to be ready for work again very shortly.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) R. T. Chapin\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Chapin, the Principal of the Norway House School in regard to different matters, and in the course of it he refers to a communication from Ottawa in regard to the payment of the wages of the man who looks after the power plant and repairs to the engines. I think the best thing to do is to quote what he has to say:\n\n\"When the new power plant was established it meant that two men had to be employed to look after it\u2014a day and night man. We started off with the School employing and paying one man and the Department employing and paying the other. Of course we do not pay as high a wage as they do; we have a young fellow and they have a married man with large family. The Auditor General has been going into things; he overlooks the fact that we are hiring one man, and orders that, as from April 1st, 1939, the school shall pay 60% of the salary of the powerhouse attendant, also 60% of the cost of repairs and parts for engines in that time. This amount, $31.90 for repairs and $455.06 for wages, is to be deducted from our September quarter per capita allowance. I am enclosing copy of my reply to the Agent. The 60% basis was worked out when the power plant was installed\u2014that was about the proportion of power the School used.\"\n\nIf there was an agreement that the School should pay one man and the Department should pay the other, do you think it quite fair to make any change without consulting us or the Principal about the matter? I confess that it seems neither businesslike, courteous nor fair for the Government to vary an arrangement which has been made without consulting the other party concerned. This happened in connection with the reduction in the per capita grant to the residential schools, and also in connection with the decision to reduce the period of teaching in the day schools by one month. Now, for a third time, we have an instance of the variation of a working agreement without any consultation with us at all.\n\nI want once more to protest against this kind\nof treatment. It would appear in this case that it was the Auditor General who had the change made. Are we to understand that the Auditor General has power to vary an agreement into which your Department has entered with the Church or an individual? If this sort of thing is to become the practice at Ottawa, then I think our protest will have to go further.\n\nYou will also note in Mr. Chapin's letter to the Agent (copy of which is enclosed) his query as to why the School's share of the cost of repairs to the power plant engines should not be charged against the annual grant to the School for building and repairs instead of against the per capita grant. Will you be good enough to look into this matter, also, and let us know whether Mr. Chapin's wishes in this matter can be met.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file S81-5, part 7)\nAttention of -\nMr. R. A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSeptember 5th,\n1940\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe - Refund of Oil Barrels - Norway House\n\nYou will probably remember that there were barrels of oil sent to Norway House School in 1938. The School was charged with $974.40 to cover the cost of the barrels, which amount was to be refunded to the School when the barrels were returned. The only refund we have had to date is an amount of $152.00, received on March 26th, 1939. However, there was deducted from the grant for the June quarter, 1939, an amount of $12.00 for freight on barrels which were returned. We are informed that in May, 1939, 42 barrels were returned by the Agent, for which the School was to receive a credit of $336.00. From the September (1939) quarter grant $58.94 was deducted for freight on these barrels, but we never received the refund. (Mr. Chapin points out that the freight on 42 barrels would be only $27.30.)\n\nIn May, 1940, the Agent returned another 19 barrels, for which the School was to have been credited with $144.00. We have had no refund of this amount either. In June, 1940, the Agent returned 41 barrels, for which the School should have received a credit of $322.00. The freight on these was charged back direct to the School, but there has been no credit given us for the returned barrels.\n\nWill you be good enough to look into this matter and see that Norway House School gets the refunds which are due. It does not seem quite right to charge us freight for barrels that were returned and not give us credit for the barrels themselves.\n\nAs far as the grant for the June quarter, 1940, is concerned, - on the basis of 92.24 per cent, of a pupilage of 105, we figure the grant should be $4237.27. In addition, for special nursing care an amount of $232.75 was due, figured on the basis of 931 days at 25 cents. This made a total due, according to our figuring, of $4470.02, whereas the amount sent for the quarter was only $4094.76. This may be the result of charging the School with further amounts for freight on oil barrels and not crediting the refunds on the barrels.

Lasenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn your letter from the Dept it was stated that after $1,000.00 was deducted for water and power construction work here this summer there would be $275.00 left of the grant to the School for building repairs and equipment. Also that 10 beds, $67.50, 15 bed springs (probably $45. or $50.), 50 ft. fire hose, $21.15, and iron post for laundry, $14.05 had been purchased and that whatever balance therewas could be applied to further needs that had been requisitioned for.\n\nAccording to the above there would be about $125.00 left.\n\nI am listing below the most imperative articles from our requisition which would amount to about this figure. There is need that this be rushed through as we cannot depend on a boat later than the first week in October or last week of September. And as we cannot get repairs in during the winter, except at a high rate of plane express, it is necessary that we have enough stock to meet the running needs for the year.\n\n10 fire extinguisher refills, guards, acid & soda, 2\u00bd gal.\n1 doz. \u00bd inch close nipples\n1 \" 2 \" anstd. \"\n1 \" \u00bd \" elbows\n1 \" basin faucets, X handle, hot.\n1 \" \u00bd inch globe pipe valves\n1 \" 1 \" \"\n1 \" 2 \" \"\n2 only closet bowls\n1 doz weatherproof electric light sockets, rubber, for barn.\n17\u00bd feet 2 inch leather belting, for extractor\n1 Blacksmith post drill, to 12 inch circle\n1 roll 38 inch galvanized window screening\n12 sheets Ten Test, 4' x 10'.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

HOEY\n\nIn memorandum of October 8, the Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, in reporting on the alterations to Norway House light and power plant, states that the 1500 gallon pump at the hospital and the 5000 gallon pump at the school have both been installed in the power plant building and connected to a common delivery pipe.\n\nHe states, further, that the 1500 gallon pump has sufficient capacity to meet normal requirements at the Agency, but that additional pumping capacity would be required in case of fire.\n\nHe advises that the 5000 gallon pump formerly in the school only operates at 25% efficiency and that to re-condition this old pump, including shop work, freight and cartage, would cost at least $135.00.\n\nIn view of the fact that the cost of a new pump would be little more than the cost of repairing the old one, the engineer looking after the Norway House plant obtained prices from the Power and Mine Supply Company and the Canadian Fairbanks Morse. Power and Mine Supply offer a new centrifugal pump of some 4500 gallons per hour, directly connected to the present motor, for $145.60 f.o.b. Winnipeg. Canadian Fairbanks Morse offer a 3500 gallon per hour centrifugal pump with a new 5 H.P. motor for $163.95. Canadian Fairbanks Morse place a salvage value on the present 5 H.P. motor of $60.00 but this they would not accept as part payment on the new unit.\nThe Director further advises that there are sufficient funds available in the amount transferred to his Branch this summer to purchase the pump and motor from the Canadian Fairbanks Company for $163.95.\n\nIt would appear advisable to instruct the Surveys and Engineering Branch to arrange for the purchase from the aforesaid funds, although delivery and installation could probably not be made until navigation opens in the spring. I should like, however, to have your views before issuing instructions to the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nM.W. Director.\n| QUANTITY | NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 5th, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of September 5th, in connection with the operation of the lighting plant at the Norway House Indian Residential School. I regret that my reply to your letter has been so delayed but, due to circumstances beyond our control, it was not possible to reply sooner as the whole question of expenditure in connection with light and power at Norway House has been the subject of correspondence with our officials.\n\nWhen the new lighting plant was installed at Norway House it was understood that 60% of the cost would be charged against the Norway House Residential School. I was under the impression that Rev. Mr. Chapin was aware of this arrangement, and that it included both the cost of the oil and wages of the men employed to handle the plant. However, certain payments were made and a percentage of them was not charged against the school and, as a consequence, the Auditor General has drawn our attention to the fact that we were not carrying out the arrangement originally made by ourselves. He, therefore, directed that we should carry out our own agreement. This necessitated charging against the per capita grant certain amounts which should have been deducted in 1939.\n\nThe point that was raised in your letter in connection with the Department charging the school with repairs to the electric plant is, I feel, well taken and, consequently, it has been decided to make no such deduction.\n\nIn order to adjust the matter, certain deductions have been made from the September quarter per capita allowance of the Norway House School. For your information, I enclose a statement of these deductions, also a statement showing amounts refunded to the school for empty barrels which have been returned. In addition, a detailed report regarding the method of arriving\n\nRev. R. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto (2), Ont.\nat the amount due the school for the September quarter is also attached.\n\nDuring the past summer the Department has made a complete re-arrangement of the light and power plants installed at Norway House in 1938. This means that all machinery for lighting the various buildings, driving electrical equipment and pumping water are now installed in one central building. Arrangements are now proceeding for the purchase and installation of a new pressure pump.\n\nThe above installation will be operated by the same persons and our officials have found that the annual operating costs, including labour, oil, etc., will be approximately $4,000 a year. This would involve the employment and payment by the Department of Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Ross, both of whom are now on the staff of the Norway House School.\n\nAs shown by our auditor's reports, the amount expended by the Norway House School for light, water and power over a period of years has averaged approximately $2,000. It is, therefore, felt that a fair charge against the school in future for supplying light, power and water would be the amount mentioned in the preceding sentence, which is 50% of the total operating costs. The new system should, of course, give much better service than the school has received in the past. I trust that the proposed arrangement meets with your approval, and it would be appreciated if you would advise me to that effect.\n\nThe deduction of the annual payment from the Norway House School could be made from the per capita allowance at the rate of $500 a quarter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Loganby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.;\nNORWAY HOUSE AGENCY\nMANITOBA\n\n5th January 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith in duplicate, my report and Diary for the month of December 1940, as follows:\n\nx x x\n\nGeneral:\n\nDuring the night of the 1st instant, the intake pipe line of the water system froze up. The men of the school and agency staff worked on the pipes till 4 p.m. at which time three more Indians were hired to help with the job. A steam boiler was made, with a steel barrel, and steam was used on the pipe, as well as fire. The pipe was thawed out and in use again by midnight, by which time the need for water in the heating boilers in the buildings was becoming urgent. Further steps were immediately taken for the protection of the pipe line, and to try to eliminate the possibility of a recurrence. During the first week of the month, the necessary credit vouchers, labour returns, etc., in connection with the accountable advances made for payment of labour for the laying and protection of the new extension of the intake pipe line, were prepared, and forwarded direct to the Chief Engineer at Ottawa.\n\nx x x\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\nP.O. still outstanding invoices not received to date.\n\n31-1-41\nOttawa,\nFebruary 1, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn September 10, 1940, purchase order No. 3612 was placed with the Pyrene Manufacturing Company for 10 refills for fire extinguishers at the Norway House Indian Residential School. As yet the account covering the cost of these refills has not reached the Department. If they were supplied you should have the account certified and forward it for payment at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nDecember 11, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nWhile Mr. Snelson was at Norway House last summer he made a careful inspection of the sewage disposal system there and has now submitted his report, two copies of which are attached for your information.\n\nThe following points will be noted:\n\n(1) The septic tank for the school is poorly designed and is too small.\n\n(2) The septic tank for the Hospital, while small, will give satisfactory service so long as the hospital population is not increased and the depth of sludge in the tank is not allowed to exceed six or eight inches. This will require careful maintenance.\n\n(3) The kitchen and laundry wastes from the school should be by-passed around the septic tank.\n\n(4) The main sewer line outlet should be extended as the recent lowering of the level of Little Playgreen Lake has left the outlet about 100 feet from the present shore line.\n\nTo improve these conditions Mr. Snelson has offered two suggestions:\n\n(1) That the present concrete tank at the school be enlarged to handle the sewage from both school and hospital at an estimated cost of from $1,200 to $1,500 or that a new steel tank of similar capacity be installed at an estimated cost of from $900 to $1,100.\n\n(2) That a 4-inch line be laid a distance of 700 feet to bypass kitchen and laundry wastes from the school around the septic tank and that the main sewer line be extended about 300 feet, the estimated cost of both being from $1,200 to $1,500.\n\nWe concur fully in these suggestions but would strongly recommend the concrete septic tank as being more lasting although slightly more expensive. The estimated cost of the above work with 10% for engineering and contingencies is $5,300. This matter might be referred to the Indian Affairs Branch as if it is decided to proceed with the work next year it should be carried out during July and August when the school is not in operation.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBanff, Alberta,\nDecember 3rd, 1940.\n\nREPORT ON - NORWAY HOUSE SEWAGE SYSTEM.\nNORWAY HOUSE, MANITOBA.\n\nI beg to submit the following report covering the condition of the septic tanks and sewage lines at Norway House, as inspected August 26th, 1940. Before inspection, both the septic tank for the school and that for the hospital were thoroughly cleaned.\n\nSEPTIC TANK FOR RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe main septic, or liquefying chamber of this tank measured 5' x 6' x 5' deep. The total contents below the water surface of the overflow pipe is therefore 150 cubic feet. Assume that the sludge would be removed when it had attained an average depth of one foot over the bottom. This would give a total liquefying volume of 150 - 30 = 120 cubic feet. Three cubic feet of liquefying volume should be allowed for each person served. The total service capacity of the liquefying chamber on this basis would be 120 \u00f7 3 = 40 persons. This is the present carrying capacity of the septic tank. Removing a concrete wall which separates the two chambers of the tank will increase the liquefying volume to 306 cubic feet or sufficient for sixty-eight (68) persons. The flow across the liquefying chamber of this tank from the inflow to the outflow pipe is but 5 feet, as the inflow enters along the side of the tank instead of at the end opposite the outflow. The flow is thus short circuited. The tank is not only too small but is ineffective. It should have a capacity, for the school and Principal's residence, of at least 120 x 5 = 360 cubic feet. I would recommend therefore that this concrete tank be enlarged to such size as will care for both the hospital and the main school, or large enough to provide for 200 persons, or replaced with a new steel tank.\n\n(A) Estimated cost to enlarge present concrete tank $1500., to $1500.\nEstimated cost to install a new steel tank .... 900., to 1100.\n\nSEPTIC TANK FOR HOSPITAL.\n\nThis tank consists of two chambers, one (A) receiving sewage from the hospital, the other (B) receiving laundry waste from the hospital. The cubical contents of the liquefying chamber below the high water or outflow elevation is:\n\nFor chamber (A) 1.5' x 6.4' x 8.6' = 60.64 Cubic Feet\n\" \" (B) 2.5' x 6.4' x 7.8' = 109.68 \"\n\nTotal liquid capacity A. plus B. = 190.32 Cubic Feet\n\nChamber (A) ..................\nChamber (A), receiving sewage only, with a total fluid content of 80.64 cu. ft., less 37.0 cu. ft., which would be occupied by sludge at a depth of not to exceed six (6) inches, would accommodate \\(\\frac{80.64 - 37.0}{12} = 4.47\\) approximately eighteen (18) persons.\n\nChamber (B), receives the overflow from chamber (A) and also the laundry water through a separate inflow pipe. The fluid content of this chamber below its outflow elevation is 109.38 cu. ft. Assuming a depth of sludge not exceeding 6 inches would give a liquid volume in this chamber of \\(109.38 - 37.45 = 71.93\\) cu. ft., or sufficient to care for twenty-seven (27) persons if no laundry waste entered the chamber. The total carrying capacity of the two chambers would therefore be between eighteen (18) and forty-five (45) persons depending upon the chemical contents of the laundry wastes.\n\nI consider that with cleaning often enough to keep sludge depth less than 6 or 8 inches, this tank will give satisfactory service so long as the hospital population is not increased by enlargement of the building or the addition of more beds.\n\n**MAIN SEWER LINE:**\n\nOn August 26th the water surface of Little Playgreen Lake had receded so that the outlet of the main sewer was over 100 feet from the water's edge. According to advice recently received in connection with the extension of the intake of the water system further out into the lake\u2014it may be possible that the distance between the end of the sewer and the water surface is much more than the distance noted on August 26th, 1940. Pipe will be required to extend the sewer to the lake. I will advise you\u2014in more detail\u2014of the estimated cost of this item as soon as I have more definite information as to position of lake high water level.\n\nA four inch diameter sewer line some 700 feet long, should be laid from the main school building to point just below the outlet of the main septic tank, for the purpose of by-passing laundry and kitchen waste.\n\nThis line, and the extension of the main sewer an estimated 500 feet is estimated to cost approximately $1,200.00, made up as follows:\n\n- 700 linear feet of 4\" Sewer Tile @ 40\u00a2 per ft. ..... $280.00\n- 5 Seams cement ........................................... 7.00\n- 2 - 4\" Yyes .................................................. 2.40\n- 1 - 2\" thread to 4\" soil pipe (2) ......................... 2.00\n- 1 - 6\" x 4\" Y .................................................. 1.70\n- 1 - Manhole cover ............................................ 17.25\n- 300 - ft (linear) 6\" Sewer pipe .......................... 120.00\n- 1 - Bale calcium .............................................. 7.00\n- 100 - ft. 4\" soil pipe ....................................... 50.00\n- Drainage fittings ............................................. 25.00\n- Labour .......................................................... 500.00\n- Timber, Nails, Freight, Incidentals ....................... 178.56\n\n$1,200.00\n\nSummary of Costs .................\nSUMMARY OF COSTS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF\nNEWEST HOUSE PLUMBING SYSTEM.\n\nReplace present school septic tank $1500.00 to $1500.00\nExtend main sewer and construct\nlaundry waste by-pass line 1500.00 to 1500.00\n\nTOTAL COST (est.) $2400.00 and $3000.00\n\ndepending on material, prices, labour, transportation, etc., when work is done.\n\nThe above improvements to the sewage system should be made during July and August 1941, provided that funds are available for the purpose, as the present septic tank for the main school is too small; the sewage outlet above the water line of the lake creates an unsightly and disagreeable smelling nuisance and the laundry waste, which is quite voluminous in such a large school, should be by-passed.\n\nW.H. Fulton\nArchitect Engineer.\n1st February, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal, Norway House.\n\nEnclosed for your information is a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated December 11th, to which is attached a copy of a report from Mr. Snelson, dated December 3rd, relative to the above. You will note Mr. Mills recommends the enlargement of the concrete septic tank at the school, the laying of 700 feet of 4-inch line to by-pass kitchen and laundry wastes from the school around the septic tank and the extension of the main sewer line about 300 feet. The estimated cost of the work is $3,300.\n\nSubject to your concurrence and to the necessary funds being available next year, it is considered the Engineer's recommendations in this matter should be adopted.\n\nYou will note that if the work is to be proceeded with next year it should be carried out during July and August when the school is not in operation.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 7, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of February 1 enclosing report of your engineer on the sewage disposal system at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the cost of the improvements suggested by the engineer is estimated at $3,300.00. At the present time I am unable to see any prospect of including this amount of money in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1941-42.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Rev.

I therefore advised him to return the invoice to the Company with an explanation. This he did. He has now advised me that he came across the refills in question a few days ago, in the school ice house, where someone had put them for some unexplained reason.\n\nThe Principal is therefore writing again to the Pyrene Manufacturing Company in the matter, and asking them to return the invoice.

If repairs are not kept up year by year the building soon goes hopelessly back and requires twice the expense to put in shape again.\n\nThe building is now in bad need of paint. When it was painted in 1936 it had stood I do not know how many years since its last painting. The one coat of paint, which was all that was put on in 1936, made little protective coating as it so went into the wood. It ought to have been done this year but had to be held over. If it is left longer than next year even a two coat job will not put it in proper shape again.\n\nPlumbing equipment and repair parts are an essential to be kept on hand. After navigation stops there is no way of getting in such except by plane at 20\u00a2 per pound. So we must have enough parts on hand to meet all needs that might arise during the year.\n\nThe laundry is one place the Doctor is constantly checking to watch the health of the girls working there. An electric ironer would lighten their burden immensely.\n\nThe fire equipment speaks for itself.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the same time he forwarded a letter from Rev. Mr. Chapin stating that the building was badly in need of paint as it had been last painted in 1936.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation it was found possible to provide an amount of $2150.00 for painting the building and any other repairs and new equipment that might be urgently required.\n\nBefore ordering the supplies requested on the requisition forwarded with your recent letter it would be appreciated if you would discuss with the present Principal of the Norway House School how he considers the money provided in the current year's appropriation should be expended. As you are aware, the price of paint has increased considerably in the last few months and as a result the amount provided for painting may not be sufficient to do the whole building. It is felt, however, that the buildings at the Norway House School requiring paint most urgently should receive attention this year.\n\nMr. C.N.C. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nAs soon as you have had a chance to discuss the matter with the Principal you should report fully for our consideration. It should be definitely understood that the amount provided, namely, $150.00, cannot be exceeded.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, July 10, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of May 20, referring to the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements and for new equipment at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nSince that letter was written, department officials have been giving consideration to certain improvements that apparently must receive first consideration, and as a consequence the amount provided in the current year's appropriation will be fully required. I refer in this regard to the following:\n\n1. Repairs and improvements to the water intake.\n\nThis will involve a very heavy expenditure, and it has been decided that of the total amount required $1,500 will be taken from the appropriation for Indian Education.\n\n2. Provision of a new refrigerating plant, to be used jointly by the school and hospital.\n\n$800 will be required from the appropriation for Indian Education as our share of this work.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would show this letter to the Principal of the Norway House School immediately, in order that he may be aware of the reasons for not supplying the articles requested by the former Principal, Mr. Chapin.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. C.N.C. Roberta,\nActing Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nJuly 25, 1941.\n\nMemorandum: The Director\nSurveys and Engineering\nBranch.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Snellson's report of December 3rd last and Mr. Miller's memorandum on the subject of the sewage disposal system at Norway House, Man., it would appear to be advisable to give consideration to the carrying out of whatever work the engineers of your branch deem advisable at the present time, having in mind the existing conditions with respect to the low level of the water in Playgreen Lake and the Jack River.\n\nI should, therefore, appreciate it if you would place the matter before the Minister's office with a view to having the necessary work carried out at the same time that the blasting of the channel for the water intake pipe is undertaken.\n\nI understand that it has been decided, more or less definitely, to blast a channel into which to lower the water intake pipe and that your branch is, at present, trying to locate a man familiar with this kind of work. I also understand that this channel will only be wide enough for the pipe line and will not serve for purposes of navigation.\n\nYou are aware, I believe, of the difficulty that this branch is experiencing in finding funds for the work and I would suggest that you recommend to the Minister's office the carrying out of such work as is considered advisable and necessary to ensure the pipe line against freezing and the school, hospital and agency against the nuisance of exposed sewage and possible contamination of the water.\n\nIf you will advise me the total amount of funds required to carry out the work to be done in connection with both the water supply and sewage disposal, I shall arrange the transfer of the funds.\n\nDirector.\n\nM.W.\nNorway House Indian Residential School\n\nREV. R. T. CHAPIN, B.A.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nNORWAY HOUSE, MAN.\nJuly 17th 1941.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey\nSupt., of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been advised in a letter from Mr. Phelin, through the Norway House Indian Agency, of the complete withdrawal of the current year's appropriation for the repair of this school, and the diversion of the funds to the repair of the water intake to the sum of $1500.00 and the installation of a refrigerator plant (mainly for the benefit of the hospital) to the sum of $800.00.\n\nI have replied to Mr. Phelin's letter direct, protesting against this complete withdrawal of funds from the school to purposes which could and should have been estimated for separately by the Agency. It is impossible to provide repairs to the school out of current revenue, curtailed as it is at a time when commodity prices are considerably increased. There is every indication of a lack of economy in thus foregoing the necessary upkeep of the school buildings.\n\nAs to the levy on the school of the major part of the refrigeration plant: I have already planned to co-operate with the hospital as much as lies in the power of the school with a view to the better and more economic operations of the hospital. To this end, I am now supplying all the milk that the hospital requires for between thirty and forty patients and I have arranged to pasture and stall-feed sufficient beef to provide the hospital with meat. I also plan, when sufficient labour can be obtained, to provide poultry and eggs. To assist in this co-operation, I fully agree that a refrigerating plant was an asset to the hospital, but certainly the cost of the plant should be charged to the Medical Services and not react as a penalty against the school, when the school is making unusual effort to assist the hospital.\n\nIt would seem that in any attempt at co-operation between the school and the other units of Indian Administration, the school is placed in a position of disadvantage. I am fully in accord with every form of co-operation, but I feel that there should be more of equity in the arrangements. The matter of the cost of pipe line repairs and the refrigerator is a case in point. I feel it may be opportune at this time to refer to other matters that are obviously inequitable. There is the matter of the proportionate cost of electric power as between the school, the hospital, and the Agency and Doctor's residences.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs the proportion is now, the school is charged with 60% of the cost of operation of the plant, the Hospital 25% and the Agency and Drs Residence 15%. I understand that some adjustment was in process of being made whereby the Department would take over our engineer and assess us one half of the operating cost, presumably $2000.00 a year. However, no indication has been given that this new arrangement will soon be put into effect.\n\nAs matters stand now, in addition to the school being charged 60% of the operating cost, the services of Mr. Stevenson, engineer under school salary, have been required in the care of the lighting plant and repair of the water line to the extent of 46 full days between September and the 1st March. He has been occupied similarly since. All this the school has paid for. Also the school is paying the full salary of one of the engineers in charge of the plant.\n\nThis situation was acceptable as a temporary arrangement pending the proposed adjustment, but the inequality of the situation does not rest there. I do not know what the relative consumption of electric power between the different units was at the time of the change being suggested, but the present situation is that the Hospital has electrical apparatus using a capacity of some 18000 watts, the school machinery capacity is only about 4000 watts. Included in the hospital amount is a dryer, using 8000 watts, which has not yet been in use. Further, the lighting units in the hospital and the Agency and Drs residence consist of lamps of 100 watts and more, whereas the lamps in the school range from 25 to 60 watts.\n\nObviously it is impossible to determine the relative consumption of power by the capacity of the machinery installed, as none of the machinery is in regular use, but it is quite evident that the hospital uses at least as much power as the school and yet the hospital is charged with 25% of the cost and the school 60%.\n\nI would suggest that the only equitable way of determining the consumption would be to install meters indicating the consumption of each unit; the school, the hospital and the residences. The installation of the meters would not be expensive, and on their reading the proportionate rate could be struck. I think this would only be fair.\n\nI trust that this matter will be given consideration and that action will be soon taken to remove this considerable burden from the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: 1941 Appropriation.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter to the Acting Indian Agent at Norway House, dated July 10th, referring to the proposed withdrawal of the whole of the amount already appropriated for repairs to this school during the current year, has been handed to me. I note that $1500.00 of our appropriation is to be diverted to the repair of the water intake, and $800.00 towards the installation of a refrigerating plant to be used jointly by the school and the hospital.\n\nMay I request that this matter be reconsidered by the Department officials, primarily on the grounds that the granting of the funds for the repair and upkeep of the school buildings is a matter of Department economy. Neglect to repair and upkeep may well mean the deterioration of the buildings and equipment to a point where repair may be no longer feasible, or, at least, much more expensive. Being well aware of the necessity for stringent economy during our war effort, the estimates were kept strictly within the bounds of absolute necessity.\n\nI wish it further noted that no amounts were placed in the estimates of the school for the purposes to which it is now proposed to divert our whole appropriation. The matter of the repair to the water intake is recognised as a necessity, and, in fact, was so recognised in plenty of time to have had the item included in the estimates for the current year. However, this matter has been considered one for Agency estimate only, particularly when applied to pipeline construction on Agency property and before it comes on school property. Had it been recognised that the expense of this repair, or any part of it, was chargeable to school appropriation, provision could have been made for this in the school estimates over and above the repairs to the school. As it appears to me, this diversion of such a large amount from our school appropriation, given precedence over all the items in our school estimate, entirely without the previous knowledge or consent of the school, to a purpose for which the school had not the privilege of estimating, would seem to be quite unfair.\n\nIt would also appear that this diversion of appropriation falls more heavily on the school, by reason of the withdrawal of all estimate funds, than it does on the other Department units making equal use of the water supply. It should be considered further that the school has been undertaking much more than its rightful share in the upkeep of the water system. In addition to the payment of 60% of the operating cost, we are paying the entire wages of one on the engineers at the plant, and Mr. Stevenson, the school...\nMr. Phelin, (2)\n\n[Redacted] has been giving a great deal of his time (while on school salary) to the repair and upkeep of the water and light plant. The total extent of his labour may be estimated from the fact that, from September last until March, he spent 46 full days working entirely on the plant and water intake. More of his time has been spent similarly since then. No consideration has been given the school for this contribution.\n\nAs to the installation of a refrigerating plant. It is conceded that this plant would be a decided asset and economy to the hospital. When the matter was first mentioned to me, I consumed in the appreciation of its value, especially as it had been suggested that the school undertake the supply of meat and milk to the hospital. This I am making plans to do, and, in fact, the milk is already being supplied. Obviously the refrigerating plant would be an asset here.\n\nMay I point out however, that the benefit of the plant would accrue almost entirely to the hospital. The school has its own ice house and cooler and much of our summer meat is put up in sealers in the Spring. It was certainly never anticipated in by me, or ever anticipated, that a sum of $800.00 would be arbitrarily taken from our approved repair appropriation for the purpose of building a refrigerator for the main use of the hospital. If this refrigerator is considered a necessity to the hospital, as it is in my opinion, then the full cost of the plant should be charged to the Medical Services. I wish to protest strongly against any part of the expenditure being so diverted from school appropriation.\n\nI trust that the whole matter of the withdrawal of the whole of the school appropriation be reconsidered in view of the above aspect of the matter, and that the pared estimates submitted by the school, in conformity with the amount of appropriation approved, will be available for school purposes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nNorway House, Man.,\nJuly 19, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attached requisitions have been submitted by Mr. Caldwell, Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, re repairs for the school.\n\nNotwithstanding Mr. Phelan's letter of the 10th inst., file 123-5-5, with respect to curtailment of the appropriation for Indian Education, I would recommend that these requisitions be given consideration. The repairs are urgently required -- and Mr. Caldwell informs me this material is much more necessary to the school than a refrigeration plant. He requests that the $800.00 earmarked as the school's share in the refrigeration plant be diverted toward the purchase of building repairs.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nG.

Mr. Phelan has also received your letter of the same date to him.\n\nI have carefully noted the contents of your letter, and I can assure you that every endeavour is being made to properly adjust the cost of electric power as between the school, the hospital and the agency and doctor's residence.\n\nIt has further been decided not to proceed with the proposed plans for new refrigeration installation.\n\nIt is only fair to departmental officials for me to point out that even though funds are provided for a specific purpose at a residential school, it is often found necessary to divert them to other more pressing matters. For instance, at the time the estimates for the current fiscal year were prepared we had no information indicating that heavy expenditures would be necessary in order to secure good water and sewage facilities. I know you will agree with me that when either water or sewage systems go out of order it is absolutely necessary to make repairs that are required. On the other hand, the amount of money available at the present time is strictly limited, and we cannot expend at any one school more than is actually provided for that school. I fully realize that principals of Indian residential schools have many serious problems to deal with at this time. I can assure you that departmental officials have these problems too, and we endeavour to handle them in the best interests of all parties concerned.\n\nIn view of the decision not to proceed with the refrigeration unit, it will be possible to supply most of the articles requested on your requisition, which Acting Indian Agent Roberts has forwarded under cover of his letter of July 19.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Rosey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. A. E. Caldwell,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nCOPY SENT TO Mr. C.N.C.

Hoey,\nSupt of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of the 31st July, advising me that the amount withdrawn from our school appropriation for the purpose of installing a refrigerating plant has been restored and that the items in the estimate submitted will probably be supplied.\n\nI am well aware of the necessity of repairing the water line before the winter and understand the expediency which made the withdrawal of a part of our appropriation for this purpose. I did not expect that the amount withdrawn for this purpose would be restored.\n\nI would be glad to be instructed, however, as to the method of estimating for the upkeep of these common utilities. Should the estimating be left entirely to the Agency, or should the school estimate to the extent of our interest in the operating expense? I have already placed the estimates for next year in the hands of the Agent and I have, as a precaution, made provision for such expense in the upkeep of the utilities commonly used by the Agency, the hospital and the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** The Jo H Ashdown Hardware Co.

(RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nJanuary 14, 1942.\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of September 5, 1940, and my reply of November 5 of the same year with reference to the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nOwing to conditions of which you are no doubt aware it has been found necessary, within the last year, to install what we consider is a very modern power plant furnishing light and power to all Departmental buildings at Norway House.\n\nAs you are aware, we have been deducting a portion of the cost of the gasoline and oil from the per capita grant but at a conference of Departmental officials yesterday it was decided that a new proposition should be submitted to you. Our proposal is as follows:\n\n1. The Department will be responsible for the cost of all the operation of the new power plant and in addition will pay Mr. Stevenson a salary of $1500.00 a year to superintend the plant. His employment is on the distinct understanding that he will devote his full time to the supervision of the plant.\n\n2. As its share of the cost of the operation of this plant we request the Norway House Indian Residential School to pay the salaries of Mr. Ross and Mr. Duncan. I understand that this\n\nRev. R.H. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\ninvolves an expenditure of approximately $960.00. The services of these two men will be required almost continuously to assist Mr. Stevenson. In addition, of course, you would have to hire another man to replace Mr. Stevenson in view of the fact that his time would be fully devoted to the power plant.\n\nWe have carefully considered the above proposals and as far as this Branch is concerned the acceptance of them by you would facilitate our bookkeeping and, what is more important, would, we believe, supply the Norway House Residential School with water and light at a reasonable cost.\n\nWe have already secured the necessary authority for the employment of Mr. Stevenson from December 1, 1941, at the salary stated above, and I should appreciate receiving your concurrence in the above arrangement at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nJanuary 16th,\n\nMy dear Dr. McGill:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 14th, submitting a new proposition in regard to the cost of the power plant furnishing light and heat at Norway House.\n\nBefore giving you a final answer to your proposition, I should like, of course, to have the opportunity of consulting the Principal in regard to the matter. I am sending him an air mail letter today and ought to have his reply very shortly. On its receipt, I will write you again.\n\nHowever, there is one part of the proposal to which I should like to refer now: Clause 2 suggests that the Norway House Indian School should pay the salaries of Mr. Ross and Mr. Duncan. My colleagues and I feel that the suggestion should be - not that we pay the salaries of two particular men, but that the School pay the salaries of the two men required to assist Mr. Stevenson - whoever they may be. Perhaps this is what you meant; but as the suggestion is worded now, it seems to tie us up to the two men who are at present doing the work. I should be glad if you would make this point clear.\n\nThanking you for giving further consideration to this rather troublesome matter and promising that we will give very serious consideration to your proposal,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\nOttawa,\nJanuary 22, 1948.\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nI have your letter of January 16 in connection with the cost of the plant furnishing light and power at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter, I may say that our letter was intended to refer to positions rather than individuals. The only reason we mentioned Messrs. Ross and Duncan was due to the fact that we had been informed that these two men were at present employed and were fully conversant with the duties that they would be required to perform.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nRev. R.B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nJanuary 23rd,\n1942.\n\nHarold W. McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Dr. McGill:\n\nRe - Norway House Residential School (Your File 123-5-5)\n\nI have your letter of January 22nd, which clarifies the second proposal as set out in your letter of January 14th, with regard to the payment by the School of the salaries of the two men required to assist Mr. Stevenson in the operation of the power plant. We thought that this was probably what was intended, but wanted to be quite clear about the matter.

(RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThere are, however, some things in connection with this new proposal which will require adjustment. First, there is the financial adjustment. The school has already paid for its share of the fuel and lubricating oils now on hand, a quantity sufficient to run the plant for several months. Obviously, the school should be credited with the money which it has invested in the fuel stock on hand at the time of the coming into effect of the new arrangement.\n\nSecond: Mr. Stevenson's appointment is from December 1st, 1941. I take it, therefore, that the school is expected to assume the wages of the engineer assistants from the same date. The 'cut-off' of the old agreement, then, would be December 1st. I am attaching the figures connected with this 'cut-off', showing the school to have the sum of $424.27 invested in the fuel stock on hand for the operation of the power plant at December 1st. In addition to this, there is the refund on empty drums, for which $354.00 was deducted from our June, 1941, grant, and $115.00 was (presumably) deducted from our September, 1941, grant, making a total refund on drums of $499.20. The total sum due the school for fuel on hand and empty drums is thus $923.47.\n\nThird: There is need for further definite arrangement regarding the engagement of the two assistant engineers. I have discussed the proposed new terms with Mr. Lazenby, the Indian Agent, and I agree with him that employer authority over these two men should be vested in the Indian Agent. It would seem that the new proposal made by the Department arose out of either Government reluctance, or inability, to establish Civil Service positions for the two assistant engineers. Nevertheless, the time of these men should be entirely at the disposal of the power plant. I do not want them as school employees, as this would afford us no advantage, but it would be a decided advantage to the Indian Agency to have authority over these two employees. This need not necessarily indicate any change in the arrangement now proposed by the Department. All that would be necessary is for the Department to advise the Indian Agent that these two men would be under his authority (or Mr. Stevenson's, if preferable). I would pay the wages of these two men to the Agent and he would pay the men; there would be no need for them to be designated as Department employees and their wages need not be entered in the Agency books. Can this be arranged with the Department?\n\nLastly: There is the matter of the engineer's residence. It is conceded that a new residence is necessary. It was agreed that the school would give what assistance it could in the building of a new house, on school property. Thus we have on hand a supply of sawn lumber, about 4000 feet, sawn by Mr. Stevenson at the school, during school time. Also we can supply most of the labour, without expense to the school. Further than this I have made no agreement. Mr. Stevenson has been making plans to get\nthe residence started next spring. I had placed in the 1942 estimates a sum of $1000.00 for assistance in building this engineer's residence. All this was feasible under the last agreement with the Department, where the services of the engineer would be available for the school. Now the situation has changed. Mr. Stevenson has been given a salary of $1500.00 a year instead of the expected $1200.00. He is an exclusive employee of the Department. (It is intimated in Dr. McGill's letter that the school would have to engage another man in Mr. Stevenson's place). Any residence built for the engineer should now be built on Government property (Agency), and with an 'administration' appropriation - not 'educational', - particularly as the letter notifying the Indian Agent of Mr. Stevenson's appointment states that the remuneration for the position of engineer had been set at $1500.00 a year with house, power and water. No mention is made in this letter of any obligation assumed, or to be assumed, by the school, in the matter of the supply of a residence.\n\nJust what is the position now? I am still willing to use the material which has been accumulated for the purpose of building this residence, and also to supply our own labour, but this could only be on condition that the building be built on school property and become the property of the school. In these circumstances, also, as is at present understood, the school could not undertake the building of this residence unless appropriation was made by the Department for such material for the house as the school could not provide without expense.\n\nSome suggestion was made last year by the Secretary of the Department that the school should provide the residence. What would we provide it with? The school is not obligated to provide buildings, equipment or repairs out of the per capita grant. All this expense is normally the responsibility of the Department. The per capita grant is, I understand, simply for operating expense. The suggestion that the school build the residence, therefore, just does not make sense. As I have said, I see no objection to the school providing labour and home-produced material for the building, but we certainly cannot undertake any money expense in connection with it.\n\nHowever, if the position of engineer has been created and the terms of the appointment are that the engineer should receive a salary with a house provided, surely that obligates the Department to providing the house. According to the previous plans, the Department was evidently looking to the school to at least give assistance in the building of the residence, and this the school was prepared to do. Does the Department regard this arrangement as continuing under the new plan for payment of power costs? This point might be cleared up, and Mr. Stevenson advised of the Department's definite intention regarding the providing of a residence. Mr. Stevenson states that it will be impossible to use his present house another winter. Although, as a business matter, I feel that this now does not concern the school, yet this fact should be known and appreciated by the Department, in the interests of the comfort of their engineer.\"\nStatement in connection with the proposed agreement with the Department whereby the school assumes responsibility for the salaries of two assistant engineers, as payments for power, light and water supplied to the School, as from December 1st, 1941.\n\n***************\n\nStock of fuel and lubricating/on hand at the Power plant, Dec. 1st, 1941, 60% of the cost of which has been paid by the School:\n\n76 drums (3420 galls) Fuel Oil @ 13.8\u00a2 ............... $471.96\n47 Galls Lubricating Oil @ 58\u00a2 gal. .................. 27.26\n\nFreight on above to Norway House:\n34650 lbs @ 50\u00a2 per 100 lb ......................... 207.90\n\n$707.12\n\n60% of above charged to school ..................... $424.27\n\nRefund on empty drums, charged June qtr. .......... $384.00\n\" \" \" \" \" Sept. \" .................................. 115.20\n\nTotal amount to be refunded ....... $923.27\n\nAmount of Fuel and Lubricating Oil on hand December 1st 1941, verified by:\n\n\"R.

I now have a letter from Mr. Caldwell, the Principal, and he is fully in agreement with the proposal made by your Department. Mr. Caldwell, however, mentions certain things in connection with the new proposal which require some adjustment. I think the best thing for me to do is to send you an extract from his letter.\n\nAs soon as these matters, to which Mr. Caldwell refers, are cleared up, I will be very glad to write you again, finally accepting the proposal which the Department has made. I hope that there will be no difficulty in meeting Mr. Caldwell's suggestions. It looks to me as if they are all reasonable. I shall be glad to hear from you at the earliest possible date, so that we can get the matter finally settled.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC.MLT\n\nEnc.\nFebruary 17, 1942.\n\nDear Dr. Gaskins,\n\nRe: Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th of February and extract from Mr. Caldwell's letter to you regarding the light and power plant at Norway House, and particularly the construction of the residence required for Mr. Stevenson, who has been appointed as Electric Power Plant Operator.\n\nWith regard to the question of paying the school for the investment made in fuel, oil, etc., on hand as of December 1st, I agree that the department should refund to the school the amount of their investment, and I intend having the figures shown on the statement attached to Mr. Caldwell's letter checked after which a refund will be made.\n\nThe suggestion that the Day and Night Operators of the Plant be placed under the control of the Indian Agent and be made directly responsible to the Plant Operator, their time to be entirely at our disposal and payment of their salary made to the Indian Agent, meets with approval, and I shall make the necessary arrangements with the Indian Agent to this effect.\n\nThe only point on which I am not in complete agreement with Mr. Caldwell is the question of the residence for Mr. Stevenson. The school indicated on several occasions either directly or through the Indian Agent its willingness to co-operate in the construction of the residence by furnishing home-produced materials, providing the department would appropriate a sufficient sum for the purchase of materials and equipment which could not be obtained at Norway House. An official of the department is to visit Norway House during the month of March, and I am asking him to discuss the question more fully with\nthe Principal and the Indian Agent, as it would not appear to be desirable to have the residence erected on school property and become the property of the school, when the department has a certain investment in the building.\n\nWe have, I might add, met the school's request to provide a sum of $1,000 for the finishing of the residence, on the understanding that the school would fulfil its agreement, but we were not able to make provision for the complete construction of a new building owing to the need for economy and for the reason that we expected the school's co-operation.\n\nI shall write you at a later date when I receive the report of the official of this branch upon his return from Norway House.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nRev.

CALDWELL\nPRINCIPAL\n\nNORWAY HOUSE, MAN.\nFebruary 2nd 1942.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt., of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Lumber costs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen Mr. Atkinson, Government engineer, was here repairing the water pipe line, he required a quantity of lumber. The school had lumber on hand which had been sawn from logs and which was seasoning for school building purposes. Mr. Atkinson was permitted to use some of this lumber with the proviso that an equal quantity be returned to the school next spring. This Mr. Atkinson agreed to recognizing that lumber which we might saw this winter to replace that which he had taken would not be sufficiently dry for use before next fall.\n\nI was surprised therefore to receive a letter from Mr. Atkinson dated Dec. 2nd, in which he said that he had issued account to the Department for the lumber, 1119 feet, at a price of $20.00 per thousand feet. In the same mail, also, I received a cheque from the Department for $22.38 in payment for the lumber.\n\nTo replace this lumber with dry lumber from the City would cost the school in the neighbourhood of $50.00 per thousand, plus $12.50 freight. I doubt whether the school could produce this lumber for $20.00 per thousand, considering permits, labour and other costs. However, our particular grievance is that we had sawn this lumber so that we would have it on hand, dry, next spring, and ready to use. It is true that the lumber supplied to Mr. Atkinson was not edged, but the measurement was liberally figured as though it had been edged.\n\nCould I trouble you to refer this to the official to which it pertains, with a request for adjustment? As you know, the school took its share in the work of repair of the pipe line in the withdrawal of its appropriation.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 21, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI attach, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School. As the transaction to which he refers was carried out by one of your engineers, I should appreciate your replying to Mr. Caldwell. At that time you might let me have a copy of your reply for our records.\n\nDirector.\nMarch 7, 1942.\n\nThe Chief Treasury Officer.\n\nRe: Norway House Light and Power Plant.\n\nYou will recall the decision made to have the light and power plant expenses provided for under one vote, and have an engineer appointed to have complete charge of the plant, direct the men employed as Day and Night Operators, and be responsible for everything in connection with the operation, maintenance and repair of the plant as well as other machinery at Norway House.\n\nYou will also recall that it was decided to assess the Residential School $2,000.00 a year for the light and power used, based on the assumption that the school used 60% of the power generated by the plant, this sum to be deducted from the school's per capita grant.\n\nAs you know Mr. Stevenson was appointed to the position of Light and Power Plant Operator on December 1st, 1941, and the proper time, therefore, to commence the new arrangements regarding the operation of the plant was, therefore, December 1st. In discussing the question with you, I understand, you pointed out that the vote bearing the expenses of the plant could not be credited with the sum paid by the school, and it was therefore decided to secure approval for a change in the proposed arrangement and ask the school to pay the expenses of the Day and Night Operators' salaries. Approval for this has been secured, and the school authorities have agreed to the arrangement.\n\nIf the expenses of the plant are to be assumed by the department, as of December 1st, 1941, the date of Mr. Stevenson's appointment, it would appear necessary to reimburse the school for any expenditures they have made for purchase of fuel oil, etc., and I would ask for your opinion of the statement attached to letter of February 9th from Rev. Dr. Cochrane, prepared by Mr. Caldwell, wherein the school claim that they should be reimbursed for the portion of the stock of fuel oil, etc. on hand as of Dec. 1st, 1941, 60% of the cost of which was charged to the school. The statement also contains a claim for refund on empty drums charged to the school in their June and September quarters.\n\nI believe that it is only fair and reasonable that we should refund to the school the sum of $424.27 for the 60% of the cost of the fuel oil, etc., but I am doubtful as to how much refund on the empty drums they should be credited with, and would appreciate your advice.\n\nM.W.

We have therefore allowed credit at the rate of 15.8\u00a2 on 1058 gals (50 drums) and on the balance of 372 gals at the rate of 12.6\u00a2, the rate paid for the oil.\n\nThe cheque is issued in favour of the Treasurer of the United Church of Canada, and I have written to Indian Agent Laseley asking him to advise Mr. Caldwell that the school is being reimbursed in the amount of $909.36.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nRev.

A cheque for this amount is being forwarded for deposit to the School account. We are also sending Mr. Caldwell a copy of your letter, so that he may know the reason for the slight difference of $14.11 as between the amount paid by the Department and the statement which he forwarded.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCopy for the information of - Dr. McGill\n\n28th March, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of February 2nd addressed to Mr. R.A. Hoey, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, relative to lumber used last October in connection with installing a new water main at Norway House, has been referred to me by the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIt is noted you state that to replace this lumber with dry lumber from the city would cost the school in the neighbourhood of $50 per M. plus $12.50 freight, whereas you have been allowed to date only $20 per M.\n\nThe matter has been taken up with Mr. Atkinson who was in charge of installing the new water main at Norway House and who has advised that the lumber taken by him was of the roughest possible kind and would cost about $20 per M. at the most which is the rate at which you have already been paid for it. However, he suggests that some further allowance be made the school for this lumber but that the rate should not exceed $40 per M. plus freight.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances we are prepared to concur in Mr. Atkinson's suggestion and to pay for the lumber used, 1119 F.B.M. at a rate of $40 per M. plus $12.50 per M. freight. This would amount to $58.75 and deducting the $22.38 already sent you would leave a balance in your favour of $36.37. Cheques in your favour for $31.44 and $4.93 are therefore enclosed.\n\nWe trust that you will consider the foregoing satisfactory adjustment in this matter.\n\nA.E. Caldwell, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nNorway House Indian Residential School,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector,\nMarch 17, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Norway House\n\nIn reference to your notation on Dr. McGill's memorandum of February 21st last with enclosure, regarding payment for or replacement of lumber obtained by Mr. Atkinson from Principal Caldwell, the matter was referred to Mr. Atkinson who has replied under date of the 12th instant as follows:\n\n\"Regarding the above matter I would suggest that a further allowance be made the School. I do not however consider that the amount allowed should be more than $40.00 per M. The lumber taken by me was of the roughest possible kind, and would cost about $20.00 per M. at the most. There is of course the consideration of getting the material up to Norway House by boat which according to Mr. Caldwell amounts to about $25.00 per M. Under the circumstances I would therefore allow at the rate of $52.50 per M. less of course the amount already paid.\"\n\nWe concur in Mr. Atkinson's suggestion and recommend that a cheque for $56.37, the balance due on 1119 F.B.M. at the rate of $52.50 per M. be issued to Mr. Caldwell in settlement of the account. This payment might be charged to Vote 73-60-982.\n\nMr. Atkinson has requested that the following items be shipped to Norway House:\n\nEnd for Pump Cylinder #3131, for Myers Lowdown Pump,\n2 - L.H. Shovel Handles,\n1 - Pick handle.\n\nWe have no information regarding these items and would suggest that this request be brought to the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

A copy of my letter, dated March 28th, is enclosed for your information.\n\nIn order to pay Mr. Caldwell $36.37 in adjusting this matter we are charging $31.44 to Establishment 73-60-962 and $4.93 to Establishment 76-60-581 and trust that this action will meet with your approval.\n\nYour attention is particularly drawn to that part of Mr. Mills' memorandum in which he states that Mr. Atkinson has requested that certain parts and tools be shipped to Norway House.\n\nDirector.\n7th April, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Director\nSurveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nI have your memorandum of the 25th of March and copy of Mr. Mills' memorandum and letter being sent to Mr. Caldwell, Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, regarding the price to be paid for the lumber taken by Mr. Atkinson when he was installing the new water main at Norway House.\n\nI note that Mr. Atkinson has recommended the purchase of a few items of equipment for Norway House, and consideration is being given to his recommendation.\n\nThe price which Mr. Atkinson suggested be paid for the lumber appears to be fair and reasonable.\n\nDirector.\n\nM.W.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Mr. Goldsworthy, Principal.\n\n**ADDRESS:** Indian Residential School, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\n**1942**\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Apr 1 | For Allowance for Eight Students at Norway House | $40.00 |\n\n---\n\n**I HEREBY CERTIFY** that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n**FORM No. I.A. 506**\n\n**VOUCHER NO.:**\n\n**DATE:** 1st April 1942\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

As you know all such purchases have to be made through our Purchasing Branch and, in view of present conditions, it is extremely advisable that orders be placed at the earliest possible date. We have also available an amount of approximately $1000.00 for other repairs that might be necessary. You should confer with the Principal immediately and let me have detailed information regarding what is needed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nJune 2, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI note from your report dated April 15, covering the month of March, that logs were hauled sufficient to saw into 6,500 board feet of lumber, which is the amount of lumber required for the new refrigerating plant for the hospital and school. I also note that the saw mill was moved to its new site and from your report for April, that the foundations have been completed, the building moved, the saw bed and carriage track laid, and the ramp on which to haul the logs almost completed, and that you expected to begin to saw lumber by the middle of May.\n\nI should like to hear from you by return mail as to whether you were able to commence the sawing on the date mentioned and when the quantity required, namely 6,500' is available.\n\nI pointed out to you in a letter some weeks ago that it would be necessary to allow the lumber to season before commencing building operations and would suggest that the lumber be piled in such a manner so that it will season as quickly as possible. You might consult with Engineer Stevenson and let me know when you consider the lumber will be ready for building purposes.\n\nIf anything is required to keep the mill in operation I would suggest that you get in touch with the Department or Inspector Hamilton immediately by radio, as any delays will not give sufficient time for the lumber to season and the building to be erected and the machinery installed this year. I should like to have a full report from you at the earliest possible date.\n\nI might add that a suggestion was also made some time ago that the Indians take out a further supply of logs and saw them in order to have lumber on hand for this work or other work which may be required at the Agency.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nNorway House.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nOttawa,\nJuly 23, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of June 18, copy of which is enclosed. You must be aware of the difficulty in obtaining early deliveries of any materials at the present time and consequently we must have, immediately, explicit information regarding the materials required at the Norway House School, in order to make certain that we can have them delivered this summer. If it is not the intention of the Principal and yourself to ask for any expenditure at Norway House this year, please let me know.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 21, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Director\nSurveys and Engineering Branch\n\nYou will recall that last fall Engineer Atkinson went to Norway House and blasted a channel in which the pipeline was placed in order to ensure protection from frost and a satisfactory supply of the water for the buildings. I understand that the blasted trench was 5' deep and extended from the shoreline to a deep channel on a length of about 1800' and that at the shoreline he drove in sheath piling in a semi-circle for a distance of about 10', which piling projected out of the water a little over a foot.\n\nI understand also that from this sheath piling to the powerhouse on a distance of 200' he built a fill of earth approximately 6' deep and 12' wide and that mid-way in this fill he inserted a 4 foot square man hole.\n\nThis spring the water rose 4' and extended in on the sides of the fill and washed the fill away so that at the present time the sheath piling is covered with water and water now lies where the fill was. I also understand that our Engineer, Mr. Stevenson, was of the opinion at the time the work was being carried out that the sides of the fill should have been cribbed. This could not have been done in the spring when the water started to rise as the frost was still in the ground. It would appear that the possibility of a change in the water level was not realized when the job was carried out with the above results.\n\nOur Engineer, Mr. Stevenson, proposes to tongue and groove 2\" planks at the Agency saw-mill and drive these in, in the form of a sheath piling along the sides and end of the old fill, then fill this cribbing with dirt. He then proposes to tie the tops of the piles with squared logs thus making a water tight box into which no muskrats can get. The estimated cost of carrying\nout the work is $400, and as the season at Norway House is short we propose to authorize the carrying out of the work under the supervision of Mr. Stevenson and as outlined by him. We will, however, be very glad to receive any suggestions or recommendations your Branch wishes to make in the matter.\n\nDirector.\nJuly 21, 1942.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI have your letter of the 17th of June advising me that the temporary cribbing and filling covering the water intake pipe at Norway House which was put in place last fall by Engineer Atkinson has washed away owing to the higher water level.\n\nI also understand that in order to remedy this condition Mr. Stevenson recommends driving in tongued and grooved 2\" planks in the form of a sheath piling along the sides and end of the old fill, filling the cribbing with dirt and tying the piles together with squared logs in order to make a watertight box.\n\nWe have advised the Surveys and Engineering Branch of the work Mr. Stevenson proposes to carry out to correct the present condition and have informed them that we intend to authorize this work, but will welcome their suggestions and recommendations if they wish to make any. I note from your letter of June 17 that the estimated cost of the work is $400. This sum is being set aside and advanced to you in order that Mr. Stevenson may proceed with the work.\n\nIn order to keep the cost as low as possible it is thought that the school should furnish teams and men for the job. This would cut the cost of labour considerably, also that the Interpreter or one of the labourers on your staff should assist Mr. Stevenson in any team or saw-mill work and thus do away with the wages of one man. It should be possible for you to arrange with the Principal of the school to furnish teams and men for this job without cost to the Department and I should very much appreciate it if you would discuss the matter with Mr. Caldwell pointing out that the expenditure was unforeseen and consequently not provided for and the Department would be very grateful for their co-operation and assistance.\n\nIt should also be possible for you to assign the Interpreter to assist Mr. Stevenson in carrying out this very important work for the length of time that Mr. Stevenson will require his services.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. G. Lasenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House.\n\nT. R. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nJuly 21, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received a report that the work carried out last fall by Engineer Atkinson in connection with the laying of the water pipeline at Norway House in a channel has largely been destroyed owing to the raising of the water level.\n\nI am informed that it is necessary to have sheath piling built along the sides and end of the old fill in order to make a sort of watertight box.\n\nThis expenditure was not contemplated and therefore not provided for and owing to the very limited funds available it would be appreciated if the school could furnish teams and men to assist Mr. Stevenson in carrying out the necessary work. We are, I might add, arranging with Indian Agent Lazenny, to have one of the members of our staff, preferably the Interpreter give as much assistance to Mr. Stevenson as possible in order to save the wages of one man.\n\nWe would appreciate very much your co-operation in this matter in order to keep down the labour costs.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. A. B. Caldwell,\nPrincipal Norway House Indian Residential School,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Caldwell, Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, left with me the enclosed bill of material requesting I send the quotations to Ottawa.\n\nI asked for quotations from the following firms:\n\n- F.W.

From the quotations that you have forwarded it is evident that it will require more than $1000.00 for the material alone. I should appreciate it if you would ascertain if the school staff intend to do the work without cost to the Department. If not, please let me have an estimate of the cost of the labour.\n\nI should appreciate receiving your reply by August 8.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nNORWAY HOUSE, MAN.\nJuly 22nd, 1942.\n\nDr. P.E. Moore,\nActing Superintendent,\nof Indian Services,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nNotes on construction details & labour.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nOn checking over ground level of basement of engineers residence to be built, I find the sewer will be only 2 feet below the surface of the ground where it enters the house. The basement will have to go down four feet to be below frost line. The sewer will leave the building two feet above the basement floor. These measurements are based on a fall of 1 foot in 100 feet, for the sewer between my residence and Mr. Caldwell's residence.\n\nMr. Caldwell does not wish to have his lawn dug up to put the sewer in, and would rather have it connected in his basement. This is quite feasible but the sewer pipe is so close to the surface of his basement floor that the use of vitrified tile would make a lump on the floor at each joint. To overcome this I would suggest a length of 4 inch pipe (about 22 feet) carry the sewage across that floor.\n\nWhen you were here March 11th last Mr. Caldwell suggested a lath and plaster finish. I doubt if the house can be finished in time to get the plasterer home on the last boat. The cost of bringing in a plasterer will be high. And will it be possible to secure the services of a plasterer at this time? Failing a plasterer I would suggest returning these lath and getting pli-board or one of the better wallboards. I can put this on myself. It would require 104 pieces of 4 ft. by 8 ft. board.\n\nWith regard to the toilet for this house. If you will recall, the school was to supply the toilet out of its stock. At the present time they have used all their stock, and I understand the school requisition has not yet been handed into the Indian Dept. This means a toilet will have to be purchased either by the School or Indian department.\n\nThe labor situation, - I have built foundation and skidway for sawmill, moved sawmill building about fifty feet, set up sawmill, made temporary set-up of planer and edged all the lumber for engineers residence with but little help from one of the powerhouse operators. Occasionally help from the agency staff when there was an extra heavy log to put up. Is it not possible for me to have more help to push along the work?\nThere is gravel to be hauled for the foundation of the refrigerator.\n\nFoundation for same dug out & concrete run.\nRefrigerator constructed.\nRepairs to hospital roof.\nRebuilding of Agency root house.\nRebuilding of Agency dock.\nCribbing water intake.\nConstruction of engineer's residence.\nDigging out and relaying 50 ft. of sewer pipe between doctor's house and Agency residence (someone in the past layed 6 in. sewer from the doctor's residence, then contracted it to 4 inches half way to the Agency house. This has plugged and backed into the doctors basement over a period of time)\n\nWith these projects before us I would point out that the Indians leave for their winter trapline in the latter part of September. We must act quickly to get our work in hand by that date. I would suggest an immediate start on gravel for the refrigerator foundation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.L.Stevenson\nEngineer.\n\nP.S. Two men left this morning to get logs to rebuild roothouse.\n\nR.L.S.\nNORWAY HOUSE, MAN.\nJuly 22nd, 1942.\n\nDr. P.E. Moore,\nAct. Supt. of Medical Services,\nDept. of Mines and Natural Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nMr. Lazenby has gone on an extended Treaty trip inland. Mr. Caldwell has been absent from Norway House nearly three weeks and no work has been done on the engineers residence.\n\nTime flies. - I do not wish to remain in Norway House another winter and have to live in this old house.\n\nTo put on record what has transpired to date.\n\nIn the past money earned by me at odd jobs about this settlement together with that received from the Indian Affairs Branch for lumber used last fall by engineer Atkinson, was put into a trust fund in the School. To date the sum of some sixty eight dollars stands to this credit. This was to be used for the buying of necessities in the completion of the engineers house.\n\nWe were short of inch lumber to complete the engineers residence. On a co-operative basis I assisted the School farm manager for five days, June 23rd - to 26th, in getting out logs for school class rooms, and twenty logs I required. I also gave this time to instruct the farm operator in the operation of the boat engine and barge work. Mr. Caldwell was absent at this time but before leaving he instructed me to hire whatever men were necessary to get in the logs. One man was required. I turned this man's time in to Mr. Caldwell on his return June 26th. He informed me this man's wages would be charged against the above mentioned $8 dollars. Since the man was getting out school logs Caldwell finally paid the man. The gist of the conversation which followed was that I had $68. to pay for labor to build the engineers residence. I immediately took the matter up with Mr. Lazenby. Mr. Caldwell shortly followed to the Agent's office and after much talk declared he would resign before he would put a dollar into labor for building the house. He stamped out of the office at that but returned in a minute and said he had three men working for the school, who would work on the house July and August when they were not carrying out their routine duties.\n\nHe talked continuously of getting his classrooms built this summer. I pointed out that he could not build out of green lumber not yet sawn. Also that there were more projects up than\nwe were likely to get finished this fall. I mentioned also that if he would co-operate with us a bit we would get the engineers residence built, and his lumber sawn, planed and seasoned to build next spring. Mr. Caldwell seemed to think this a good idea. He left for Winnipeg shortly after, and although I have asked repeatedly for help the acting principal, Mr. King, always states that the men are fully occupied at the school.\n\nWe require, boat, barge, gasoline and help to get gravel for foundation.\n\nBasement excavated.\nSewer trench excavated.\nLumber moved to planer & from planer to site of building.\nErection of framework.\n\nFollowing erection of framework I can do most of the constructing providing I can get time from the numerous other projects that will be going forward.\n\nI am taking the liberty of addressing you on this subject, you being the only member of the Indian Affairs Branch that I have the honor of being acquainted with. Also because you are cognizant with what has gone before.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a few notes on details.\n\nThanking you for your co-operation and interest in the past,\n\nI am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.L. Stevenson.\nEngineer.\nNorway House, Manitoba\n17th July, 1942\n\nSir,\n\nI have just received in the mail a copy of Doctor Moore's letter No. 37123-1 dated July 6th and addressed to Mr. A. E. Caldwell, Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School in connection with my letter to the Department to the effect that Mr. Caldwell had refused to supply the labour for the erection of Mr. Stevenson's residence.\n\nIn connection with this matter, I beg to say that Mr. Caldwell has been away to Winnipeg for the past two weeks, and I have no idea when he will return. Also, I am leaving on my treaty trip in three days time and will not be back until the end of July. The season when building can be done is now half over and in the meantime nothing whatever has been done towards making a start for the building of Mr. Stevenson's residence.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

Hoey's letter of June 19th and Mr Phelan's letter of July 23rd, File 123-5-5, I beg to forward herewith in duplicate, a statement of the materials requested by the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, which he estimates will cost in the neighbourhood of $1,000.00, although he states that he has no way of arriving at the actual cost.\n\nThe delay in forwarding this statement is due to the fact that the Principal was away in Winnipeg and arrived back just after I had left on two weeks trip paying treaty.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.:\nOttawa,\nAugust 11, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, enclosing the statement of materials requested by the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School. This list has been reviewed and it is difficult for us to understand why so many items, which are ordinarily replaced immediately, have been allowed to accumulate. I feel that both the Principal and yourself should realize that, in view of the many demands occasioned by the war, this is a very difficult year to secure many of the items mentioned on the Principal's list. Besides, the information given in the majority of cases is insufficient for us to place the matter before the Purchasing Branch. For instance, the Principal requests 12 single beds but does not state the size he needs.\n\nWe do not supply electric light bulbs. Such replacements are made by the school management from their own funds.\n\nWe are interested in knowing how many of the items mentioned on the list are intended for the new classroom building. With regard to the request for a furnace for this building, is it intended to heat it by hot water or by hot air? If the latter, the cubic air space should be stated, as this information is necessary before deciding on the size of the furnace required.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to consider purchasing the hay scythes, \"fittings\", faucets or bath connections. All of these are in the same class with the electric light bulbs, namely, minor replacements, and should be provided by the school management from their own funds.\n\nI enclose the list, in order that you may furnish more specific information regarding the necessity\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nP.t.o.\nfor each item, and in as many cases as possible you should quote catalogue numbers or give more definite information, in order that we may submit the matter to our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAugust 27, 1942\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School states that he requested you to arrange for an inspection of the boilers in the school. Doctor Moore advises that the hospital boilers should also be inspected at the same time. Will you please communicate with the provincial authorities and advise the Department when this inspection will be carried out. You should attempt to impress upon the provincial authorities that it is quite impossible for a man to do a complete inspection and return on the same boat.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIM\nNorway House, Manitoba\n25th August, 1942\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of the report of the Provincial Boiler Inspector regarding the condition of the two heating boilers and the high pressure boiler at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nIt will be noted from the third paragraph of this report that the Inspector points out that certain immediate repairs are necessary, and suggests that the work be done by qualified men.\n\nWill you please arrange with Inspector Hamilton to have the necessary men sent in to do this work immediately, before navigation ceases?\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP. G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 31, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending forward herewith a report on the boilers at the Norway House Residential School, submitted to the Department by the provincial boiler inspector. I am enclosing also a copy of the accompanying letter from Indian Agent Lazenby.\n\nYou are authorized to take immediate steps to have a fully qualified man undertake the repair work necessary to these boilers, and you will no doubt be guided by the recommendation of the man you select in respect to the repair parts and general supplies necessary to undertake and complete this work. In view of the fact that we are not this year proceeding with the installation of a refrigerator plant, funds are available for this repair job.\n\nIndian Agent Lazenby has not sent forward a report on the condition of the boilers at the hospital. It might be advisable to have the man you select look over these boilers also and undertake any minor repairs that may be necessary. It is our hope that you will experience no difficulty in securing a qualified man for this work. It is a matter of regret that this report did not reach us until this comparatively late date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. A. G.

Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNORWAY HOUSE, Man.\n\nRe: 1942 Repair Appropriation.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your copy of letter received from Mr. Lazenby dated August 11th, returning the list of requirements for this school for more specific information. I have revised the list and cut it down to the lowest possible quantities to ensure operation of the plumbing and heating facilities during the coming winter months. I note that the plumbing fittings should be provided for out of the school funds. May I point out that these items have always been estimated for and have always been supplied by the Department. Many of the items in this connection are replacements of parts taken from the school stock for the plumbing and fixtures for the engineer's residence and thus our stock is depleted much beyond the safety margin for necessary winter repairs.\n\nI trust that the Department will reconsider the suggestion that such items be no longer supplied.\n\nWith the exception of the desks and the furnace no item in the requisition is to be used in the construction of the new class-rooms. The desks are necessary, as we are now employing two teachers in the residential school, keeping the junior grades in full time class-room work. Under the late arrangement whereby our junior children attended the day schools when this was first instituted years ago, some of the desks from the residential school were transferred to the day school. Only three or four of these desks in the day school are now available to the residential school.\n\nThe extra beds are made necessary for replacement of beds beyond repair and to offset the beds now used on the balconies for resting patients (preventorium), accommodation given by the school at the request of Dr. Moore.\n\nSome of the steam registers requisitioned are also designed for the heating of these balconies and also to replace some cracked registers in the school.\n\nThe furnace designed for the class-rooms is a hot air furnace, as, on the advice of the engineer, it is impossible to convey heating to the class-rooms from the steam system in the school.\n\nI trust that this gives you the information you require,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nUnited Church Indian Residential School,\nNORWAY HOUSE, Manitoba.\n\nREQUISITION for 1942.

DelRegio, the Boiler Inspector who made the examination and are pleased to advise that our Welder Foreman Mr. K. Neilson could go up to Norway House before the end of the month and do all necessary repairs with the exception of that required to the brick work. The basis on which this work will be charged to you will be $1.50 for our man's time plus all expenses.\n\nFor the brick work repairs we would recommend that you consult Mr. J. Threlfall, Winnipeg Supply & Fuel who we believe, will take care of this work for you in a satisfactory manner.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVULCAN IRON WORKS LIMITED\nper:\nSales Engineer.\n\nE.A.k\nDear Sir,\n\nThe enclosed letter has just been received from Mr. Anderson of the Vulcan Iron Works Limited.\n\nMr. Anderson stated the rate of pay is $1.50 per hour, with time and a half for overtime. There is also a definite agreement with the boiler welders that they will be paid for a ten hour day while travelling. They must be supplied with transportation and travelling expenses as well as board and room while at work. In view of the war work it is almost impossible to engage welders and boiler makers and Mr. Anderson cannot promise the release of Mr. Neilson much before September 28th.\n\nI have contacted Mr. Threlfall, Winnipeg Supply and Fuel, but as yet he has not been able to locate a brick layer with boiler experience - they have men but they are all busy. The wages for this man will be at least $1.25 per hour, plus all expenses. His time starts when he leaves the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel Company.\n\nI will do my best to get the necessary brick and supplies for the next boat and if at all possible I will get the bricklayer on that boat.\n\nPlease wire at once if the above arrangements meet with your approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, September 11, 1942.\n\nRe: Repairs to Boiler,\nNorway House Residential School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant and to state that the terms asked by the Welders, Boilermakers, etc., while somewhat exacting, are perhaps the only terms under which we can secure men to undertake the repairs necessary to the boilers at the above-noted school. You should do everything you possibly can to have this work undertaken at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 12, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Mr. Caldwell:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter from Inspector Hamilton relating to the repairs that appear to be necessary to the boilers at your school.\n\nYou will note that owing to the acute shortage of labour a certain amount of delay may be experienced in securing the men necessary to undertake this task. You will note also that the cost to the Department is likely to be quite substantial. I would appreciate it, therefore, if everything possible could be done to expedite the job while the men are there. It is difficult for me to understand why it should be necessary to incur any expenditure for overtime work. However, this is a matter that may have to be decided after you have discussed the task with the mechanics themselves.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.E. Caldwell,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nNorway House, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to refer to Departmental Letter 123-5-5 dated August 31st, and my reply dated September 9th.\n\nMr. Threlfall of the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel was called away just after Mr. Anderson, of the Vulcan Iron Works, contacted him and only now has he returned to the city. He interviewed the boiler inspector and supplied the following information:\n\nMaterial required (approximately) -\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Cost |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|------------|\n| Fire brick            | 5600     | $99.00 per 1000 f.o.b.Winnipeg | $554.40    |\n| Fire clay             | 1700 lbs.| $1.58 per owt. | $26.86     |\n| Plaster               | 1600     | $1.10 per owt. | $17.60     |\n| Lime                  | 500      | $1.00 per owt. | $5.00      |\n| Cement                | 10 bags  | $.95 per bag | $9.50      |\n| **Total**             |          |            | $645.36    |\n\nExpert boiler-bricklayer wages $1.20 per hour per eight-hour day start when he leaves Winnipeg and continue until his return. Board, room, boat fare and travelling expenses are to be included.\n\nMr. Threlfall states his company expects ten per cent over all cost.\n\nThis is a big job and I understand the Vulcan Iron Works and the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel work together, knowing that each company have capable, qualified and reliable men. I am advised by all with whom I have talked that an ordinary brick layer should not be sent out on this work. The boiler inspector states that in past years the brick work on these boilers has been done by greenhorns, with the result that a major repair is now required and this should be handled by expert workmen.\n\nA man is being called in from another job to do this as emergency work and if the Department approve he will leave for Norway House on September 21st.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIMPORTANT\u2014Caution Notice\nPLEASE READ CAREFULLY\n\nSchool Desks\n\nACCEPTANCE OF SHIPMENT AND BREAKAGE\n\nThe goods covered by the attached invoice were receipted for by the Railroad Company as having been received by them in good condition and properly packed. It is necessary to accept the shipment from the Railroad Company as is your duty to assure yourself that all articles enumerated on the bill of lading are included in the shipment and in good condition. To protect yourself against loss or damage in transit, check the shipment carefully with your bill of lading, noting the number of crates or packages and their condition. Any parts broken by the Railroad Company will be duplicated free of charge by us on the following conditions only:\n\nFirst\u2014The consignee must not give the Railroad Company a clear receipt for the complete shipment if there is any shortage, breakage or damage of any kind. In the event there is any shortage, or if any part of the shipment is damaged, the consignee can give a receipt for the goods if the railroad agent will make a notation on the freight bill indicating the amount of the shortage or the extent and nature of the damage. This freight bill must be mailed to us.\n\nIf the breakage or damage is concealed and not discovered until the goods are unpacked, notify the Agent of the Railroad Company by letter or telephone to call immediately and examine the shipment. The carrier is equally responsible for \"Concealed Damage\" as for visible damage and when notified as suggested it places the burden of proof upon the carrier. When you have given the Railroad Company notice in the manner suggested, mail us your bill of lading and paid freight bill.\n\nSecond\u2014When there is shortage, breakage or damage in an express shipment, request your Express Agent to furnish you receipt showing the condition in which the shipment was delivered to you.\n\nThird\u2014When you report shortage or breakage to us, enumerate fully and describe clearly the parts you desire replaced. In ordering standards for School Desks specify size and whether right or left, which is always determined as you sit at the desk. It is well to supplement your order by mentioning the pattern mark you will find on the piece. If several styles of desks, be sure to specify the style for which the parts are desired, particularly if wooden parts are being ordered. Care in making your order clear and complete will permit us to give you immediate service.\n\nFourth\u2014All claims for shortage, breakage or damage must be made within Thirty Days and you must provide us with the necessary papers to enable us to file claim against the Railroad or Express Company, as explained in Paragraphs No. 1 and No. 2. Otherwise claim will not be allowed.\n\nFifth\u2014We are not responsible for parts broken through carelessness of drayman hauling the goods or your workmen in assembling and installing.\n\nSTORAGE\n\nThe desks manufactured under this contract were constructed from thoroughly air seasoned and properly kiln-dried material and were in perfect condition when shipment left our factory. This does not mean that parts will remain perfect regardless of local atmospheric conditions. Under no condition should the crates containing the wood be stored in a damp or basement nor in a partly completed structure where building material, such as plaster, calcimine, paint, etc., may be thrown over the crates. Store in a dry, well ventilated room of normal uniform temperature. The crates containing woods should rest on their ends and all crates and boxes be elevated above floor a few inches to allow free air circulation under and around them.\n\nCLEANING AND POLISHING\n\nDo not attempt to clean or polish the woodwork with linseed oil, turpentine, unadulterated benzine, gasoline, alcohol, or anything of that kind. These materials are dangerous solvents which soften the varnish and spoil the finish; nor do we recommend any one of the various furniture polishes on the market. The following is a very good cleaner and polisher, the constituents of which can usually be obtained in any paint or drug store for a few cents:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mix thoroughly before using.}\n\\]\n\nMoisten a rag with this solution, apply sparingly to the surface and immediately rub dry with a clean dry cloth. Cheese cloth is recommended. The most effective result is obtained through the rubbing, not through excessive use of the solution.\n\nN. B.\u2014We maintain a SERVICE DEPARTMENT for the purpose of giving our customers all possible information and rendering any service to insure the proper installation and care of our products. If you have any difficulty in the installation and desire further information, your request will receive immediate attention. In writing please refer to the order number you will find stamped on the invoice and other papers.\n\nGlobe Furniture Company Limited\nWaterloo, Ontario\n\nForm 213-5m-M.P.C.\nOur Order No. 28490\n\nYour Order No.\n\nSold to Department of Mines & Resources,\nc/o Mr. H.J.

He will need two or three good workers and you should arrange to have these men ready to start. You know the usual rate of pay allowed there for laborers and you can voucher for payment, showing the number of days and the rate per day. Show this as helpers required for assisting bricklayer.\n\nThe Department will expect the bricklayer and boiler-welder to be supplied with board and room by the institution in which he is working.\n\nThis is an expensive repair job, both as to material and labour, and you should see to it that every minute counts, and allow no delays that can possibly be avoided.\n\nAttached is correspondence re arrangement with the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel for bricklayer, also a copy of a letter to Vulcan Iron Works re the boiler-welder.\n\nThe extra labour required to assist the bricklayer and boiler-welder was not mentioned to Ottawa, but we must provide helpers and I have explained to both companies that good men could be secured at Norway House and it would not be necessary to take men from Winnipeg and thus incur extra travelling expenses and higher wages.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNORWAY HOUSE, Manitoba.\n\nENCLS.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Boiler-welders at Norway House.\n\nThe boiler-welder from the Vulcan Iron Works and the bricklayer from the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel are leaving today by boat for Norway House.\n\nMr. Anderson of the Vulcan Iron Works said it was advisable to have these men on the job at the same time, so he delayed other work in order that the welder might leave today; which is a week ahead of his promised date. However, in view of the weather I am glad the men are getting away.\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of a letter sent to Mr. Lazenby, the Indian Agent. If these men are working in the school I see no reason why the institution cannot supply board and room. Helpers will be needed and to avoid the extra expense of taking men from Winnipeg, I have instructed Mr. Lazenby to supply Indian help and voucher for payment.\n\nI feel certain the work will be well done and I trust the arrangements meet with the Department's approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

Hoey,\nSupt., of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe: Boiler Repairs.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI have your letter of Sept. 12th, received on my return from Winnipeg.\n\nThe Welder and Bricklayer came on the boat leaving Winnipeg Sept. 21st. I had arranged for two good men to attend them, mixing mortar, etc. Gravel and sand was hauled for the work. Board and room was made available in the school.\n\nThe welder finished his work and left on the boat of the 30th Sept. The bricklayer had a much longer job, but finished last night and is leaving on the boat today, which, we understand, is the last boat of the season.\n\nSome overtime has been worked by these men, but, in both cases, it would have meant remaining over another boat if they had not worked overtime. I am satisfied that a good job has been done, the boilers and pressure tanks are now in good condition and should, with the proper care, be good for many more years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nTHE SELKIRK NAVIGATION COMPANY, LIMITED\nLake Winnipeg Passenger and Freight Service\n\nTo Mr. James, Esq., Norway House\nC.

Hoey,\n\nRe: Account of Winnipeg Supply and Fuel\n\nI acknowledge your letter 123-5-5 dated December 23rd, 1942, and am returning the account submitted as requested.\n\nIt was around September 1st before I received word to proceed with this work. I tried for a week to secure a bricklayer with boiler experience without success. In view of the fact that I was strongly advised not to accept anyone except an experienced boiler bricklayer, I consulted Mr. Anderson, of the Vulcan Iron Works. He explained that only competent men should be sent in to these outlying points and stated that their Company worked with the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel and he thought they might supply a man.\n\nI went to this Company and Mr. Thrifall said it was short notice and all his men were out of the city, but he would let me know what he could do. He also agreed to interview the boiler inspector and find out just what was required. A few days later Mr. Thrifall agreed to bring in a man providing the arrangements suggested were agreeable, namely, that his Company was to have ten per cent over all cost. I outlined all this in my letter 207-11 A.U., dated September 11th, and this arrangement was approved in a wire dated September 14th.\n\nI did, however, secure a quotation over the telephone from the Alasip Brick and Tile Company and this was slightly higher. Had it been the same I could hardly have done otherwise than give it to the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel, because they were the only ones willing to supply a suitable man and guarantee his work.\n\nWe are in a War and skilled labor is difficult to get. This Company, at considerable inconvenience to themselves, accepted the work - brought in a man off another job, where work stood still till his return. They have, I understand given us a splendid piece of work; and I am confident I made no mistake when I accepted Mr. Anderson's suggestion and gave the work to the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel. The Company has been out considerable money and I hope the account will be passed for payment without further delay.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEncs.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 7, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI attach account amounting to $659.76 covering the cost of material required in connection with repairing the boiler at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the latter part of August Indian Agent Lazenby forwarded a copy of the report of the Provincial Boiler Inspector regarding the condition of the heating boilers and the high pressure boiler at the Norway House Indian Residential School. The Inspector pointed out that certain immediate repairs were necessary. Due to the fact that navigation was closing soon after the date on which the above request was received, Mr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, was authorized by an air mail letter of September 11, 1942, to have these repairs made immediately. The attached account covers the cost of the material secured. In his letter forwarding the account Mr. Hamilton states that he secured a quotation from the Alsip Brick and Tile Company in addition to the one from the Winnipeg Supply and Fuel Company. The quotation of the latter was cheaper and they had the goods ready to ship. He, therefore, placed the business with them.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows: 581-76-09-622.\n\nR.A.

It is herewith recommended that the smokepipes be kept at least twelve inches from any combustible wall or ceiling, or that the combustible wall or ceiling be insulated with at least 3/8\" asbestos covered with metal.\nNorway House, Man:\n4th January 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.:\n\nI beg to advise that when the boiler inspector was at the agency early last summer, he made certain recommendations regarding the repairs needed at the Norway House Indian Residential School, which have since been carried out.\n\nThe inspector also, in his report included his findings regarding the conditions in the School and the Hospital as to fire protection and fire escapes. On receiving this report from the inspector, the Fire Commissioner communicated with Mr Inspector A.G. Hamilton at Winnipeg, requesting that he be provided with sketches or plans of these buildings, in order that he may make recommendations that he considered necessary.\n\nThese sketches and plans were duly provided, and I enclose herewith for the information of the Department, a copy of the Fire Commissioner's letter in this connection, with the sketches and plans that were submitted to him.\n\nI should be glad to be advised in due course what action, if any, the Department may decide to take regarding the Fire Commissioner's recommendations.\n\nP.G.

Is there anyone at Norway House who could be employed in erecting the stairways recommended by the Commissioner? If so, you should immediately obtain quotations with regard to the cost of both the material and the labour and submit these for our consideration. With regard to the last paragraph of your letter, you should warn the school authorities to take every possible precaution against fire originating from the smoke pipes in the kitchen stove. If it is not feasible to keep the pipes at least 12\" from any wall or ceiling please let me know the approximate quantity of asbestos that would be needed to insulate the ceilings and walls next the pipes.\n\nR.A.

Hoey's letter No; 123-5-5 of the 24th December, regarding the replacing of the high pressure boiler at the Norway House Residential School with one not in use at the Hospital, I beg to say that when the boiler welder was here repairing the heating boilers at the school last fall, he opened up and cleaned out the high pressure boiler, and found that there was a very considerable amount of corrosion inside it; so much so, that he could not get it thoroughly cleaned out in the one operation. Successive washing out have brought to light the fact that the corrosion had eaten right through the boiler in some places, so that it was not considered safe to use. The boiler welder stated that this had been the result of the boiler not having been regularly washed out and properly cared for during some years past, but the corrosion had been allowed to continue without attention, instead of being washed out at least once every three months.\n\nThis boiler, I may say, was installed new at the school in 1935, just a little over seven years ago.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 27, 1943.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the high pressure boiler at the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that the boiler welder stated the condition of the boiler was due to the fact that it had not been regularly washed out. This emphasizes the necessity of the school management taking every possible care of the equipment supplied. This is especially necessary at the present time, when it is becoming increasingly difficult to replace equipment.

Hoey's letter No; 123-5-5 of the 14th January last, regarding the proposed construction of three wooden stairway type fire escapes with hand rails on the Norway House Indian Residential School building, one escape at the rear of the building, and two at the front; also the proposed construction of a similar type of fire escape on the Norway House Indian Hospital.\n\nSince the receipt of Mr Hoey's letter, we have made some attempts to figure out the materials and the best way of constructing these fire escapes, but without much success, and there was no one at Norway House with any experience in this kind of work. However, recently a Mr Joe Keeper, an employee of the Hudson's Bay Company, who is a carpenter, returned to Norway House from some building work he had been doing for the Company, and I got him to give us some assistance.\n\nIn figuring out the escapes recommended by the Manitoba Provincial Fire Commissioner for the School, one only was figured on, for the rear of the building, as shown on the estimate attached hereto. The fire commissioner recommended two of these stairway escapes for the front of the building, but discussing this with the Principal and Mr Keeper, we were all of the opinion that this would be of no advantage at all over the four fire escape poles now in use, and by means of which, the Principal informs me, the whole of the school pupils and staff can be evacuated in less than two minutes. This, could certainly not be improved upon with stairway type fire escapes, - in fact it is thought that the substitution of stairway escapes would be a move in the wrong direction.\n\nIn his letter of recommendations, the Provincial Fire Commissioner states that while making his inspection, the inspector \"noted that smokepipes from the kitchen stove were in close proximity to a combustible wall or partition\", This is not so, as the smokepipe from the kitchen stove leads directly into a concrete and brick chimney, so there is no need for any change there.\n\nI may mention, that the concrete foundations of this school are in very bad shape, and getting worse each year. They are badly cracked in several places, and during the winters they heave with the frost and they are getting more and more out of shape and position.\n\nWith regard to the Hospital, the Fire Commissioner's letter states that \"there appears to be only one means of egress from the basement, which is by the main stairway, and it is hereby recommended that alternative means of egress be made either from the killer room, laundry room, and kitchen to the ground level\". The fact of the matter is, that the hospital rear door leads directly from the laundry to the outside; and the 'kitchen' is on the top floor, so that there is already a means\n\np.t.o.\nIndian Agency\nNorway House, Man:\n16th July 1943.\n\nMATERIALS ESTIMATED FOR CONSTRUCTION OF\nWOODEN FIRE ESCAPE AT\nNORWAY HOUSE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n4 - Pcs Dimension. 6 X 6 - 30'\n4 - \" \" 6 X 6 - 18'\n200 - Lineal Feet 3 X 8 Plank\n6 - Pcs Dimension. 2 X 4 - 18'\n30 - \" \" 2 X 8 - 12'\n16 - \" \" 2 X 4 - 12'\n8 - \" \" 2 X 12 - 12'\n3 - \" \" 2 X 12 - 18'\n\n12 - Bolts. 3/4\" X 24\".

Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI have been expecting to hear through the Agency about the appropriation granted on our 1943 estimates, but to date no information has been received. I am anxious to hear before the end of navigation, which, by the way, may be considerably earlier this year on account of shortage of wood put up on Lake Winnipeg for fuel for the passenger and freight boat.\n\nUnless I can find some means of providing more stabling accommodation for our stock here at Norway House, it is almost a necessity that I dispose of at least some of the stock before winter sets in. I have been keeping some of the stock at the farm at Hope Island during the winter, necessitating the extra employment of a family there. In the present necessity for economy, I find that keeping this extra help will not be possible, even if it were not for the fact that the stable buildings at Hope Island, which are logs, are so deteriorated that they are not suitable for winter care of stock. It would be very regrettable to have to dispose of the stock. When I came here two years ago there were only 7 head of milk cattle here and the Principal had determined to go out of cattle altogether, as being too much expense. I saw some opportunity of overcoming this by undertaking the supply of milk and meat to the Hospital. Since that time I have increased our stock so that I have now some nine or ten head of cattle to kill each fall, and plenty of milk for the hospital and the school. Just at present my stock stands as follows:\n\n- 40 head cattle, of all ages,\n- 23 pigs, including brood sows and boar.\n- 27 Goats, 12 milking.\n- 5 Horses.\n\nMy plan is to winter all this stock (some 9 head of cattle and 20 pigs will be butchered at Freeze-up) here at the school, eliminating Hope Island expense. I will require additional space for about ten head of cattle and the goats. Until such time as we can get either a new barn or a proper addition to the old one, lean-to buildings could be used. These could be built with lumber sawed from logs obtained locally, with the addition of shingles. The cost of getting the logs and the building would be approximately $500.00\n\nThe cattle are a really fine herd. Whether it would be better to go to the expense of adequately stabling them cannot be doubted.\nIt would be almost impossible to build up such a herd again under present conditions. Further, the expense of shipping cattle in the fall to supply the Hospital and the school with meat would be almost prohibitive. However, in the present financial situation, where the school is actually operating, or trying to operate, on a 30% increase cost of operation (figuring supplies and wages) with a revenue of 21% less than pre-war, is manifestly impossible, without the most rigid economy. Even with this economy, a deficit is bound to accumulate.\n\nTo complicate matters, the hay supply is most inadequate this year. The water is very high and has covered most of our hay grounds, which are located along the banks of the river and lakes. Where I should have normally at least 100 tons of hay put up, I will be fortunate this year to get 50. This has had to be cut mainly on islands in Playgreen Lake and has to be hauled in some cases 20 miles. Formerly, during seasons of high water, the Indians were accustomed to cut the hay in the water, spreading it out to dry. This was not uncommon. Under present conditions however, with so much work being available in the harvest fields (over 100 men have left this reserve along for the harvest) it is impossible to get men to cut hay. However, I am fortunate in having a good crop of oats which will be cut green and stacked. In this way, I may be able to manage, with careful feeding, through the winter. The stabling room, however, is most necessary.\n\nWe have a really fine herd of goats. They have been a distinct liability thus far. I could make some revenue selling the goats milk to the hospital, but the Doctor expects to get the goat's milk at the same price as cows milk (until recently we were supplying cows milk to the Hospital at 5\u00a2 per quart, this has now been increased to 10\u00a2). Goats milk sells normally at about 35\u00a2 per quart, and I would rather use it at the school than sell it at such a low cost.\n\nWe have been unfortunate in our kid production during the last two years. This year, out of 15 kids, only 3 are nannies. The Billies are useless, of course, except for the small supply of goat meat which they provide. It is impossible to account for this adverse production of kids. I am changing the Billy this year. I have even suggested to Dr. Corrigan that there might be a chance to get some real results with his Vitamins in our goat herd.......but he does not seem to take kindly to the idea.\n\nOur pigs are a real asset. I have a very fine type of Yorkshire and they have done remarkably well considering the very meagre and primitive accommodation we have for them. I wish we could have even a little of the fine accommodation and housing some other schools have.\n\nI wish to make a note of the labour and staff problem. As you know, I received material to erect new outside class-rooms, we to supply all the material and labour that could be obtained here.\nwing to the shortage of labour (for logging, hauling and building) I have been as yet unable to build this building. In fact, were the labour available, finances would not permit at present of the expenditure entailed. I have the material supplied stored in the warehouse where it will not deteriorate, and this work will be proceeded with as soon as opportunity affords. In the meantime, I am using the old outside class-room for the senior pupils.\n\nI have also gone into egg and poultry production, which has not been introduced here. I have had some 40 chickens for over a year, and this year I purchased 200 day old chicks, out of which 170 have matured. Some of these will provide poultry for the hospital, but I will have about 150 in egg production during the winter. It was necessary to build a chicken house, which is partially complete and needs to be lined and insulated for the winter.\n\nThis gives an outline of our live stock situation. There can be no doubt that our stock has contributed very greatly to the economical operation of the school. I do not know what we would have done during these difficult times had we not built up our live stock during the past two years. I feel that more land, (if it were obtainable within convenient reach of the school) and adequate stabling, is necessary to the continued better operation. What can be done under the present circumstances I do not know, but I am putting the situation before you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) A.E.Caddwell.\n\nI don't know whether Mr. Lazenby has taken up with the Department the matter of the construction of a barge to haul wood and hay. I have discussed it with him and he agrees to the necessity. The old barge is useless. I tried to use it this summer in the hauling of wood, but the hull is so rotten that it cannot be kept bailed out. In hauling our hay I purchased two old lake fishing boats (about 30 feet long) these are tied together and a rack put over them on which the hay is piled for hauling, then towed with a gas boat. The whole thing is very primitive but it is necessary expedient.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 2, 1943.\n\nEX'D\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nI attach for your information a copy of a letter which has just been received from the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School. The Department regrets that you have not consulted the Principal before this with a view to ascertaining what repairs and improvements he thought should be made at the Norway House School this year. In order to save time, it has been decided to approve an expenditure of $500.00 for the erection of lean-tos for the accommodation of the stock during the coming winter. Please advise Mr. Caldwell immediately regarding this authority, in order that he may proceed with the necessary work.\n\nYou will note that in the last paragraph of his letter the Principal refers to the construction of a barge. We have had no report from you regarding this matter.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 4, 1943.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nOn the 2nd instant I sent you a copy of Mr. Caldwell's letter of August 24. You will notice a postscript to the letter in which he states that a barge is needed for the school, in order to haul wood and hay. I have had an opportunity of discussing this matter with Dr. Corrigan who suggests that a barge could be made by the Cross Lake School, as they have made other barges for their own use. Consequently I am writing to the Principal requesting him to make a barge for the Norway House School, on the understanding that the Department will be responsible for its cost. You should communicate with the Principal and give him the dimensions of the barge that is needed at Norway House. Dr. Corrigan believes that the barge should be completed and taken across the portage by the end of March. It could then be brought to Norway House early in June by tug.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 4, 1943.\n\nEX'D\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Norway House Indian Residential School requires a barge for transporting wood and hay. Dr. Corrigan was in the office yesterday and he thought that possibly the barge could be made at the Cross Lake School, as you have made other barges for your own use. It would be built on the understanding that the Department would be responsible for its cost. I trust that you will find it possible to co-operate with us in this regard and, in the hope that you can, I am instructing Indian Agent Lazenby to supply you with the dimensions of the barge that would be needed at Norway House. If this work can be done at Cross Lake it would be appreciated if the barge could be finished by the end of March, in order that it could be taken across the portage. From that point it would be taken by tug to Norway House early in June.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. G.E.

In fact I have not found any idle carpenters and the contractors tell me they are not available.\n\nMr. Mitchell, Selkirk, who built the Agent's house at Norway House and the addition to our Fort Alexander Hospital, is busy and unable to go. He has been trying to get extra help to rush his contract work but states reliable men cannot be secured. If this work is left till spring Mr. Mitchell would go up providing he knew early enough to line it up with his year's work.\n\nThe construction of a safe and suitable fire escape I feel should be done by someone familiar with this kind of work. However, Dr. Corrigan thinks the work could be done by Indians under the supervision of Mr. Stevenson, the engineer. This, of course, should be the cheapest arrangement.\n\nA.G.

I must also say that we have just resumed our mill operations and we have close it until next summer. Then we have no special lumber on hand for barge purposes and we have no logs at present to prepare some. If I had known it before our sawer went away may be I could have arrange with him to make it as he is the man who built the one we have with the Brothers.\n\nThen another thing which is quite a job will be the transportation of the barge across Whiskey Jack Portage. There in no road across Whiskey Jack Portage in the winter time and in the summer time it could be done, but it would be quite expensive. A barge like ours will weigh close to four tons and could not be handle easily.\n\nI regret that I find it impossible to be able to co-operate with the Department in this case and you may rest assure that if I had found it possible in some way that I would have been glad to do it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.E.

Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have been expecting to hear through the Agency about the appropriation granted on our 1943 estimates, but to date no information has been received. I am anxious to hear before the end of navigation, which, by the way, may be considerably earlier this year on account of shortage of wood put up on Lake Winnipeg for fuel for the passenger and freight boat.\n\nUnless I can find some means of providing more stabling accommodation for our stock here at Norway House, it is almost a necessity that I dispose of at least some of the stock before winter sets in. I have been keeping some of the stock at the farm at Hope Island during the winter, necessitating the extra employment of a family there. In the present necessity for economy, I find that keeping this extra help will not be possible, even if it were not for the fact that the stable buildings at Hope Island, which are log, are so deteriorated that they are not suitable for winter care of stock. It would be very regrettable to have to dispose of the stock. When I came here two years ago there were only 7 head of milk cattle here and the Principal had determined to go out of cattle altogether, as being too much expense. I saw some opportunity of overcoming this by undertaking the supply of milk and meat to the hospital. Since that time I have increased our stock so that I have now some nine or ten head of cattle to kill each fall, and plenty of milk for the hospital and the school. Just at present my stock stands as follows:\n\n- 40 head cattle, of all ages\n- 23 pigs, including brood sows and boar\n- 27 goats, 12 milking\n- 5 horses\n\nMy plan is to winter all this stock (some 9 head of cattle and 20 pigs will be butchered at freeze-up) here at the school, eliminating Hope Island expense. I will require additional space for about ten head of cattle and the goats. Until such time as we can get either a new barn or a proper addition to the old one, lean-to buildings could be used. These could be built with lumber sawed from logs obtained locally, with the addition of shingles. The cost of getting the logs and the building would be approximately $500.00.\nThe cattle are a really fine herd. Whether it would be better to go to the expense of adequately stabling them cannot be doubted.\n\nIt would be almost impossible to build up such a herd again under present conditions. Further, the expense of shipping cattle in the fall to supply the hospital and the school with meat would be almost prohibitive. However, in the present financial situation, where the school is actually operating, or trying to operate, on a 30% increase cost of operation (figuring supplies and wages) with a revenue of 2\u00bd less than pre-war, is manifestly impossible, without the most rigid economy. Even with this economy, a deficit is bound to accumulate.\n\nTo complicate matters, the hay supply is most inadequate this year. The water is very high and has covered most of our hay grounds, which are located along the banks of the river and lakes. Where I should have normally at least 100 tons of hay put up, I will be fortunate this year to get 50. This has had to be cut mainly on islands in Playgreen Lake and has to be hauled in some cases 20 miles. Formerly, during seasons of high water, the Indians were accustomed to cut the hay in the water, spreading it out to dry. This was not uncommon. Under present conditions, however, with so much work being available in the harvest fields (over 100 men have left this reserve along for the harvest) it is impossible to get men to cut hay. However, I am fortunate in having a good crop of oats which will be cut green and stacked. In this way I may be able to manage, with careful feeding through the winter. The stabling room, however, is most necessary.\n\nWe have a really find herd of goats. They have been a distinct liability thus far. I could make some revenue selling the goats' milk to the hospital, but the Doctor expects to get the goat's milk at the same price as cow's milk (until recently we were supplying cow's milk to the hospital at 5\u00a2 per quart, this has now been increased to 10\u00a2). Goat's milk sells normally at about 35\u00a2 per quart, and I would rather use it at the school than sell it at such a low cost.\n\nWe have been unfortunate in our kid production during the last two years. This year, out of 15 kids, only 3 are nannies. The billies are useless, of course, except for the small supply of goat meat which they provide. It is impossible to account for this adverse production of kids. I am changing the billy this year. I have even suggested to Dr. Corrigan that there might be a chance to get some real results with his vitamins in our goat herd --- but he does not seem to take kindly to the idea.\nOur pigs are a real asset. I have a very fine type of Yorkshire and they have done remarkably well considering the very meagre and primitive accommodation we have for them. I wish we could have even a little of the fine accommodation and housing some other schools have.\n\nI wish to make a note of the labour and staff problem. As you know, I received material to erect new outside class-rooms, we to supply all the material and labour that could be obtained here.\n\nOwing to the shortage of labour (for logging, hauling and building) I have been as yet unable to build this building. In fact, were the labour available, finances would not permit at present of the expenditure entailed. I have the material supplied stored in the warehouse where it will not deteriorate, and this work will be proceeded with as soon as opportunity affords. In the meantime, I am using the old outside class-room for the senior pupils.\n\nI have also gone into egg and poultry production, which has not been introduced here. I have had some 40 chickens for over a year, and this year I purchased 200 day old chicks, out of which 170 have matured. Some of these will provide poultry for the hospital, but I will have about 150 in egg production during the winter. It was necessary to build a chicken house, which is partially complete and needs to be lined and insulated for the winter.\n\nThis gives an outline of our live stock situation. There can be no doubt that our stock has contributed very greatly to the economical operation of the school. I do not know what we would have done during these difficult times had we not built up our live stock during the past two years. I feel that more land, (if it were obtainable within convenient reach of the school) and adequate stabling, is necessary to the continued better operation. What can be done under the present circumstances I do not know, but I am putting the situation before you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) A.E. Caldwell.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 2, 1943.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nI attach for your information a copy of a letter which has just been received from the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School. The Department regrets that you have not consulted the Principal before this with a view to ascertaining what repairs and improvements he thought should be made at the Norway House School this year. In order to save time, it has been decided to approve an expenditure of $500.00 for the erection of lean-to's for the accommodation of the stock during the coming winter. Please advise Mr. Caldwell immediately regarding this authority, in order that he may proceed with the necessary work.\n\nR.A.

Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 11th instant, forwarding requisition for a jacketed hot water boiler for the Norway House School. You recommended a No. 1-W-7 shown in Ashdown's catalogue on page PS. In this type of boiler coal has to be used. Is coal available at Norway House? We were under the impression that wood would be used. Please let me have this information as soon as possible.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNorway House Indian Residential School\n\nNORWAY HOUSE, MAN.\n\n15th July, 1944.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nAbout one year ago some lumber was shipped here to the school for the erection of an additional building. I understand that Mr. Caldwell proposed to make this building into a classroom, and convert the present classroom into a boys' recreation room.\n\nUp to the present no work has been done on this proposed building and before commencing work I would like to change the plan for the following reason. The present classroom is well lighted and comfortable and if converted into a recreation room it would receive considerable hard usage as Indian boys are usually very destructive. We have already one outside classroom which we use for the junior pupils, and this classroom in the building is used for senior pupils, and I consider it quite satisfactory to use them for these purposes. But what we do need in a suitable recreation room for the boys. The present basement playroom is quite cold in winter and unsuitable for the boys' recreation room. It was evidently Mr. Caldwell's intention to provide a more comfortable room for the boys and I would like to carry out this part of the plan. I am sure that I can make a good recreation hall that will meet our requirements.\n\nI shall be glad to know if you endorse this plan.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\n\n(Rev. J. Jones) Principal,\nOttawa,\nAugust 9, 1944.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of a letter just received from Reverend Joseph Jones, Principal of the Norway House Residential School. You are in a better position than we are to decide if Mr. Jones' suggestion is practicable and necessary. You should discuss the matter with him and use the lumber that has been received at the school to the best possible advantage.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nNorway House, Man:\n14th August 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nIn reply to Mr R.A.Hoey's letter 123-5-5 of July 26th, I beg to say that our engineer, Mr R.L.Stevenson has examined the jacketed hot water boiler in the Norway House Residential School, and finds that although the front of the boiler shows the same number and designations as shown in Ashdown's catalogue, it is not the same boiler.\n\nMr Stevenson states that the following repair parts should be supplied for the present boiler:\n\n5 - New Sections, with the necessary gaskets, nipples and stove cement for assembling them.\n\n1 - New door. To replace the second door from the bottom in front of the boiler. Size 6\" X 16\" (including the hinges)\n\nThe fire box in the present boiler takes a 22\" stick of fuel wood.\n\nP.G.Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 22, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nRecently Indian Agent Lazenby submitted a requisition for a new hot water boiler for the Norway House Residential School. He suggested No. 137 as shown in Ashdown's catalogue page PG. When we received the requisition it was noted here that this particular type of boiler required coal and we consequently wrote to Mr. Lazenby to ask if he was certain that this was the type he required. In reply to that letter Indian Agent Lazenby forwarded his letter of the 16th instant, copy of which is enclosed. It would be appreciated if you would arrange to purchase the new sections and the new door and have them sent to Norway House before the close of navigation.\n\nR.A.

Some of the material is on hand such as sash and doors some sheeting siding, and flooring and some cement, shingles and Plaster board. Evidently Mr Caldwell intended to build a room 20 x 36 this is too small to play games. We have to take eight feet off the floor space to accommodate the heater. I propose to make the building 20 feet X 56 feet this will leave a playing surface of 20 X 48 which is small enough for the purpose.\n\nIn addition to what we have on hand I require the following.\n\n22 cu. yd. of Gravel for the foundation of recreation room.\n110 sacks of cement\n74 pieces of 2 x 8 x 12\" Floor Joists\n126 \" 2 x 6 x 14\" Studding\n16 \" 2 x 6 x 10\" Gables\n30 \" 2 x 6 x 16\" Plates\n88 \" 2 x 6 x 14\" Rafters\n31 \" 2 x 6 x 20\" Ceiling Joists\n44 \" 1 x 6 x 10\" Collar ties 1 x 6 x 10\"\n\n600 ft. of 6\" fir flooring\n1620 \" 8\" Shiplap\n600 \" 6\" Siding (Fir)\n6M Cedar Shingles\n\nIf I can have the above and the cost of delivering the gravel I will pay the labour.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJoseph Jones Principal.\nNorway House Indian Residential School\n\nRev.

Sep. 26th 1944\n\nMr Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Mr Hamilton,\n\nOwing to the lack of adequate power for towing the barge for hauling wood and hay for our school, I am hiring this work to be done by Mr Folster who has a higher powered boat. This is costing me a considerable sum. The stronger engine that formerly belonged to the school has been transferred to the hospital and is no longer available for our use. I understand that the engine has been put into a boat owned by the Game Guardian. If the Department will supply the material and the engine, I will build the boat. This will be an excellent programme of manual training for the boys this Winter. I am already fitting up a workshop for this purpose. I have taught boatbuilding to Indian boys before. I believe the Department is aware of this as the boat I built is now being used by the Alberni School, the boat was named \"DANN\" but I think it has now a new name \"HELVIN - SWARTHOUT LL\". I propose to build a boat of 36 feet length and 8' beam. I have secured prices on materials in Winnipeg; the total cost for all materials except the Engine will not exceed $750.00 seven hundred and fifty dollars. The cost of a hull of the quality I shall build is $1400.00 in Winnipeg.\n\nThe engine for the boat will not be required until next Spring. I understand that the United States Government are releasing some small Diesel Engines that are suitable for this size boat and the price is very reasonable.\n\nI shall be glad if you will present to the Department a request that this material be supplied before the close of navigation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources\n\nRE: Boat for Norway House School\n\nI enclose a letter just received from Mr. Jones. I understand the school has no boat. Mr. Jones explains the material will cost $750 and when the hull is made, it will be worth at least $1400. I have no doubt a boat is needed, but apart from this, I feel that in building the boat the boys will receive a worthwhile training. Later if a fishing boat is needed or a boat for the hospital, perhaps this also could be built at the school. I believe such a training will be a delight to many of the boys and will prove useful in later life.\n\nMr. Jones has the material located at various places in Winnipeg and he claims it can be assembled in time for the last boat, if the authority is granted at once. Please advise by wire if Mr. Jones can make the necessary purchases.\n\nA. G.

It is very expensive to maintain horses for this work; the tractor will do better work than a four-horse team can do and will cost considerably less to operate. Our garden is all row crop work and the soil is hard clay and requires extra cultivation. You are aware that we depend on our garden to supply the needs of the school and the tractor will enable us to put a larger area under cultivation.\n\nWill you submit this request for the consideration of the Department?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He proposed a different way to what we had planned, attaching the escape to the building on brackets. I spoke to him again just before leaving on the treaty trip, and he said he would give the matter further thought while I was away. Nothing had been done when I got back. I have mentioned the matter a number of times since, and he said he wanted to get Joe Keeper, an employee of the H.E.Co., to do the work. I again took the matter up with Mr. Jones yesterday, and he said he was unable to get Joe Keeper to do the work, and that he would just have to put away the materials. Nothing at all has been done to date, and it looks now as if nothing is going to be done, as practically all the local Indians have gone away to their winter camps, or are about to go, and competent help will not be available for the job during the winter, and besides, the job can hardly be done during the cold weather.\n\n\"P.G.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEncs.\nReverend Sir:\n\nSeveral months ago the Department supplied the material required for the erection of fire escapes at the Norway House Residential School. It was understood at that time that if we supplied the material the school management would provide the labour. From a letter that Inspector Hamilton wrote to Indian Agent Lasenby on June 21 last the Department infers that Mr. Hamilton discussed this matter with you on your way to the school. I am now informed in a letter dated the 10th ultimo from the Indian Agent that you have not taken any action with reference to the erection of these fire escapes. It was previously pointed out to us that the fire escapes were very necessary and consequently it is felt that, as we carried out our part of the bargain by supplying the materials, you should have been just as anxious to carry out the school's share by erecting them. I am afraid that by the time this letter arrives the season will be too far advanced for you to erect them this fall. I would like an explanation regarding your reasons for delaying this matter because, as far as any information we have is concerned, there appears to be no reason why the fire escapes could not have been erected during the past summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

It is our understanding that Mr. Jones intends to proceed with the construction of this boat during the winter months. We have not, however, yet received the account covering the cost of this material; consequently, I am unable to state definitely whether or not the material was actually purchased.

It is now on hand, packed ready for shipment. Ackland and Sons got their shipment away and the invoices were sent to Mr. Jones.

Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe first mail came in today and I hasten to reply to you question about the proposed Fire Escape.\n\nMr Hamilton asked me if I could secure someone at Norway House to erect the fire escapes as it was too expensive to send a carpenter from Winnipeg. I said if I could secure Joe Keeper who I had trained at Brandon and who has done considerable carpenter work for the Department and the Hudson's Bay Co I would get the work done. However I found that \"The Bay\" had him engaged under contract so was not available. There is no other man here who could undertake this work, I discussed with the Indian Agent about engaging Sandy Lauffer who is a rough carpenter for the work, he could not have done it without my help and I was prepared to work with him but he was engaged at the agency for work there and was not available.\n\nI was not aware that the school was expected to pay for the labour of erecting the fire escape these arrangements must have been made before I came.\n\nFor your information I may say that I have completed the erection of the Gymnasium and have converted another building into a boatbuilding shop. I had to do this work personally as there is no capable man available, of course the school boys were working under my direction as I consider this kind of work valuable training.\n\nGoing back to the question of fire escape. I understand that this wing of the building was used as a sick room at the time it was decided to erect the escape. This wing is not being used for that purpose now.\n\nThe work will be done when the weather is mild enough to permit cutting the openings in the wall.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJoseph Jones\nOttawa, January 17, 1945.\n\nMr. P.

With that communication he enclosed a letter dated September 26, 1944, from Reverend Joseph Jones. One paragraph of Mr. Jones' letter read as follows:\n\n\"The stronger engine that formerly belonged to the school has been transferred to the hospital and is no longer available for our use.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of August 22, 1944, authorizing purchase of repairs for the hot water boiler at the Norway House Indian Residential School. Indian Agent Lazenby has now submitted an account for $122.51, in favour of the J. H. Ashdown Hardware Company. This account is marked Invoice No. 58706 and was dated October 24, 1944. In this account there is an item of $5.30 for freight. It will be necessary to have a receipt from the transportation company before this item can be paid. It would be appreciated if you would secure this from the Ashdown Hardware Company and forward it to me.\n\nWe are also in receipt of an account from Indian Agent Lazenby, amounting to $76.47, issued in favour of the John Leckie Co., Ltd., 183 James St. East, Winnipeg. This account is marked Invoice No. 272 and is dated October 22, 1944. It includes an item reading \"Equalizing Express - $3.00\".

I have asked Mr Jones to procure from John Leckie L'td the express receipt required.\n\nWith reference to the engine, dealt with in the last two paragraphs of Mr Phelan's letter, I beg to say that this engine had been lying around for some years at the school, not being in use, and Dr Corrigan procured it from the then Principal, who was Rev: R.T. Chapin. Dr Corrigan informs me that the taking over of this engine from the school was discussed by him with both Mr Hoey and Mr Phelan when he was in Ottawa a few years ago, but that nothing 'official' was done about the transfer of the engine.\n\nWhen Dr Corrigan got the engine, the Game Guardian had a large fishing boat without an engine in it, and they made an agreement whereby the doctor would put the engine in the boat and both would have the use of boat and engine when needed. There is no question of this engine being 'Transferred to the Game Guardian'. It is still the property of the Indian Affairs Branch, and may be taken out of the boat at any time. This is an old engine, and the doctor states that considerably over $100.00 has been spent on it since he got it, keeping it in repair.\n\nP.G.

Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House Agency.\n\nDear Mr Lazenby,\n\nThe main drain leading from the school has given us considerable trouble this year; it has been blocked no less than thirty times. I am sure there is a broken tile either under the foundation of the school or just outside, probably caused by the settling of the foundation. This should be attended to during the Summer holidays.\n\nThe boys' toilets in the basement freeze up during the severe weather, so we should locate them in another place where there will be no danger from frost.\n\nNow that we have a gymnasium, the part of the old playroom could be used for the purpose of wash room and toilet. I propose to partition this part off from the main room on the West side.\n\nThree toilets and five wash basins would be installed. I can supply the wash basins but cannot supply the toilets or the fittings. I will give you an estimate of the materials required.\n\nOne hundred dollars should cover the labour cost of excavation and installing the fittings. May I ask if you would submit this request to the Department for consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES**\n\n6th April 1945\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nNorway House Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 10 - 691\n\nSHIP TO Rev: Joseph Jones, Indian Residential School, Norway House, Man:\n\nc/o Selkirk Navigation Co: Redwood Dock, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nPurpose for which required Repairs & Painting - School buildings.\n\nNote: Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\n| Quantity | Description                  | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------------------------|------------|-------|\n| 3-Only   | Closets with Tanks. # G764\u00bd Page # P55 |            |       |\n| 32-Foots | Galv: Pipe. 1/2 inch         |            |       |\n| 3 - Only | Galv: Unions. 1/2 inch       |            |       |\n| 4-Only   | Galv: Tees. 1/2 inch         |            |       |\n| 3-Only   | Galv: Couplings. 1/2 inch    |            |       |\n| 25-Foots | Soil Pipe.

Joseph Jones is the Principal in charge. There are 55 girls and 47 boys enrolled - a total of 102.\n\nThe building was quite clean; some repair was needed to the plaster walls, and the kitchen ceiling badly needed painting. The classroom also needed interior decorating.\n\nThe school is operated on a half day system and there were 52 pupils in the senior room - 25 in the morning and 27 in the afternoon. The pupils appear to be making fair progress. The book work seen was neat and the writing good.\n\nThe girls receive a good training in cooking, sewing, housekeeping and laundry work. All the departments appeared to be well supervised and the children seemed to enjoy their work. The children were friendly and appeared happy.\n\nThe dormitories were clean and all the beds neatly made. The bedding was plentiful and in good condition. The plumbing showed care and was in good operating condition.\n\nThe northwest corner of the foundation has moved out and is in bad condition. The north foundation wall is badly cracked. I consider the condition serious and I think the Department should obtain expert advice from a qualified engineer as to how the condition can best be remedied.\n\nThe fire escape requested by the Fire Inspector has not been erected. I understand a wooden stairway was recommended in 1942 and material provided. Mr. Jones thinks a pole type escape would serve equally as well, especially if used to come down one flight onto a landing and from there on by the proposed stairway. However, the Fire Inspector, Mr. Del Begio, does not agree. This Inspector was at the School since my visit and stated Mr. Jones promised to have the escape erected at once. I would request the Department write Mr. Jones insisting that the Inspector's recommendations be carried out immediately. If Mr. Jones needs assistance other than that he has on his staff, I would suggest that he be authorized to hire it and instructed to submit a voucher through the Indian Agent, showing the time and rate per hour paid.\n\nThe new building erected for a gymnasium is well built and I am sure serves a very useful purpose. If a man interested in sports is kept on the staff then during the winter months I am sure the building will be kept in use.\n\nI was impressed with the boat being built for use at the school. It is 36' long and the frame is well constructed.\nMr. Jones states he will require a fairly large engine and later will submit a requisition to the Department giving full details regarding the size and type of engine needed.\n\nThe garden had all been planted but the season was late and most things were just beginning to show through the ground.\n\nA few pigs are kept and all surplus butchered for meat. Poultry is also kept. Mr. Jones was making alterations to the barn so that he could increase his flock of poultry.\n\nThis school is of frame construction and in my opinion is a real fire trap. The children observe fire drill and are not afraid to use the pole fire escape. Fire extinguishers are kept in prominent places throughout the building, but I am sure that if a fire ever got started, it could not be stopped. If a school is to be kept at this point I feel that in view of the foundation and fire hazard a new fireproof building should be erected.\n\nA.O. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, 29th August, 1945.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nI have just received a report from Inspector Hamilton regarding his inspection of Norway House Residential School.\n\nIn 1943 we supplied material for a wooden stairway which the Fire Inspector considered to be necessary. This stairway was to be erected by the school management but I understand that they have not done so. Please arrange to have Mr. Jones erect this stairway immediately. If the school cannot handle all the work, you may hire some assistants. You should report to this office when the stairway is completed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 29th August, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Norway House Indian Residential School\n\nThe report received from Inspector Hamilton in connection with the above school reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The northwest corner of the foundation has moved out and is in bad condition. The north foundation wall is badly cracked. I consider the condition serious and I think the Department should obtain expert advice from a qualified engineer as to how the condition can best be remedied.\"\n\nI would appreciate if you could arrange to have one of your officials visit Norway House to inspect this building and submit a report to this office.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nVULCAN IRON WORKS LIMITED\nWinnipeg, Canada.\n\nAugust 25, 1945.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n528 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian School & Hospital, Norway House.\n\nWe have noted Mr. M. CalBejo's, Chief Inspector, Dept. of Labor, letter addressed to you dated August 18, 1945, listing the repairs necessary for the coming heating season to the boilers for above school and hospital and would advise that we are able to take care of this work for you on the same basis as the repairs made by us in 1942, namely that the charges would be $1.50 per hour for our man's time from the time he leaves the plant until he returns plus all expenses. The time would be charged on the basis of a nine hour working day.\n\nWe are also advised by John Plaxton Company that they are in a position to take care of the steam fitting work and that their charges would be on the same basis as ours. It would be our suggestion that our boilermaker and the steamfitter should leave at the same time so that they would be of some assistance to one another. We also understand that the engineer at the school and the hospital would work with the men.\n\nThe back section of the Cast Iron Junctional Boiler is in stock in Winnipeg and has been set aside for this particular job.\n\nMr. DelBejo's letter is returned herewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nVULCAN IRON WORKS LIMITED\nPer: \"E. Anderson\"\nSales Engineer.\n\nEnc. 1.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Ontario.\n\nRe: Boilers - Norway House Agency.\n\nMr. M. Del Regio, Chief Inspector, Department of Labour in the Provincial Government, inspected the boilers at the Norway School and Hospital and made the following recommendations:\n\n\"School - Norway House: I wish to draw your attention to the boilers at the school, which are in the following conditions:\n\n\"#1 Boiler -- tubes are leaking very badly at both ends and if this is allowed to continue much longer, it will be necessary to re-tube this boiler. Recommend that these tubes be rerolled as soon as possible or before the heating season commences, also replace broken try-cocks on water column.\n\n\"#2 Boiler -- replace the missing water glass. The back hand hold in combustion chamber is now leaking and is badly reduced by corrosion. A new gasket could be replaced to make this join tight. I, however, would recommend that this hole be sealed by welding as this leak seems to prevail at every inspection. Both return pipes of boilers have pitting through and are now leaking, same should be replaced at once.\n\n\"Also recommend that a larger sump hole with an automatic pump be installed in boiler pit to remove water which is leaking through the walls and if this condition is allowed to continue, it will destroy the boiler foundation.\n\n\"Hospital - Norway House: The cast section of the boiler which was installed new, a couple of years ago, has a cracked section at the back which is leaking badly and should be replaced as soon as possible before the heating season starts.\n\n\"Also replace broken try-cock in the vertical boiler.\"\n\nI took this up with Mr. Anderson of the Vulcan Iron Works and enclose a copy of his letter. To carry the plan out would cost at least $425.00 plus material.\n\nMr. Stevenson, the Engineer at Norway House, was in to get the Diesel Tractor and I talked this over with him. He stated that since the erection of the sawmill at Island Lake was to be left over he would have time to do this work. In the case of Boiler #2 he would use a new gasket for lack of welding equipment.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 9)\nIn company with Mr. Stevenson I went to see Mr. Anderson and he has agreed to send up all the repair parts on the next boat and added he was sure Mr. Stevenson could do the work. He stated that his Company was reluctant to spare a man for twelve days (necessary time for the trip) but they could not refuse if we were stuck.\n\nI feel confident Mr. Stevenson will do satisfactory work and think we are fortunate in having a man as capable. I do think we should provide him with a complete welding outfit and in doing this work I am sure he has saved the price of one.\n\nI phoned Ashdowns and they said a complete outfit would cost approximately $145.00, f.o.b. Winnipeg, listed as follows:\n\n| Outfit No. 22ST | $111.25 |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| Cutting Torch No. 3890 | 25.20 |\n| 15 lbs.

He has drawn up plans in accordance with those we agreed upon when you inspected the school building last June; i.e.: using slides instead of stairways.\n\n\"A requisition for the materials necessary has gone forward to Ottawa, and the work will be proceeded with as soon as possible.\n\n\"I have asked Mr. Jones to have a plan of each floor drawn as per the request of the Provincial Authorities, and the same will be forwarded when complete.\n\n\"It seems to me that the original Blue Prints of this building must be on file in Ottawa, and that copies of these, which would be more accurate and satisfactory, could be obtained from there.\"\n\nI might say while I was at Norway House the pole idea was discussed; but I made it clear I would not issue instructions contrary to the Fire Inspector, but would discuss the matter with him and this I did. You will note I made it clear in my letter that pole fire escapes will not be approved. I might add that the Fire Inspector objects to the pole escapes, on the verandah, and...\nthe reason he wants a floor plan is to decide if we may retain them or if stairways are to be erected. You will find we were obliged to do away with the pole system at the Portage School and build stairways on the rear verandahs.\n\nMr. Jones and Mr. Goodman should, I think, receive definite instructions from Ottawa concerning this matter. I understand material for the recommended fire escapes was supplied in 1943 and surely when warehouses, residences and boats can be built, these fire escapes can be erected as per instructions. An air mail letter which will catch the next boat will be the quickest means of communication.\n\nPlease also see the eighth paragraph of my report on the Norway House Residential School, dated August 23rd.\n\nA.G.

This letter did not reach us until September 16th and we immediately wrote Inspector Hamilton authorizing him to purchase and ship the materials requested.\n\nIt is hoped that these materials together with the material supplied several months ago will be sufficient to complete the fire escape, which I hope will be built immediately, as the school authorities promised to do this work.\n\nWe have a report from the Fire Prevention Branch of Manitoba in which they are very critical of the delay in the erection of this fire escape. I understand that you received advice regarding the fire escape from the Fire Inspector and in the best interests of the children you should carry out his recommendations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend Jos.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer\n\nHMG/G\nDecember 13, 1945.\n\nRe: Indian Residential School,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nIn reply to the notation dated August 31st last, requesting our views regarding stability of foundation walls at the above school building as covered in Mr. Hays' memorandum to you dated August 29th, 1945 we are now in receipt of a letter from Mr. D.B. Gow, enclosing a report prepared by Mr. J.T. Rose. It is explained that transportation difficulties delayed an inspection of the building, but eventually our officer was able to secure accommodation on a Manitoba Forestry Branch aeroplane, which allowed only a brief time at the site.\n\nIn his letter Mr. Gow requests that this office recommend which of the methods of repairing the foundation walls outlined in the report is considered the most suitable under the conditions involved.\n\nWe have examined the report and although the information submitted is not as complete as could be desired, a summary has been prepared and the result of our analysis follows:\n\nGENERAL DATA\n\nThe basement foundation walls are 12\" thick and appear to be of medium grade concrete. No steel reinforcement is apparent and was not called for on Indian Affairs drawings or in specifications on file in this office. The walls are 12 feet in height, 6 feet being below present grade. The footings, as closely as can be ascertained by scale from the original drawings are of plain concrete 2 feet wide by 8 inches deep. The interior bearing walls are of concrete 8 inches thick. All foundation walls support a 3 storey and roof timber structure.\n\nWe calculate the load applied to the soil by the footings as approximately 2000 lbs. per sq. ft. Under ordinary soil conditions the footings should be adequate to support this load without settlement. The report, however, states that surface or other water finds its way to the clay sub-soil on which the footings bear, thus reducing the clay to a slumberous consistency, which is unsuitable as a supporting soil. No evidence is available that sub-soil drainage has been provided. No information as to the construction of the basement floor slab is given in the report, whereas original Indian Affairs drawings and specification conflict in thickness of slab and base. These details are noted in view of the reported damaged conditions of basement floors which appears later in this summary.\n\nA report received by Mr. Gow subsequent to the inspection by Mr. Rose, indicates rock formation at 11 feet below grade line. This depth to rock was obtained at a sump located in the furnace room ashpit. It may be assumed, therefore, that rock strata as a\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nbearing material is present below the N.W. foundation walls, although without further investigation we can offer no opinion regarding variations in depth below grade for the portions of walls affected.\n\nEXISTING CONDITIONS\n\n(a) Defective Foundation Walls:-\nBoth exterior and interior bearing walls at the N.W. side of the building are reported to show cracks to a considerable extent. Exterior walls are as much as 4 inches out of plumb, with consequent bulging of frame walls above. Eleven major cracks are evident at openings and at intermediate points in the foundation walls, and spalling of concrete around cracks indicates progressive movement. Some of these cracks show larger widths at the bottom of the walls than at the top, indicating typical sliding and settlement of footings apparent in soil that has become saturated to gumbo consistency. Surface water enters the basement through these cracks and cold air from outside causes difficulty in heating area adjacent to cracks.\n\nOur conclusion is that the damaged walls are unstable and dangerous to the safety of the structure.\n\n(b) Damage to Interior Bearing Walls and Basement Floor:-\nIt is evident from the data furnished that some interior basement walls are also defective. Movement is indicated by visible fractures, and it is our opinion that this movement will continue as long as the variable sub-soil moisture conditions exist. The basement floor slab shows cracks and surface deterioration to the extent that floor drainage is difficult. The furnace room and ash pit are reported to be in a particularly bad condition.\n\n(c) Damage to Verandah:-\nThe settlement of verandah piers has caused damage to beams, floors and columns. The verandah is three storeys in height.\n\nREMEDIAL MEASURES\n\n(a) Drainage of sub-soil and Diversion of Rainwater:-\nThe report suggests installation of eavestroughing and leaders as a means of protecting the foundations from roof water, as well as tile drainage to rectify subsurface moisture conditions. It is felt that in lieu of eavestroughing and leaders a concrete channel of adequate proportions, draining away from the building should be constructed along the north and west walls, with a 4\" thick concrete apron laid for a width of 4 feet shutting the foundation walls. This would serve to divert seasonal water from the immediate vicinity of the foundation walls and footings.\n\nIt is also recommended that a tile drain be laid along the outside of the north and west foundation walls at a proper depth so that the sub-soil in the vicinity of the northwest portion of the building may be stabilized. In the absence of a site plan giving locations, distances and contours, a definite estimate for sub-soil drainage cannot be made. From a sketch plan in this office dated 1910, however, a general idea may be gained on which to base an approximate estimate of $2,300.00 for sub-soil drainage.\nchannel and concrete apron is roughly estimated to cost $150.00.\n\nAt a later date, after the sub-soil has attained a sufficient moisture stability, the damaged basement floors could be renewed or repaired as required.\n\n(b) Verandah:-\n\nIt appears to be necessary to carry piers to rock and renew and repair damaged superstructure. The extent of damage is not reported, but from an examination of the original drawings an approximate estimate of $600.00 seems reasonable.\n\n(c) Paved Concrete Playground:-\n\nIt will be necessary when excavating along a portion of the length of the damaged foundation walls to remove some concrete pavement. For removing and relaying this pavement a sum of approximately $90.00 should be allotted.\n\n(d) Foundation Walls:-\n\nThree methods of repairing the foundation walls are suggested in the report. First - To construct a new 30 inch wide by 12 inch deep reinforced concrete footing under the existing footing and replace existing walls with 6 inches of reinforced concrete dowelled to the walls. Second - To remove and replace the two damaged walls with new reinforced concrete walls supported on concrete caissons carried down to rock; for this the estimated cost is given as $2,500.00. Third - To place tie-rods the length of the existing walls to prevent movement, then construct caissons to rock with reinforced concrete beams under the existing footings. The estimated cost for this method is given as $1,500.00.\n\nWe recommend that the third method be adopted. By this method the walls would be tied and plumbed, with cracks well grouted and rendered watertight. As the depth of rock below grade is not definitely known, a unit price for excavation, concrete caissons and reinforced concrete work should be stated in any tender so that deductions or additions to cost of the work may be made.\n\nWe may summarize the cost of work considered necessary to stabilize the damaged walls and to rectify sub-surface moisture conditions at the northwest portion of the building, as follows:-\n\n| Item                                                                 | Cost   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| (1) Construct caissons and beams under two damaged foundation walls and tie walls with tie-rods | $2,000.00 |\n| (2) Lay sub-surface drainage pipe                                    | $2,300.00 |\n| (3) Remove and relay concrete pavement                               | $90.00  |\n| (4) Construct concrete channel and apron                             | $150.00 |\n| (5) Repair verandah                                                   | $600.00 |\n| (6) Transportation, Workmen's Comp. etc.                             | $100.00 |\n| (7) Contingencies and Supervision                                     | $760.00 |\n| (8) Total                                                             | $5,900.00 |\n\nIn view of the location of the building and the transportation and labour problems which may be encountered this approximate estimate can only be considered a minimum.\n\nThe condition of the foundations is hazardous and immediate consideration should be given by the Indian Affairs Branch to the repairs outlined herein.\n\n(Over)\nWe are attaching three sheets of photographs, together with two blueprints showing (a) locations of damaged walls and (b) diagramatic sketches showing suggested remedial treatment for the walls.

You will note that the walls in their present condition prejudice the safety of the structure, and repairs should be effected as soon as conditions permit.\n\nThe report of Mr. J.T. Rose, of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau at Winnipeg, estimates $6900 will be required for repairs, this amount being stated as a minimum. However, as there would be further deterioration over the present winter, together with the high cost of having the work done, it is suggested that $8000 be provided in your 1946-47 Estimates.\n\nIn the meantime, it is suggested you make inquiries from your Indian Agent as to the possibility of labour being available at Norway House, so the work could be undertaken on a day labour basis under the supervision of one of our engineers next spring.\n\nDirector.\nCredit Advice\n\nDecember 10th, 1945.\n\nThe following remittance has been received from Indian Agent B.

Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nThe Department has received a lengthy report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch regarding the condition of the foundation walls at the Norway House Residential School.\n\nConsiderable expenditure will be required to effect repairs that are believed necessary, and it is our intention to include these in our estimates for the fiscal year 1946-47. At the present time I am not certain if the item will be allowed, but it is likely that favourable consideration will be given to it.\n\nIn the meantime, we would like to know what possibility there will be of securing labour at Norway House, so that the work could be done on a day labour basis, under the supervision of an engineer. In the event of the work proceeding, I presume that nothing could be done until the latter part of June or early July, and therefore the labour required would be necessary at that time. Please make enquiries and let me have as complete information as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Agency       | Firm                                      | Article                                      | Cost   | P.O. |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|------|\n| Norway House | J H Ashdowne                               | Repairs to Heating System                    | 117.21 | 1602 |\n|              | John Leslie                                | Material for NEW Boat                        | 144.04 | 877  |\n|              | D Auckland & Sons Ltd                      |                                              | 216.27 | 863  |\n|              | Brown & Rutherford Ltd                     |                                              | 197.89 | 864  |\n|              | J W Porter Ltd                             | Building Renovation for Boat                 | 77.00  | 861  |\n|              | N.H.

JOSEPH JONES\nPRINCIPAL\n\nDecember 28th 1945\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago I received a list from Inspector Hamilton of supplies that could be secured from the War Assets Corporation. I made an estimate of our needs from the list and forwarded it to our Church headquarters. This list was forwarded on the first of February 1945 but no response up to this date. I am therefore sending a list to you which I trust you will forward to the department for attention.\n\nI will make out three lists as I think they varied articles will be handled by different departments.\n\nFirst list will be clothing items taken from the list supplied by your department per Inspector Hamilton.\n\nSecond list will be for equipment for our Manual Training Department. I have at present a boat under construction 36 feet long by 8 ft. 6 inch beam which will be completed by Spring and ready for launching. I need an engine for this boat of 35 h.p., heavy duty. Specifications for shaft and propeller I will submit later when I know the type and power of engine available. I prefer a diesel but if not procurable a gasoline engine of the same power will be satisfactory. I understand that a number of these small marine engines are listed with the War Assets Corporation.\n\nThe Third item is an enquiry regarding Landing Barges. Our School and Agency have to haul wood fuel long distances by water, we have to run the barge close inshore to load the wood. I am sure the \"Landing Barge\" would be ideal for our purpose. Do you know if a catalogue can be obtained giving description of the barges.\n\nIf you can give me any information concerning the method by which I can obtain equipment from the War Assets Corporation, I shall be very grateful.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nCredit Advice\n\nJanuary 17th, 1946.\n\nThe following remittance has been received from Indian Agent E.

JOSEPH JONES\nPRINCIPAL\n\nNORWAY HOUSE, MAN.\n\nFeb. 7th 1946\n\nMr Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Mr Hamilton,\n\nThe boat we have been building is just about complete as far as we can go until we receive the shaft propeller, clutch, stern bearing, and intermediate bearings. On another sheet I will give the details of these requirements.\n\nIn the school Estimates for the present year there are items to cover the cost of Engine and the fittings.\n\nIt is possible that the Department could procure a Deisel engine from the War Assets Corporation that would be ideal for our boat.\n\nIt will be much easier for me to transfer the boat from the shop to the lake before the ice goes out, then I can put the engine in when navigation opens.\n\nI would like to get the fittings as early as possible as these will have to be installed before the boat is in the water.\n\nThe boys have taken a great interest in the construction of the boat and are becoming quite clever in handling tools. The Indians of the reserve are pleased to see their boys receiving this type of training.\n\nOur pupils are well and happy and I trust they will maintain this high standard of health right through the year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\nList of requirements for 36 foot boat being built at the above school. These should be shipped to Wawbowdon on the H.B.Railway.\n\n1 only Gooderich Standard Stern casting, for one & one eight shaft, I have the Cutless bearing for the casting. See Fig 187 John Leckie Ltd catalogue, 183 James St East Wpg.\n\n1 only Universal Joint for one & one-eight shaft Fig 169\n\n1 only \"ship Shape\" coupling for 1 L/8\" Fig.170\n\n3 only Shaft bearings for 1.1/8\" Fig 172 # 27 Bearing only required I have the thrust bearings.\n\n1 only Monel shaft 1 & 1/8th Dia. length as per drawing. straight shaft with keyways both ends and castle nut at propeller end. I do not know the type of propeller I shall require until I know the type of engine to be installed, but the width of propeller will be about the same for an eighteen or twenty inch propeller. So I have given the length of shaft required up to the end of Stern bearing, the width of propeller and for castle nut to be added to the length. The shaft must be on Monel as its tensile strength is almost double that of steel or bronze. The shaft log is already bored for this 1 -& 1/8\" shaft.\n\nShaft from coupling to shaft log shaft log stern bearing\n\n12' 8\" 5' 9 1/8 5 1/8\" Prop\n\nIndian Affairs.

B. Goodman at Norway House Agency and recorded in the Official Cash Book.\n\nAmount $110.00\n\nAgency Receipt No. 35233\n\nPayer Indian Residential School, on account of electric light and power, Rev. Jos. Jones.\n\nApril 1946 - Revenue 114.\n\nFor Treasury Branch.\nR.A. Hoey, Director Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa\n\nWould you please advise me as to ownership of Residential School property. It seems to me the interests of the Indian Affairs Branch should be taken care of. Already 300 cords of wood have been sold by the Principal, Reverend Joseph Jones, to the Selkirk Navigation company. This wood, which I believe was paid for by Government money could have been used by us and saved time, money and labor next winter.\n\nI understand there is still a considerable amount of wood on hand not yet sold. There are several buildings that are of value to the Indian Affairs Branch. There is also livestock, such as horses, pigs and poultry. I do not know what interest or say in this matter the United Church has and would be glad of your advice. All the buildings on Hope Island, which were part of the school have been disposed of and removed by Mr. Jones since he took over as Principal. I would like to be given the opportunity to have some say in the disposition of this property on behalf of the Indian Affairs Branch. Mr. Jones was away at the time of the fire and I have no definite information as to when he will return, but should he return on the next boat, I would be leaving almost immediately for Oxford House.\n\nPlease advise me as to what line of action I should take in this matter.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 19, 1946.\n\nMr. E. B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have been expecting to receive a complete report from you regarding the fire. The only information that we have received in this connection is your telegram of May 29. Your letter was discussed with the Director yesterday and he was very anxious to receive a very complete report, indicating the buildings that were saved and the equipment that is still available.\n\nThe wood to which you refer was purchased by the school management from school funds and, consequently, they are at liberty to sell to whom they please. I regret that the Principal has evidently not shown any spirit of co-operation with you, in view of the fact that you could have used the wood for other agency purposes.\n\nWhat has been said regarding the wood applies also to the live stock, such as horses, pigs and poultry. The expenditure for their purchase was made from school funds.\n\nThe main building and all the outbuildings are the property of the Department and should not be sold or torn down without receiving our permission. You should so inform Reverend Mr. Jones.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nI propose that the old hospital building be turned into a two room day school. The entire first floor could be cleaned out and made into classrooms and the second floor could be used as living quarters for the two teachers. The basement could be cleared out and used as a gymnasium and a workshop for manual training. If the hospital is built on the proposed site this will involve a new Doctor's residence. The present Doctor's residence could be used as Clerk's quarters.\n\nI understand that no building is to be done in this locality until 1947. With the burning of the Residential School, 50 children from Norway House had to be returned to their homes, which means that another year that there are an extra 50 children who will have to attend day schools. If no building is proposed before next summer, I believe there are enough buildings around the Residential School to provide accommodation for these children this winter. There is a new gymnasium, which could be converted into a classroom, and there is a very good store building which the school used as a warehouse. Both these buildings would make excellent classrooms for the winter.\n\nThe turning of the Residential School certainly complicates the picture, but I believe in the long run, it is all for the good. We have got rid of an old fire trap of a building, which was going to cost a lot of money to repair the foundations. There was no loss of life and no particular loss of other property. With the building of a new hospital, that leaves the old hospital building as a large day school, which should take care of all the educational needs of this reserve together with the day schools at the Catholic Mission and the Anglican Mission. I see no reason to rebuild boarding schools in this Agency.\nNorway House, Manitoba\n5 June, 1946.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 29th which arrived by the first boat. I have given the matter of the disposition of the old hospital building considerable thought. Since the destruction of the Residential School by fire, several previously unconsidered possibilities have arisen. I would like to suggest that the building be remodelled into a 2 room day school. The ground floor could be used for classrooms, the top storey for living accommodation for teaching personnel and the basement for manual training and club rooms for the women's homemakers of Rossville. Further, as the hospital will be moved to a different location, the doctor's house will be empty and I suggest that this be used as residence for the new clerk.\n\nFor school accommodation during the coming academic year including the present Rossville Day School, there are three buildings, the other two being the senior classroom of the residential school, which was a separate building, and of the same size as the present day school, and the gymnasium which is approximately the same size and which has heating and electric light. The principal's residence could be used to house the 3 teachers who would be required.\n\nWith regard to the remodelling of the hospital building, I estimate that it would take from $2500 to $3000 for remodelling. This figure would not include the purchase of school furnishings, such as desks, blackboards, etc. I would\nlike to point out that, at the time of the fire, there were 95 children in the school. Fifty four of these were practically living in their own back yard and were able to walk home for breakfast. Thirty two came from Cross Lake and the balance from inland. The 3 suggested Day Schools at Rossville would provide temporary accommodation for approximately 105 children.\n\nI submit the foregoing for your consideration.\n\n(Sgd.) E. B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nJune 20, 1946.\n\nMr. E. B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to provision that can be made to operate a day school at Norway House during the academic year 1946-47.\n\nYour suggestions re the use of the old hospital building and the doctor's house as a two-room day school and clerk's residence respectively seem very sound. However, as I understand from the Medical Branch that the construction of a new hospital at Norway House has not yet commenced, it does not solve our immediate problem, namely, the provision of school facilities for the year 1946-47.\n\nWould you kindly provide answers to the following questions:\n\n(a) What buildings are still available on the site of the burned out school?\n\n(b) How many class-rooms can be provided by the use of these buildings?\n\n(c) Will the use of the class-rooms in (b) plus the Rossville Day school-rooms provide sufficient day school facilities at Norway House for the coming winter?\n\nThe above information plus the report requested in our letter of 19 June will clarify your present situation and will enable us to discuss future plans with Dr. Corrigan, who, I am informed, expects to visit Ottawa about the first week in July.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAt about 3:30 A.M. on the 29th instant I was awakened by an Indian from the Reserve who told me the United Church Indian Residential School was on fire. I immediately dressed and proceeded to the scene by canoe, after having aroused the prisoners and escort and instructed them to follow. On arrival I found the whole building enveloped in flames.\n\nOn arrival I was informed by a member of the staff that all children had been evacuated and that no one had been injured or burned. Numerous Indians were on hand and patrols were established to guard against the Hospital and other buildings in proximity to the school catching fire. At one time it was feared the principal's residence would ignite and the household furnishings were removed, but the building was saved and things were later moved back in.\n\nWhen the danger of the fire spreading was overcome I made enquiries as to the possible origin of the blaze. I was informed by Mr. Organ, acting principal in the absence of Rev. Joseph Jones who left on the 28th instant on a business trip to Winnipeg, that he was roused by one of the older boys at approximately 2:00 A.M. He found that the woodshed, which is an addition of the kitchen wing, was ablaze. He stated the services of a night watchman had been dispensed with Apr. 15th and that there had been no furnace fire on, the only fire being one in the small water heater in the furnace room. He stated he had made a round of the entire building at 10:30 P.M. and found everything in order. At the time of the fire there was approximately one cord of 4 foot wood in the woodshed, which opened into the furnace room, and there was quite an accumulation of chips and bark on the floor. Mr. Organ and some of the boys immediately got out firehoses, after having rang the alarm, but they found the hoses were inadequate and that the water pressure was not sufficient to reach the heart of the blaze, although they were able to restrict it to the woodshed for sometime before the kitchen above caught fire. Once the kitchen caught the fire spread rapidly throughout the whole building.\n\nThey were able to hold the fire in check long enough that with the help of numerous Indians most of the furnishings of the building and all records were salvaged. Some of the members of the staff lost their personal belongings.\n\nDonald BEARDY, 15 years, the Indian lad who gave the alarm, was questioned and he stated he awake and smelled smoke, on looking out the window he saw flames coming out of the woodshed and immediately woke up the other boys and reported to Mr. Organ who gave the general alarm. He and other boys were questioned as to whether they had seen anyone in the vicinity of that part of the building after dark or if any of them had been smoking in the woodshed. As far as can be ascertained...\nRe: Indian Residential School, Norway House, Man.\n\nDestruction by Fire:\n\n5. (Continued) CAN BE ASCERTAINED no one was seen around that part of the building after dark nor have any of the boys admitted smoking in the vicinity of the woodshed. It is possible someone dropped a cigarette butt in the chips and bark on the floor of the shed and it smoldered and eventually ignited the refuse on the floor. During the enquiries Mr. D.H. Learmonth, Manager of the Hudson's Bay Co. store at Rossville, which is approximately 200 yards west of the school, stated he retired at about 11:00 P.M. and left the windows open. Sometime after he smelled smoke and twice got up and checked the Company buildings for possible fire but could not locate anything. At the time there was a very slight breeze from the east but we did not notice anything amiss at the school until the alarm was sounded. This would tend to substantiate the theory that the fire was smoldering for sometime before it was noticed at 3:00 A.M. by young BRANDY.\n\n6. At 7:00 A.M. the following message was dispatched by A.P. Airlines Radio to the Officer Commanding, Winnipeg Sub-Division:\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL HERE COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY FIRE EARLY MORNING TODAY STOP ALL CHILDREN AND STAFF MEMBERS ACCOUNTED FOR AND NO ONE INJURED STOP COMPLETE REPORT BY MAIL.\n\n7. The Matron, Mrs. Rollins, sent messages to the various Reserves from which the children are drawn notifying everyone that the children were safe. A message was also dispatched to Berens River for delivery to Rev. Jones who is a passenger aboard the S.S. Keenora bound for Winnipeg.\n\n8. All children and staff members are being billeted and cared for at the agency, and adjacent homes.\n\n9.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton,\n\nI beg to submit a report of the fire which destroyed Norway House Residential School on the 29th of May, 1946. The fire broke out in the wood storage pit on the outside of the building, adjoining the furnace room. When the fire was discovered the outside of the building was burning. The fire hoses from the third and second floors were immediately brought into operation, but the supply of water was inadequate to cope with the fire.\n\nThe children were removed at once when the fire was discovered. They were marched out onto the campus and counted.\n\nWhen it was found impossible to put out the flames the staff proceeded to salvage as much of the contents as possible. The local Indians gave every possible assistance. Some of the staff have lost personal possessions.\n\nSomething will have to be done at once to provide water connection with the Principal's residence and Engineer's residence. Some temporary work has been done, but this work will have to be completed before the frost comes. I will interview Engineer Cow at the earliest opportunity and discuss with him the best means of doing this work.\n\nI had left Norway House by boat Tuesday noon, the day before the fire and could not return until I got into Winnipeg.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. Jones,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIn Mr. Hamilton's absence, I am forwarding a report submitted by the Rev. J.

Neary.\n\nIn reply to your letters of June 12 and 20th and further to my telegram re the burning of the Residential School, the Residential School was totally destroyed by fire which had its origin in a lean-to woodshed. The fire occurred at about 3 A.M. on the 29th May. I was away at the time with Dr Corrigan at Warren's Landing. None of the outbuildings were in any way damaged. These comprise a workshop, gymnasium, ice house, teachers shop, barn, senior classroom, principal's residence, and paint shop. This latter (the paint shop) Mr Jones claims does not belong to the Department. I also submit a list of physical assets, which have been submitted to me by Reverend Joseph Jones. I believe that considerable equipment such as bedding, furniture, clothing etc was rescued before the school burned down but of this I have no definite knowledge.\n\nIn your letter of the 20th you ask what provision can be made for schools at Norway House for the years 1946-47. In answer to your questions: (a) There are 2 buildings which could very easily be used as day schools. There is a senior classroom which is fully equipped and the same size as Rossville day school and there is the gymnasium which is somewhat larger and would make an excellent day school. This would have to be equipped with blackboards, teacher's desk and chair and 40 single desks, 15 large, 10 medium, and 15 small size. (b) These buildings together with the present Rossville day school should provide 3 day schools which would accommodate about 125 pupils. (c) These 3 buildings will not accommodate all the children of school age in this community but it will accommodate more from this community than before the fire. It will be necessary to use the principal's residence for living accommodation for the 3 teachers required for these schools, otherwise there is no accommodation here for them.\n\nBefore the fire there were 54 Norway House pupils in the Residential School. The Rossville day school, which is old, decrepit and should be condemned accommodated the balance and was most of the time overcrowded as a refusal of the quarterly returns. It shows that this time I would also like to point out that there is an excellent Anglican day school at Jack river which was closed all last year owing to the fact that there was no teacher provided. There are 62 children who should be attending this school and I would suggest that the matter be brought to the attention of Bishop J. Lofthouse at Kenora who nominates the teacher.\n\nI presume that you have seen Dr Corrigan and that you have got a great deal of information from him regarding the burning of the school and I trust that I have supplied what information you require. I have just returned from paying treaty inland, hence the delay in replying to your letter.\n\nE. B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 15, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWe have just received a letter dated July 5 from Indian Agent Goodman with regard to the arrangements that could be made for teaching services at Norway House during the academic year 1946-47. The Agent's report reads in part as follows:\n\n\"(a) There are 2 buildings which could very easily be used as day schools. There is a senior classroom which is fully equipped and the same size as Rossville Day School and there is the gymnasium which is somewhat larger and would make an excellent day school.

It will be necessary to use the Principal's residence for living accommodation for the 3 teachers required for these schools, otherwise there is no accommodation here for them.\"\n\nYou will note that the Indian Agent suggests the use of the Principal's residence for the teachers. Will this building be available for this purpose or does Mr. Jones intend to remain at Norway House?\n\nIf living accommodation is available for the\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nActing Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\nteachers, I would appreciate it if you would nominate three teachers for this school.\n\nAn early reply would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nIn the absence of Dr. Dorey on holidays, I am replying to your letter of July 15th, in which you give the Agent's report on arrangements that are being made for conducting three day schools at Norway House. The big item of concern is to secure the teachers. I have already written to Dr. Cormie, our Superintendent of Missions, asking him to give this his immediate attention.\n\nSo far as securing a place for the teachers to stay is concerned, - we have a letter from Rev. Jos. Jones, dated July 6th, and in it he states that, in all likelihood Mrs. Jones could take in two of the teachers, and the other missionary, Mr. McLeod, would likely look after one.\n\nWe shall write you again as soon as we hear from Dr. Cormie.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMCM.MIT\n\nJUL 19 1946\n\nREGISTERED\nOttawa, July 24, 1946.\n\nMr. E.B. Goodman, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nEducational Plans for Norway House.\n\nOn receiving your letter of July 5th, I immediately wrote to Doctor Dorey with regard to the arrangements that could be made for teaching services at Norway House during the academic year 1946-47.\n\nI am attaching a copy of a letter which I received today from Reverend M.G. Macdonald, in this connection.\n\nI will contact you immediately on hearing of teachers being nominated so that you can proceed further with the plans which you outline in your letter.\n\nI have ordered the desks which you requested (forty in all). I would also ask that you consider the requisitioning of further supplies, such as, blackboards, sanitary supplies and school books.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnclosure:\nIn reply to your letter of Jul 6 1946,\nI have interviewed Mr Jones and Mr Stevenson and together\nwe have gone over the ground where we will have to\nre-organize our plumbing and sewage owing to the burning\nof the Residential School and I submit in detail, the\nestimate of labor and material required for this work.\n\nEstimate of Labour\n\n| Item                                      | Quantity | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|--------|\n| 1/2\" pipe galvanized 15 lengths, 20 ft length each |          | $400.00|\n| 324 ft. 4\" sewer pipe                     |          |        |\n| Two 4\" sewer pipe Y's                     |          |        |\n| Two only one-quarter turn 4\" sewage pipe (Elbow) |          |        |\n| Two only one-eighth turn 4\" sewage pipe (Elbow) |          |        |\n| For salvage work and cleaning up debris and filling |          |        |\n| In old basement - 1 weeks work for 6 men ($25.00 per day equals $150.00) |          |        |\n\nMr. Stevenson will be proceeding on his\nholidays on 24 July but Mr Jones has signified his\nwillingness to supervise this job.\n\nK.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nI have been over the ground where the Residential School was burned down with Mr Stevenson. We inspected the 3000 Gallon Tank, which he states is damaged beyond repair. However we have found a 500 gal tank unamaged. This is capable of servicing the community without the load imposed by the Residential school when it was in operation. We have installed this tank in the power house and attached the air compressor and motor which are now in operation and giving satisfaction.\n\nThe chlorine has been doubled in the water supply and is being carefully checked by Mr Stevenson. There will be no need under existing conditions to purchase a new tank. It will be necessary to re-organize the plumbing and sewage in the vicinity of the whole school basement and I have submitted a report on this and the materials that will be required, and labour, so Mr Stevenson may see of which I enclose for your information. I have a gang of men employed digging the new trenches and will lay the sewage and water pipes in separate trenches at a considerable distance apart. It will not take long to complete this work after the required material arrives. It will require a gang of 6 men, working a full week to salvage any useful material from the ruins and to fill in the basement and push the old walls in, which are in a dangerous condition. This work also is proceeding.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 1, 1946.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n536 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nIndian Agent Goodman has forwarded to this office a copy of his letter to you of July 22nd, with reference to material required for repairing the plumbing and sewage at the Norway House School.\n\nPlease arrange for the purchase and shipment of material the Agent requested.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAIRMAIL.\n\nOttawa, August 1, 1956.\n\nMr. E.B. Goodman, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, regarding the Norway House School, it is noted that you can arrange to have five hundred gallon tank installed.\n\nI have written to Inspector Hamilton instructing him to purchase locally the material that you requested.\n\nI note that you estimate the cost of digging trenches, laying the sewage and water pipes at $400.00. This expenditure is approved. It is hoped that you can keep the cost below the amount mentioned.\n\nAn expenditure not exceeding $150.00 for labour in clearing the debris and filling in the old basement of the old school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMiss [signature],\n\nI have written correspondence re 300 gal tank at school. Eliminating water do not recall the file.

It is in fair condition and could be used for the Agency to very good advantage. For our purpose it would require a pulley and gear and a few minor repairs which would cost approximately $120.00.\n\nSince the tractor is on the spot, and the men who use it know it, it is requested that authority be granted for the purchase of this tractor and the necessary repairs. It would be used chiefly to drive the planer, the shingle mill and the edger, and when not thus employed could be used for hauling, ploughing, etc.\n\nE.B.

Mr. Jones, although absent at time of the fire, is of the opinion that this entry was not necessary, and classed it as wilful damage, turning the invoice for repairs over to this office.\n\nWould you kindly advise this office in the event of this voucher is not paid, so that same may be cancelled on records here.\n\nE. B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nThe work of filling in the old school basement has been completed and any material which was of value has been salvaged. The cost was higher than anticipated being $310.35. Please bear in mind that we have no equipment for doing such work and it all had to be done by hand with shovels. However the work has been well done and if the sewer drain pipe runs underneath survives the winter without freezing there will be no need for changing it. Thus considerable money will be saved from the $400.00 allowed for digging trenches and laying a new sewer. I see no reason why it should freeze and settle out a heavy layer of sand and shingles over the top. The laying of a new water line is also completed. The cost of which was $57.45 which was much less than anticipated. The material for this work we had on hand, so that providing the old sewer survives the winter there will be no need for further expenditure from the $400.00 allowed for this purpose.\n\nWould you kindly have the amount of $310.35 forwarded to this office, as these costs have been paid from School's account accountable advance which now shows a debit balance.\n\nFor R.

The father is a Protestant, and the mother is a graduate of several years ago, of the Norway House Boarding School, but at the time she sent the girl to the R.C.School was, I believe, considering becoming a Roman Catholic. As the family are away on their trapping grounds, I cannot interview them with regard to this latter point. Numbers 242, Thomas Anderson, and 243, William Anderson, of Norway House Residential School are brothers of Betsy, with the same father and mother. I understand that the father was opposed to sending the girl to the R.C. school, and placed her in the Protestant school.\n\nI have not heard that any effort was made by the authorities of the Jack River R.C.School to secure the admission of this girl to their school after it was made a Boarding School. It is probable that they tried, and were refused by the parents.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McKenzie, Esq.\nDept' of Indian Affairs\nOttawa........Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA little time ago Indian Agent Gordon of Norway House notified me that a discharge for three of our school boys had been recommended by the Department of Indian Affairs. These boys were as follows:\n\nNo. 242. William Anderson.\nNo. 221. Joe Muswagon.\nNo. 222. Geo. Paupenakis.\n\nI was considerably surprised to learn this as none of these discharges had been asked for by myself. William Anderson was on my suggestion and on the advice of Dr. Turpel allowed to remain with his parents for this current year in order that he might possibly become a little more robust. He was not considered tubercular but being but eight years of age and a little inclined to brood for his parents if he became in any measure indisposed, we thought it wise to let him go to the bush with them this year feeling quite certain that he would be fine another year. To have his discharge effected was far from our thought. The other two boys I had already taken steps to have them return at once to school since there had been no permission given by myself for them to remain away. On the day that their discharge was reported to me the latter of these boys presented himself at the school to again take his place. Of course all that I could do under the circumstances was to tell him of his discharge and send him home again.\n\nI am very much afraid that the action of the Department in recommending the discharge especially of Geo. Paupenakis may set a precedent that will make a good deal of trouble for the Principal of this school in the future. There has always been a very decided tendency on the part of the parents of children who are about to their final year, to attempt to get the children out before the expiration of their time. Two years ago out of a graduating class of fifteen pupils no less than eight were demanded at the opening of their final year. One did stay out and remained out as did another a year ago. Last summer when I was going about inland with the Treaty Party Indian Agent Gordon was very particular to impress on the people that they should not look to have their children removed until they were Eighteen years of age. In the case of Geo. Paupenakis no valid reason why he should be discharged was ever presented by his parents. I stood out for his return and with the result that he came in only to be sent home again. One other very undesirable aspect of this particular case is that in the regular round we this year find ourselves practically no large boys to manage out outside tasks. This boy had been carried by the school for several years and this year when we needed help we have been forced to hire from the outside. One very undesirable aspect of hiring outside help is that we find the outsiders are very apt to have an unsavoury influence on the other boys with whom they labor.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI am fully aware that the application forms read, \"Until discharged by the Indian Department.\" I would like however if you would please give me a ruling as to who is to take the initiative in discharges. I have had the thought that that duty rested in the first place on the Principal, as the man most conversant with the case in hand. I have had a lot of trouble with parents approaching the Indian Agent to demand the discharge of children and then coming to me with the statement that he had stated that the child should go home to stay and be discharged. Again when I have approached Indian Agent Gordon I find that he gave no definite promise at all. Still they assumed that what he stated was a permission, when perhaps all he stated was, \"We will see.\" It would solve the problem greatly if you would give a ruling as touching this matter.\n\nAs touching the above mentioned boys, it goes without saying that they now stand discharged for the present even though the copy of the letter sent by Mr. Gordon was explanatory of their absence rather than a recommendation for discharge.\n\nAs touching general matters pertaining to the school I beg to state that never have we had a better year that we are having this year. Our staff is working in the very best of harmony all round. A year ago we had unfortunately a couple members on our staff who were exceedingly lax in discipline in their departments. This spread itself to the other departments and gave me a good deal of continuous trouble. This year the staff are just fine and the discipline of the school has been a most satisfactory thing. We have practically no offences on the part of the children large or small and all are as happy as can be. Some children returning to school brought us an epidemic of whooping cough. We had over forty with it at once. It surely was strenuous period and at the end almost everyone was about worn to a \"Frazzle\" but we did not lose a child. When we learn of the terrific mortality out on the reserves we feel more than pleased that our care was so amply rewarded. Now it is all past and our monthly weight chart shows an almost universal increase in weight, Dr. Turpin's verdict is that never has he seen the school so well fed, dressed or so healthy. Almost every child is rosy and the picture of good health. Naturally we are very proud of the general appearance of our charges.\n\nOur policy has been one of, \"Plenty good plain wholesome food, Plenty of good warm clothes day and night with plenty of fresh air through exercise during the day and adequate ventilation at night without direct draft on their beds! We have striven to get Hope Island to producing hay and pasture and to that end have cleared and seeded to grass a considerable area. We have put the best sire of a dual purpose breed. During the cold secure at the head of our cows. Instead of bringing in cows that have not been acclimated, we are raising our own heifers. We have heifers now so that in two years more the school will have some Eighteen or Twenty cows. We are today milking ten fresh cows, and practically all that milk is being sterilized and going on the children's tables. All these things are telling on the condition of the pupil body of the school. I wanted while writing to report thus on the condition of the school. I trust that it will meet with your approval.\n\nI am Sincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 29th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School. From this letter, it appears that Reverend Mr. Shoup considers that pupils 221, 222 and 242 should not have been granted their discharge.\n\nWhile your letter of October 16th, last, did not definitely recommend the discharge of the above three pupils, the Department felt that, from the information contained in your letter, it was doubtful if these three boys would return to the school and it was, therefore, considered advisable to grant their discharge by official letter of November 7th.\n\nIt is inadvisable to retain on the quarterly return the names of any pupils who will be absent from the school for a considerable period of time due to illness. In the case of such pupils, application should be made for their discharge in order that their names may be removed from the return. If their health improves and it is again considered desirable to place them at school, application can be made for their re-admission.\n\nNo doubt, you consult the Principal before applying for the discharge of any pupil. The Department considers such action very desirable. In the event of a difference of opinion between yourself and the Principal regarding the discharge of any pupil, all the facts should be placed before the Department in order that we can decide whether or not the discharge should be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Besides, it is undesirable to keep on the return the names of pupils who are absent from the school for a considerable length of time. If their absence is due to medical reasons, application should be made for their discharge and, if their health improves at a later date, you could again apply for their re-admission.\n\nI feel certain that Mr. Gordon consults you before applying for the discharge of any pupil. The Department considers such a course advisable and, in order that there may be no misunderstanding in the matter, Mr. Gordon is being so advised. He is being further informed that, in the event of differences of opinion between yourself and the Agent regarding the discharge of any pupils, all the facts must be laid before the Department in order that we can decide whether or not the discharge should be granted.\n\nUnless under very exceptional circumstances, no pupil should be discharged from the Norway House School without your first having been advised by Mr. Gordon that such discharge is approved by the Department. Statements made by individual Indians regarding their interviews with the Agent need not be given any credence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

SHOUP\nPRINCIPAL\n\nNORWAY HOUSE, MAN.\nJune 30th, 1934.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, .......... Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nYour recent communication re children in this institution who have been reported as Sixteen years of age and over is before me. Replying to it I may state that when I took over the management of this school it was stated to me that there had been no fixed age for discharge of pupils fixed by the Government, but that for years the generally acknowledged age was Eighteen years. I have proceeded on that basis in my recommendations for Graduation and discharge. I was acquainted with the clause relating to attendance at school of Indian Children up to Sixteen years but did not think that that clause was to be read that no child should attend school after that maximum age, but if a child's parents wished the child to go longer that it was their option without further permission being secured. For these reasons the names have appeared on our reports as you have noticed.\n\nIn addition I would like to respectfully call your attention to this fact that has a decided bearing on any proposal to discharge any pupils simply because they are Sixteen. The school with the approval of the Government for instance takes a pupil in at the age of seven. Up to sixteen the pupil is not able to be of any very marked assistance with the regular work of the school except for lighter tasks. During the years from sixteen to eighteen we find the pupils are able to carry our heavier tasks and so take the place of help that would have to be hired from the outside. The present financial condition of our schools will not allow\nthe engagement of much outside help on current wages. And in addition to all this is the fact that my experience has been that outside help very frequently causes the management of an institution considerable trouble through the influence of the help on the pupil body.\n\nI trust that you will find these reasons entirely satisfactory to your Department management.\n\nI am herewith inclosing a list of children whose names appear on my return as being Sixteen years and over, with request for their continuance in the school,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Shoup's letter of the 30th ultimo, in connection with the circular letter issued by the Deputy Superintendent General on the 15th ultimo.\n\nThe latter letter did not state that children must be discharged when they reach the age of sixteen years, but it pointed out that the Indian Act requires that, when pupils reach sixteen years of age and it is desired to keep them in school for a further period, permission must be secured. In future, therefore, you should, at the end of each academic year, forward to the Department, through the office of your local Indian Agent, a list of the children in the Norway House Residential School who are sixteen years of age and over. In the case of those whom you consider should remain for a further period, permission should be requested to retain them, and, in each case, your reasons for making the request should be stated.\n\nIn Mr. Shoup's letter, he mentioned the following children whom he states are sixteen years of age or over and whom he considers should remain in the school for another year:\n\nJohn A.

In view of Mr. Shoup's request, permission is granted for the above mentioned children to remain in the Norway House School for another year, and, as mentioned above, you should, at the end of next June, bring their names, as well as any others who have reached sixteen years of age in the meantime, to the attention of the Department.

It simply points out that, when pupils reach that age and it is desired to keep them for a longer period, application should be made to the Department for permission to retain them. It is realized that there are often very good reasons for keeping pupils in a residential school, especially the girls, until they reach the age of eighteen. In all such cases, the Principal and yourself should discuss the matter carefully, keeping home conditions in mind, and report to the Department with a definite recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nNorway House, Man:\n27th February 1935.\n\nRef: 6-A\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Rev. R.T. Chapin, principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, has received an account from Wings Limited of Winnipeg, charging $162.00 for transportation by airplane, of 18 pupils from God's Lake and Island Lake to Norway House, at $9.00 each, when returning to school after holidays last summer.\n\nThere was an agreement apparently arrived at, whereby the parents should pay this transportation for their children, the mounts to be deducted from their earnings at the Island Lake Gold Mine, and in addition, the parents were to be supplied with the same rations as they would have received, had they transported the children by canoe.\n\nAs it turned out, the parents received their rations, amounting to $72.01 supplied from the personal stores of Mr Gavin Grieve, missionary at Island Lake, and $2.15 supplied from the personal stores of Mr Keith Armstrong, missionary at God's Lake, but the amounts of the fares were not collected from the parents and turned over to Wings Limited.\n\nMoreover, only 13 of the 18 pupils were pupils of the Norway House Residential School, the other 5 being pupils of the Jack River R.C. Day School.\n\nThe Rev. Mr Chapin, does not feel that he should be called upon to pay the above accounts to Wings Limited and the two missionaries, as he did not authorize this expenditure.\n\nWill you please advise me what should be done in the above matter, and if I should forward vouchers to the Department for the above accounts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.G.

You should obtain triplicate copies of the account and attach same to proper voucher forms. I am not certain from your letter whether or not Reverend Mr. Chapin has already paid the account. If so, you should obtain receipted accounts from Wings Limited and, in this case, the voucher should be prepared in Mr. Chapin's favour.\n\nIt should be distinctly understood both by yourself and the Principals of the Norway House and Cross Lake Schools that, in future, the Department will not consider payment of transportation expenses of pupils to and from these schools unless our authority has been obtained before the expenditure is incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Robinson, A. of this Detachment, and with Police dog-train I left the Detachment at 9.00 am. of the above date and proceeded to Rossville in an effort to ascertain the truth of this report and make necessary investigations. Upon arrival at the premises concerned I found out that this offence had occurred on the night of the 6th inst., entrance having been gained by breaking a couple of panes of glass in a window leading into the storehouse on the west side, also the dividing sash had been broken, probably by an axe, in order that the person would be able to crawl in; size of the aperture was 15in. x 20 in.; an opening of this size would only allow a small person to enter. I obtained a statement from William GALL - Clerk - who is always the first on the scene in the morning.\n\n3. STATEMENT OF WILLIAM GALL 12.3.35\n\nOn Saturday, March 9th, 1935 I opened Hyer's Ltd. store, where I am employed as a clerk, which is located on Mission Point, Rossville, at about 9.00am., when I went round to the rear for wood, I saw two panes of glass broken in a window in the store-house, which is a part of the store proper. I looked at the books and owing to being busy the day previous the cash sales were not put in the books. I cannot give a definitive amount missing, although there is some missing approx. \u00a38.00 or \u00a39.00. If the person or persons who broke in took anything from the store stock I could not tell that. I cannot place any suspicion on any person at all.\n\n(signed) Wm. Gall.\n\n4. I proceeded over to the Norway House Indian Boarding School and I interviewed Mr. J. Smith, one of the boys supervisors, in the absence of Rev. R. T. Chapin, Principal. In an effort to check up on some of the senior scholars who might be capable of pulling off a stunt of this kind, however the ones that may be under a faint suspicion, in the mind of Mr. Smith, were at that time out on the farm and would not be back until evening at any rate.\n\n5. At this stage I returned to the Detachment, arriving at 3.30pm. Shortly after my return, S/Cst.

Yesterday, March 11th, he sent the pants back for exchange, as they were too small. Zacharious Loomfoot and Nelson Flett, two other children from the school. Yesterday he gave me $4.00 to keep for him. I gave this to the Principal Rev. R. T. Chapin, I told him when questioned, that William Folster told me to keep it for him. Wm. Folster bought another knife yesterday he also gave Zacharious Loom-foot and Nelson Flett a nickel a piec for taking the pants back.\n\n(signed) Peter Loomfoot.\n\n7. 13.3.35\n\nI proceeded to the Indian Boarding school the above date, accompanied by S/Cst. Robinson and police dog-train, where I interviewed Rev. R. T. Chapin, Principal, who had the previous day taken the pants back to the store, the ones purchased by Folster had questioned him and had taken in addition to the pair of pants, the sum of $2.00 and from Peter Loom-foot he had received $3.00. Mr. Chapin stated that has the majority of the money Folster had claimed he had stolen, had now been returned, including the value of the pr. of pants $1.25, he requested me to wait the arrival of the Indian Agent before I interviewed the offender, he (Mr. Chapin) would be responsible for the safe custody of the child. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, was at Cross Lake and would return on the weekend, I complied with Mr. Chapin's request, the matter being left in abeyance.\n\n8. 19.3.35\n\nOn this date I proceeded on foot to Rossville, leaving at 8.45 am. Upon arrival at the Indian Agency I interviewed Rev. R. T. Chapin & P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, who was of the opinion that this boy should be punished in some way that would be an education to him, they did not favour the idea of him being sent out to Portage la Prairie Reformatory (Industrial School), but they did think that he should be put suspended sentence for one or two years and certain privileges taken away from him, which he would otherwise enjoy as an ordinary pupil at the school. This is what the above two officials will request from the Court, if this matter comes up for trial. The above with a rider that if Folster commits another offence, serious enough for Police action, he will forthwith receive sentence to go outside. I later interviewed Folster at the school and obtained from him the following statement, after being duly warned:\n\nP. T.O.\n9. STATEMENT OF WILLIAM FOLSTER\n\nOn Friday, March 8th, 1935 I was looking after the lighting engine and water pump at the Norway House Indian Boarding School, where I am a pupil. I started about 6:00pm. I was alone. About 8:00 pm, the same evening, I went in the direction of Hyer's store. I went to the side of the store, I noticed one window was broken and the other side was not. I broke the window and part of the sash and crawled through. I was by myself, I went to the cash drawer and took $7.00, this was made up of one dollar bills. I came back to the school. On Saturday I went to Campbell's store and purchased one pair of pants, 2 pkgs. chewing gum, 3 chocolate bars, 1 pocket knife and one pkg. candies. I paid for the above, I do not know how much. Peter Loonfoot was with me. We returned to the school. On Monday, March 11th, 1935 I sent Nelson Flett & Zacharius Loonfoot to Campbell's to change the pants, they were too small. They purchased a pocket knife, they brought a larger size back and I wore them, the same day Mr. Chapin saw me with the new pants on, he said \"You stole those pants I will go and tell Mr. Chapin\" he did not say this, I later gave them to Mr. Chapin, later he called me in the office. I had lost one knife playing but I gave Mr. Chapin the other one, and I confessed the theft. Four dollars was being kept by Peter Loonfoot another school boy, and one dollar was in the wood-pile, three of these dollars had been given to Mr. Chapin by Peter Loonfoot. Next day I got the other dollar off Peter and with the one dollar from the wood-pile, I gave Mr. Chapin the sum of $8.00.\n\nSigned:- Billy Folster.\n\n10. According to School records produced by Rev. R. T. Chapin William Folster was 13 yrs. of age September 23rd, 1934, according to this he was born Sept 23rd, 1921, he being at the present time 13 years and 6 months (Mar. 23rd.)\n\n11. Without prejudice, this boy has been a source of trouble at this school for some time past, he having been caught in the staff quarters with the idea of thieving, and also he was caught making home-brew in the basement, he having been punished by the school authorities for the above two mentioned offenses, these matters were not brought to the attention of this Detachment. According to information received this boy has had every chance to make good.\n\n12. In the event of a Prosecution against this Juvenile, I would respectfully request that I be advised by wires:- Appointment of a Deputy Juvenile Judge:- G. G. M. Collins, is Police Magistrate at this point, also if it would be agreeable to the Crown to Suspended Sentence in this case, in the event of the Court deciding in favour of it.\n\n13. Rev. R. T. Chapin, informed me that he would turn over to Hyer's Limited, Norway House, Man the sum of $5.25 ($5.00 received from Leon-foot and Folster and $1.25 received from Campbell Bros. when the pants were returned) I may say that, for business reasons, the aggrieved party, Hyer's Limited (Mr. L. Sundi, Manager,) did not wish a prosecution in this case.\n\n14. The parents of this boy, who resides in Norway House, have been advised of the circumstances, and will be duly notified prior to the trial.\n\nP.T.O.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n15. During the course of my investigation in this case I checked up the purchases made by Folster at Campbell Bros. Ltd., they have records of the purchase of pants and two knives, but no record of the gum, candy and chocolates. Other stores in the neighbourhood were also checked prior to Folster confessing.\n\n16. It is the rule at the Norway House Indian Boarding School, that if the pupils have any cash on their person it must be turned into the Principal, if at any time they wish to spend any, upon the discretion of the Principal they are given a slip stating how much they can spend.

R.T.

I trust that the action of the Principal and myself, in allowing the above boys to go trapping will have the Department's approval.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to be advise as to whether there are any special regulations regarding the summer holidays allowed for the two Residential Schools in this agency, namely the Norway House United Church School, and the Cross Lake R.C. School.\n\nThe Rev. R.T. Chapin, Principal of the Norway House Residential School has been in the office today in connection with this matter, as he only took charge of this school after the holidays last summer. The Principal states however, that he knows that the school holidays for the past five years at least, have been for two full months, namely July and August.\n\nMy understanding has always been that the residential schools were allowed 43 school days of holiday each year, for which the Department paid the full grant; and during the 11 years I was at the Birtle agency, the residential school there always closed at the end of June, and reopened about the 15th or 16th August.\n\nReference to the Principal's Return for the Norway House school for last September quarter, shows that none of the pupils attended school more than 19 days during that quarter, the school apparently being reopened about the 4th September.\n\nI should be glad to be advised in the above matter as soon as possible, in order that proper arrangements may be made for the coming summer vacation.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 9, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, giving the names of 8 boys who have been allowed to go trapping muskrats, in lieu of going on their holidays.\n\nThe action of the Principal and yourself in granting this permission is approved. It should be noted, however, that if the boys are absent from the school more than 43 days, grant should not be requested for the period their absence exceeds 43 days. As you are aware, the Department allows only 43 days' holidays with grant. It is presumed, from your letter, that these boys will remain in the school while the other pupils are on holidays during July and August.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nP. G. Lasenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nManitoba.\nOttawa, May 9, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the summer holiday period at the Norway House and Cross Lake Indian Residential Schools.\n\nWhile the Department prefers that principals of residential schools take only 43 days' holidays in the summer, at the same time, if the principals of these schools consider that it is in the best interests of the school and pupils to allow two months' holidays each summer, they may do so; but, it should be distinctly understood that the Department only allows grant for 43 days' holidays.\n\nWhen a pupil is allowed out on holidays on July first and does not return until September first, the principal, in preparing the September quarter return, should ask grant for only 73 days (30 days in September plus 43 days' holidays for which grant is allowed). In other words, in preparing the September return, grant should only be requested for the actual number of days each pupil is in residence during the quarter, plus 43 days' holidays for which grant is allowed.\n\nYou should so inform the principals of both schools. You should instruct both principals to forward their quarterly returns through your office, and, with special reference to the September return, you should see that it is prepared in accordance with the instructions contained in this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

School, as per Departmental letter No: 123-5-10 dated 12th March last.\n\nIn my letter to the Department dated the 27th February last in this connection, and to which the above mentioned Departmental letter was a reply, I stated that rations had been supplied to the parents of the above pupils to enable them to bring the pupils in by canoe, but which was not done. Mr Gavin H Grieve the missionary at Island Lake supplied rations to the value of $72.01, and Rev Keith Armstrong, missionary at God's Lake to the value of $2.15, which these gentlemen paid for from their own personal funds.\n\nWill you please advise me if the Department will reimburse the missionaries for these expenditures.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

(RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-10)\nOttawa, May 22nd, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to your 6-A of the 29th ultimo, I beg to say that a cheque for $162.00, covering the cost of transportation of children to the Norway House Residential School and the Cross Lake Residential School at Jack River, is being forwarded to Wings Limited.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to consider payment of the other two accounts mentioned in the second paragraph of your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nMr P.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay we, through you, ask the Department if they will consider bringing the children of our school who reside at Island Lake and God's Lake in to the school in the fall by plane. The Company (Wings Ltd), have quoted the nominal rate of $9.00 a pupil for this service.\n\nFrom these inland places it is sometimes difficult for the parents to arrange to get their children back as they have to have to send them down with someone coming for freight. Many have not the means to make the trip unless they can take back freight to pay their way and this is not always possible for all at that time of the year. Some of the children arrive much later than they should, as the parents cannot come or find someone who will bring them at the proper time.\n\nComing by plane, the children are not exposed to the possibility of wet weather and colds on their return trip, and start their school year in much better shape.\n\nIn the event of the children returning by canoe their rations for the trip amount to about $3.50 each. If the Dep't cannot see its way to bring the children back by plane will it meet the expense of their rations? The school gives the children their rations for their trip home.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned:- R.T. Chapin.\nMEMO.\n\nAt Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nRef: 6-A\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter I have received from the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, requesting that the Department give consideration to his proposal to bring the pupils of the school back after the holidays, by airplane at a nominal charge of $9.00 per pupil, from Island Lake and God's Lake Reserves.\n\nOf the present pupils of the school, there would be 26 to come back from Island Lake, and 12 from God's Lake, not taking into account the possibility that there might be a few new pupils recruited from these reserves.\n\nThere should also be taken into consideration four or five pupils resident at the Jack River R.C.Mission School, and who are considered as a part of the Cross Lake R.C.Residential School, and also belong to the above mentioned reserves, so that the total number of pupils to consider, would be approximately 50, which would make the cost $450.00.\n\nThe charge of $9.00 per pupil is most reasonable especially when the many great advantages are considered, such as the prompt return of the pupils to the schools, and the elimination of possible sickness through exposure in case of bad weather. The trip by plane from Island Lake takes less than two hours, whereas by canoe, without motor, it takes about eight days. There is also, from the schools' point of view, the certain loss of a portion of the per capita grant to consider, through the late return of many of the pupils.\n\nWill you kindly give this matter consideration, and advise me of the Department's decision.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby.\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 17, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, in which he requests that the Department provide a grant of approximately $450.00, covering the expenses of bringing the pupils of the school back after the holidays, by airplane, from Island Lake and Gods Lake Reserves.\n\nIn this connection I have to say it is not the general policy of the Department to use airplanes, unless in exceptional or urgent cases, in the transportation of Indians. It is true that, last year, the Department paid an account in returning 18 pupils from Island Lake and Gods Lake, by airplane, but this account was only paid after serious consideration being given. We are therefore not prepared to consider authorizing such a large expense in returning the pupils to the school this year.\n\nHowever, the Department might consider payment of certain of the costs in the supplying of rations to the Indian parents in returning the children. Properly receipted accounts should be obtained, covering the cost of the rations. Then you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department. Consideration will then be given as to the amount that can be allowed to reimburse the school authorities for the outlay.\n\nI may add that we are not prepared to pay any part of the cost of the rations in sending the children home. It is considered that, where pupils have to go such long distances to reach their homes for holidays, it would be advisable, in future, that they be retained at school, owing to the cost involved and the length of time it takes them to go home and return to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This boy is a bright conscientious lad in grade 6, anxious to return, and a splendid influence with the younger boys. He himself will derive a great deal of benefit from another year.\n\n211 Fred McKay, and 226 Cornelius Monias,- These boys are not quite 16 now and need another year in school.\n\nAs to the girls, the parents (0240 excepted) are agreeable to them staying for another year. Where they are not needed at\nhome, the extra years at school better fits them for their own home life which the majority of graduates soon enter upon.

She hopes to gain their consent during the holidays.\n\nre 0217 Martha Kennedy,- This is one of our brightest girls and has passed her 7th grade. I would ask that she be transferred to Brandon Industrial School to take her 8th grade.

D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nPP/O'M.\nIndian Residential School\nNorway House, Man.\nJan. 25, 1936\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI wonder if you remember\nthe time I called to see you at Mr.\nHuggins' to find out about Norway\nHouse and Indian Work in general.\n\nSince then I've become better\nacquainted with Norway House\nand have taken such an interest\nin Indians and their bush country that\nI feel I could find the work satisfying\nas a life-time vocation.\n\nThe Indians in this district\nseem to have more self-respect\nthan at home and I believe are more\nself-supporting. Yet I think it is\npretty safe to say that the average\nintelligence of the children is below\nthat of white children. Their reactions\nseem to be those of a normal white\nchild a year or two younger than themselves.\nThey love to play and learn new games readily if the rules are not too complicated.\n\nThey differ from white children that I have known in their tendency to use their hands in spare time to make things out of little or nothing, such as sling shots, bows and arrows, checkers and checker boards, snow snakes, and with the girls bead work and occasionally silk work or knitting. They are very disinclined to speak out when spoken to in English even after they know a person well. A great deal of their humour comes from picking out personal peculiarities of speech or manner of dress to ridicule or imitate for amusement.\n\nThe education they receive in the classroom is probably fairly satisfactory in the first three or four grades but beyond that I feel that much Indians subjects from Grade IV on are largely wasted. Geography, History, Grammar and Physics will be a memory and nothing more to 90% of them, for they have no books or newspapers to speak of and do not take any interest in the world outside, chiefly because they have no connection with it close at hand. Eaton & Co Winnipeg. Except for the brightest ones I should think the manual arts would be more useful for boys and girls after they have reached the standard set for the end of grade IV.\n\nIt was another matter, however which made me think of writing you, and I hope this preamble hasn't taken too much of your time. Last year a girl in this school, Martha Kennedy by name, was recommended by the principal and Indian Agent as a pupil who would profit from further education at the Brandon School. This recommendation was not accepted at Ottawa. The girl was 16 with just two years till graduation.\nand in grade seven. I understood that the Department felt the expenditure would not be advisable, because the two years would not benefit her sufficiently to warrant it when the Government was so hard pressed financially. I realize that the line has to be drawn somewhere, and that the Department is trying to use its budget the best way possible.\n\nMartha was very disappointed when she learned that she would not be able to go. She has had the ambition to be a nurse among her own people for a long time, and that together with a great liking for books made her wish very much to continue her studies. This year she has been doing well in grade eight. Her health is fine. Miss Oliver who has been the Hospital here as nurse said to me that not many of these girls had the constitution to go through a training course but she thought Martha had.\nNot the least of her assets are her attitudes towards others and her work. She is honest and dependable and takes pride in doing her work well. I believe she has a deeper religious experience than perhaps any of the children here. It seems to me that in all probability she would make a real contribution to her own people if the opportunity were hers.\n\nI feel that her education would be a good investment and I would be willing to pay the $100 high school tuition fee next year and half of the total cost of board and tuition for the next two or three years until she finished Grade IX or X which would give her the qualifications necessary to begin training. I expect to be teaching at Island Lake for the next few years.\nAnd I'm sure I could spare one or two hundred dollars a year. I have a few hundred dollars of my own now.\n\nI have confidence in Martha's ability. I believe she will apply herself, and I feel it would be a shame to deny her the chance of higher training if the way were open at all.\n\nI would be grateful if you would consider this proposal and if it is not feasible perhaps you might suggest some other alternative.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nWalter Mutch\n\nP.S. I have taken up developing printing for a hobby. There are some pictures taken this year.\n\nP.S.S. Mr. Chepman, the principal, after reading his felt I had left the impression that Martha is more clever than she really is. Although she stands high in intelligence in this school, it is likely that she would only measure up to the average white child. She is not original in her thinking. What I would depend on is her desire to get ahead and the readiness with which she undertakes her studies.\nOttawa, January 30, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Mutch:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with the three snapshots showing groups of pupils at the Norway House Indian Residential School. Judging by the pictures, they appear to be a healthy group of children.\n\nI note that, after your experience with the Indian children, you find their intelligence below that of white children of similar ages. In the north country, where it is doubtful if farming operations can be carried on, it might be in the best interests of the children - the boys especially - to grant them their discharge after they have reached the fourth or fifth grade, in order that they can return to their parents and learn to hunt and set traps, as it is likely that this will be their future means of livelihood for some time. However, this is a difficult point to decide, as the churches interested desire to keep the children, both boys and girls, until they reach at least 16 years of age.\n\nI hope you like the work at Norway House and have become familiar with conditions, which, I am sure, you found entirely different from P. E. Island.\n\nRegarding the case of Martha Kennedy, in July last, Mr. Agent Lazenby forwarded a request from Reverend R. T. Chapin, that this girl be transferred to the Brandon Indian Residential School, to take her 8th grade. We were unable to approve sending her a long distance and\n\n- paying for\n\nWalter Mutch, Esq.,\nIndian Residential School,\nNorway House,\nMan.\npaying for her maintenance and tuition at Brandon. As I understand it, she will not be able to pass her Entrance to high school until the end of the present school year, and, if sent to Brandon, it would require four years for her to obtain Matriculation. I note she wishes to take up nursing. Most hospitals now require that girls entering training have their Matriculation, and the nursing course would take three years. As Martha is now 17 and as it would take another 7 years before she would become a nurse, the cost involved would be greater than the Department could provide. I may say that we have paid the expenses of a number of Indian girls to obtain training as nurses. The Government is unable to provide them with positions upon graduation and there appears to be prejudice among white people to utilizing their services in private nursing. If Martha only obtained Matriculation, where would this get her? She would have to return to her own people, and the further education would be of little use.\n\nThe Department is spending a large amount on the higher education of Indian children and we sometimes wonder if the value received is in any way commensurate with the expense. However, if you are still of opinion that a year or so at Brandon would be of real practical benefit, the Department might favourably consider the transfer of Martha to the Brandon School in August, next, in time for her to begin studies when the schools re-open after the summer holidays. You might let me know if you still think that Martha would get anywhere by two years' further study at Brandon. In any event, I would strongly urge you not to spend any of your own money on her education, as, by so doing, it would be likely to lead to a misunderstanding of your interest in the girl.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education\nIndian Residential School,\nNorway House, Man.\nFeb 15, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI received your very prompt reply (noted) to the letter regarding Martha Kennedy. I appreciate your interest in the case and also your friendly advice.\n\nSeven years does seem a long time and Indian women rarely stay unmarried after 25 yrs. age in this country, so I believe you are right in thinking the nurses training is a gamble with the odds against the Government.\n\nI was very pleased to note that the Government might favor Martha's going but for two years to Brandon school. I suppose it is a matter\nwhich should be talked over among the principal agent and myself. If the Government were to take on the full expense, I would feel all the more responsible if she did not show in her Record at Brandon and later on in the Reserve that the further education was of positive benefit to herself and her people.\n\nI think stability of character is the most important factor in deciding whether a pupil should be singled out for higher education. I believe Martha will measure up in this respect.\n\nYou will probably hear more concerning the matter from Mr. Layton by later in the term.\n\nThanking you once more and with kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\nWalter Muto\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT NORWAY HOUSE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL DURING QUARTER, 1936\n\n| No. | Name       | Band | Residence | Occupation | Date of Admission | State of Education | Trade or Industry Taught | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|------------|------|-----------|------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|\n|     |            |      |           |            |                   |                    |                          |                       |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name       | Band | Residence | Occupation | Date of Discharge | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|------------|------|-----------|------------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| 0245| Annie Balore|      |           |            | 30-6-36          | Grade 5            | Given position on staff of Mental Hospital, Selkirk. |\n| 0254| Nora Osborne|      |           |            | 30-6-36          | Grade 4            | Mental breakdown, taken to Mental Hospital, Selkirk. |\n\n**NOTE:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

T. CHAPIN.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith the Principal's Return for the Norway House Indian Residential School, for the quarter ending 30th June 1937, with a copy of a letter addressed to me by him, asking that certain pupils, though sixteen years of age or more, be permitted to remain at the school for another year.\n\nAfter receiving the return, I had opportunity for only a few minutes talk with the Principal before he left for Winnipeg, and I spoke to him about these particular pupils, but without achieving any direct result before the boat left.\n\nI would advocate the discharge from the school of the healthy boy pupils as soon as possible after they reach 14 years of age, in order that they may return to their fathers or guardians, and learn to earn their living. Boys cannot learn to hunt and trap and fish at school; and these are the only means they have of earning a livelihood in this country; they must of necessity learn these things from their fathers, and they will learn better at the age of 14 or 15 years than they will if they are kept at school until they are 18, because when a boy reaches 18 years of age he is not so inclined to accept discipline from his father or guardian.\n\nI realize of course that it is necessary that a certain number of the bigger boys are required at the school, to help with the outside work in the barns and gardens, and so on, but I do not consider that all the 11 boys mentioned in the Principal's letter are needed, and I think some of them might be discharged, making way for a number of beginners. This argument does not, obviously, apply to the girl pupils.\n\nI am forwarding the Return, rather than holding in until the Principal's return from Winnipeg; but on his return, I will further discuss this matter with him and make a further report.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 27, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, the Department agrees with you that it is advisable to discharge the boys from the Norway House Indian Residential School when they reach the age of fourteen years. However, we are not prepared to insist on this action this year, but you should advise the Principal that such procedure should be adopted on and after June 30th, 1938.\n\nWe are not prepared to approve any boys of sixteen years of age remaining in the school for another year. You should, therefore, inform the Principal that the discharge of the following pupils is approved:\n\n- No. 205 - Sandy Beardy\n- No. 215 - Kenneth Scribe\n- No. 235 - William Folster\n- No. 241 - Nathaniel Queskekapow\n- No. 245 - Matthew Bradburn\n- No. 247 - Ross Flett\n- No. 250 - Michael Day\n- No. 252 - Peter Harper\n- No. 256 - Agnesa Flett\n- No. 262 - Robinson Harper\n- No. 271 - Chillion Monias.\n\nRegarding the girls who are now sixteen years of age, the Department would appreciate if you would review the list with the Principal and decide those that should be discharged and those who might remain in the school for another year, owing to home conditions or for other reasons. After consulting the Principal, you should advise the Department of your decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nNorway House Indian Residential School\n\nRev. R. T. Chapin, B.A.\nPrincipal\n\nNorway House, Man.\nJuly 30th 1937.\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSirs,\n\nWould you kindly send me graduation certificates for the following pupils of our School,-\n\n211 Fred McKay\n226 Cornelius Monias\n227 Abel Wood\n0217 Martha Kennedy\n0281 Madeline Grieves\n0283 Sarah Hill\n\nWith thanks,\n\nR.T. Chapin\nOttawa, August 12, 1937\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, the Department approves the transfer of Walter Felix from the Norway House Residential School to the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that he will attend technical school at Brandon, and you should arrange for him to take a practical course that will be valuable to him when he returns to Norway House.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\nMr P.G. Lazenby  \nIndian Agent.  \nNorway House, Man:\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn view of your letter received from the Dep't regarding the older boys of this school, and after the talk we have had as to the change of plans in our school work to make it possible to release the older boys, may I ask the Dep't to reconsider its decision for this year.\n\nI would ask that the following five boys, in addition to the three graduation boys, be discharged:\n\n208 - Sandy Beardy  \n245 - Matthew Bradburn  \n250 - Michael Day  \n252 - Peter Harper  \n256 - Aeneas Flett\n\n(These boys, with the exception of 245 will be over 16 years of age in 1937.) And I would ask that the other boys be allowed to remain for this school year.\n\n(three) I have talked with the Norway House parents of these other boys, and in each case, they express their preference for the boy to remain in school this year. The parents of the other reserves of course, I have not been able to see.\n\nIt is hardly possible to alter our school work enough this year to do without any of the older boys, but with the above arrangement we could carry on. As I was discussing with you by another year we could make further changes in our work to meet the change in policy of letting the boys out at an earlier age.\n\nHoping this will meet with your and the Dep't's approval,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned:- R.T. Chapin\nNorway House, Man:\n22nd August 1937.\n\nRef: 7-A\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter I have received from the Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, which he has been prompted to write, after I had advised him of the decision of the Department as set out in the second paragraph of official letter No; 125-5-10 of the 27th July last.\n\nIf all these boys are discharged, there would not be sufficient help available to carry on the outdoor work of the school, but if the Principal's request is granted, as stated in his letter, he would have three big boys left.\n\nI have discussed this matter with the Principal, and he intends making certain changes in the school work during the coming year, which will enable him to discharge the healthy boys when they reach the age of 14, but these changes cannot be made all at once.\n\nI would recommend that the Principal be allowed to retain the three boys he asks for, for this year, and should be glad if you would advise me if he may do this.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, August 30, 1937\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, the Department approves of the three boys over 16 years of age remaining in the Norway House Indian Residential School for the academic year 1937-38.\n\nI find it difficult to decide from your letter the three names and registry numbers of the boys whom the Principal wishes to keep. Please let me have this information in order that it will be available when the September return is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nP. G.

CHAPIN, B.A.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nNorway House, Man.\nSeptember 18th 1937.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to bring before you the matter of two of our boys in the School.\n\n1st re Michael Day, No.250. He was one of the boys I asked of the Dept. to be released this year pursuant to the policy to let the boys out at a younger age that they might be with their parents. At the close of the holidays when the children came back the parents of this boy sent him back to School from Island Lake along with his younger brother.\n\n2nd re Peter Loonfoot, No.292, also from Island Lake. As he is past 17 years of age I had intended to have him graduate with the graduating class this Treaty time. However in the spring he expressed his wish to stay in the School another year. There were two reasons for this. His younger brother was in the hospital here and likely to remain. He wished to be near him. Then he had done considerable carpenter work the past year and he desired to stay another year and learn more about the work. He talked it over with his older brother in the spring when he was here on a freighting trip, and he agreed with Peter. I advised him to go home with the rest of the children at holiday time and talk the situation over with his parents and the missionary. During the holidays his brother from the hospital was sent home, but in spite of this fact he came back at the end of the holidays and said that both he and his parents wished for him to remain at the School this year, and that the missionary advised him this as his constitution will stand carpenter work better than trapping. I will give him special training in carpenter work during the year and practical practice to make him as proficient as possible.\n\nWould the Dept. allow these two boys to remain this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. T. Chapin\nNorway House, Man:\n21st September 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith a letter I have received from the Rev: R.T.Chapin, Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, regarding two of his older boy pupils, who have returned to the school after vacation, from the Island Lake Reserve.\n\nAfter consideration of the Rev: Mr Chapin's letter, will you kindly advise me if these two boys may be allowed to remain at the school for the present school year?\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.;\nOttawa, November 10, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of September 21 enclosing letter received from the Principal of the Norway House Residential School.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, you may advise the Reverend Principal that the Department approves the following boys remaining in the Norway House Residential School until the end of June 1938.\n\nMichael Day, No. 250\nPeter Loonfoot, No. 232.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nP.G.

May I make a special plea for his admission on the following grounds: any T.B. he has had has been arrested and he is in apparently good health at the present time. This being so he is no menace to the other children. The home he comes from is terribly poor and he ought to stand a much better chance in the school of getting built up against further reinfection. I have explained to his parents the doctors report and they are very anxious that if at all possible the child remain in school. The boy himself has entered into school life splendidly and tells his father he likes it and wants to stay, which attitude on the boy's part is to his advantage physically. The parents live at Norway House and it is easy for them to keep informed of the boy's condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I through you ask the Department if they will consider the case of Reginald Andrew James Gamlin, to grant permission for him to enter Residential School. This boy has never been taken into treaty, and his case is as follows:\n\nDelia Hill, a Gods Lake treaty girl and School graduate, was married to James Gamlin, a white man. Before the third child, the above, was born but while the mother was pregnant the father left her and went to Winnipeg and beyond. He never returned. Through pressure of the police he made one or two remittances for the care of the children. Later he secured a divorce. The mother was then married by a treaty Indian, Andrew Crate Jr., of Norway House, a School graduate. This winter she died. The above child when a baby was given by the mother to Andrew Crate Sr., a treaty Indian, and his wife who have brought the child up and are taking the responsibility of him.\n\nBoth he, Andrew Crate Sr., and the step-father, Andrew Crate Jr., a nephew, have asked if the boy, now of School age, can be taken into School. Date of birth is April 4th 1929. They have asked me to make a plea to the Department on behalf of the boy. They are very desirous that the child should get the training and education that the Residential School affords. As the boy is being brought up in an Indian home I would ask the Department to favorably consider the case and grant the permission for him to enter Residential School that he may secure that education and training.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, a copy of a letter I have received today from Rev. R.T. Chapin, Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, in which he requests the Department's consideration of the case of a non-treaty boy, whom the foster parents wish to have admitted as a pupil of the residential school.\n\nI drew the Principal's attention to official circular letter No. 150-9, dated 10th December 1937, but he thought that as this child had been brought up from babyhood in an Indian home, and on an Indian reserve, and that since his birth, his mother had become an Indian, and had very recently died as a treaty Indian, some consideration might be given the case.\n\nI might say that at the time this child's father secured a divorce from the mother, no judgement was handed down with regard to the custody of the children of the marriage. The boy's brother, Billy Gamlin, attends the Rossville Day School.\n\nWould you please advise me of the opinion of the Department regarding the above case.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

(RG 10, Volume 6269, file 581-10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No; 123-5-10 of the 2nd April, advising that proper application should be made for the admission to Treaty of Reginald Andrew James Gamlin, before making application for his admission as a pupil of the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nBefore making application for this boy's admission to Treaty, I think it wise to acquaint you with his status. This boy is a son of James Gamlin, a white man, and Delia Hill, who was a treaty Indian, and a daughter of Daniel Hill, #26 God's Lake Band.\n\nSome years ago, James Gamlin secured a divorce from his wife Delia, at Brandon, Man: after which, the wife returned to the north with the children.\n\nAt the time of the granting of the divorce, the presiding judge handed down no judgement regarding the guardianship of any of the children; that is, whether the wife or the husband should have specific charge over any or all of them. When the wife returned to this country after the divorce, she brought her children with her, and gave them to certain Indians to keep for her, but in none of these instances were there any adoption papers drawn. The mother, Delia, eventually re-married, becoming the wife of Andrew Crate Jr: #653 Norway House Band, thus becoming again, a Treaty Indian. The mother died this winter.\n\nThe situation seems to me, to be that the - father -\n\nR.A.Hoey Esq;\nSpuit of Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.;\nfather, James Gamlin, is still the legal guardian of his children, although so far as I know, he has done nothing to support them since the divorce. If this is the case, could his children be admitted to Treaty without his consent?\n\nI may say that there are two other sons besides the Reginald Andrew James Gamlin mentioned in your letter, living here in Indian homes. One of these, namely Billy Gamlin, attends the Rossville Indian Day School, and since his parents' divorce, has been living with Nathaniel Queskekapow, a treaty Indian of the Norway House Band. Two years ago, Nathaniel Queskekapow asked that this boy might be admitted to treaty, but I have hesitated to make the application as he has no adoption papers for the boy, and the boy's father might, according to law, be regarded as his legal guardian.\n\nIf one of these boys were to be admitted to treaty without the consent of the father, and the father learned of it, could he take any action against the Department for taking such action without consulting him?\n\nAfter the foregoing points are taken into consideration, I should be glad to receive further instruction as to making application for the admission to Treaty of Reginald Andrew James Gamlin.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

Broughtong of Keewatin he paid his transportation across to Sioux Lookout and Jimmie arrived at the school. I had no work on hand at that time but as he was up against it I told him if he would make himself useful around the place sufficient to cover his board I would be willing for him to stay till things opened up again in the spring.\n\nHe was in communication with an Aunt I believe, who lived in Toronto and when the spring came on again I gave him sufficient money of my own to pay his transportation to Toronto.

I am forwarding herewith a copy of the Rev Mr Marshall's letter in the matter.\n\nI am of the opinion, that nothing further can be done from here, to ascertain the whereabouts of James Gamlin, and that in view of his long neglect of his children; the\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.;\ncare these children have been given by their present Indian guardians; and the unsuccessful attempt to discover his whereabouts, there is now no reason why application should not be made for the admission of the children to treaty, and eventually to an Indian Residential School as grant earning pupils.\n\nI shall be glad to be advised of the Department's opinion in the matter, and to receive further instructions if considered necessary.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.

However, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age is apparently increasing, and the further consideration that due to conditions now confronting us there is no immediate prospect of our securing funds to provide increased pupilage at Indian residential schools, it is considered that in future it will be necessary to adhere more strictly to the provision of the Indian Act requiring discharge of pupils at 16 years of age. Consequently unless there are some exceptional reasons the above-mentioned children should be discharged at the end of June next. If, however, there are a few of them who you consider should be retained please let me have detailed information before the end of June.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. R.T.

Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nNorway House, Man:\n5th April 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith the Quarterly Return for the Norway House Indian Residential School for the quarter ending 31st March 1940.\n\nWith reference to the pupil, No; 0333, Jane Muswagon, whose discharge is asked for, I may say that this child was one of the Typhoid Fever patients, and the fever has left her lungs in an active T.B. condition.\n\nThe other pupil whose discharge is asked for, James Crow, No;266, did not manage to get back to school after holidays last year. He has no parents now, his father having died last summer, and he was unable to get transportation to Norway House when the other pupils returned. He later made an attempt to get to Norway House, but the rivers froze up ahead of his small party and they had to turn back. This boy is sixteen years of age, and I understand that he has been trapping.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.
