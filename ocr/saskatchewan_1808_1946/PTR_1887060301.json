Mr. Wilson.\n\nTHIS PAPER MAY BE FOUND AT THE OFFICE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES, NEW YORK.\n\nFRIDAY, JUNE 3, 1887.\n\nRAILWAY POLICY.\n\nWe believe all who look at the matter upon its truest principles will agree with us in thinking the Government have done right in keeping faith with the C.P.R. and maintaining the status quo as to its allowance. The question was brought up by Winnipeg for local reasons which need not be here analyzed, became for a time a lively topic of discussion throughout the country and has been settled by a vote sustaining the Government policy by a very substantial majority.\n\nThe fact that so few of the representatives from Manitoba, British Columbia, and the North-West Territories voted in the minority is suggestive enough of the state of public feeling outside the city of Winnipeg, where the great division of opinion has been. The Division on this question is still felt.\n\nIt is to be hoped, however, that the city and the C.P.R. will amicably arrange their differences, and that the latter will not feel it to be necessary or advisable to adopt any measures that would bear the stamp of retaliation.\n\nWe have all along felt that the interest of our town and district in this question was of the utmost importance, and we observed that during the recent election contest in the Saskatchewan district, it was scarcely ever mentioned. What concerns us much more to know is, what are we likely to have to do with the question ourselves? There are two lines partially constructed pointing in our direction, and we should be rejoiced to see either one completed. One of these was progressing towards our settlement\u2014or indeed for that matter, that both were coming on apace. Although both these lines were to touch the town, they would divide the district so very widely situated that each would have a large territory tributary to it entirely distinct from the other. There can be no doubt that such roads, when available, we would immediately have a large influx of settlers, and as no other district in the Territories can at all compete with Saskatchewan as a farming country, we should at once enter on an era of great and lasting prosperity.\n\nIt cannot be too strongly insisted that the chief outlet for the products of the land will ultimately be by the Hudson's Bay route, and Prince Albert should lose no opportunity of furthering proper measures for the opening up of that route in the near future.\n\nAGRICULTURAL NOTES.\n\nThe outlook for our important agricultural interest is, at the present date, much more favorable than it has been for several years in succession. A most promising season stands before us, and the crops are getting into fine condition to begin with and a continuance of good weather, have given an excellent start to the grain crops, and the grass is abundant and fine all over the district. Grass is abundant, and live stock consequently getting into fine condition, while there is no likelihood of any shortcoming in the hay crop. Recent weather has been also favorable, so that we fear the grub will have to be reckoned with. Many recipes and nostrums for the destruction of this pest have been produced and tried with no great success. We believe the only real mode of dealing with it is still a desideratum, and anyone who can discover such will deserve well of his country.\n\nAbout this season we often hear complaints of scrub holly being allowed to run at large, which of course is very annoying to those having a good class of stock. To this end the Legislative Council passed an Ordinance last session (No. 16 of 1886, amending No. 13 of 1884). This Ordinance comes into force for such portions of the district as may be designated by proclamation by the Lieutenant-Governor. Probably the Lorne Agricultural Society might do well to keep this in view when they fix upon the boundaries of the district to be included in their proposed incorporation.\n\nThere has been some talk recently among those interested as to the repayment of the seed grain supplied by the Government. Of course a harvest is a bargain, but there seems to be a general impression that, in the circumstances, the terms of repayment are somewhat onerous. It is a very serious matter, however, and one that would have been no trouble, but a year of comparative failure followed upon years of prosperity, and instead of making them better by the aid of Government, even the seed grain was almost worse than the beginning. We have no doubt if a proper representation be made in the proper quarter a measure of relief will certainly be obtained.\n\nCARD OF THANKS.\n\nThe results of the bazaar are beyond all expectations. There is a clear profit of $500. We beg to offer our sincere thanks to the generous benefactors who have contributed thereto.\n\nIn the Acts of the Apostles we read how the Christians had but one heart and one soul, and held all their goods in common.\n\nIn seeing during these two evenings the kindness and generosity shown by the inhabitants of Prince Albert we feel happy to remark, that though there are differences, the same charity exists among us.\n\nMay the Almighty sustain Him self to reward them.\n\nSpecial thanks are due to the Hon. L. Clarke who has honoured the undertaking to an extent.\n\nThanks also to all the charitable friends who have organized the bazaar and worked with their own hands to make the various objects. Thanks again, to the members of the P.T. Band who contributed so largely to the gaiety of these two evenings.\n\nLastly, thanks to all those who kindly honoured us with their presence.\n\nP. DOMMEAU.\n\nMontreal's Jasberry Cordial at Clark's Drug Store.\n\nYou are sure to get the worth of your money in Boots and Shoes at Shannon & Sons', because they have chosen their backs and feet fully developed to be a strict cash business, therefore they must and will sell very cheap for cash. No tricks taken. Cash down sales, and the worth of your money every time.\n\nIN MEMORIAM.\n\nTHE LATE REV. MOTHER AUSTIN.\nMary Ann Austin, eldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Egan, died at St. Mary's, Clare, King's County, on March 16, 1841. At the early age of seventeen she was received into the Order of the Faithful Companions of Jesus and Mary at Clonchore. Here during the first years of her religious life, which are generally considered the happiest of her earthly duties and services applicable to different branches of study, she showed all that was best in a religious life. Afterward she marked her after-care, and succeeded in obtaining a first-class certificate from the Board of Examiners of Education in London. After her religious profession in 1860 she was placed in some of the best schools in England, and numbered among the day or five hundred children, and filled again in the school of the Sisters of Mercy in the surrounding parishes and mills, are again thrown open on Sundays for both day and evening classes. Those who have experienced it can understand the exhausting nature of the work and the amount of exertion demanded of these schools demand. Yet it was in this laborious task that with an energy and perseverance, and a spirit of self-sacrifice, patience and gentleness which endeared her to her superiors, her sisters, and all who knew her. Mother Austin was twenty-four years previous to her arrival in Prince Albert. In 1866 Mother Austin was transferred to Superior General assistant to the Superior who was deported to England by the order of the Governor of the North West Territories. The severity of the first winter tried her constitution very much, but notwithstanding her ill-health she continued to labor for the education of the children connected to the school, and her many cheerful devoted services, and following the example of those having visited her by her last sigh, she died on the 29th of June, 1867, as she always wished, found her as she wished, and all three of her life, self-gifted and full of kind forethought for others. Amidst great sufferings and trials she expressed her thanksgiving and of prayed for the many friends and benefactors in Prince Albert, whose interest she had so faithfully served, and of whom she died in peace in heaven.\n\nBUILDING HARDWARE, CARPENTERS' TOOLS, AMMUNITION, GARDEN TOOLS, UNION CURNS, DASH CURNS, MILK PAILS, BUTTER MOULDS, COW BELLS, HORSE BELLS, BUGGY SHAFTS, SPOKES, HUBS AND FELLOWS.\n\nT.

The land is in good shape, and the soil is in good condition, and under the influence of the rain, we get an early start. Mr. Tappell got an Italian reserve about six inches high.\n\nWhile Bourke and Bourke have 129 acres of grain, besides a nice area of roots, the land of the upper settlement, has been sown with wheat, and while not grown all the ground they have really, but there is altogether there will be enough for the present year, put on the crop, and up to the present time prospects of success is good.\n\nA few days ago Mr. Tappell sent the Rev. Mr. Gardner in the Presbyterian church on the 12th ult. After music and song by the choir, Mr. B. A. Lawson presented Mr. Gardner with a Bible, dress and Miss Laumer handed him a purse containing fifty dollars. Mr. Gardner accepted the gift, and the congregation for their valuable present, but said it was unnecessary to give anything beyond the usual stipend for the church, as it was his first visit. In the Presbyterian church he had charge of after service, and the services were attended by a large meeting held in the school house at the barracks. Mr. Gardner was present at the marriage of Lieutenant and a Miss Macdonald and Miss Macdonald was read by Corp. Hether and the marriage was made by Sgt. Major Breland, who was present at the sealing terms to the general regard of the congregation.\n\nOn receiving the news of good will and esteem, Mr. Gardner acknowledged it in eloquent and fitting terms.\n\nFORT MACLEOD.\n\nFrom the Gazette.\n\nThe crops are now up on High River.

Mr. Clarke, M.P., who had been invited by the Jubilee Celebration Committee, inviting the members of the Society to walk in the first of July procession, met with enthusiastic response to accept the kind invitation.\n\nThe Secretary suggested that it would be an excellent idea if each member of the Society subscribed one dollar from each prize winner for the next year's membership fee.\n\nThis suggestion received considerable discussion, and on motion of Mr. Sifton, was almost unanimously carried.\n\nThe disposal of the surplus cattle after expenses of the Hon.

They also regret to hear that a number of farmers were refused oats under the Act. They understood there was a quantity of oats and barley left over on the Government's hands at the warehouses.\n\nThe General Committee, or the Secretary will be pleased to hear from friends of the Society who wish to offer special prizes at the fall exhibition.\n\nNEWSPAPERS IN 1887.\n\nGeo. P. Howell & Co., of New York, have issued the nineteenth annual edition of their \"American Newspaper Directory.\" The new volume contains an exhaustive list of all Newspapers Published throughout the world. Among the 3,500 papers represented there can be readily referred to and important facts concerning it, together with the names of the proprietors obtained. The Newspaper Directory will be used principally by publishers, advertisers and subscribers, but the vast fund of information it contains makes it valuable to persons of almost every description. For instance, for five dollars alone it is well worth the price charged, $5, for it fully describes every known newspaper in the world. It is a book for people care to know about any place where men use newspapers.\n\nThe number of papers published in the United States, Canada, Mexico (including Alaska) and Cuba is put at 14,239; an increase of 581 in one year. To say that the growth of newspapers in Western States would be a matter of wonder, if it were not that this year is a record year for the whole country. The volume shows that great care has been taken to sustain its reputation as the most complete and accurate directory ever published, and to insure accuracy in every detail. Anything less than a complete publication would be a serious neglect of publishers' and proprietors' work. We quote those who are familiar with the frequent efforts of this firm, who feel kindly toward them as the most honest and best known of all the American Advertising Agencies.\n\nTELEGRAPHIC.\n\nWinnipeg, July 3.\n\nIn the House today Mr. Perley introduced several petitions for changes in the Land Laws and Tenancy system in the Northwest.\n\nMr. Daly introduced a resolution of the Municipality, asking for legislation to collect current and overdue taxes on lands owned by the Northwest Land Company.\n\nSir Donald Smith asked leave to introduce a bill to extend the Manitoba and North-Western Railway.\n\nIn reply to a question, Sir John Macdonald said the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba had accepted his resignation, but his resignation had not yet been accepted.\n\nSir Charles Tupper said that both the Imperial and Canadian Governments were promoting a friendly settlement of the fisheries difficulties and reciprocity trade relations with the United States.\n\nCanada Spain is suffering from a terrible blight disease. Vegetation has entirely disappeared, and workmen have to employ the old railway tracks before a train can proceed.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Murray, Minister of Agriculture, stated that the members of the Board of Directors, the Parks, the new members breathe more freely since yesterday, and they are certainly prepared for another term of office for twenty-four hours longer. They are not to be on the scene for terms of more than three days, however, and it was thought no body to see Rosier place his resignation in the hands of President Greer before noon.\n\nFrom Regina we learn that Manakatah left last week arrested for the murder of Mrs. Sanderson.\n\nA farmer living south of White Wood was found strung up to a tree, having been murdered by a man named McLean, living near the reserve north west of Broadview, who had been murdered by half-breeds and his stock run off.\n\nNo tidings yet of McLetha's murderers. Mr. Murray has been away for twenty-four hours. The funeral procession was about a half hour late, owing to a band playing the dead man's music in Saul.\n\nTHE R. C. BAZAAR.\n\nThe bazaar held in the Roman Catholic Church on Wednesday evening in aid of the church funds was a great success. On both evenings the building was well filled, and the entertainment was always liberal, especially so when the object is for a charitable purpose.\n\nThe interior of the hall during the bazaar was handsomely decorated, and presented quite a gay appearance. The music was excellent, and the songs were numerous and valuable, but for want of space we cannot particularize them. The performers who took part in the bazaar were treated to some excellent singing and music. Mrs. Murray sang a French song, \"Amour Eternel,\" with piano accompaniment by Mr. Peters, which was encored. Miss Murray sang a French song, \"Quand je serais grand,\" with piano accompaniment by Mr. Peters, which was encored.
