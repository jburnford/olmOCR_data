This policy will expire on the 9th of January. We presume on expiry of the present policy that the building will be completed and we beg to solicit a renewal of the insurance for the full term for our agent, Mr. A.

The insurance should then be dropped as the Department does not carry risks on properties the cost of which has been paid from monies voted by Parliament. Insurance is only placed upon buildings the cost of which is paid from Band funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nExaminer,\nThe Continental Insurance Company,\n17 St. John Street,\nMontreal, Que.\nWhile making an inspection of the Central School last week at Caughnawaga, I noticed that the contractors were about to start the laying of the sewer pipe on a distance of over 500 feet. After consulting with the Indian Agent it was considered advisable to authorize someone to supervise at least the jointing and the filling over this drain pipe. I have therefore taken it upon myself to request Mr. Robert, one of the caretakers of the Government schools to attend to this work, with the understanding that he will be paid reasonable wages for this extra work. I have given Mr. Robert the necessary instructions to enable him to attend to this work which should be completed before the end of this month.\n\nOwing to the absence of earth along the course of the above mentioned sewer line, I have also arranged for the purchase of fifty dollars worth of manure to cover the clay pipe in order to prevent it from damage by the pressure of loose stones, etc., in the filling of the trench. This condition of the soil could not, of course, be foreseen in the preparation of the specifications and will be at the charge of the Department.\n\nWhile at the building my attention was brought to the difficulty of securing the services of a reliable workman to come to Caughnawaga at the present time, when transportation conditions are very inconvenient and undertake the construction of the terrazzo flooring in the toilet rooms in the basement. It was suggested for this reason that they be replaced by floors of red vitrified quarry tiles, laid with good coloured cement joints, similar to those manufactured by the Ontario Provincial Government. The contractors have a certain amount of these on hand, and are willing to supply the balance without extra charge. As this latter type of flooring is much more sanitary than that made of terrazzo, I beg to recommend that this change be authorized. I would ask your approval of the above mentioned arrangements.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that it is necessary that the fire insurance policy on the new Central School, which expired on the 9th instant, be immediately renewed and forwarded to the Department with the least possible delay and would suggest that this new policy be increased to $30,000 to enable the Department to issue another progress certificate before its expiration.\n\nWith reference to your request for the substitution of red vitrified quarry tile flooring for the terrazzo as specified, for the lavatories in the basement of the school, I beg to say that this change will be permitted on condition that these tiles be equal in quality to those manufactured by the Ontario Provincial Government, also that these tile floors be laid in an entirely satisfactory manner with neat and even coloured joints and without any additional charge to the Department whatsoever.\n\nThe Department is advised that there is some exterior woodwork which has not yet received its priming coat of oil paint, and also that the heating of the building is far from being satisfactory. I have to request, therefore, that you arrange for the painting of this woodwork as early as possible, and that you take the necessary steps to fully protect the interior work by an adequate supply of heat until the completion and acceptance of the building as required by your specifications.\n\nMessrs. MacKenzie & Genest,\nContractors,\nCaughnawaga,\nQue.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6079, file 305-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nWith reference to the filling over the drain pipe of the sewerage system for this school, I beg to say that the Department has authorized the purchase of a quantity of manure to be delivered along the trench for the covering of the pipes before the stone filling is started, with the understanding that the cost of the quantity required will not exceed fifty dollars. It is desired that all care possible be taken in the filling of the trench in order that the drain pipe be not disturbed or damaged when the ground settles next spring.\n\nKindly acknowledge the receipt of this letter by return mail and oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSt. Ann's Convent, Caughnawaga,\nJanuary 12, 1928.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen at your office last week I forgot to ask if\nthe Department would allow the usual grant of sixty-five\ndollars for sewing material.\n\nThanking you for past favors, I am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister M. Rose Alma\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 13, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have acknowledged receipt of the voucher which you forwarded to the amount of $154.76 covering general disbursements in connection with the supervising of the R.C. Indian day schools on the Oughmawag Reserve and for disbursements for driver and messenger boy.\n\nIn connection with these accounts, it is noted that a duplicate charge is made for visits to St. Isidore Road School. Five visits were made during the period from September 19th to the end of December. A charge of $1.50 is made for the driver and also $1.50 in the account for disbursements made by Rev. Sister Mary Rose Alma. Please explain why this duplicate charge is made for these visits.\n\nThere is also an amount of $65 charged for the transportation of the teachers to the schools on stormy days and during the month of December. While the Department would be prepared to allow a reasonable amount for the transportation of the teachers on stormy days, it is considered that transportation should not be provided at any other time. Please take this matter up with the Rev. Sister Superior and have her state the number of times the teachers were given transportation on stormy days during the period covered by this account, and also to whom the same was paid and whether receipts are obtained. We note that this item is gradually increasing, and you should inform the Rev. Sister that it is only on stormy days or during extremely wet weather that we could pay for the cost of transporting the Sisters to the schools.\n\nYour early reply giving full particulars as requested above is desired before payment of the account which you submit can be made.\n\nI beg to inform you that we are authorizing the Rev. Sister Superior to incur an expenditure not exceeding $65 in the purchase of sewing material. The account covering the cost will be handed to you, which you should certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.

In this connection I wish to refer to my letter of November 25th, 1928, in which I have already explained what the Department claim to be a duplicate charge for visits to St-Isidore Road School. Sister Superior is allowed $1.50 for her visit to that school which is three miles one way, making it a six miles drive with horse and carriage in very bad country roads. No driver will go there with a wait of one hour or more for less than $1.50.\n\nWhen Reverend Sister Superior visited the Departmental Offices last August, she made known to the Superintendent of Indian Education the request of the Reverend Mother General of her Order to have Sisters driven to the Girls' School because of the distance from the Residence. He, therefore, agreed to have the Department pay $35.00 a month for December, January, February and March if necessary. One excellent teacher who taught at the Girls' School last year caught a bad cold that regenerated into tuberculosis. She has been confined in the T.B. Department at the Sisters Infirmary since last August with no prospect of curing.\n\nNo woman can plough through the snow, kneedeep any great distance, with freezing temperature and in all sorts of wintry stormy days and that four times a day without feeling the effects sooner or later.\n\nAll the Reverend Sisters under the School Board of Montreal who teach even a short distance from the Convent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nare given transportation every day all year round. I firmly believe that the Department of Indian Affairs could do as much. Surely it is an economical expenditure because no money can buy the health of such devoted teachers.\n\nDuring the dreadful rainy autumn days the Reverend Sisters were transported to the Schools twenty times, besides four times a day during December. Mr. J. Diabo was paid but like the greater number of Indians he is not willing to sign papers, they do not know how to read or write and they have a dread for any paper that they are asked to sign.\n\nHoping that my explanations are satisfactory and that the Department will soon forward the Cheque covering the expenditures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nKETCHUM & COMPANY, LIMITED\nSporting and Athletic Goods\nCLEVELAND BYCYCLES\u2014ELTO MOTORS\u2014CHESTNUT CANOES\nFISHING TACKLE\u2014GUNS AND AMMUNITION\u2014ROW BOATS\n\nSOLD TO Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Bldg.\n\nOTTAWA Jan 17, 1928\n\nTERMS CASH.

Sister Superior's charge of $1.50 for visits made to the St. Isidore Road School. I wish to state that the Department's intention was to allow $1.50 for the driver only. I note that this item has been paid to the Rev. Sister Superior in the past, but this was in error, and the Auditor General might seriously question such payment to a full time employee of the Department. I have carefully examined our files and I am satisfied that no authority has been directed for this special fee. I should be grateful if you would direct that it should not be included in future in the Rev. Sister's account for general disbursements. There are five such items in the account for the December quarter which you forwarded under cover of your letter of the 30th ultimo. These are being disallowed.\n\nPlease inform Sister Mary Rose Alma that the Department regrets that the regulations are such that we cannot continue this payment to her for the St. Isidore Road School visit. Payment of $1.50 to the driver for each trip will be allowed as heretofore.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL.

After application for insurance, it shall be presumed that the applicant has informed the company of all matters which would affect the value of the property insured, unless the company points out, in writing, the particular wherein it does not agree.\n\n4. Any change in the use or condition of the property insured as defined by the policy must be immediately notified to the insurer, and within the contract or knowledge of the assured, and which increases or decreases the risk, must be immediately notified to the company or its local agent; and the company, when so notified, may increase or decrease the premium, or cancel the policy, and if no notification is made in writing an additional premium, which the assured must pay, will be charged, and if the assured refuses to make such payment forthwith after receiving such demand, the company may cancel the policy.\n\n5.

Un des entrepreneurs m'a dit qu'il leur \u00e9tait impossible de fournir la chaleur requise \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de cette b\u00e2tisse avant d'y avoir fait l'installation d'une pompe mue \u00e0 l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9.\n\nHier, M.

One of the contractors told me that it was impossible for them to furnish heat as required inside the building before the installation of an electric pump was done.\n\nYesterday, Mr. Binette, of Quebec, telephoned me to say that he had received instructions from the Department to have an electric pump installed immediately, but that on account of the changes in the specifications which he had submitted to the Department with his price of $150.00, he had said he received instructions to change the specifications so as to put a 3\" pipe instead of one of 1\u00bd\" to a depth of 40 feet in the artesian well and that he was furthermore instructed to connect the electric current from the transformer to the building. On account of this change in the specifications he had submitted, Mr. Binette then informed me that he could not do this work for less than $150.00 instead of $150.00 as previously tendered.\n\nAs this work was most urgent, I\nthoughts I could take upon myself to authorize Mr. Bissette to proceed without delay with the work at the price of $150.00.\n\nThe work to the sewer system is progressing in a satisfactory manner; I believe the laying of the pipe and the connection done during the course of a week.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nMEMORANDUM: Dr. Scott.\n\nThe Department is advised that the sewerage system at the Central School at Caughnawaga, with the exception of the portion in the St. Lawrence River, is now completed and ready for inspection, and that the contractors are anxious to have the heating and lighting installations inspected. As I have not made a visit to the works since the beginning of January I beg to be authorized to proceed to Caughnawaga next Monday for the above mentioned inspection.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nM.

I enclose herewith a page from the catalogue of one of the manufacturers of school desks, and from it you will see the ages of the children for which the various sizes of desks manufactured are suitable. I may add that the desk we supply is the single school desk only. In considering the number of desks required in each classroom, it would be advisable, if possible, to arrange to have each row of desks of the same size, with a front and rear seat, and in forwarding the information asked for, you should give particulars for each of the classrooms separately, stating the number of rows of desks it is intended to install and the size and number of desks required for each row.

The concrete floor in the boiler and fuel room should be graded in such a manner as to allow the water to drain itself into the new gulley.\n\n2. Means should be taken when cleaning the tile floors in the toilets to stain the cement joints, which have been left in their natural colour, as was understood in my letter of the 11th of January, authorizing the substitution of red quarry tiles for terrazzo.\n\n3. The corner posts of the C. C. compartments from the bottom railing should be supported with metal legs formed of nickel plated steel pipe with suitable flange at top and bottom anchored to the tile floor with anchor bolts, etc. The top flanges of the posts should be shaped to have same width as that of the post itself. I understand that the above mentioned fittings can be obtained from dealers in plumbing fixtures, as they are frequently used for partitions made of marble.\n\n4. The doors should be adjusted with standard triplex spring single action hinges of the size required for this type of door, and illustrated in Belleville Hardware Cat. No 4, page 253. They should be provided with lavatory door pull and latch, and door pull on the outside as shown on pages 262 and 265 of the above mentioned catalogue, or approved equal.\n\nMessrs.

It will be necessary that door stop be placed at all door openings to prevent the wooden or plaster wall from being damaged by door handles.\n\n6. With reference to the hardware already installed I should like to be advised why this has been purchased in brass finish instead of bronze as required by the specifications, as it is possible that the Department will insist on the latter finish.\n\n7. It will be necessary that additional coat hooks be adjusted in the cloak rooms, so that the spacing between them will not exceed 6\" as specified.\n\n8. The coal chute should be provided with suitable metal locking device inside the building as was described by the Engineer.\n\n9. With regard to the plaster work this was found to be entirely unsatisfactory and same will have to be thoroughly repaired and cleaned to an even and perfect white colour before the building is accepted.\n\n10. Kindly request Indian agent Letourneau or Mr. Robert, the contractor to advise the Department by wire as soon as the portion of the sewerage system in the river has been satisfactorily completed in order that payment for this work can be made this week if possible.\n\nIt is understood that an amount will be withheld until the levelling of the excavated earth and stone along the trench has been satisfactorily completed.\n\nI am sending you an English copy of the specifications, and would request that you return immediately the one left by the Departmental Engineer, which has been utilised in using it for the preparation of specifications for other works and is still needed here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This fixture was not included in the specifications, but the necessary piping has been installed and it will be necessary that the sink be installed before the cement floor is completed. I would suggest that one enamelled iron kitchen sink size 24 x 54\" with integral drain board be purchased immediately, in order that the plumbers who are still on the job may complete this work and allow the floor to be finished in this class room. The cost of this fixture will amount to about $80.00.\n\n[Signature]\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nReverende Sceur Superieurs,\nCouvent de Caughnawaga.\n\nCaughnawaga.\n\nReverende Sceur:\n\nCi-inclus les prix pour les diff\u00e9rentes armoires dont vous avez besoin.\n\nClasses: 2 de 69\u00bd\" x 24\", 3 portes, tablettes. 10.00 chaque.\n\n2 \" 69\u00bd\" x 24\" \" \" 10.00\n\n1 \" 73\u00bd\" x 24\" \" \" 10.00\n\nBureaux: 1 64\u00bd\" x 72\" x 11\"(d'apr\u00e8s d\u00e9tail) 22.50\n\nLivres: 1 9\u00bd\" x 8\u00bd\" (le devant d'1 mer) 54.00\n\n\" \" \" \" 2 \" 62.00\n\n\" 1 5' x 4'x11\" 15.00\n\nEsp\u00e9rant \u00eatre favoris\u00e9 de votre commande, je vous remercie \u00e0 l'avance et suis,\n\nVotre bien d\u00e9vou\u00e9e.\n\nJ.H.

I understand that the interior will be ready for occupation the first week of May, but that it will take several weeks more before the exterior is completed, owing to the unfavourable weather conditions, and the amount of repairs which will have to be made to the jointing, the brick veneering and the cement work, which as you know is entirely unsatisfactory. I would ask you, therefore, to furnish me with a renewal receipt of the Fire Insurance Policy before the date of its expiration.\n\nWith reference to the spring hinged adjusted on the lavatory doors, I beg to say that these will not be accepted under any consideration, as they would not stand the frequent use of the doors. Each of the lavatory doors should be adjusted with two 5\" single action, triplex spring hinges as required in the specifications.\n\nThe Department is advised by the firm of Thomas Lawson that the balance of the guard railing for the spiral stairs above the Theatre floor will be shipped within the course of a few days, and it is understood with this firm that they will be responsible for the payment of any additional work which might have been required for the installation of these stairs, due to defective construction by them.

P. Laverty  \nAssistant treasurer.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nPlease refer to my memo on Crane's letter of January 1st\u2014therein, according to an assignment given by the contractors all payments should be made through their bank in Ottawa.\nCRANE Automatic WATER SYSTEMS\n\nRunning water\u2014the burden bearer\n\nBringer of health and comfort, saver of labor, frequently an increaser of profits, running water is perhaps as important a contribution to modern life as mechanical ingenuity has made.\n\nIn the kitchen, it renders irksome tasks easier. In the laundry, it lightens drudgery. In the bathroom, it lends vigor for the day's duties or soothes muscles weary from work. Piped to barn lots, it saves a vast amount of pumping and carrying while it promotes the productivity of stock and poultry. In the garden, it ends the threat of drought.\n\nPublic health officers, studying vital statistics, have found that running water in homes saves thousands of babies' lives, and promotes adult health as well.\n\nServing the well being of the entire family, making life easier for man, woman, and beast, the great benefit of running water is that it is not an expense but almost invariably a profitable investment.\n\nDominion and provincial agricultural leaders, and agricultural colleges, after a study of the effect of running water on farm profits, are sending out bulletins in which a characteristic statement is: \"No equipment for farm homes is needed more than water under pressure. Plan a complete plumbing system. If necessary, have it installed in units as circumstances permit.\"\n\nBut most people, and especially most women, know without being told how much they need running water. For farm families and for dwellers in small towns and suburbs away from city water mains, the problem has been to find a way to get it without prohibitive trouble and expense. Now, that way has been found.\n\n---\n\nCRANE Automatic WATER SYSTEMS\n\nHow you can have running water\n\nNeither doubt of practicability nor fear of the cost need make you hesitate longer to equip your home, your farm, your rural school or hotel or club, with a running water system.\n\nSkilled engineers, studying the actual necessities of prospective users of all kinds, have developed for Crane Limited a full line of automatic water systems, simple, enduring, and dependable. One of them will surely meet your requirements and your purse.\n\nWhether water is taken from a 22-foot or a 250-foot well, there is a Crane system to pump it. Whether 200 gallons an hour or 6000 gallons an hour are needed, a Crane system will supply them. Whether your home is one of the growing number of country places with electricity or whether you depend on gas engine power, some one of the Crane systems is adapted to your situation.\n\nAbout the dependability of any Crane system, you may have the utmost certainty. For 72 years, Crane Limited has been engaged in the manufacture of power and other appliances. Increasingly through these years, the Crane reputation has grown, because Crane Limited has always stood behind every article that has gone out under its name. Similarly, back of every water system stands Crane Limited.\n\nMoreover, a way has been found to build Crane systems so that they can be sold at remarkably low prices. While prices naturally vary with the vertical lift, the amount of water required daily, the job that the pump must do, no one need hesitate because of cost. A request will bring full information as to the price of a system to fit your needs.\n\nStudy the systems described in this booklet. Then consult your dealer. Or write to Crane Limited, describing your needs and conditions. You will find that a Crane system will quickly pay for itself in labor saved, in doctor bills avoided, and in actual profits increased.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6079, file 305-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nCRANE Automatic WATER SYSTEMS\n\nEleven important features of Crane Shallow Well Pumps\n\n1 Accessibility of all valves and packings, and other parts, with a wrench, the entire tool kit.\n\n2 Accurately ground, drop forged .40 carbon steel crank shafts with double bearings.\n\n3 Hand reamed bronze bushed bearings throughout.\n\n4 Valve seats, cylinder caps, stuffing box, cross-heads, connecting rods, are hot pressed brass forgings. This insures greater wearing qualities and is a positive guarantee against sand holes.\n\n5 A monel metal piston rod, which provides great strength, high rust-resisting capacity, and will not score.\n\n6 A positive oil seal without the use of any packing.\n\n7 A positive splash oiling system, using spoons in place of wicks, which keeps bearings always flooded.\n\n8 Oil level float gauge easily visible even in a dark corner.\n\n9 Only repulsion-induction type motors are used for alternating current.\n\n10 Fibre gaskets throughout, which may be used time and again without tearing.\n\n11 All electric systems are entirely automatic, starting and stopping with pressure variation. Gas engine systems automatically stop at proper pressure.\n\nCRANE Automatic WATER SYSTEMS\n\nEfficient ~ economical ~ enduring\n\nThree points will determine the purchaser's satisfaction with a water system after it is in use.\n\n1 Efficiency of operation. No more smoothly running, efficient systems are made than the Crane automatic shallow and deep well systems. Materials and manufacture throughout are the best. Bearings are machined to a microscopic fraction of an inch. Oil always floods the bearings. Skilled engineers have carefully worked out every detail that means added service. All pumps need occasional adjusting. Crane systems are accessible in every part. With no other tool than a wrench, all adjustments can be made to intake valves, discharge valves, connecting rod and cross-head, plunger, and controlling switch.\n\n2 Economy in operation. A Crane shallow well system can be operated at one third the cost per gallon of water which city dwellers pay. The upkeep is practically nothing. Deep well systems are proportionately low in operating cost.\n\n3 Durability. The mechanical excellence which gives Crane systems efficiency also makes them enduring. As experience has taught its lessons, they have been improved to bring their operating characteristics to the highest point.\n\nWater systems are divided into two general classes; shallow well, to be used wherever the vertical lift is 22 feet or less; and deep well, pumping from depths down to 250 feet. Shallow well systems are shown from page 6 to page 10, inclusive. Deep well systems are illustrated and described from page 11 to page 16.\nCRANE Automatic WATER SYSTEMS\n\nFits the needs of the average family\n\nRunning water in ample quantity for the average family, to supply kitchen, laundry, bath, and out-buildings, is provided by Crane Shallow Well Pump No. 215.\n\nIt will pump 200 gallons an hour where the suction lift does not exceed 22 feet and the horizontal distance is not over 100 feet. Very quiet and smooth running, this pump, like all Crane electric systems, starts and stops automatically as the pressure in the supply tank varies.\n\nWith special packings, No. 215 also is extensively used for oil burners for domestic heating purposes. If this is to be the use, the fact should be clearly stated in ordering.\n\nFor large farms, schools, apartments\n\nWell stocked farms, schools, clubs, apartment houses, and large country residences will be splendidly served by the Crane No. 400 Duplex Double Acting Shallow Well Pump, which meets requirements up to 1200 gallons daily.\n\nThe hourly capacity is 400 gallons. With garden-hose nozzle wide open, it will throw a full stream of water 35 to 40 feet. Quiet and automatic, it has all the exclusive features of No. 215. It is self-oiling, with crank shaft supported on both ends by liberal bearings. Crank pins on an angle make a plunger stroke dead center impossible.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n| No. | Cap.

When these tanks are integrally installed with the motor, the complete unit is exceptionally attractive and takes up little floor space. Legs five inches high keep the pump away from any cellar dampness.\n\nThe tank is equipped with a pressure gauge and water glass with both top and bottom shut-off valves. In case the glass is broken, the valves may be shut and the system operated as usual.\n\nOnly the best quality gate valves and tank trimmings are used.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nTANK:\nGalvanized electric weld; air tested to 150 lbs. pressure; working pressure 85 lbs.\n\nTRIMMINGS:\nCrane No. 624 water gauge complete as shown.\nCrane 3/4\" railroad union galvanized.\nCrane 1/2\" gate valve.\nProper length galvanized nipples and ells to make up the line between pump and tank.\n100 lbs. pressure gauge.\n\nPUMP:\nNo. 215.

Supplying 200 gallons an hour, ample for kitchen, bath, and laundry, it will keep a small hose going. With this system offered at a surprisingly low price, no home can afford to be without running water. Cost has been reduced not by sacrifice of quality, but by eliminating the tank. Opening a faucet starts the pump.\n\nOther handy, low-priced Crane systems are No. 215-F and No. 400-F, portable. Only 2 pipe connections are needed for installation.\n\nWhen no electric current is available\n\nExceptionally desirable systems where no electric current is available, No. 215-E and No. 400-E, operate with a Fuller and Johnson air-cooled gasoline engine. These systems are made in the same capacities and general styles as electric systems Nos. 215 and 400. The pumps do not start automatically, but do stop automatically. The controlling circuit breaker cuts off the ignition when set pressure has been reached.\n\nPrice F. O. B.

Covering every condition under which a deep well system must operate, no more efficient and economical systems are manufactured than Crane. Some superior features of Crane systems are:\n\n1. Backed by the 72-year Crane reputation for reliability.\n2. Every part easily accessible for adjustment and repairs.\n3. Parts oversize for greater strength.\n4. Bearings machined to .0005 of an inch.\n5. Well-head entirely housed to keep out dust and all foreign substances.\n6. Positive oiling system which keeps every bearing flooded and requires the minimum of attention.\n7. Repulsion-induction type motor for alternating current. D. C. motor furnished if required.\n8. All electric systems entirely automatic, starting and stopping with pressure variations.\n9. Supplied also for gasoline power, with a Fuller and Johnson air-cooled engine mounted with the head.\nThe Crane Deep Well System No. 850\n\nA striking value\n\nThe new Crane No. 850 Deep Well System effectively meets the need for a reasonably priced, well-made system which will pump water from any depth. With such a system on the market, no one is justified in doing without the health-giving, comfort-giving, labor-saving qualities of running water.\n\nThis new system is made in capacities to pump 125 to 510 gallons an hour from depths down to 250 feet. Built of the finest materials, machined to a precision not found in ordinary pumps, this system is constructed in every detail for enduring untroubled operation.\n\nIt shares with other Crane systems the advantages of accessibility, simplicity, and easy repair which are so valuable in assuring buyer-satisfaction.\n\nIt is self-oiling. Most heads of this type depend on the dip of the cross-head and crank pin for oiling of these parts. In the Crane No. 850, this practice has been improved by providing a positive overhead oiling system. The oil is collected in a reservoir between the pinions at the high point and carried by gravity to every bearing and pin, including the cross-head and guide rod. This construction means longer life for every part.\n\nAn important feature is the ease with which the sucker rods and plunger can be removed when connected to an open type working barrel or cylinder. The head need never be removed from the foundation to accomplish this occasional servicing. Since the water chamber and head proper remain intact in this operation there is no possibility of the two parts ever getting out of alignment when removing the rods and plungers. It is entirely enclosed as a protection against dirt and foreign substances.\n\nIt will not pound. The pump, of the walking beam type, has a sliding cross-head which moves the rod down at greater speed than up, cushioning the upstroke.\n\nThe system can be operated with either electric or gas engine power. With electric motor, two styles of drive are offered; the standard, with belt and idler, and a silent chain drive with guard. The chain drive, supplied at slight extra cost, is recommended for its long, trouble-free service and greater efficiency. For those who have their own gas engine power and belt drive, the pump is available with tight pulley only; while for line shaft drive it can be furnished with tight and loose pulley at a small extra charge.\n\nLength of stroke is 6 inches and is not adjustable. Pulley size, when furnished, is 16 inches by 2\u00bc inches. Recommended speed\u201440 to 45 strokes a minute. Water chamber\u2014bolted to head, has packing tube and air pump.\n\nRegularly tapped to receive a maximum of 3\u00bd inch drop pipe, and can be bushed down to smaller sizes.\n\nA frost-proof attachment can be furnished when the head cannot be placed where it will be protected from frost.\n\nAmong the many sizes and capacities of the No. 850 is one to exactly meet any requirements. On the following page will be found a table of power required to operate at varying capacities and well depths.\n## Crane Automatic Water Systems\n\n### Table of Power Required for Operating Depths, with Prices\n\n| Symbol | Cap.

It consists of a regular switch box with levers and cross bar, a brass rod with stop collars, and a spherical copper float. It can be adjusted to operate between any desired levels by moving the collars on the rod accordingly. The pressure of the rising water level raises the float against the top collar and breaks the contacts in the switch. When water is drained from the tank, the float lowers with the water level until it rests on the bottom collar, and the weight of the float then throws the switch into contact.\n\nWhen ordering a float switch give inside height of tank so the brass rod can be cut to proper length.\n\nPRICE \u2014\n\nThe drawing on the right shows the dimensions of the base holes for Nos. 215, 400 and 850. By using this sketch a base template can be made full size, which will enable one to build a foundation (when one is needed) before receiving the pump.\n\nThe sketch on the left gives the height in inches of the suction and discharge openings in Nos. 215 and 400. By adding two to these figures the foundation height, it will enable one to rough in suction and discharge lines before receipt of the pump.\n\nCRANE Automatic WATER SYSTEMS\n\nWall Bracket and Floor Base for Pump Only\n\nCrane Cold Water Valve\n\nThis valve is a special check valve which can be installed in discharge line between pump and tank having an outlet to fresh water bibb. Whenever the valve is opened the pump immediately starts pumping, furnishing fresh cold water direct from well.\n\nFor proper installation, see cut.\n\nPrice of valve, $5.00\n\nPrice of valve, $4.00\n\nThe wall bracket base as shown above is made for mounted pump where the construction is made with mounted tanks. This makes a very neat way of mounting pump. The floor base is made to elevate pump from floor where tanks are located some distance from pump.\n\nPrice, each ...........................................\n\nGuarantee\n\nThe manufacturers guarantee all pumps shown in this catalogue to function properly when correctly installed, and will furnish any parts free of charge upon the return of the defective ones. No charge, however, for labor or expense required to repair defective goods, or occasioned by them, will be allowed unless authorization in writing has first been secured. If the goods are defective, the measure of the damage is the price of the defective goods only.\n\nRelief Valve\n\nIt is made entirely of brass, with adjusting nuts on outside of body of valve.\n\nPrice ....... $6.00\n\nCrane Foot Valve\n\nMade along the most scientific lines. You will see from accompanying cut how perfect check is obtained under the leather seal on seat. Recommended for use on bottom of suction line where suction exceeds 10 feet.\n\nPrice ...........................................\nWater Requirements\n\nAn average family of three to four persons using water for house use only with a laundry tub, bathroom and kitchen sink should not ordinarily require a larger outfit than our 215-A with a 42-gallon tank.\n\nFor a family of five to eight persons, under the same conditions we would recommend our 215-C outfit with 82-gallon tank.\n\nA few estimated maximum water requirements are:\n\nFor each member of family ........... 25 to 30 gal. per day.\nFor each horse .......... 10 gal. per day.\nFor each milch cow .. 10 to 15 gal. per day.\nFor each hog .......... 5 gal. per day.\nFor each sheep .......... 3 gal. per day.\nFor sprinkling with one-half-inch hose equipped with nozzle .. 200 gal. per hour.\n\nAs Automatic Electric Water Systems are designed to operate at intervals for most efficient service, the tank size should be such as to carry about one-half the amount of water used daily.\n\nFor any information you may desire in regard to pumping problems, write to our Engineering Department.

MacKenzie\n\nGentlemen: Please refer to your letter of the 27th and our reply of the 30th inst. regarding automatic flushing tanks supplied for the Central School at Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nWe have had our mechanic make an investigation of the above and from his report we concluded that it is not the fixture which is giving the trouble but it is on account of insufficient water. The man in charge of the building has stated that the flushing tanks work perfectly when there is sufficient water. Our mechanic shut off all the valves leading to fixtures and tightened the pump itself, and has reported that there must be something wrong with same because very little water was coming from same.\n\nFor your information, we are attaching our circular of Crane Automatic Water Systems, and we would refer you to Page 8 which illustrates and describes our heavy duty automatic Pump.\n\nIf we can be of any further assistance to you, please communicate with us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCRANE LIMITED.\n\nBY W.

The prices are figured on B.C. Fix for every cupboard, installed in place to our satisfaction without the furnishings of hardware. An additional amount of twenty-five (25) would be required for brass catches, knobs etc. to complete the cupboards. The painting could be done by some painter on the Reserve at a much lower cost.\n\nSo as not to spoil our beautiful class-rooms and to save expense, I thought of adjusting the cupboards above the panels in the space between the window and the door of each wardrobe, taking no floor space, fitting very nicely and large enough to answer the purpose. The sisters shall be served a cupboard for their wearing apparel, but they are\nwilling to hang them on a hook alongside the pipe.\n\nHoping that the above information is satisfactory,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\nYours respectfully,\nSister M. Rose Anna, S.S.A.\n\nMr. A.F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nOttawa\nMay 7, 1926.\n\nRev. and Dear Madam,\n\nI beg to inform you that the W. F. Vilas Co. of Cowansville, Que., have just advised the Department that they will send at your request one of their carpenters to supervise the installation of the classroom furniture just purchased from them for the new Central School at Caughnawaga. You may, therefore, communicate with their agent in Montreal as soon as the building is ready to receive this furniture.\n\nAs to the purchase of cupboards for the classrooms for this building, I beg to say that the Department accepts the offer sent in through your office by J. H. LeBeuf Ltd., of Ville St. Pierre, with the understanding that the work is to be carried out to your satisfaction and in accordance with the details given in your communication of the 16th ultimo. You may arrange later with a local painter for the staining and varnishing of the above mentioned cupboards, in order to have them match the rest of the woodwork of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

After many inquiries I find it much more economical to have the wall cupboards built by a lumber company and installed by a carpenter. It takes at least three weeks to get an order filled at the mill and ten days to have the work completed. Then comes the buying of dishes, kitchen utensils and all that is necessary to carry on that activity.\n\nAltho I understand it is preferable to wait for Mr. Ferrier's return before any decision can be given regarding the purchases required for the next scholastic year, could there not be an exception made in a case such as the one mentioned above.\n\nAssuredly it will be utterly impossible to open that class if the cupboards, counter and electric installation are not attended to before August. The Indians are looking forward to the opening of the Domestic Science class and a disappointment of that kind will mean trouble to me.\n\nHoping you will understand my situation, I am, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. J.D.

Sister Mary Rose Alma to have the cupboards and counter built and installed in the domestic science room in the new Central School on the Caughnawaga Reserve. She has been authorized to have J. Theoret, general contractor, Lachine, carry out this work. His price for the building of the cupboards complete is $160, and for the counter, $130. The Rev. Sister is being requested to have him prepare accounts, in duplicate, and submit same to you. Please certify them in the usual manner and send them to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL.

As it will take time to have this work carried out and in order to prevent delay, the Department will approve of the acceptance of the quotation of J. Theoret, general contractor, of Lachine, to build and install the cupboards and counter. It is noted that his quotation for the building of the cupboards, as per the sketch which you enclosed, is $150, and for the building of the counter, as per sketch enclosed, $130. You may therefore arrange with him to undertake this work and have same completed to your satisfaction at as early a date as possible. The Department is leaving this matter in your hands, as it is assured you will see that the work is satisfactorily performed. When the cupboards and counter have been installed, Mr. Theoret should submit his accounts in duplicate to Mr. Agent Letourneau, who is being informed of the authority granted you. Mr. Letourneau will certify the accounts and send them to the Department for payment.\n\nRelative to any electrical installation that may be required in connection with the fitting up of this domestic science room, I shall be pleased if you will obtain prices and submit them to the Department, when consideration will be given to authorising having the work done.

This agreement was for a period of 25 years.

It would be necessary to build a Beaver-board partition to make an entrance hall at the end of which would be a cloakroom such as there is one at the Eastern school. I believe the cost of this work would not amount to much as we could use the Beaver-board which has been discarded from the principal entrance of the Kateri school.

After much inquiry I found a manufacturer of Montreal who volunteers to make the cupboards and have them installed for $233.50 which is $50 more than was asked by Mr. Pelletier and accepted by the Department.\n\nDo you not think it advisable to have six fire extinguishers for the Senior School? They can be purchased for $13.50 each and 75\u00a2 for the refiller.\n\nMay I please ask you to give immediate attention to the first paragraph especially as it takes so long to get orders filled at the mills.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A.

The deafening floor above mentioned consists in the laying of one ply roofing paper between the joists and filling of the space with a thickness of dry cinders.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Six of these had no chairs to match as they were set up temporarily in the classes needed. Three chairs that were repaired last year fell to pieces when they were unscrewed. This accounts for the nine chairs for Harvard adjustable desks 26\" x 20\" asked for on last requisition.\n\nHoping the above explanations are satisfactory,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister M.

We believe there would be no Sales Tax on these goods for your Department, but if so, the Government Sales Tax of 5% would have to be added to the above price.

Est-ce que l'eau de la couverture qui suivra ainsi sur la brique durant les temps froids ne sera pas de nature \u00e0 endommager les joints ?

Provision should also be made for the cleaning of the school grounds which is filled with large boulders, and for the filling of the holes where stone has been quarried. This work can be done economically by day labour, under the supervision of Mr. Robert, Caretaker of the School.\n\nA slate or marble partition 24\" x 3/4\" x 4'6\" is required to separate the two urinals in the boys' lavatory. This material can be purchased here in Ottawa, and shipped to the caretaker of the school, who is willing to install it in place.\n\nOne faucet is required in the recreation room to allow water to be taken with pails for the cleaning of the floors, etc. The faucets in the water basins are too low for this purpose. This work can be done by the plumber who will have charge of the installation of the hot water tank in the boiler room.\n\nWith reference to the furnishing and installing of hot water system for the domestic science classroom, I would suggest that the electrical work be entrusted to Mr. Needing of the Clovis Electric Co., who has already done work in this building, and that the plumbing work be given to Mr. Pilon, plumber, of Lachine, who has offered to carry out this work reasonably.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | Putting in intermediate deafening floor between the joists of ground floor at the Central School at Caughnawaga, amount allowed on cost of work. | $125.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

For the last few weeks it has been impossible to obtain the necessary water to this school. It would be well for the Department to look into this matter at once.\n\nAt the Senior School, whether it is on account of some defect in the pumping system or the intake of the pipe, but it is however impossible to get the water needed for the general purpose of the school.\n\nI also take this occasion to ask the Department if you intend to have the damaged plastering repaired? This was deteriorated last spring and was furthermore spoiled during the tornado of the 21st & 22nd September last by the crowd from Laughnawaga and outside. Permission was then given by the Dept. to use the Auditorium at the Senior School where the plastering now need repairs.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) Solergo Stannum\nGenl.\nOttawa, October 1, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to transmit herewith an account of $98.45 received at the Department from the Canadian General Electric Company for a range shipped to an Indian School at Caughnawaga.

As you are aware, all accounts payable by the Department for supplies furnished for Indian purposes at the Caughnawaga Reserve should be submitted through your office, and should bear your certificate if they are correct.

The successful applicant in the competition was Mr. J. A. Barcelou, of La Prairie, but, when advised of his appointment, he informed the Indian Agent that he would be unable to accept, as he had obtained a more advantageous position. As the work was well advanced and it would take too long to await the result of another competition, we made an arrangement to have the Indian Agent make weekly inspections together with the Departmental Engineer until the work is completed. If Mr. Jacobs' application had been received in time, I doubt whether we would have accepted his appointment, as it is not considered that he possesses the proper qualifications or has had sufficient experience in this kind of work.

The installation of this system became necessary on account of discontinuing taking water from the water system at the Mission building across the road, which did not give continuous service. The supply pipe connecting both systems was frozen most of the winter season, and on this account the Department was compelled to pay for the transportation of water. The prices received are as follows:\n\nCrane Limited, Montreal, $294.50\nDarling Bros., Montreal, $270.00\nCanadian Fairbanks Morse, Montreal, $371.10 and Ottawa.\n\nI beg to recommend that the order be placed with the firm quoting the lowest price, and that the installation be entrusted to the Clovis Electric Co., who have already done similar work in other schools on this Reserve at a reasonable charge.

Sisters of St. Ann's Congregation\nCaughranaga, P.Q.\n\nReverend Sisters\u2014\n\nMr. Guy tells us that if you install a cylinder with connections of 2\u00bd in., you would obtain better results, but you will have also to change the pipe of 1\u00bd\" for a 2\u00bd\" one. The price of this cylinder with 30 ft. of galvanized pipe is $63.50 F.C.B. Montreal.\n\nThis price does not comprise the time and expenses of Mr. Guy or any other of our mechanics who may have to do the installation, and the cost of the change will depend on the time that it will take.\n\nMr. Guy tells us also that the leashes of the pistons on the compression cylinders were dry and after he had them soaked the pump was working very well. Evidently your man is not very familiar with this pump or he should have avoided this trouble.\n\nThis is the third time that Mr. Guy goes to your place to look over troubles of the same kind and which cannot be attributed to a defect in the construction or the material of the pump; consequently we hope that when you receive our account you will approve it for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Fairbanks Morse Co.

I am informed that Mr. A. Denoon of Sackville, offers also a good lot to do these repairs by day labour, and I believe it would be wise to follow this course.\n\nConcerning the building of a fence around the Senior School, I want like to meet the departmental engineer on the ground at his next visit to Longawanaga, together with Mr. Barcelon of Sopranie, who could undertake this work.\n\nI would also like to discuss at that moment with the engineer the question of repairs done to the water system for the supply of water to the Sisters School by the Rev. Father Missionary at the Priest house at Longawanaga.\n\nI have in hand the accounts for gasoline and repairs amounting to $248.17.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Lawrence Salmonson\nAgent\nNov. 9, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 20th ultimo, regarding certain repairs required to the plaster at the Central School at Craigburnage, I beg to say that you may arrange to have this work carried out as speedily and economically as possible, in the manner suggested in your above mentioned communication. It should be understood that no repairs other than those strictly necessary in the Assembly Hall of this School should be undertaken, and that the painting of the plaster will not be authorised until next year. As to the repairs required to the pneumatic water supply system at the above mentioned building, I understand that this matter has already been attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nCaughnawaga\nPost Office\nNov 2nd/28\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith your kindness attention,\nThat I have called to your Office of the Indian Affairs\nAbout the damage of our roof. I've had a man to look over he said it would be about $15.00 to get it fixed.\n\nAnd what about my fare for I've come only for that to get the roof fixed.\n\nWith much Affige\nYours very truly\nMrs. John H. Caughnawaga\nAnd she came here to see for the house and she asked if you want to give her half of her fair she came specially for that.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith a letter dated 2nd instant from Mrs. John S. Canadian, of Caughnawaga, which I beg to submit for your consideration, and approval if possible.\n\nThis claim of $15. from Mrs Canadian whose property is in the neighborhood of the Senior School, is for alleged damages to the roof of her dwelling house during the construction of that school by the contractors MacKenzie & Genest during the fall of the year 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEnclosure.\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nA claim was submitted to the Department through the office of the Indian Agent last summer, from an Indian woman by the name of Mrs. Cecilia Hanson, who resides on the Caughnawaga Malone Highway, Caughnawaga Reserve. She claimed an amount of $21.00 representing the cost of repairs required to her house, which she claimed had been damaged by blasting at the time of the construction of the sewer line for the Central School last winter. The trench, which was dug in solid rock, passes quite close to her house, but all possible precautions were taken by the contractors to prevent damage. I consider that it was probably on account of her house being very old that the blasting affected it, if such was the case. This matter was submitted to Indian Agent Letourneau who reported that the claim appeared to be fair and reasonable according to hearsay.\n\nI since interviewed the contractors concerning this matter and they have convinced me that they cannot be held responsible in any way for damage done to property in the vicinity of the school, in view of the fact that they took every care possible when the work was being carried out. The request, for this reason, was left in abeyance, and no further communication has been received from that Indian woman.\n\nThe Department has just received a claim amounting to $15.00 from Mrs. J. Canadian, whose property is also located in the neighborhood of the School. It is curious to note that these claims were not sent in last winter at the time of the performance of the work which they claim was the cause of the damage. However, as I know that the work was carried out with as much care as possible, and that the contractors went to the expense of boarding up the windows, replacing broken glass, etc., I would suggest that these claims be not given any consideration.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nOct. 29, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nAs requested in your communication of the 17th instant, I beg to say that the address of the Contractors Messrs.

Furthermore they have continued to be supplied by the Mission as in the past.\n\nThe repairs, all very urgent so as not to condemn the children and Sisters to suffer the infection of closets without water, did not leave us time to communicate with the department.\n\nWould it be too much to ask that your department expenses the expense incurred solely to supply the water needed, as proven by a letter from the Mission Superior enclosed herewith.\n\nIt seems to us that we are not asking for anything exaggerated under the circumstances especially when the department has not yet accepted the association.\n\nThe P.

Hamel S.J.\nSt. Ann's Convent,\nCaughnawaga, Nov.17, 1928.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nMay I please confirm the fact that the water used in Kateri School was supplied by the Rectory upon our request, whenever it was needed until about two weeks ago.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Rose Ahma.\nSuperior.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, together with that from Mrs. John Canadian, who claims an amount of $15.00 for damages to her dwelling house, resulting from the construction of the Senior School at Caughnawaga by Messrs. MacKenzie & Genest, during the fall of 1927.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this claim, also that made by Mrs. Cecilia Ransom, amounting to $21.39 for similar damages, which was submitted last summer through your office, was referred to one of the contractors when he was in the Department, and the question of their responsibility in the matter was fully stressed. The contractor stated emphatically that all possible care and precautions were taken by them during the progress of the work for the protection of surrounding property, etc., such as the boarding up of windows, and adequate covering of eaves, and that in the event of any house having suffered damages as has been claimed, they should be attributed to the poor state of repair of the houses. He also declared that any damages which resulted from the execution of their contract, such as broken window panes, etc., which were brought to their attention at the time were immediately repaired.\n\nIn view of the above mentioned facts and the statements subsequently made in connection with this matter, I regret to say that the Department is unable to give these claims any consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLe Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\n\nJe De McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nThe agreement referred to in Rev. Father Hauser's letter of the 19th instant between the Department and the Missionary of Caughnawaga was drawn up in September 1919, whereby the latter, in summary, agreed to allow the water pipe from the girls' school to be connected to the water supply system then in operation at the Mission building, on condition that the Department would assume the cost of supplying the gasoline for the operation of the system, would pay for the cost of a number of improvements to the system which were considered necessary at that time, and maintain the system in a good state of repair in the future. In return the Missionary was to take care of the whole installation and its proper operation, during a period of 25 years.\n\nAs it became obvious later that the upkeep and operation of the system entailed too large an expenditure on the part of the Department, it became advisable to provide an independent and more adequate water supply for this school. The Agent was, therefore, requested in February 1927 to obtain from the Missionary an annulment of this agreement, and this was confirmed in a communication from the Missionary on March 27th last, turned out hereunder together with the agreement. No accounts have since been submitted by the Missionary in connection with the upkeep or operation of the system, and the Department was under the impression that the necessary water for the school was being supplied from a shallow well pump.\n\nThe Department was advised on the 7th instant by the Principal of the School that this was not the case, and that the school had continued to obtain water from the old system at her request. She submitted to me in the presence of the Agent, when I was last in Caughnawaga, a number of accounts with a request that I arrange for a refund to the Missionary. I suggested that the Missionary's request be submitted direct to the Department, as I explained that I was under the impression that since the agreement was discontinued last spring the Department was under no obligation towards the maintenance or operation of this system. Furthermore I do not understand the accompanying accounts, and I would respectfully\nsuggest that the whole matter be referred to the Indian Agent, in order that the Department might be furnished with a report as to whether it would be justified in giving the Missionary's request any consideration.\n\nI may add for your information that an artesian well has been sunk at this school, and an order for the necessary pumping equipment was given some time ago. It is expected that a reliable system will be in operation in the course of a few days.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nNov. 22, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 19th instant, addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, together with a number of accounts which have been paid by you for the maintenance and operating of the water supply system at the Mission building, Ongimawaga.\n\nIn reply I beg to advise you that I am today sending these accounts to Indian Agent Lotournon with a request that they be examined and returned here with the necessary report.\n\nAs soon as this report is received your request for a refund of the amount of the above mentioned accounts will be given consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. C. M. Hauser, S. J.,\nMissionary,\nOngimawaga, Ont.\nNov. 22, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI am sending you herewith a number of accounts sent in by Rev. Father Hauser for the repairing and operating of the water supply system at the Mission buildings. The Missionary claims that he is entitled to a refund of the amount expended on account of water having been furnished to the girls' school at Saginawaga at the request of the Principal, although the agreement in connection with the joint use of this system terminated last March.\n\nIn view of the above mentioned circumstances, I would request that you fully examine these accounts, more particularly the one from Dr. Courcel, which contains an item of $84.55 for which there are no details given. Vouchers in duplicate giving a description of the amount and nature of the work which you consider a just claim against this Department should be sent in by you as early as possible.\n\nI should also like to be advised whether the Missionary should be officially notified of the discontinuation of the agreement in connection with this water supply system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

The Department allowed $30 on the letter of August 22nd - File 5-1-5, but I expended $20 for staple groceries for Sept., and the monthly current expenditures for Oct., Nov., and Dec., were approximately $8.00.\n\nCould the grant be made so as to allow more money the first month to stock certain provisions that are needed at almost every lesson, and payable at the end of every month.\n\nThe girls look forward with delight to their cooking lessons. They show great interest in all that pertains to domestic science.\n\nThanking you for your kindness and your influential assistance in all that concerns the Caughnawaga R.C. Schools.

The coal is ordered directly by the Department and is delivered to the buildings by the Indians without any checking of the weight or the amount delivered to each building. After giving this question serious consideration I am convinced that a large saving could be effected if the heating system were operated by employing either fuel oil or buckwheat coal using a forced draft system. Should you give this matter further consideration I will gladly furnish you with additional information as to the saving that can be made and the cost of each type of installation.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nOttawa, January 25, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, relative to the cost per year of obtaining the groceries and other supplies required for the cooking classes in the Central School on the Caughnawaga Reserve. It is noted that the monthly cost for the past three months has been approximately $5.\n\nThe Department will allow a grant to an amount not exceeding $10 per month for the ten teaching months in the year for the purpose of purchasing the supplies required for the cooking classes. We prefer that you arrange for the purchase of these supplies and for payment of same, including in your usual monthly statement of expenses an item as follows: \"Grant allowed for the purchase of supplies for cooking classes - Central School ... $10.\" Under the above arrangement, a total amount of $100 will be allowed each school year.

To remedy this condition, I would strongly urge that steel posts and extra beams be erected to strengthen this part of the building. This work could be economically carried out when general repairs are being performed at other schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve.

It should be the same for the entrance to the basement of the Eastern School. This entrance is deteriorating on account of the first rows of bricks which are breaking under the weight.\n\nThe Vaillant water closet in the kitchen of the latter residence should, I believe, be replaced by W.C. for on which a coat of \"filler\" and varnish could be applied. I also wish to recommend that stoneware hand basins be installed on the dressing of the large concert hall of the Senior school, as that kind of paint is easier to keep clean than water colours.\n\nThe electric bell system outside the Eastern and Western schools is in bad order; I recommend it be renewed. At the Protestant school quite important repairs are necessary. A new articulation well should be sunk. Water is lacking absolutely at this school, also for the W.C., which should be rebuilt outside.\n\nThe outside doors, windows and stairs should be repaired and painted.\n\nPlease instruct your obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo...Rev...Sisters of St.Ann,\n(Procure des Missions)\nLACHINE,\nQue.,\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1929 April 2 | For the laundry made for the teachers of the Caughnawaga Indian R.C.

I believe these repairs would not be complete if the floor was left in that state.\n\nI wish to recommend that the employees of the Clovis Electric Co. be authorized to scrape the floor entirely and have them paint spots disappear and then give the floor 2 coats of varnish.\n\nYours etc., [Signature]\nMonsieur,\n\nJe dois vous informer que dans le cours de la semaine derni\u00e8re, \u00e0 Caughnawaga, j'ai rencontr\u00e9 le Reverend P\u00e8re Hauser, s.j. Ptre Missionnaire, qui m'a demand\u00e9 de soumettre au Departement la question d'un raccordement du syst\u00e8me pour la fourniture de l'eau qui est pr\u00e9sentement install\u00e9 dans l'\u00e9cole Kateri, \u00e0 celui du Presbyt\u00e8re, pour la raison que les Missionnaires ne peuvent se procurer autrement l'eau potable n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 leur subsistance.\n\nUn tuyau pour la conduite de l'eau existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 entre le Presbyt\u00e8re et l'\u00e9cole Kateri. Il suffirait de faire faire ce raccordement dans le soubassement de l'\u00e9cole.\n\nCependant, je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 en recommander d\u00e8s maintenant l'ex\u00e9cution, pour la raison que des difficult\u00e9s ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 surgies avec le Reverend P\u00e8re Hauser au sujet de cette fourniture de l'eau qui \u00e9tait faite dans le temps par les Reverends Peres., en sens inverse.\n\nDepuis que le Departement a fait faire une installation qui semble fonctionner admirablement bien, le Reverend P\u00e8re Hauser aimerait sans doute maintenant tirer avantage de ce service pour la fourniture de l'eau pour le Presbyt\u00e8re. Autrement il lui serait excessivement co\u00fbteux d'avoir \u00e0 faire une installation ind\u00e9pendante de celle actuellement install\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole Kateri, c'est pour cette raison qu'il demande l'autorisation au Departement de faire ce raccordement.\n\nEn autorisant ce raccordement il faudrait\n\n..................\nchanger le r\u00e9servoir actuel par un autre de plus grandes dimensions; il faudrait aussi prendre en consid\u00e9ration la question de la part que le Reverend Pere devrait payer pour le service du pouvoir \u00e9lectrique, etc., ces diverses conditions devraient \u00eatre convenues par \u00e9crit pour \u00eatre finalement accept\u00e9es par le D\u00e9partement.\n\nJe crois devoir sugg\u00e9rer qu'au cas d'acceptation par le D\u00e9partement, s'il survenait par la suite un d\u00e9saccord, ou apr\u00e8s un avis de quelques jours le D\u00e9partement pourra discontinue ce service.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent des Indiens.\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des Indiens,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that during the course of last week at Caughnawaga I met Rev. Father Hamer, a missionary who asked me to submit to the Department the question of connecting the water system at present installed at the school to that of the Presbytery, for the reason that the missionaries cannot get a supply of drinkable water otherwise.\n\nA water pipe already exists between the new battery and the school. It would be sufficient to have it connected in the cellar of the school.\n\nHowever, I am not inclined to recommend without the execution of this project, for the reason that difficulties arose in the past about this supply of water, which at that time was installed in the reverse way by the Rev. Fathers to the school.\n\nSince the Department has had an installation made which works admirably well, Rev. F. Hamer would like now to benefit of the service by getting the necessary water supply to the Presbytery. Otherwise it would be very costly to have a separate installation made similar to that of the school, that is the reason why he is requesting the authorization of the Department to make the connection.\n\nBy authorizing such connection it would be necessary to change the present water tank and have it replaced by a larger one; the share of the electric subsidy to be paid by the reverend Fathers should also be taken into consideration; all these conditions should be agreed.\nupon an writing to be finally approved by the Department.\n\nI wish to suggest that in case the allotment would accept this proposition, should any disagreement arise, the service could be discontinued after a few days notice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, May 3, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the request that the Department allow the missionary at Caughnawaga to connect the Presbytery with the water supply system of the Kateri School. I regret that I cannot grant this request at the present time; but I wish to assure you that it is receiving the consideration of the Department.\n\nI have also your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to scraping the floor of the concert hall at the Senior School. There are no funds available for this improvement at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL.

You should report as to what further work is required to complete the erection of the fence around the central school property, stating the material and labour necessary for the completion of this work. You should also visit the Protestant School building and report as to the repairs, painting, etc., that you would recommend in order to place this building in a satisfactory condition, giving, if possible, an estimate of the cost of any work which you would recommend be carried out. Further, you should furnish a report regarding the erection of a new fence around the property, the removal of the swings and the fitting up of the ground around the school. Please report, also, on any other matters requiring attention at these schools.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMay 17, 1929.\n\nMr. [Signature]\n\nWhile making an inspection of the work now being carried out by the various schools in Caughnawaga my attention was brought to the necessity of performing various works which have not been authorized.\n\nEASTERN SCHOOL.\nReconstruction of the entrance to the basement at an estimated cost of $250.00.\n\nThe brick veneer was found to be in immediate need of painting. This work was authorized as well as the replacing of two doors of the pupils' entrance which were warped and cannot be rehung.\n\nMIDDLE SCHOOL.\nThe brick veneer of this building was found to be in need of painting, and this work was authorized, also the replacing of two doors of the pupils' entrance which were beyond repair. The new doors will have glazed panels instead of being entirely of wood and will improve the appearance of the building.\n\nSENIOR SCHOOL.\nThe floor of the auditorium of this building was damaged in many places while the roof was being reinforced, and should therefore be revarnished at a cost of $60.00. I have not authorized this expenditure. Screens are required for this building, and I would recommend that they be ordered from a Sash Factory in Lachine by the Agent. They will probably cost around $1.50 each. Authorization was given for the installation of two chains around the railing of the opening above the winding stairs in the rear of the stage as a means of protection against the pupils falling into the stair well. This will cost about $15.00.\n\nAuthorization was given for the painting of the fire escapes at each of the above mentioned schools.\n\nTEACHERS' RESIDENCE.\nA separate drain for the waste water from the laundry\nshould be installed in order that this water might not pass through the septic tank and thus interfere with the proper functioning of same.\n\nThis separate drain will cost in the neighborhood of $100.00 and I strongly recommend that it be installed as early as possible.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nSt. Ann's Convent,\nCaughnawaga, P.

After speaking with Mr. Chene this week he saw no other means but standing completely outside and suggested a window seat such as used by the professional window-washers. If to save that expense you could suggest some other means I would appreciate it.\n\nYou would greatly oblige me if you gave this letter your earliest attention, as I hope to have the windows cleaned before the Closing Exercises.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister M. Rose Alma\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 21st, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, requesting authority to purchase a window apparatus for the caretaker, to enable him to wash the windows at the Senior School on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase of this equipment. You will, no doubt, be aware as to what is required and will be able to obtain same either in Lachine or Montreal. It is thought that this equipment could also be used, if required, in cleaning the windows at the Eastern and Kateri Schools.\n\nYou should obtain an account, in duplicate, and this you should hand to Mr. Agent Letourneau, in order that he can certify same and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister M. Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nMay 22, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been advised that the repairs now being performed at the Caughnawaga Schools are not progressing as speedily as they should, and that some of the painters and carpenters are not competent to fulfill the work entrusted to them. I would ask you, therefore, to consult with Mr. Needing who has charge of the work and make the necessary arrangements in order that the work may be completed by the end of this month. As previously mentioned the Department relies on you to verify the time sheets submitted to you by the contractor, as well as the accounts for materials which are to be ordered at the time that they are needed on the work.\n\nNo work, other than authorized by the Department Engineer when he last made an inspection, should be undertaken, with the exception of the cleaning and varnishing of the floor in the auditorium of the Senior School and the reconstruction of the entrances to the basement in the rear elevation of the Eastern School, which work should be undertaken at once in order that it might be fully completed on the above mentioned date.\n\nThe Department will further advise you with regard to the renovating of the Protestant School as well as the St. Isidore Road School and Teachers' residence, which work it is intended to have performed by contract.\n\nA request has been made by the Superior of the schools that screens be purchased for all windows of the Senior School. I would ask you to obtain competitive prices from local dealers for a strongly constructed screen each provided with all necessary hardware for their adjustment in the lower part of the windows, all of which should receive two coats of paint. The price should be $2.00 per school building at Caughnawaga.\n\nKindly acknowledge receipt of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLe Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\n\nJe.-De. Mclean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, May 20, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs the school year is nearing its close, I beg to remind you of your kind offer of annually donating a Ten Dollar Gold Piece to the most deserving girl of the Caughnawaga Schools.\n\nYour kind encouragement is highly appreciated by the teaching staff and is a great stimulant for our pupils.\n\nBelieve me, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T.

Les peintres et les menuisiers qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s par la Compagnie Clovis Electric n'avaient sans doute pas tous la m\u00eame comp\u00e9tence au travail, d'ailleurs, les listes de paie attestent qu'ils sont pay\u00e9s d'apr\u00e8s la capacit\u00e9 de chacun d'eux et ils \u00e9taient plac\u00e9s par M. Niding, qui est journali\u00e8rement en charge de ces travaux, suivant le genre de travail que ces employ\u00e9s pouvaient faire en tenant compte de l'habilit\u00e9 de chacun d'eux.

The pay lists as well as the accounts for materials were well checked and controlled, and the pay lists more particularly were verified each week by the Reverend Sister Superior of the School. The painters and carpenters employed by the Clowes Electric Co., did not all have the same competency for the work they had to perform; however the pay list indicates that they were paid according to their individual merit and they were placed by Mr. Ryding, who is continually in charge of the work, according to the nature of the work and ability of each one to do it.\n\nIt was Indians of Caughnawaga who were employed, as in the past when repairs were authorized by the Department.\nAt every visit of my visits at Oshawa, two and sometimes three times a week, I examined with Mr. Miller, the work in progress; he also came several times at my office at St. Constant to confer about it and I can affirm that if this work cost to date, an approximate sum of $300.00 in work and material has been supplied to the Department to that extent.\n\nSenior School\n\nThe work done is as follows:\n\n1. One coat of paint was given in every room as well as the hall. This work was preceded by a thorough cleaning of the walls.\n\n2. A second coat of paint was put on at the request of Rev. Sister Superior as the first coat did not appear sufficient.\n\n3. Cleaning and varnishing of the Concert Hall (Auditorium) as well as the principal entrance and following, the rooms contiguous to the principal entrance, this was done according to instructions given by Rev. Sister Superior. Both toilet rooms were painted and also varnished up to 6 ft. high.\n\n4. After the work was completed by Mr. Macleay in the Auditorium, the repair work to the plastering necessitated the employment of two plasterers with two laborers for nearly 8 days and the material required for that same work took 75% of that which was intended to be used at other places.\n\n(Note) The work which remains to be done at that school is: one coat of paint to be given to the fire escapes, as the rust covering them will damage them considerably.\nKateri School\n\n1. The repairs to the plastering are completed.\n\n2. Cement basis 5'x3' were built, from proof, under the brick pillars which were rebuilt (this is covered in the accounts for materials) supporting the columns of the porches situated at the outside entrance as well as at the extremities of the school. These columns were rotten at their bases, but they were utilized by Mr. Hickey by adding other blocks of wood with mouldings.\n\nAnother cement basis also proof-proof was placed under the stair of the principal entrance.\n\n3. A proof-proof cement basis was placed under the fire escape.\n\n4. The roof was repaired.\n\n5. The steps and risers of the three exterior stairs were rebuilt.\n\nThe work remaining to be done by the Oblate Co. to this school are as follows:\n\n1. Painting the interior and exterior of the building.\n\n2. The two doors at the ends need to be replaced.\n\nNote: The bricks which could be used again from the pillars of the three entrances were transported by Mr. Hickey to the Eastern school where they were used again.\n\nEastern School\n\n1. The cement basis were also rebuilt, supporting under the entrances at the end and front of this school.\n\n2. The exterior stairs were in very bad state and had become dangerous on account of the decay of the timbers; it was necessary to replace all that timber.\nA cement base was built under the main entrance.\n\nThe walls were given two coats of paint at the interior.\n\n(Note) The plastering in the school rooms of this building was in very bad state and have necessitated a great deal of repair work beside the cleaning of the walls which had to be done after.\n\nThe ceilings were finished.\n\nThe carpentry work to the doors and windows was completed.\n\nThe work remaining to be done to the school is as follows:\n\n1. Painting of the exterior.\n2. Repair the sidewalk at the main entrance.\n3. Demolish and rebuild the entrance to the basement at the rear of the school.\n\nPermit me to suggest that this entrance be rebuilt in the same manner as that done by the same company during the course of last fall at the Sisters' school. The artesian well which is 6\" in diameter and drilled at a great depth supplies water of good quality to this Eastern school. There may not be any question of installing an automatic pump similar to that of the Sisters' school; at least when it is thought of installing one as the well is already dug, it would be more economical to have the intake pipe lengthened a few feet than now.\n\nSisters' residence:\n\nThe work done was as follows:\n\n1. Painting, with two coats of the exterior of the residence, the dependencies as well as the...\nHowever, the painting of the fence will not be completed before Friday, the 31st inst.\n\n2. Repairs done to the residence.\n\n3. The residence's doors are repaired.\n\n4. The plastering was repaired and two coats of paint were applied on the walls of five rooms as well as the hall of the main entrance, all the ceilings of those rooms were painted as well as the dining room.\n\nThe work remaining to be done at the residence is as follows:\n\n1. Waterproof cement on the roofs.\n\nNote: It will be necessary to wait until the temperature is warmer to do this work.\n\n2. Paint the floors, one coat in the bed rooms.\n\n3. Varnish the linoleums.\n\n4. Paint the wainscoting.\n\nI fear that the remaining work may not be completed by the end of the present month as requested in your letter of the 27th inst.\n\nHowever, Mr. Hiding is doing his best to have the work done as soon as possible, but I fear this may not be terminated until the 8th of June next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nMonsieur,\n\nJe suis inform\u00e9 par Albany Robert, gardien des \u00e9coles \u00e0 Caughnawaga, ainsi que de l'entretien de la r\u00e9sidence des Soeurs, que M.

The motor is furnished in all ordinary voltages and cycles.\n\nOther models of the same capacity (225 gallons-per-hour), either without tank or with any standard size pressure tank up to 1000 gallon capacity may be furnished.\n\n440 Gallon-per-Hour Pumps\n\nThese models are twin-cylinder, duplex type, shallow well pumps with 440 gallon-per-hour capacity, 3/4 H.P. motor.\n\nThe extra large pumping capacity will take care of the requirements of many installations where a large volume of water is desired.\n\nMay be furnished without tank or equipped with any standard size storage and pressure tank, as shown to the right (Model 400-B, 80-gallon tank), according to requirements.\n\nDeep Well Pumps\n\nWhen complete automatic pressure water service is desired, where the supply must be pumped from a depth greater than 22 feet, these pumps designed especially for deep well use are available. It is easy to install, requires practically no attention, and is as near perfect as engineering and manufacturing experience can make it.\n\nA complete deep well system consists of the power head (illustrated right) with motor and air pump, together with appropriate size pressure tank and well cylinder, either of the open or closed type.\n\nThere are several patented and superior features about the line of Deep Well Water Systems. Packing box and piston rod are made of brass with packing of extra high quality. Operating normally at a 5\" stroke, this may be easily adjusted to the 6\" position when a smaller cylinder must be used, or to the 4\" position, when the voltage is low.\n\nFour Models\u2014125 to 550 gallons-per-hour. Model 25, for wells up to 100 feet; Model 50, for wells up to 200 feet in depth; Model 75, for wells up to 300 feet in depth; Model 100, for wells up to 575 feet in depth.\nSingle Cylinder Delco-Light Plants\n\nCombination 750-Watt Delco-Light\nModels 778 and 786\nCombining the desirable features of an automatic and a battery charging plant.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nEngine: Air-cooled, valve-in-head, 4-cycle, copper-finned, single-cylinder engine.

I shall be pleased if you will state who placed the order, and on whose authority, and the school for which same was required.

Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nSept. 11, 1929.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Paget.\n\nThe Department requires an oil burner for the Senior School lately erected at Caughnawaga, one large enough to heat a no. 8 hot water boiler. I have examined a number of types of installations, several of which I found to be thoroughly dependable and worthy of consideration. Among these is the Sphinx manufactured by Shaver Bros. Ltd., of Ottawa in three different types, selling at $555.00 - $650.00 - $750.00. After seeing this burner in course of assembly and in operation at the factory, I would recommend that the order be placed with this firm for one of medium size at their price $650.00, without fuel oil tanks. This price comprises complete installation of the apparatus and one year maintenance service.\n\nShould it be found advisable to invite competitive prices for an apparatus of this kind I would ask you to furnish me with the names of dealers in Montreal. It is essential that this equipment be supplied as early as possible as no provision has been made for supplying coal this fall.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nOttawa,\nSept. 11, 1929.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI beg to inform you that your offers of $350.00 for the furnishing of 3000 gal. tank and $82.00 for the furnishing of 200 gal. tank for the Senior School at Ongimawaga has been accepted, and I would request that you arrange to have the above mentioned tanks delivered at the school as early as possible. The tanks should be built in order to be installed horizontally instead of vertically, as called for by the specification. The various openings as called for should be placed accordingly as well as the manhole.\n\nKindly advise me by return mail as to when the Department can expect delivery of the above mentioned tanks.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

In view of the fact that the rest of the building is well finished I would recommend that the whole of the exterior of the brick work be painted next spring, the cost of which will not exceed $450.00. I am glad to say that all of the other schools in Caughnawaga have been completely renovated this year, and their present appearance is certainly a credit to the Department.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nOttawa, Sept. 11, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has just placed an order for the two fuel oil tanks to be installed at the Senior School at Caughnawaga. It is desired that you advise the Department immediately upon the tanks being delivered at the school in order that arrangements may be made for their installation by an officer of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLe Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nOTTAWA.\nSept. 18, 1929.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI beg to inform you that you may furnish this Department with one Sphinx automatic oil burner having a capacity sufficient to heat a No. 65 hot water boiler already installed at the Senior School at Gagniassaga, Que. This oil burner should be fully automatic and installed in working order before the 10th of October next, when it is expected that the oil tanks will be in place ready for connection to the burner. The price which this Department agrees to pay for this apparatus fully installed is $650.00, which I understand is the selling price for the medium size machine manufactured by your company.\n\nAll additional details concerning the type of installation required to ensure proper heating of the boiler at this school will be given you by the Departmental Engineer if you will call at his office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.

Binette, contractor of St. Jerome, Que., for work performed by him last April for the repairing of the roof of the Senior School at Connaughton, on behalf of the contractors for the building, Messrs. MacKenzie and Genest of Ottawa. As these repairs have not in any way been authorized officially by this Department or its Departmental Engineer, payment cannot be given any consideration. Furthermore you should be aware since the above mentioned work was carried out at the request of the contractors Mr. Binette's request for payment should have been sent directly to them, as all accounts in connection with this contract have long been settled.\n\nI may add, however, that this account has already been sent to the contractors Messrs. MacKenzie and Genest by Mr. Binette's creditors, and I am advised that the contractors refused to give it any attention as they had themselves presented a counter claim against the contractor for an amount of approximately the same as the account above mentioned, and this settlement had been accepted by the firm who took over Mr. Binette's business.\n\nI am returning Mr. Binette's accounts in order that you may advise him of the decision of the Department in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would ask you however to communicate directly with this firm in order that delivery may be expedited, and the installation of the tanks proceeded with as early as possible.

This he has not done.\n\nThe small Tank is still in the factory, and we are holding same until we ship the large one, which will be on Tuesday or Wednesday next, at the latest.\n\nFor some reason or other, our factory mislaid the shop order for this Tank, and it was not started in time to complete delivery as promised. However, it is now in the process of construction and is about forty-five percent complete.\n\nWe, therefore, see no reason why we cannot deliver during the middle of next week, as arranged.\n\nWe also understand that we are to deliver these Tanks to Caughnawaga direct instead of Adirondack Junction, and for this an extra will be charged, i.e., cartage to Caughnawaga; this was arranged with your Engineer at Ottawa, and the writer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nST.

Installing of a small hydrant outside the building where water could be obtained by the Indians at any time without interfering with the school operation. The above mentioned installation would necessitate the erection of a small building over the well and pumping plant at a total cost of about $600.00.\n\nInstalling also of a small hydrant outside the Girls' School (Katari School) where an artesian well with a complete pumping plant is already in operation. It would be necessary in this case to install a larger pressure tank at a total cost of $200.00.\n\nBoring of another artesian well at the eastern end of the village and the installation of a complete pumping system similar to that installed in the above mentioned schools at an approximate cost of $1200.00.\n\nWater could this way be obtained from any of the above sources of supply by the Indians individually as well as by those who are now making a distribution and selling it throughout the reserve.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, June 27, 1929.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Paget,\n\nWill you please advise if funds can be provided to carry out immediately the work described in my memorandum of the 22nd instant, hereunder, in order to remedy as much as possible the present unhealthy condition now prevailing in the Indian village at Caughnewaga as referred to in Dr. Stone's memorandum of May 10th hereunder.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\n\nMr. Chene,\n\nAs a saving will be effected in the item for maintenance of improved highways, this money can be used to install the plant suggested over the well at the Boys' School at a cost of $500.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Chief Accountant.\n\nJuly 12th 1929.\nMEMORANDUM: Dr. Scott.\n\nI beg to refer you to the statement made by the Acting Chief Accountant hereunder advising that funds are available to carry out some alterations to the water supply system at the boys' or girls' school at Caughnawaga, as recommended in my memorandum of June 22nd. In order that this work may be expedited I would recommend that I be allowed to purchase the necessary materials without obtaining competitive prices also that I arrange personally on the ground with a reliable plumber for the installation of the machinery in order to save time and money. If this meets with your approval, I will attend to the matter next week.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nWATER ANALYSIS.\n\nNo. ------------------------ Date of collection ------\nPlace --------------- Date of Analysis ------\nSource ----------------- Submitted by J.G.

As I understand that this system is now in satisfactory working condition, I have to request that you inform the Indians to that effect in order that they may secure their water for domestic purposes during certain hours of the day, as you may arrange with Mr. Robert, caretaker of the school. It should be understood that the greatest care is to be taken not to waste any water on account of the high cost of operating the pumping plant. If these arrangements are taken advantage of by the Indians of the village, the Department will install a similar plant at the Eastern School.\n\nI may say for your information that the water from both of the artesian wells above referred to has been analysed and found to be exempt from pollution and perfectly safe for drinking purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

B. McLean\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWith reference to our contract to supply two Tanks to Caughnawaga School, which have been delivered by us direct to the school, by truck.\n\nOur quotation dated September 24th, 1929 quotes on these two Tanks, f.o.b., Adirondack Junction.\n\nAfter talking the matter over with your Mr. Chenie, in your office, we discussed approximately the additional cost of delivering these Tanks direct to the job, instead of to Adirondack Junction, of approximately two miles from the School.\n\nDuring this conversation, while discussing the large Tank, it was mentioned that the additional cost of delivering via truck direct to School, would probably be in the neighborhood of $7.00, and nothing was mentioned about the small Tank.\n\nAs the allowance made for freight plus the $7.00 allowance that you have granted us as per your telegram dated October 14th, 1929, does not meet the cartage charges to Caughnawaga on two trucks, which was absolutely necessary, we would ask you to pass our invoice for an additional amount of $3.50 cartage on the small Tank.\n\nThe large Tank of three thousand gallons capacity required a large truck, which we had to hire at the rate of $3.50 per hour, and the small tank had to be loaded on another truck of a smaller size, which cost us $1.50 per hour.\n\nSomehow or other, there was considerable delay on the job, owing to your contractor there having to phone Ottawa before he would allow us to unload the Tanks.\n\nThis telephone conversation was extremely expensive to us, as it cost us $6.20 per hour lost time, as we had two men with the trucks, in addition to the drivers, to assist unloading.\n\n(cont'd)\nMontreal, Oct. 28th, 1929.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nIn view of the above, we trust that you will pass the cartage account that will be shown on the invoice, for the small tank, to the amount of $3.50.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nST.

The system could be later gradually extended through the whole town whenever found necessary.\n\nI would not recommend, however, the undertaking of such a project which would eventually require larger expenditure for its construction as well as for its operation until the Indians had demonstrated their willingness to cooperate with the Department and follow the advice already given them to discontinue the use of water from the St. Lawrence River and other polluted sources should they be allowed to draw their supply of water from any one of the above mentioned artesian wells without any charge whatsoever to them.\n\nI would suggest, furthermore, that the Provincial Board of Health from Montreal be requested to make in future, frequent bacteriological analysis of the water from the artesian wells until the health conditions have become normal on the reserve.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nJanuary 31-1930.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nGentlemen:-\n\nATTENTION MR.

C. Indian Day Schools. I have to request that you will obtain accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost. These should be forwarded to the Department in the usual manner for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nFor Secretary.\n\nRev. Sr. M. Francis,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nSept. 4, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to my letter of October 22, 1928 ordering from your company a pneumatic water supply system for the girls' school at Caughnawga, which plant was installed by the Clovis Electric Co. of Montreal.\n\nI regret to advise that the caretaker who has had charge of this plant reports that this outfit has never given satisfaction, although it has been examined and repaired at various times by competent plumbers. It appears from an investigation lately made that the piston rod which was supplied by your company is not of the kind suitable for this installation, also there are some defects in the pump which prevents it from operating to its full capacity. By referring to the letter above mentioned, you will note that payment was made for this machinery on the assumption that it would give satisfactory and continuous service. Before expending further amounts for the repairing of this pumping plant, I would very much appreciate it if you would have one of your mechanics make a thorough inspection of it, and advise the Department as early as possible as to the reasons for the existing conditions.\n\nIn view of the fact that water is absolutely necessary for the operation of this school I trust that you will give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This has been replaced lately by a galvanized iron pipe, which we think should be all right.\n\nYou of course know that it is only usual to guarantee apparatus for one year from date of shipment, and on this account, any work that you wish us to do on this outfit, we would require to be paid for... If you wish us to have a mechanic dismantle the outfit and examine the Deep Well cylinder, we would be glad to receive your order to do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDARLING B. OTHERS LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident.\n\nIndian Affairs.

When he pulled up the Deep Well Cylinder it was hanging to the Discharge Pipe by only two threads and might have dropped to the bottom of the well at any moment, also practically all the Joints in the Discharge Pipe were leaking badly. The intake to the Cylinder was quite clear and not clogged, neither were the Cup Leathers in very bad condition, in fact, the same Leathers were used when we started the system again.\n\nThe net result of our efforts was that the Pump is now discharging at a rate of approximately 75% more capacity than before the repair was made.\n\nWe trust that these results will be satisfactory, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDARLING BROTHERS LIMITED.\n\nR.A.

Please give the matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nOXENE & OXENATORS\n\nThe purpose of this schedule is to outline the various types of Oxenators, and to describe the Oxene tablets.\n\nOXENE\n\nOxene is a patented compound put up in tablet form. This compound contains 27% chlorine. Tablets are manufactured in 1/4\", 5/8\", and 1 3/8\" diameters.\n\nSTERILIZING.\n\nThe water is sterilized by contact. A tablet immersed in a stream of water gives off 98% of its chlorine in approximately 16 hours. The chlorine is liberated very rapidly at first, and comparatively slowly as the chlorine becomes exhausted. The contact method of sterilization is particularly well adapted to sterilize small water supplies where the demand is of an intermittent character.\n\nOn larger systems having a comparatively uniform demand it is more economical to grind the tablets, thus using all available chlorine which is supplied by the grinder at a uniform rate corresponding to the pre-determined water demand.\n\nOXENATORS.\n\nOxenators are devised for use in applying Oxene tablets.\n\nPOCKET OXENATOR.\n\nThe Pocket Oxenator is similar in appearance to a fountain pen. This device consists of a magazine for holding spare 1/4\" Oxene tablets, and a perforated receptacle at one end for holding a single tablet. The device is designed for travellers and can be used in sterilizing doubtful water. A fresh tablet is placed in the perforated receptacle and stirred around in a glass of water for 30 seconds. This effectively sterilizes the water.\n\nTAP OXENATORS.\n\nThe Tap Oxenator consists of a hard-rubber receptacle arranged to screw on a water tap, or the device can be provided with a soft-rubber adapter to slip over any ordinary tap. The device contains a receptacle for a 5/8\" Oxene tablet, and the water is sterilized by passing over the tablet as it is drawn from the tap. With ordinary domestic demands a tablet will last from one to two days, and should then be renewed.\n\nJUG OXENATOR.\n\nThis Oxenator consists of an enamel-ware jug having a receptacle in the spout for a 5/8\" Oxene tablet. The device is particularly adapted for campers. The water is effectively sterilized as it passes over the Oxene tablet in the spout of the jug.\n\nCONTACT OXENATORS.\n\nThe Contact Oxenator for 1 3/8\" tablets consists of galvanized steel containers with a removable hole cover., a basket containing the tablets; and an arrangement of valves to regulate the flow of water through the Oxenator. With this type of Oxenator sterilization is accomplished by forming a strong hypo-chlorine solution in the Oxenator.\nOn pumping systems of uniform demand, water is taken from the pressure side of the pump through a needle valve to the bottom of the Oxenator. The water passes from the Oxenator flowing out at the top through the flexible connection and a rubber shut-off valve back to the suction of the pump. The needle valve is adjusted to supply the required amount of solution to the pump intake.\n\nOn pressure systems an orifice gate may be installed in the pressure line by passing a small portion of the water through the Oxenator. This arrangement can be piped to effectively sterilize fluctuating demands within reasonable limits.\n\nAnother type of Oxenator is similar to those described above, except that the basket is omitted, and a screen is provided near the bottom of the Oxenator. These Oxenators can be filled with from 50 to 100 pounds of Oxene tablets. This Oxenator is used in sterilizing water mains. Water is passed through the Oxenator into the lower end of the main. After a pre-determined interval, the supply valve to the main is opened to allow a small flow of water. The flow is set to fill the main in a pre-determined time. The water as it passes through the main valve carries a crest of very strong hypo-chlorine solution through the main. After the crest is started the flow through the Oxenator is adjusted to supply chlorine at the rate of from 2 to 5 P.F.M.\n\nThis follows up the strong crest with an over-sterilized flow of water. The City of Montreal, and the Montreal Water Board have been using this type of Oxenator in sterilizing new mains, and all old mains which have undergone repairs.\n\nAnother type of Oxenator consists of a double galvanized metal screen approximately 3' x 8' 1 3/8\". Tablets are clamped between the screen. The screen is suspended from the stern of a boat. This outfit is used in sterilizing reservoirs. Last fall the Gueremont reservoir on the Montreal system was badly contaminated by algae. The trouble was corrected in a few hours, without interrupting the water service.\n\nOXENATORS - GRINDERS.\n\nThese Oxenators consist of a small mechanical driven grinder wheel, a magazine containing 1 3/8\" Oxene tablets, and a supply of water to wash the grindings from the wheel. The wash water contains a strong hypo-chlorine solution. The strength of this solution depends on:\n\n1. The grit of the wheel.\n2. The speed of the wheel.\n3. The weight of tablets in the magazine.\n4. The quantity of wash water supplied.\n\nSolution from these Oxenators may be connected directly to the suction of a pump, provided a uniform amount of water is being pumped steadily for 24 hours. In the event of fluctuating demands, the solution is stored in a reservoir and provided with suitable regulating devices which may be of an automatic, or semi-automatic character.\n\nThese Grinders may be driven by:\n\n(A). A water wheel providing water pressure is available at 30 pounds or more.\n(B). An electric motor.\n(C). By a belt or gearing when mechanical power is available.\n\nAPPLICATIONS.\n\nThe Contact Oxenator is best adapted when supplying intermittent demands to the systems of comparatively small capacity. The Grinding Oxenators are best suited for supplying systems of uniform flow over a 24 hour period.\nHALIBURTON & WHITE LIMITED\n\nMANUFACTURING ENGINEERS\n\n686 NOTRE DAME WEST\n\nMONTREAL. Dec. 26th, 1930.\n\nRef. 31005.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Harrington has referred to us your inquiry of the 22nd inst., regarding the cost of installing a sterilizing equipment in a school within a radius of 15 miles of Montreal.\n\nWe use a compound known as Oxene for sterilizing water. The various devices used in applying the compound are known as Oxeonators. The contract licensing us to manufacture this compound has only recently been signed and no literature is available. We are, however, enclosing a typewritten schedule describing the various appliances which are, or shortly will be, on the market.\n\nThe type of Oxeonator required for the school is governed largely by the character of the water system, and the amount of water required per day. We recommend that you consider installing Tap Oxeonators, which will sterilize water by passing it over an Oxene tablet as it is drawn from the tap, or drinking fountain. These Tap Oxeonators would cost from $3.00 to $20.00 installed at the school, depending on the quantity. The small Oxene tablets cost $1.00 per \"C\" With ordinary demand one tablet per day will be required for each tap. As an alternative we would suggest a 12 1/2 gallon By-Pass Contact Oxeonator. This device will cost from $50.00 to $150.00 installed. The Contact Oxeonator makes use of the 1 3/8\" Oxene tablets, which can be supplied in 100 pound lots for $20.00, or in 50 pound lots for $12.50. With this type of Oxeonator, water can be sterilized at a cost not exceeding $.01 per thousand gallons. I would also suggest that you provide the school with an Ortho-Tolldin test kit. With this outfit any of the teachers can check the water for chlorine residue. We can supply you with the test kit for $15.00.\n\nIf you can give us full particulars regarding your requirements we would be pleased to submit a tender covering the installation of the complete system at your school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6079, file 305-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJan. 14, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge with thanks receipt of your communication of the 26th ultimo giving a description of the different types of apparatus manufactured by your company for the sterilizing of water. As requested I beg to say that the school referred to in my letter of the 22nd of December is located at Onegawaga, across from Lachine; the name of the school is Senior or Central school, and its location can be obtained from the Missionary's residence at the Church.\n\nThe Department would be interested in being furnished with a tender covering an installation that would sterilize all the water supply at the school, providing it would not entail any expense to the Department for the furnishings of the offer. This proposal should also mention the cost of the operation of the ozonators.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. F.

Indian Schools and the teachers' residence.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. October 15th dated October 15th 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nThe purpose of this schedule is to outline the various types of Oxemators, and to describe the Oxene tablets.\n\nOXENE\n\nOxene is a patented compound put up in tablet form. This compound contains 27% chlorine. Tablets are manufactured in 1/4\" - 5/8\" and 1-3/8\" diameters.\n\nSTERILIZING.\n\nThe water is sterilized by contact. A tablet immersed in a stream of water gives off 96% of its chlorine in approximately 16 hrs. The chlorine is liberated very rapidly at first, and comparatively slowly as the chlorine becomes exhausted. The contact method of sterilization is particularly well adapted to sterilize small water supplies where the demand is of an intermittent character. On larger systems having a comparatively uniform demand it is more economical to grind the tablets, thus using all available chlorine which is supplied by the grinder at a uniform rate corresponding to the pre-determined water demand.\n\nOXEMATORS.\n\nOxemators are devised for use in applying Oxene tablets.\n\nPOCKET OXEMATOR.\n\nThe pocket Oxemator is similar in appearance to a fountain pen. This device consists of a magazine for holding spare 1/4\" Oxene tablets, and a perforated receptacle at one end for holding a single tablet. The device is designed for travellers and can be used in sterilizing doubtful water. A fresh tablet is placed in the perforated receptacle and stirred around in a glass of water for 30 seconds. This effectively sterilizes the water.\n\nTAP OXEMATOR.\n\nThe tap oxemator consists of a hard rubber receptacle arranged to screw on a water tap, or the device can be provided with a soft rubber adapter to slip over an ordinary tap. The device contains a recess for a 5/8\" Oxene tablet, and the water is sterilized by passing over the tablet.\nas it is drawn from the tap. With ordinary domestic demands a tablet will last from one to two days, and should then be renewed.\n\n**JUG OXENATOR.**\n\nThis Oxenator consists of an enamel-ware jug having a receptacle in the spout for a 5/8\" oxene tablet. The device is particularly adapted for campers. The water is effectively sterilized as it passes over the oxene tablet in the spout of the jug.\n\n**CONTACT OXENATORS.**\n\nThe contact Oxenator for 1-3/8\" tablets consists of galv. steel containers with removable hand hole cover, a basket containing the tablets, and an arrangement of valves to regulate the flow of water through the Oxenator. With this type of Oxenator sterilization is accomplished by forming a strong hypo-chlorine solution in the Oxenator.\n\nOn pumping systems of uniform demand, water is taken from the pressure side of the pump through a needle valve to the bottom of the Oxenator. The water passes from the Oxenator flowing out at the top through the flexible connection and a rubber, shut-off valve back to the suction of the pump. The needle valve is adjusted to supply the required amount of solution to the pump intake.\n\nOn pressure systems an orifice gate may be installed in the pressure line by passing a small portion of the water through the Oxenator. This arrangement can be piped to effectively sterilize fluctuating demands within reasonable limits.\n\nAnother type of Oxenator is similar to those described above except that the basket is omitted, and screen is provided near the bottom of the Oxenator. These Oxenators can be filled with from 50 to 100 pounds of oxene tablets. This Oxenator is used in sterilizing water mains. Water is passed through the Oxenator into the lower end of an empty main. After a pre-determined interval, the supply valve to the main is opened to allow a small flow of water. The flow is set to fill the main in a pre-determined time. The water as it passes through the main valve carries a crest of very strong hypo-chlorine solution through the main. After the crest is started the flow through the Oxenator is adjusted to supply chlorine at the rate of from 2 to 5 P.P.M. This follows up the strong crest with an over-sterilized flow of water. The city of Montreal and the Montreal Water Board have been using this type of Oxenator in sterilizing new mains, and all old mains which have undergone repairs.\n\nAnother type of Oxenator consists of a double galvanized metal screen approximately 3' x 8'. 1-3/8\" tablets are clamped between the screen. The screen is suspended from the stern of a boat. This outfit is used in sterilizing reservoirs. Last fall, at Outremont the reservoir on the Montreal system was badly contaminated by algae. The trouble was...\ncorrected in a few hours, without interrupting the water service.\n\nOXENATORS \u2014 GRINDERS.\n\nThese oxenators consist of small mechanical driven grinder wheel, a magazine containing 1-3/8\" oxene tablets, and a supply of water to wash the grindings from the wheel. The wash water contains a strong hypo-chlorine solution. The strength of the solution depends on:\n\n1. The grit of the wheel.\n2. The speed of the wheel.\n3. The weight of tablets in magazine.\n4. The quantity of wash water supplied.\n\nSolution from these Oxenators may be connected directly to the suction of a pump, providing a uniform amount of water is being pumped steadily for 24 hours. In the event of fluctuating demands, the solution is stored in a reservoir and provided with suitable regulating devices which may be of an automatic, or semi-automatic character.\n\nThese grinders may be driven by:\n\n1. A water wheel providing water pressure is available at 30 lbs or more.\n2. An electric motor.\n3. By a belt or gearing when mechanical power is available.\n\nAPPLICATIONS.\n\nThe contact Oxenator is best adapted when supplying intermittent demands to the systems of comparatively small capacity.\n\nThe grinding Oxenators are best suited for supplying systems of uniform flow over a 24 hour period.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo...Clovis Electric Co., Limited  \n924 - St. Catherine Street East  \nMontreal, Que.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1931 Feb. 14 | For the closing of the drinking water system at the Senior School, of the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve, material supplied as per attached account, in duplicate:- | $18.70 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nForm 52.\n\nAgent\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary - Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your inquiries of Jan. 14th. and Feb. 6th. Our investigation shows the following conditions at the Senior Central Catholic School Building at Caughnawaga:\n\nThe water system consists of:\n- A 100 foot driven well.\n- A Fairbanks-Morse deep well pump.\n- A 250 Gallon Pneumatic pressure tank supplying water to a drinking fountain.\n- Wash basins and toilet.\n\nFrom information supplied, the requirements of the school are about 500 gallons per day. The janitor reports the water is very clear, but that the tests have shown that the supply is contaminated.\n\nWe recommend that you install a 12 1/2 gallon contact-type Oxenator as outlined on our print #1151. Our price for installing this system is $150.00 for the Oxenator and labour. $3.00 for 1-15 pound package of Oxene tablets, and $15.00 for an Ortho-Tolidin test kit for testing the water to check the residue chlorine. For the above mentioned prices we will supply and install the sterilizing system. The water tank and pipes will be emptied, and the tank and all piping thoroughly sterilized. The system will then be rinsed out with steril water, and adjusted to sterilize the water as it is drawn from the well.\n\nWritten instructions will be supplied for operating the system. We will demonstrate the operation of the system to the janitor and the Principal, showing them how to take the Ortho-Tolidin test for chlorine residue.\nArrangements will be made with the Chemical Laboratory of the City of Montreal to test samples of water for bacteria for 30 days after the system is installed. Reports of the bacteria test will be forwarded to the Principal of the school, and to your Department at Ottawa.\n\nThe cost of operating this small system is very small .... based on 500 gallons per day for 240 days per year you would only require 7 1/2 pounds of Oxene tablets. These tablets cost $.20 per pound in small quantities.\n\nOperating Cost.\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| 7 1/2 Lbs.

The only alternative would be the installation of a chlorinator which would cost about $600.00.\n\nShould it be the wish of your branch that I deal with this question further I should like to be so advised.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nSt. Constant, Que.\nFebruary 25th, 1931\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant relative to the total amount of water which is being used at the Central School at Caughnawaga and in reply to say that the approximate amount of gallons for drinking purposes is 15 daily, while the approximate number of gallons used daily for the furnaces, toilets, etc., is of 250 gallons.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nMarch 4, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThis Department has under consideration the installation of a sterilizing plant for the treatment of water from the pneumatic water supply system at the Senior Central School at Caughnawaga, which has been reported to be highly polluted.\n\nAn offer has just been made by the firm of Haliburton and White Ltd., manufacturing engineers of Montreal, dated Feb. 18, which appears to be quite satisfactory in every respect. As I understand that there will be funds available during the course of next month for the installation of this apparatus could you advise me as to whether the Department would be justified in placing the order direct with this firm, without inviting any other prices. I might say for your information that this apparatus is solely manufactured by this firm.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nMarch 4, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo advising me of the price which will be charged by your company for the installation of an Osmatizer for the sterilizing of water from the pneumatic water supply system at the Senior Central School at Caughnawaga.\n\nIn reply I wish to say that your offer is now being taken into consideration and I shall further communicate with you during the course of next month when the Department has made a final decision with reference to this sterilizing plant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It pleases me to add that we are truly grateful for being able to look back upon a term that has been rather pleasant and successful with the greater number of our pupils. Their attendance during the last quarter was far better than previously reported. Our only real annoyance was with a few of the larger boys who longed to be out at the Club to earn money for new apparel. It required a certain amount of firmness, both on my part and that of the teachers, to keep them in the classroom till the end.\n\nOur Physical Culture Demonstration was all that we could desire and received high commendations on all sides. I am quite satisfied with Captain A. Champagne's work and trust you will do us the favor to re-engage his services next September. This training means so much for the improvement of discipline and is a powerful factor in facilitating the teacher's work in the classroom. With boys such as we have, Physical Culture under an Experienced Professor is really an indispensable part of the school curriculum.\n\nNow kindly allow me to call your attention to a very serious point. Mr. Chene had given us his word that the\npoorly-lighted classroom occupied by Miss Stacey would be put into fit condition during the last Christmas holidays. The matter was not attended to and, as a result, Miss Stacey complains, with perfect justice of cause, that the continuous use of the electric light during these past ten months has greatly impaired her eyesight. She made a special call since the closing of school to notify me of the fact. Moreover, the platform in the rear of her classroom, not only compels her to crowd the children around about her desk, but also occupies so much space that we cannot take in as many pupils as would be possible were this obstruction removed.\n\nLast spring, owing to lack of accommodation we were compelled to refuse twelve little ones, much to the disappointment of parents who are not prone to accept our reasons readily and calmly.\n\nWould you please look into this affair during the summer months so as to prevent further difficulties from arising.\n\nThanking you most sincerely for all the Department has done for our welfare and that of our pupils during this last year, I remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T.

Canadian, of this reserve, asking for the rental of an Underwood Typewriter for two weeks. This machine is one of those in use at the school during the years 1930-1931.\n\nI thought it was advisable to suggest to the Rev. Sister Superior not to grant this request of Angus H. Canadian until it is approved by the department.\n\nI believe it is my duty not to recommend this request for your approval for the reason that this precedent may create abuses and in such cases the Typewriting machines in use at the schools would soon be put out of order.\n\nHowever, I leave it to the Department to decide of this case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLorenzo Letourneau,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Dept.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a communication from Angus H. Canadian, addressed to the Rev. Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga R. C.

It is conceded that the water in front of the Caughnawaga Village is not proper for domestic use; however for washing and other domestic use, this water can be kept clean and it is for that reason I wish to recommend to the Department that the pipe in question be lengthened about 30 feet or about as soon as possible before the level of the river which is now very low gets higher this Fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSept. 4th, 1931.\n\nMemorandum Mr. Williams,\n\nWith reference to Indian Agent Letourneau's communication of the 25th ultimo requesting that a sewer pipe from the Senior School at Caughnawaga be extended from its present outlet a distance of 30 feet into the St. Lawrence river, I beg to recommend that this work be carried out, under the supervision of the Indian Agent, with the understanding that the pipe will be the same diameter and material (steel) as the present one.

J'ignore encore si ces r\u00e9parations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien faites, j'y verrai lors de ma prochaine visite \u00e0 Caughnawaga. Cependant, j'ai averti M.

The electric pump at the Eastern School ran continually for several days without stopping, that is to such an extent that it got hot and damaged the machinery to such an extent that it became out of use.\n\nIt was then that without advising me Mr. Robert requested the services of the Clovis Electric Co., who afterwards had certain work done by the company who sold the pump to the Department. I do not know yet if these repairs have been well done but I shall make sure at my next visit at Caughnawaga. However, I have warned Mr. Robert that in future such repairs whether urgent or not shall not be done without authorization and the name of the person or company to be authorized to do such work shall be given by the Department.\n\nIf the work in question is found satisfactory I wish you would kindly inform me if I could be authorized to submit the account to be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

If so it should be understood that payment will not be made until the apparatus has been thoroughly tested as to its operation and the quality of the water.\n\nBefore starting any of this work you should communicate with Indian Agent Letourneau who resides at St. Constant, and who is familiar with the present system, condition of the artesian well, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

F. MacKenzie, Secretary - Department of India Affairs, together with a copy of our reply. The writer visited the school in February and inspected the water system. From information obtained we do not believe that we would experience any trouble in sterilizing your water supply unless conditions obtained of which we were not advised.\n\nWe were told that the water pumped from the well was clear and palatable, but that fermentation tests showed that the water was contaminated. We do not believe from this information that the water is so badly contaminated that it would require more than a normal dose of chlorine to destroy the bacteria.\n\nCan you give us the capacity of the pump in gallons per minute, or provide us with the name of the contractor who installed the plumbing system so that we can obtain this information from them. We require this data in order to provide the proper size of venturi nozzle for use with the Oxenator.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHALIBURTON & WHITE LIMITED.\nHALIBURTON & WHITE LIMITED\nMANUFACTURING ENGINEERS\n686 NOTRE DAME WEST\nMONTREAL.\n\nSept. 22nd, 1931.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nReference #5-1-5.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 21st inst. We are willing to put in the Oxenator and Equipment as covered by our quotation of Feb. 18th at 60 days' trial with the understanding that we will accept the return of the material F.O.B. our factory if it does not sterilize the water if operated in accordance with our instructions.\n\nWe wish, however, to bring to your attention the fact that chlorinating the water does not necessarily improve its quality. The addition of chlorine destroys the bacteria, and it is possible but not probable that chlorine might have to be added to badly contaminated water in such quantities that it would be unpalatable. If you will cover us with an order we will proceed immediately with this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHALIBURTON & WHITE LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

L.

The Reverend Sister Superior has recommended an Indian by the name of John to do this work. He has estimated that he could do it in about a week's time, and he would charge fifty cents (50\u00a2) an hour. It is understood that the lumber in the platform would be used as flooring. You may authorize having this work done under the supervision of Sister Mary Francis.\n\nThe Sister Superior also requested the raising of the partition in this room to the ceiling. You may also authorize this work and the cost should be kept as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nL.

If not I would ask you to attend to it with the least possible delay, as outlined in your proposal of the 16th of February last.\n\nI would ask you also to be kind enough to advise me when the apparatus is fully completed and tested in order that it may be inspected by an officer of this department before payment is made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Ceci nous permet de constater que l'eau et les d\u00e9chets, qui s'\u00e9chappent parfois en quantit\u00e9 consid\u00e9rable de diverses sources \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole Senior ne parvient pas du tout \u00e0 cette extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 sur le bord du fleuve. Le gardien Robert est descendu dans les buissons et il a constat\u00e9 que seul un l\u00e9ger filet d'eau claire y passe.\n\nNous croyons que les d\u00e9chets s'accumulent \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 le tuyau de renvoi fait un angle d'environ 45\u00b0 sur le bord de la rivi\u00e8re. Cet angle est maintenant sous un gros amas de terre, pierres et d\u00e9chets de toutes sortes qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9s par les Indiens du village durant ces deux derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Peut-\u00eatre que le poids de cette masse de d\u00e9chets a fait disjoindre le tuyau \u00e0 son angle et qu'ainsi les d\u00e9chets ne peuvent parvenir jusqu'\u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9.\n\nAfin de pr\u00e9venir des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts qui pourraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9rables dans le cours de l'hiver et du printemps prochains, permettez-moi de sugg\u00e9rer que l'Ing\u00e9nieur du D\u00e9partement vienne \u00e0 Caughnawaga pour faire l'examen de ce tuyau et rem\u00e9dier, s'il y a lieu, aux dommages qu'il aurait subi.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Indiens,\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des Indiens,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI take the liberty to refer to my letter of the 25 August last concerning the present state of the sewer-pipe of the Senior School, Caughnawaga, and to inform you that the extremity of the iron pipe which was previously laid under the water surface in the river is now on account of the low level of the river is now completely dry. This permitted us to notice that the water and the waste which is sometimes flown in considerable quantity from diverse sources at the Senior School do not reach the extremity of the pipe on the river's edge. The guardian, Robert, went down into the septic tank and found that only a light water jet was passing through.\n\nWe believe that the rubbish is accumulating at a point where the sewer-pipe makes an angle of about 45 degrees on the edge of the river. That angle is now under a pile of land, stones and rubbish of all kinds which were thrown there by the Indians of the village during the last two years. It may be that the weight of that rubbish has made the pipe disjointed at that angle and that the waste can not reach the extremity of the pipe.\n\nSo as to prevent any damages which might be considerable during the course of the Winter and of next Spring, permit me to suggest that the Engineer of the Department come to Caughnawaga to examine this pipe and find a way to repair it and prevent any further damage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

We sent a man the next week to sterilize the System, and start the Plant, giving the janitor verbal instructions regarding its operation. The next week we again sent a man over to the Reservation, as Mr. Letourneau asked us to check and make sure that the janitor understood the operation of the Plant. At this time our man brought back a sample of water, and left six bottles with the janitor, who has subsequently submitted two samples. Our bacteriologist reports fermentation in one test out of five in the first sample; and the other two samples - no fermentation developed out of five tests on each sample. Under the microscope, what is known as pin point colonies, were plentiful. These colonies have no sanitary significance, as they signify the presence of a harmless bacteria, which often develops rapidly in sterilized water, due to the absence of natural enemies. The development of this bacteria is also encouraged in samples which are not analyzed immediately.\n\nWe are holding our billing until we can supply the School with written instructions in both French and English. These are now in the hands of the Printer. As soon as the instructions\nare ready we will again send a representative to the Reservation to deliver these instructions, and to take a sample of both the raw and sterilized water. A third sample of sterilized water will be delivered to the Provincial Board of Health with a request that they send you an independent report on the condition of the water.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHALIBURTON & WHITE LIMITED.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: La Procure des Missions (Sisters of St. Ann)\nLachine,\nQue.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1931 Dec. 30 | For the laundry made for the R.C. teachers of the Caughnawaga Indian reserve for the months of October, November and December 1931, @ $20. per month | $60.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\n\nForm 52.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the account of Albany Robert, it is noted that he also charged for two trips at $3.00 for the transportation of the stove. A full explanation is required regarding the double charge. The Rev. Sister requests $2 for each trip, and if she paid for this service a receipt should be forwarded.

Jolicoeur for $5.17, which does not appear in the Rev. Sister's statement.\n\nYou will also note that a reduction should be made in the amount charged for telephone, as a number of the messages were of a personal nature.\n\nI might add that the Department allows a grant for the services of a messenger boy, and it is thought that a number of messages charged for could very well have been performed by this boy in the course of his duties.\n\nPlease obtain full information from the Rev. Sister regarding the above charges and amend the account before returning same to the Department.

I would point out that Mr. Albany Robert is a full time employee and there also a janitor for each school. It is, therefore, thought that considerable work, such as cleaning and installing windows, scrubbing and cleaning classrooms, moving desks etc., could be done by them as part of their regular duties.

If he rented the mower for the purpose and obtained someone to cut the weeds, he should furnish a receipt.\n\nSeptember 19 - Washing and installing double windows at the United Church School ... $1.50.\n\nIt is considered, as there is a janitor at this school, it should be part of his duties to wash and install double windows.\n\nSeptember 30 and October 2 - Two trips to transport a stove to teacher's residence at Bush School ... $3.00.\n\nPlease state why it was necessary to make two trips for this purpose.\n\nOctober 31 - For washing and oiling floor of United Church School Annex ... $5.\n\nAn explanation is required regarding this item.

M. Francis, Superior of the R.C. Indian Day Schools for hex disbursements in connection with the administration of the R.C.

I therefore cancel the charges I made, and I will settle with him for cartage. The distance to St. Isidore Jct. is about twice that to St. Isidore Rd. School. Thence to Bush School, about 10 miles.\n\n(b) Oct. 17. Two trips to Station were unavoidable.\n\n(c) Oct. 23rd and Dec. 21st. Evidently, some Officials of the Department have not had the opportunity to visit the Bush School. After leaving the main road, the rest of the way to the school is so difficult to cover, that people prefer walking two miles on the R.R. track in order to avoid marshes, ditches, besides the awful jolting right along. Since cars could not pull thro without meeting accidents after mid September, it was impossible to drive there in our carriage. Even our express wagon broke down when Albany Robert went there to make repairs.\n\nFour years ago, Sr. M. Rose Alma refused to accept the supervision of that school for the same reason as stated above, unless the Department\npaid her $10.00 for each visitation.\n\nTo speak truthfully, I would willingly relinquish the direction of Bush School because it means such a strain each time.\n\n(d) Voucher A. Jolicoeur, for $5.17 was paid, but omitted by error in the statement.\n\nTrusting these explanations will prove satisfactory to the Department, I am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. L. Letourneau,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nCaughnawaga, January 19th., 1832.\n\nSecretary of Indian Department,\nBooth Building, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast year, we were favored by the Department with a grant of $100 for the upkeep of our skating-rink. This grant represented the entrance-fee of the school-children who were thus able to have the skating-rink for a few hours every day. Would it be possible for the Department to renew this bounty again this year? The favor would be greatly appreciated as at present our Indians here are very low\u2014more than ever before, it seems\u2014in their amusement-money. Several local attractions, customary to the season, have had to be suppressed already for lack of sufficient monetary support. The expenses of the skating-rink (caretaker's salary, electricity for power and light, help for clearing of snow, etc.) run too high and the receipts of an occasional hockey-game too low for the proposition to be self-supporting. A grant such as that of last year would solve the problem.\n\nI take occasion of this letter to extend to the Department sincere thanks and congratulations for the splendid work done by Miss Moody among our women-folk. These persons are a difficult and sometimes rather annoying class to deal with on account of their inbred shyness wherever strangers are concerned. Miss Moody by her tact and pleasant disposition has won them over. She has been very busy here straightening out the countless wants of the ladies here. I am sure her good advice will help them a great deal.\n\nI beg to remain, Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMissionary\nOttawa, January 26, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, requesting a grant of $100 towards the upkeep of the community rink in the village of Caughnawaga.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that our grant last year was not towards the upkeep of the rink, but was to pay for 125 sheets of corrugated iron, used for the sides of the rink. It was promised, in view of the above payment by this Department, that the school children would be given free skating up to 6 P.M. daily, with the exception of school hours. The Department understood that this concession to school children was of a more or less permanent nature because of our assistance when the rink was first prepared. At no time was a grant for current expenses discussed. As our appropriation at the present time is extremely limited, I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Elle est trop froide pour cause que le vent souffle apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union des \u00e9coles protestantes qui se tient \u00e0 Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup. Nous devons faire quelque chose pour le bien-\u00eatre de nos enfants.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant concerning the account of Albany Robert, amounting to $125.45 and in reply to inform you that there is no grass cutter at that school to cut the hay and bad weeds on the playing ground of senior school and Robert thought of renting that horse drawn mower which I believe was more economical than to pay a man by the day to do the work with a hand scythe. Robert is going to produce a receipt for that sum of $3.00.\n\nSeptember 19 - We admit that it is the duty of the two guardians at the United Church School to do the washing and install the double windows at the school. But they neglect and refused to do so and that is why I am forced to have recourse to the services of Robert. The present guardians or others of Caughnawaga who would be called to replace them generally have a great repulsion of water and of the broom and they neglected or refused to do any small repairs.\n\nSept. 30 & Oct. 2: - In referring to your letter of the 19th September last (File No. 5-3-8) you authorized me to make the purchase of a stove for the Bush School. The shipper assured me then that that stove would be at the station at St. Isidore Junction at a set date; I had then requested Robert to go and get it, a distance of eight miles return. The Agent at the station replied to Robert that the stove had not arrived. From Caughnawaga Robert afterwards telephoned to inform me of this incident and after several inquiries I was finally informed that the stove was at its destination on the day mentioned but the conductor of the train had forgotten or neglected to hand the way bill to the Agent of the station. That is the reason why Robert had to make a second trip to St. Isidore Junction, that is to say two trips 16 miles and transportation to Bush School six more miles total 22 miles apart from the installation of the stove and I think that his charges of $3.00 is just and reasonable.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOct. 31 - As I explained above, the floors of the United Church Schools become so dirty on account of the negligence of the Indians that Miss Simons has requested Robert to attend to it. I believe again that $5.00 to clean and oil this floor is an acceptable charge. I often asked the teachers of the United Church Schools to inform me if they wanted the guardians to be replaced. I believe that if they do not ask for any change it is most likely that they believe, as I do, that to replace these Indians by two others would not improve the situation at all.\n\nNov. 7 - Kateri School. I did not ask Robert to do the cleaning of the class rooms after the changes were completed at the Kateri School, however, I knew that this cleaning was not of an ordinary nature after this work was completed; removal of rubbish etc.; he told me that he thought that that extra work deserved a compensation.\n\nIf you will kindly refer to your letter of the 15th September last you will find that Robert obliged to carry from four to six pails of drinking water every school day, from the opening of the school until the 15th of November.\n\nNovember 30 - If you will kindly refer to your letter No. 5-1-1 dated December 11 last, arrangements were made to permit the children of the United Church Schools to have their Christmas Concert in the hall of the Senior School. After that concert the floors and stairs were left absolutely dirty. It seems evident that this cleaning does not come under the regular work of the guardian of the Senior School.\n\nI can assure you that I have no favour to do to Albany Robert but I have often noticed that he is a good servant, very conscientious, laborious and careful. When I find that repairs, cleaning, etc., become absolutely necessary at both of the United Church Schools I have no other way than to obtain the services of Robert to do the work. As the toilet became unapproachable, that the floors of the schools are dirty, that the glasses in the doors and windows are broken and the guardians in charge neglect to fulfill their duties, should I then advise you each time for every case? This would be very annoying to you, or is it not as I believe preferable to have recourse immediately to the services of an employee who, I am sure only asks in return a just and reasonable supplementary salary.\n\nI have, however, recently warned Robert, not to do any work at the United Church Schools nor to lend any tools to the guardians of the schools unless he is sure that they will be brought back and that until you find it proper to advise me to the contrary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) Lorenzo Letourneau,\nIndian Agent.\nMonsieur,\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'accuser r\u00e9ception de votre lettre du 13 courant concernant le compte de Albany Robert au montant de $123.45 et en r\u00e9ponse de vous informer qu'il n'y a pas de faucheuse \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole pour couper le foin et mauvaises herbes sur le terrain de jeux \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole Senior et Robert a cru devoir louer cette faucheuse \u00e0 chevaux ce qui, je crois, \u00e9tait plus \u00e9conomique que de payer un homme \u00e0 la journ\u00e9e pour le faire avec une faucille \u00e0 mains. Robert doit produire un re\u00e7u pour cette somme de $3.00.\n\nSept. 19 - Nous admettons qu'il est du devoir des deux gardiens aux \u00e9coles United Church de faire le lavage et installer les ch\u00e2ssis doubles \u00e0 ces \u00e9coles, mais ils n\u00e9gligent et finalement refusent de le faire et c'est ainsi que je me vois dans l'obligation de recourir aux services de Robert. Les gardiens actuels ou d'autres de Caughnawaga qui seraient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 les remplacer ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement horreur de l'eau et du balai et ils n\u00e9gligent ou refusent de faire quelques l\u00e9g\u00e8res r\u00e9parations.\n\nSept. 30 & Oct. 2. - En r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 votre lettre du 19 septembre dernier (F. 5-3-8) vous m'autorisez \u00e0 faire l'achat d'un po\u00eale pour l'\u00e9cole Bush. L'exp\u00e9diteur m'a alors assur\u00e9 que ce po\u00eale serait rendu \u00e0 la gare St.Isidore-junction \u00e0 un jour indiqu\u00e9; j'avais alors requis Robert d'aller le chercher, une distance de 5 miles aller et retour. L'agent de la gare a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 Robert que ce po\u00eale n'\u00e9tait pas arriv\u00e9. De Caughnawaga Robert m'a ensuite t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour m'informer de la chose et apr\u00e8s beaucoup de d\u00e9marches j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement inform\u00e9 que ce po\u00eale \u00e9tait \u00e0 destination au jour indiqu\u00e9 mais que le conducteur du train avait oubli\u00e9 ou n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de remettre le connaissment \u00e0 l'agent de gare. C'est pour cette raison que Robert a fait un deuxi\u00e8me voyage \u00e0 St.Isidore-junction, ainsi, deux voyages, 16 miles et transport \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole Bush 6 autres miles, total 22 miles \u00e0 part l'installation de ce po\u00eale, je crois que $3.00 est juste et raisonnable.\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes,\nOTTAWA.\nOct. 31 -\n\nComme je vous l'ai expliqu\u00e9 plus haut, les planchers des \u00e9coles United Church deviennent tellement sales \u00e0 cause de la n\u00e9gligence des gardiens que Miss Simons a demand\u00e9 Robert d'y voir. Je crois encore que $5.00 pour laver et huiler ce plancher est acceptable. J'ai souvent demand\u00e9 aux institutrices des \u00e9coles United Church de m'informer si elles d\u00e9sirent que les gardiens soient remplac\u00e9s. Je crois que si elles ne demandent pas ce changement c'est que peut-\u00eatre comme moi elles croient que remplacer ces deux Indiens par deux autres Indiens n'am\u00e9liorerait pas cette situation.\n\nNovembre 7 - \u00c9cole Kateri. Je n'ai pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Robert de faire le nettoyage des classes apr\u00e8s que les modifications furent termin\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole Kateri, cependant, je sais que ce n'\u00e9tait pas un nettoyage ordinaire \u00e0 faire apr\u00e8s ces travaux; transport des d\u00e9chets, etc.; il me dit qu'il croit que ce travail suppl\u00e9mentaire m\u00e9riterait compensation.\n\nSi vous voulez bien r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 votre lettre du 15 septembre dernier vous constaterez que Robert \u00e9tait dans l'obligation de charroyer quatre \u00e0 six chaudi\u00e8res d'eau potable, chaque jour scolaire, depuis l'ouverture des classes jusqu'au 15 du mois de novembre.\n\n30 Novembre. - Si vous voulez bien r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 votre lettre N\u00b0. 5-1-1 en date du 11 d\u00e9cembre dernier, des arrangements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits pour permettre aux enfants des \u00e9coles United Church d'avoir leur concert de No\u00ebl dans la salle de l'\u00e9cole Senior. Apr\u00e8s ce concert les planchers et les escaliers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9s dans un \u00e9tat de malpropret\u00e9, il semble \u00e9vident que ce nettoyage n'entre pas dans le travail r\u00e9gulier du gardien de l'\u00e9cole Senior.\n\nJe puis vous assurer que je n'ai pas de faveurs \u00e0 faire \u00e0 Albany Robert, mais j'ai souvent constat\u00e9 qu'il est un bon serviteur, tr\u00e8s conciencieux, travaillant et parcimonieux. Lorsque je constate que des r\u00e9parations, nettoyage, etc., deviennent absolument n\u00e9cessaires aux deux \u00e9coles United Church il ne me reste pas d'autres alternatives que de recourir aux services de Robert. Parce que les cabinets d'aisance deviennent inabordables, que les planchers des \u00e9coles sont sales, que les vitres des portes et fen\u00eatres sont bris\u00e9es et que les gardiens nomm\u00e9s n\u00e9gligent de remplir leur devoir, dois-je alors vous en aviser dans chaque cas ?, ce serait ennuyeux pour vous, ou,\nou, comme je le crois, n'est-il pas plut\u00f4t pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de recourir imm\u00e9diatement aux services d'un employ\u00e9 qui, je le sais, n'exige en retour qu'un salaire suppl\u00e9mentaire juste et raisonnable.\n\nJ'ai cependant r\u00e9cemment averti Robert de ne plus faire aucun travail aux \u00e9coles United Church, ni de pr\u00eater des outils, etc., aux gardiens de ces \u00e9coles \u00e0 moins qu'il ait la certitude que ce lui serait rapport\u00e9, cela, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que vous auriez \u00e0 propos de m'aviser du contraire.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent des Indiens.\nOttawa, January 30, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, concerning the account of Albany Robert to the amount of $125.45 for repairs, cleaning, materials purchased and other incidental expenses in connection with the schools, your office and jail on the Osughnawaga Reserve. In this connection I have to say that, in view of your explanation regarding a number of items in the account, the Department has decided to allow payment in full, and a cheque will be forwarded in due course.\n\nIn connection with the janitors' services at the schools on the Gaughnawaga Reserve, it is felt that if all the janitors carried out their duties it should not be necessary to call upon Mr. Robert to perform the extra work as charged for by him in the account above referred to. I would point out that the Department expects Matthew Lazare and F. K. Diabo to carry out the following duties, viz.: light the fires and have the classrooms warm before the children arrive each school day; sweep the classrooms; put on and take off double windows and wash and clean same; any snow shovelling required and any other duties which they are called upon to perform by yourself and the teachers. You should inform both these janitors of the duties they are expected to perform and also advise the teachers. The Department also feels that for the salary paid Albany Robert, Joseph Geitens and Mrs. Geitens they should perform all the duties required of them by the Reverend Sisters and yourself at the R. C. Schools and teachers' residence.\n\nWith all the caretakers doing their duty, it should only be necessary, in future, for Mr. Robert to perform very few services for which he will expect extra pay. Therefore, in future, all work, such as cleaning and installing windows; scrubbing and cleaning classrooms; moving desks, etc., and keeping the grounds in good condition, should form part of the regular duties of the janitors. You should see each of the janitors named above at an early date and explain to them fully the work the Department expects them to perform for the salary they are being paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP.Q.\nOttawa, January 30, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, concerning the account of Albany Robert to the amount of $123.45 for repairs, cleaning, materials purchased and other incidental expenses in connection with the schools, your office and jail on the Caughnawaga Reserve. In this connection I have to say that, in view of your explanation regarding a number of items in the account, the Department has decided to allow payment in full, and a cheque will be forwarded in due course.\n\nIn connection with the janitors' services at the schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve, it is felt that if all the janitors carried out their duties it should not be necessary to call upon Mr. Robert to perform the extra work as charged for by him in the account above referred to. I would point out that the Department expects Matthew Lazare and F. K. Diabo to carry out the following duties, viz.: light the fires and have the classrooms warm before the children arrive each school day; sweep the classrooms; put on and take off double windows and wash and clean same; any snow shovelling required and any other duties which they are called upon to perform by yourself and the teachers. You should inform both these janitors of the duties they are expected to perform and also advise the teachers. The Department also feels that for the salary paid Albany Robert, Joseph Gaitens and Mrs. Gaitens they should perform all the duties required of them by the Reverend Sisters and yourself at the R. C. Schools and teachers' residence.\n\nWith all the caretakers doing their duty, it should only be necessary, in future, for Mr. Robert to perform very few services for which he will expect extra pay. Therefore, in future, all work, such as cleaning and installing windows; scrubbing and cleaning classrooms; moving desks, etc., and keeping the grounds in good condition, should form part of the regular duties of the janitors. You should see each of the janitors named above at an early date and explain to them fully the work the Department expects them to perform for the salary they are being paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Sisters teaching at Caughnawaga, by the Nu-Way Oil Burner Company, Montreal, for repairs which were done to the oil burner of the Senior school and I do not believe I should recommend this account to the approval of the Department before giving the following explanations.\n\nThe caretaker of the school first telephoned to the Nu-Way Company to inform them that the burner was not working properly and suggested that they should come to do the necessary repairs. However, Robert informed at the same time the Company that in the meantime he would do his best to locate the trouble. To that the Nu-Way Company replied to Robert not to touch it. However, Robert immediately started to work and he states that he succeeded in locating the defect, since the burner started to work immediately. Then Robert telephoned again to the Company to tell them not to come to Caughnawaga but they replied that two of their men had already left for the reserve. In fact these two men went to the Senior School, but there was nothing for them to do as the burner was working normally.\n\nI believe I should leave this matter for your consideration and I wish you would kindly inform me if you desire me to follow the usual formalities to produce the account to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLorenzo Letourneau,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing an account to the amount of $10.90 covering the cost of repairs to the oil burner at the Senior School on the Caughnawaga Reserve. The circumstances in connection with this account, as stated by you, have been noted. The Department considers that the account of the Nu-Way Oil Heating Equipment Ltd., Montreal, should be paid, as, in proceeding to the school, they acted on instructions from the caretaker. A voucher is being prepared here and a cheque in payment will be sent the above Company.\n\nIn future, the caretaker should endeavour to locate and make any necessary repairs that are possible for him to make without damage to the equipment before requesting the Company to do the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Careful consideration has been given to this account and the Department is not prepared to allow the following items as it is considered that these come within his regular duties and he should not request extra pay for same:\n\n- Washing of floor of the Corner Protestant School (January 2nd) - $5.00\n- Installing ladder, St. Isidore Road School (June 28th) - $2.00\n- Exchanging furnace gates (June 30th) - $1.25\n- Replacing post at gate of teachers' residence (July) - $2.00\n\nIt is felt that the price charged for the cleaning of the closets at the St. Isidore Road School on June 27th, viz., $10.00, is rather high. It is considered that $5.00 should be sufficient.\n\nThe Department cannot understand the charge, amounting to $7.75, for transportation of wood to the different schools. It was always understood that, when you purchased wood, you secured a price delivered at the school at which same was needed. Under these circumstances, the Department is not prepared to allow this item.\n\nIf you specially authorized Mr. Robert to clean the jail following the distribution of seeds to Indians as appears from item of May 28th, a separate voucher, amounting to $1.00, should be forwarded for this one item.\n\nTaking the above into consideration, you may forward a new voucher in Mr. Robert's favour for the sum of $95.20.\n\nThe receipted accounts from Jolicoeur, Latour and Charron, which accompanied your voucher, are being retained here and will be attached to the account when you return same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Albany Robert pour les travaux suppl\u00e9mentaires qu'il a ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s aux \u00e9coles de la r\u00e9serve ainsi qu'\u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence des Soeurs \u00e0 Caughnawaga. Apr\u00e8s en avoir caus\u00e9 de nouveau avec lui il a finalement consenti \u00e0 ce qu'une r\u00e9duction de $24.00 soit faite sur ce compte que je retourne sous ce pli, avec mon \"voucher\" en triplicata pour une somme de $95.20.\n\nCependant, M. Robert d\u00e9sire que vous lui permettiez de vous donner connaissance des raisons pour lesquelles il a cru que le compte original de $119.20 \u00e9tait juste et raisonnable. Sa lettre du 12 courant est attach\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente.\n\nJe profite de cette occasion pour vous soumettre respectueusement que la fournaise de l'\u00e9cole Bush est maintenant hors de service. Dans le cours de l'hiver dernier M. Robert a fait plusieurs voyages \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole pour la rep\u00e9rer, quoiqu'il n'y fut pas tenu, et il l'a ensuite \u00e9chang\u00e9e pour la fournaise de la prison afin de ne pas priver l'\u00e9cole Bush de ses jours de classes. La fournaise de la prison a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en assez bon \u00e9tat par M. Robert, mais celle de l'\u00e9cole Bush devra \u00eatre remplac\u00e9e avant l'ouverture des classes. Je vous prie de bien vouloir m'autoriser \u00e0 faire l'achat d'une fournaise au co\u00fbt approximatif de $25.00. Je d\u00e9sire ajouter que le charbon \"coke\", en usage depuis l'hiver dernier dans les \u00e9coles de la r\u00e9serve, est de nature \u00e0 faire d\u00e9teriorer plus rapidement les fournaises.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nAgent des Indiens,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP.Q.\nDear Mr. Agent,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Jan. 13, 1934, asking for further information concerning voucher #3851 for $25.15 worth of repairs in the Teachers' Residence, I wish to state that no one voluntarily had the intention of incurring expenses without the Department's authority. Where permission had not been previously obtained, the repairs were emergency cases.\n\nThe most striking item on the bill was the renewal of the kitchen hot water tank which had suddenly run a very heavy leak. The plumbers took down the tank for a closer examination and found it not only useless to patch up the opening but dangerous to set the tank again as the zinc was so corroded by the hard water and similar leaks were liable to break out at any time. Hence when I mentioned the matter to you, Mr. Letourneau, you secured the permission authorizing the installation of the new tank.\n\nWhile the plumbers were in the house, I was asked if a leak in the toilet-room could not also be attended to as it was impossible to cram in a pail under the box to receive the dripping water. The plumber found that this small tank also had been corroded by hard water beyond repair. He brought it off with him immediately as during this season, when boats are not running, he avoids as many trips as possible with his truck over the Victoria Bridge, about a 30 mile trip out of the way. Whenever the material required for repairs is not too heavy, and he can make suitable connections with the trains, in such a way as not to lose too much time, he gladly does so.\n\nThe trouble in the Teachers' Residence was not at an end. This time the hard water again caused the pipes in the kitchen stove to burst. A new water-front had to be put in without delay so as not to deprive the teachers of their hot meals.\n\nThen the interior of the oil-burner called for new bricks, the others being worn out to the iron. As the furnace was in a condition to cause serious and imminent damage, I spoke to you about it, Mr. Letourneau and your reply was that this was an emergency case----to have the furnace attended to at once. Hence two men worked at it half a day and at the same time renewed the pipe of the small coal furnace which is heated only when the electricity gives out and the oil-burner cannot be used. The large holes found in this pipe were mostly caused by rust. While the men were at their work, I asked them to tell me what was wrong with the electric water-pump. The trouble was found to be connected with the safety-valve. A new one was put on, but I still have the old one on hand and shall have it repaired if possible.\nAbout the worst annoyance arose in the bathroom which became suddenly invaded with a terrible stench. Moreover, in the bath tub fecal matter even came up the drain pipe from the toilet next door. The odor was so strong and the sleeping rooms so close-by that there was every chance of the Sisters becoming victims to typhoid fever, and it was too cold to open the windows. Knowing that no Health Department allows delay in such matters, we had the plumber try to locate the cause of the trouble. After repeated efforts and a great deal of difficulty and trying labor, he discovered that a hard, strong mass had formed in the air-pipe connected with the drain pipe and had blocked circulation.\n\nThis, dear Mr. Letourneau is a summary of the unpleasant and manifold disturbances the teachers enjoyed during their Christmas holidays.\n\nI trust that the Department will not find that I have acted unwisely and tried to take the general management of things in my own hands. I did all for the best, thinking the Department would be the first to encourage me to have these urgent repairs attended to in time.\n\nHoping I have given you satisfactory explanations, dear Mr. Letourneau,\n\nI am\n\nYour humble servant\n\nCaretaker\n\nMr. L. Letourneau,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant relative to the account of $3.15, covering the cost of urgent repairs to the water system, etc., in the teachers' residence on the Caughnawaga Reserve and in this connection please permit me to enclose herewith a letter of the 16th instant from Mr. A.

In some of these rooms, the situation is made worse by the fact that some of this insufficient light comes from the wall facing the pupils. This can be remedied, to a certain extent, in the room that is occupied by the girls of the 2nd Grade, in the Kateri School, by arranging the desks to face in the opposite direction. If the roofs of these schools were raised, it would be possible to remedy this situation, without the addition of any new floor-space.\n\nIn the report on the Senior School, you will find remarks on the condition of the paint on the interior walls of that school and on the advisability of certain improvements in the boys' lavatory.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF SEPARATE SCHOOL\nINSPECTOR A.

Unfortunately, there must have been some essential ingredient lacking in the paint used on the interior walls, as the paint is falling off the walls, in large flakes or scales, in many parts of the building.\n\n2. In the boys' lavatory, there are only two urinals for the use of forty-three boys. As a consequence, the other toilet-bowls are often used as urinals. I would respectfully suggest the addition of two new urinals, for sanitary reasons. There is ample room for this addition.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR A. W.

Sister Superior and of Mr. Robert Janitor. As I am at Caughnawaga every day of the week I wish to say that, if I am to be held responsible for all the expenses made I would like to be consulted, either by the Sister Superior or the Janitor, in order to secure proper authorization from the Department and also to find out if the expenses are really needed.\n\nIn connection with the enclose account I have to let you know that I did not know anything about it until I received same. Previous to the 1st of October last, my predecessor was coming to the Reserve twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday and from 2 to 4 pm, and as he was living at 12 miles from Caughnawaga, he had instructed the Sisters and Mr. Robert to have any necessary repairs made without consulting him. But as I am here 5 days a week presently and will be at the Agency 6 days weekly after the 1st of January next I would recommend that no exception be made for the local Schools or the Sister's Residence with regard to expenses.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 26, 1934.\n\nMadam:\n\nMr. Agent Brisebois has forwarded a voucher for $25.00, covering the cost of material and repairs at the Rev. Sisters' residence, Caughnawaga.\n\nIt would appear that the repairs were made by Mr. Pilon, at your request, without consulting the Agent in the matter. I should be very pleased if, in future, before undertaking any repairs to the residences or schools under your charge, or in the purchase of any supplies, you would make your request through the office of Mr. Agent Brisebois. As Mr. Brisebois is present on the reserve each day, there should be little trouble occasioned to you in consulting him. It is necessary that he refer all requests to the Department and receive authority before undertaking any repairs or purchasing any supplies. It is expected that the janitor of the schools, Mr. Robert, will also consult the Indian Agent before he authorizes any work being done. Since the new Agent has been appointed, it is required that his recommendation accompany all requests for repairs, equipment and supplies of all kinds. I am sure you will be pleased to comply with the Department's requirements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Sister M. Cleophas,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nOttawa, December 26, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing a voucher for $25.00, in favour of Mr. Bruno Pilon, covering the cost of repairs and materials supplied to the Sisters' residence and the Caughnawaga Village Schools. Cheque in payment will be forwarded Mr. Pilon in due course.\n\nI have noted your remarks regarding your being consulted by the Sister Superior or the Janitor before incurring any expenditure. In this connection I enclose, for your information, copy of a letter which is being sent to the Rev. Sister Superior. When forwarding any requests from the Sister Superior, your recommendation should accompany such requests.\n\nEncl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nI am requested by Rev. Father Menard together with a group of leading Indians of this reserve to submit to your consideration their request for a grant from the Department towards the making and the upkeep of a skating rink. The promoters of the rink are claiming that the Indians of Caughnawaga are presently very poor and consequently are unable to meet with all the expenses involved for a rink, they claim that with a small help from the Department the population of the Band would be provided with good distraction. It is understood that a grant from the Department would be to entitle all the children of the Caughnawaga Schools to skate every day of the week after school and all day on Saturday. It was represented that the young men are presently without any place to go and that they are hanging around pool rooms and other places where it would be better for them not to go. It is claimed that a rink would gather the youth and that responsible persons would maintain the good order.\n\nAlthough I am aware that the Department has more serious things to consider and that expenses are very heavy for relief etc., I beg to say that any amount given, be it very small, would be very much appreciated. It is also considered that any village or small town having the same population as Caughnawaga, has its own skating rink, which provides distractions for the old and young, and that if a certain sum is granted it should be on the ground to provide amusement for schoolchildren.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6080, file 305-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 9th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 17th, requesting a grant from the Department towards the upkeep of a skating rink. The Department is unable to find funds which might be used for this purpose. The Department sees nothing to prevent Osughawaga from having an open air skating rink as there is so much assistance available from the unemployed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF.

In the event of Jolicoeur being given the job, he will employ Saylor to do some work.\n\nThe above-mentioned interior painting is very necessary and I would strongly recommend that it be done during the coming summer holidays.\n\nIn addition to the interior painting, the oil tank at the back of the building should also be painted in order to keep it from rusting.\n\nI do not consider that it is necessary to incur any expenditure this year for painting the exterior of the window frames and the fire escapes. The painting of these can be postponed until next year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The present fence is now out of order and the animals have access to the school yard, just as if there was no fence at all. There are 66 fence posts in all for this fence, out of this number, 31 could be utilised leaving 35 to be replaced by new ones, 600 ft. of fence wire 4 ft. high and about 15 lbs of staples would also have to be bought. The price for the posts is of $0.12 each (4 inches) the price of the fencing wire is $0.18 a yard (4 ft. high) and $0.07 a lb. for the staples. The total material required would amount to approximately, $42.00. If recommended, I would suggest that the work be done free of charge by the chief janitor Albany Robert, his assistant Jos. Cassien and the janitor of this school Michael O. Phillips. Enclosed herewith is a letter from the teacher, pertaining to the fence.\n\nSt-Isidore School.\n\nThe only repairs required at this school are for the window screens which are in bad order, the frames of the screens are good; the wire netting only, has to be replaced. 15 yards of screen would be needed at $0.50 a yard. The work should be done free of charge by Albany Robert, chief janitor.\n\nProtestant School Senior.\n\nNo repairs needed.\n\nProtestant School Junior.\n\nThe repairs needed at this school consist in the repairing of the front porch which is in bad shape and dangerous for the children. As this building belongs to the United Church and is only rented by the Department, I would kindly ask you to communicate with the authorities of the Church, in order that the necessary repairs be made.\nKateri School.\n\nSeveral radiator valves of the heating system of this school are broken. This should be repaired before the cold weather comes. The janitor in charge also requested that 2 dozens of window blinds be supplied, as the ones in use are a little too short. This is not recommended as they are considered good enough for at least another year.\n\nEastern School.\n\nSeveral radiator valves are broken and also the sump of a sink. The pipe from the school to the well is broken and the pipe inside the well is thought to have dropped down the well when an attempt to repair it was made last Spring by the janitor. If this pipe cannot be reached, a new one will be needed at an approximate cost of $10. for the pipe only. The cost of labour for a plumber, for the repairing of the valves and also the piping system of the well is estimated at about $20. The digging of the trench from the school to the well should be made free of charge by the janitor and his assistant. In addition to these repairs, the three revolving gates which are now broken, should be repaired at an approximate cost of $5.00 for the three. The roof of the toilets at this school will have to be renewed. In the course of April, an authorization for shingles, from the Department, in order to repair this same roof was received. The shingles were bought but not utilized as it was found out that the boards of the roof were rotten. The entire boards of the roof have to be removed and covered anew with shingles. This roof measures 16 X 32 ft. and the renewing of the roof is estimated at about $40. for material. The work should be made in this case also by the janitor and his assistant. Two dozens of window blinds were also requested for this school, but are not considered urgently needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 20, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, I beg to say that you may have the necessary repairs made to the Kateri and Eastern Schools.\n\nIt is noted in your letter that repairs to the Eastern School will cost approximately $75. As much of the labour as possible should be done by the janitor and his assistant.\n\nSeparate letters are being directed to you regarding the Bush and St. Isidore Schools. In writing to the Department concerning these schools, you should send separate letters, as separate files are kept for each school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF.

Church.\n\nSince the departmental engineer will be here soon, I wish to call your attention to the unsatisfactory lighting system in the attic floor of this school where two large kindergarten Indian-school children have their classes. I have complained of this unsatisfactory situation on many previous occasions and the Department has promised to remedy the matter, but so far nothing has been done yet. I suggest that new large windows be installed on the south side of this building. The glass surface should equal \u00bc to \u00bd of the floor space. Tinted or prismatic glass may be used to augment the light from the plain glass.\n\nIf it is not possible to get better direct lighting,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6080, file 305-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nin these two said class-rooms, an indirect or semi-direct method should be installed with the use of electricity as the best source of artificial lighting.\n\nWith present conditions tolerated, many of our young school children are continually complaining of short-sightedness.\n\nSincerely hoping that my suggestions will be taken into serious consideration,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.H. Jacobs M.D.\nCaughnawaga, August 22, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to transmit you herewith the original of a letter sent me by Dr. J.M. Jacobs of this Reserve, which deals with the lighting of the two classes located on the second floor of the Kateri R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nAs will be seen by the enclosed communication, the doctor is claiming that the two kindergarten classes are not well enough lighted and he suggested that the present windows be enlarged and equipped with ribbed or prismatic glass. I understand that this matter had been taken up previously with you by the doctor. After having visited the two classes mentioned I beg to say that it was found not to be very well lighted, but I also wish to point out that the carrying out of the doctor's recommendation would require considerable expenses, as practically two complete sides of the upper story would have to be demolished, in order to install larger windows.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCaughnawaga, August 22, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 8th instant with regard to a second coat of paint to the inside walls of the Senior R.C.

H. Jacobs, with reference to the lighting of the two classrooms located on the second floor of the Kateri School.\n\nConsiderable expense would be involved in making the change in these rooms recommended by Dr. Jacobs and, as the Department has no funds for the purpose at the present time, no action can be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You requested me to let you know what would be considered a fair amount to allow the janitor for this work.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the payments which used to be made at $2.50 for the toilets of the Eastern School should be paid at $1.50, the Sisters' toilets, tank and sewer of this same school $2.00 instead of $3.00, toilets of the Materi School new payment $3.00, old payment, $5.00, St. Isidore Road School $3.00 instead of $5.00 per toilet, sewer teachers' residence suggested payment $5.00. The total cost of this work for the above schools and residence would amount to $30.00 instead of $50.00 and this amount is considered as very reasonable.\n\nIn the event of Mr. Robert not willing to do this work, I would kindly ask you to authorize me to hire someone else to do it.

Jolicoeur, Lachine, Que., was accepted for the repairing and re-touching of the walls and the painting - one coat - for the sum of $275.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the work is now carried on by the contractor who is employing Louis Sayler, Indian of this Reserve.\n\nHowever, I beg to inform you that owing to the conditions of the walls and due to the peeling off of the old paint and the repairs made, one coat of paint is not sufficient and is far from making a satisfactory work. Due to the small cracks in the walls, one coat of paint penetrates so that it leaves marks or spots almost everywhere. In order to see the difference between one coat and two coats, the contractor painted one room with two coats and I have to say that with two coats, no marks are showing and thus making a first class job. As the contractor is not yet through with the first coat and is still at the Senior School, with his men, I would recommend that a second coat of paint on the walls be authorized. Mr. Jolicoeur would be ready to undertake the painting of an additional coat for the sum of $90. I would kindly ask you to let me know as soon as possible if this recommendation is accepted, in order that the contractor be advised before he resumes work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) F.

Jolicoeur, Leckinheque, was accepted for the repairing and retouching of the walls and the painting - one coat - for the sum of $57.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the work is now carried on by the contractor who is employing Louis Saylor, Indian of this Reserve.\n\nHowever, I beg to inform you that owing to the condition of the walls and due to the peeling off of the old paint and the repairs made, one coat of paint is not sufficient and is far from making a satisfactory work. Due to the small cracks in the walls, one coat of paint penetrates so that it leaves marks or spots almost everywhere. In order to see the difference between one coat and two coats, the contractor painted one room with two coats and I have to say that with two coats, no marks are showing and thus making a first class job. As the contractor is not yet through with the first coat and is still at the Senior School, with his men, I would recommend that a second coat of paint on the walls be authorized. Mr. Jolicoeur would be ready to undertake the painting of an additional coat for the sum of $20. I would kindly ask you to let me know as soon as possible if this recommendation is accepted, in order that the contractor be advised before he resumes work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nOffice of Indian Affairs,\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is not due to any fault of yours but simply on account of the manner in which the accounts are prepared.\n\nOn the account it states as follows: \"All complaints regarding service, please address the Manager, Commercial and Distribution Department, Montreal\". The Department would appreciate if you would visit this office as soon as possible, show them the enclosed accounts and receive from the Company a full explanation regarding the manner in which the amounts shown on the account are reached.\n\nFull information should be obtained regarding the following:\n\n1. Why is the electricity for the Senior School charged on rate No. 192, while the rate for the teachers' residence is charged on rate 1907?\n\n2. The account for the electricity at the Senior School reads:\n\n| Present Reading | Previous Reading | Consumption | Total |\n|-----------------|------------------|-------------|-------|\n| 0015            | 004              | 11 x 5 = 55 |       |\n| 1222            | 1174             | 48          | 103   |\n\nDoes this mean that there are two meters, and, if so, when the first one shows a consumption of 11, why is it multiplied by 5 to bring 55?\n\nI trust that you will find it possible to give this matter your early attention and receive from the Company a detailed explanation of the manner in which these accounts are computed by them. Would it be possible to secure a uniform rate at all schools? When forwarding the information requested in this letter, you should return the accounts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

The rate for the Senior School is the one charged for all public buildings, stores, etc., where rate 190 is not applicable because this rate is for domestic use only. The Company is considering the teachers' residence as a private residence and is therefore computing the account on rate 190, which is cheaper than 192. It is preferable that the rate in use at the residence remains as it is.\n\n2. Relative to the account for electricity at the Senior School, I beg to inform you that the appearance of two meter readings on the same account is due to the fact that the old meter was changed about the middle of the month, therefore showing a reading for this regular meter as follows: present reading, 1222, previous reading, 1174 giving a consumption of 48 kwhrs. The new meter, of a type called Lincoln E.D. Demand Meter showing a reading as follows: present reading, .0015, previous reading, .0004, giving a consumption of 11 kws. I beg to point out that this new meter, which will be in use in the future, is a type of meter registering only 1/5 of the electricity consumed, therefrom, the multiplying of the number of kilowatts amperes, by 5. The amount of electricity used at the Senior School for the month of November is, on the old meter, of 48 kwhrs. and of 11 kws.X 5 or 55 kws., on the new meter, for a total of 103 kwhrs.\nYou will find enclosed, as requested, the electricity accounts for November, but you will notice that the account for the Senior School has been corrected after a communication was received, on the 16th instant, from the Shawinigan Water & Power Company at Valleyfield, enclosing a corrected statement of the account.\n\nI would kindly ask you to cancel Voucher No.847 amounting to $27.84, which will be replaced by Voucher No.847A amounting to $27.34. The reason for this error, according to the Company, is that we were billed on a demand of 4 kw., whereas the demand should have been 2.5 kw. for service charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo...The Bell Telephone Co. of Canada,\nLachine Exchange...\nLachine, Que.\n\nDecember 18, 1935.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | Allotment #2 - 202 |        |\n|      | ENCLOSURE. |        |\n|      | To inter-school communications at the Caughnawaga Indian Boys' Schools and teachers' residence during the month of November, 1935. | $5.66 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 506\n\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs.

This rink has been realized only after heavy expenses were made, and as it is now, there are a number of payments that will have to be met within the next few weeks. To briefly summarize the work done and things purchased - for which we owe -\n\n(1) The land had to be plowed and levelled and necessitated the hiring of 3 or 4 men with a team of horses.\n(2) New wiring and lights had to be installed.\n(3) Heat Coal and Food, and many other small items which are too lengthy to enumerate.\n(4) Flooding etc.\n\nUp to the present time, during the days, we have been permitting the school boys and girls on the rink for the purposes of skating free of charge, and it is for this reason that we desire to make an appeal to the Department of Indian Affairs for financial aid. The generosity of the Department in matters such as these, has been known in the past, and we are certain that apart from the help that we may derive from any help that may be given us, the school children will benefit morally and physically; it will prevent the children from hanging around pool rooms and from running the streets.\n\nWe are certain, and we hope, that the Department will contribute generously - and we are making this sincere and earnest request through your good self.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nHarry Williams,\nSecretary,\nMichael K.

Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor Stone:\n\nRe' Kateri Tekakwitha School (R.C.)\n\nOn Oct. 1, 1931, I made a report to you on the unsanitary conditions existing in the class-rooms of the upper floor in the above school. I have complained of these conditions again and again, but nothing has yet been done to correct it. I was informed by the local Indian agent that Mr. Chief of the Department saw these class-rooms a year ago, and at that time he said funds would be voted for this fiscal year to make the necessary structural changes to improve the unsanitary conditions. In another six weeks, classes again will begin, so that there is now not much time to do this necessary work.\nThere are usually about 50 to 60 small school children in these two class-rooms and they require plenty of fresh air, sufficient amount of light and direct sunlight for a part of each day, but they cannot have that in their class-rooms. No serious structural operation would be required.\n\nIt would only be necessary to replace the four windows on the East, South and West sides with small dingy windows, as a matter of fact, four large bay windows. As a matter of fact, I am told that it could be done at a very small cost.\n\nAs I have been complaining of the above condition for a long time and as nothing has yet been done, I wish you would persuade the Department to do something for the sake of the health of the young Indian school children now.\n\nThanking you, I am\n\nYour truly,\n\nL. W. Jacobs M.D.\nOttawa, July 31st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, addressed to Dr. E. L. Stone.\n\nWith reference to your complaint regarding certain rooms in the Kateri School, the Department investigated this matter when you wrote some months' ago and it was decided at that time that, owing to the expense involved, no action could be taken.\n\nIn future, you should not correspond direct with the Department regarding such matters, but should discuss them with the Indian Agent, who will report if necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Senior School was defective and that about 100 gallons of oil had been lost during the two previous days. Upon being so advised, the fuel distributors, Mongeau & Robert & Co., who are supplying us the fuel oil for this year for Come Lanctot of St. Isidore, who has the contract - were requested to send a truck to empty the tank at once, which was done.\n\nHowever, the tank will have to be taken out of the ground and thoroughly examined and repaired. I would suggest that the Company's men, who are specialized in such work, be requested to make the repairs needed. It is understood that this account would be charged to Come Lanctot, who would afterwards charge it to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSept. 26, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th instant with reference to the defective condition of the fuel oil tank in the Central School at Caughnawaga.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange with Come Lanotot of St. Isidore to have this tank taken out and repaired with the least possible delay. It is desired that you personally supervise the work of repairing and installing the tank in order that you may be in a position to verify and certify that the work has been properly carried out. It should be done as economically as possible.\n\nIt might also be advisable to arrange to have the tank re-coated with asphalt paint before it is again buried in the ground, after it has been thoroughly tested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes.\nActing Secretary.\n\nFr. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nCaughnawaga, October 5, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 26th ultimo dealing with the repairs to be done to the oil tank at the Senior School, Caughnawaga and to say that the tank has actually been taken out of the ground and has been found to be pierced by rust at many places, the corroding action of the rust has also attacked the whole part of the tank which was underground. It is claimed that the damage is due to the fact that it was only half buried and that the tank should have been all buried or installed completely on the ground.\n\nIt is stated by the officials of the Company making the repairs, for C. Lanctot of St. Isidore, that if this tank is welded only at the several places where it now leaks, we will likely have to start the same work all over again before long, as the rust has damaged it very badly. It has been suggested that a new tank be installed, but instead of being of a capacity of 3000 gallons, as the present one, a tank of approximately 1500 should meet the requirements, as since the construction of the new bridge, oil can be obtained at a few hours' notice the roads being kept open during the winter months.\n\nIn view of the actual condition of the tank and the contentions advanced, the price of a new tank was obtained and was found to be as follows: for one of 4\" thick, 5' diameter and 13' long of a capacity of approximately 1550 gallons, of $225. taxes included, delivered at Caughnawaga. The excavation now made would be sufficient to receive a new smaller tank, which should all be buried.\n\nHowever, I would kindly ask you to let me know whether it is your wish that the actual tank be repaired or if you think advisable to have a new one installed.\n\nI would ask you to inform me of your decision as soon as possible, as the school is without fire. For the Department's satisfaction, it might be advisable to send one of your officials to look the matter over.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 8th., 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, regarding a new tank for fuel oil, Caughnawaga School, I have to request that you advise the Department as to what firm submitted the quotation mentioned in your letter. I may say that funds are available to the amount mentioned by you, but that the purchase should be made from some firm whose name appears on the approved list.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nFrancois Brisebois Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa, October 9th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the voucher which you submitted in favour of the Reverend Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga R.C. Indian Day Schools. The voucher is issued in her favour and, consequently, it will be necessary to have the telephone account receipted, also the accounts from J. P. Dupuis Ltd. As you are aware, present regulations require accounts to be receipted before payment can be made to a second party.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF.

But I have not the required money for that purpose.\n\nWould the Department help us with a grant of a hundred dollars ($100.00) or more?\n\nActually, after school hours, our boys and girls, having no amusement whatsoever, hang around the reservation, losing thus all the good principles they are given at school by our good sisters. If we could secure for them a skating rink, by keeping them away from places where they should not go, viz. poolroom, we could help them to live up a little better to the excellent education they receive at school, and so, the expenses so generously made by the Department for their formation, would not be partially lost.\n\nHoping that my request will not be overlooked, & remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFiona Farnan, S.J.

Indian Day Schools for the month of January last, and including the final charges up to the date this service was disconnected.\n\nIn this connection, I would say that you have already forwarded a voucher covering the cost of the telephone services for the month of January and a cheque in payment, to the amount of $5.66, has been sent the above company. The account which you now forward requests payment for the same month and for the balance to the time the service was disconnected. I am returning the voucher and you should obtain another statement from the company showing the amount due from the first of February until the date the phone was disconnected. This account you should attach to proper voucher forms, in triplicate, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF.

They claim the enclosed statement to be in order with their records, and further stated that the misunderstanding might be due to the fact that the telephone service bills are payable in advance and that all the bills presented to this office, and transmitted to Ottawa, were paid at the end of the month, that is at the beginning of the next month, thus always leaving a month's arrear, hence the account of $5.66 for one month's service, plus $3.76 for the period between January 11th, and February 1st, when the phone was disconnected.\n\nI beg to trust this information will be found satisfactory for the payment of this account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n| Rate No. | Demand | Lecture Previous Reading | Consumption | Service | Amount |\n|---------|--------|--------------------------|-------------|---------|--------|\n|         |        |                          |             |         |        |\n\n**Are you making full use of your electric service?**\n\nAny employee will advise you how to do your hard work electrically.\n\n---\n\n**DEPT.

Schools.\n\nAt one time we had three janitors for these schools, viz: Mr. Robert, Mr. Gatien and Mrs. Gatien. The latter did general cleaning under direction of the sisters and was paid at the rate of $300.00 a year. Some time ago it was found necessary to dispense with Mrs. Gatien's services and, instead of appointing anyone to succeed her, the Reverend Sister Superior was authorized to expend an amount of $150.00 a year, or $15.00 a month, for extra cleaning that is required. It has been the usual practice in the Caughnawaga R.C.

Senior School and more particularly to the roof of building which was leaking.\n\nIn this connection I wish to let you know that recently following a heavy rain, an additional part of the plaster ceiling fell due to the water coming from the roof.\n\nIt is feared that if the roof is not repaired soon, considerable damages will be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Phelan\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your memorandum of the 26th ultimo, addressed to Mr. Chene, an engineer of this Service, with reference to some alterations required to the roof above the pupils' entrances at both ends of the Senior Day School at Caughnawaga, Quebec, which matter was brought to his attention by the Caretaker and the Indian Agent while visiting Caughnawaga last spring.\n\nIn this connection I am advised by the above mentioned officer that the work in question would consist in the continuation of the gable roof in order to eliminate the hips at both ends and prevent water or snow from any portion of the roof falling on the concrete entrances (landing and steps), which becomes dangerous when ice accumulates thereon during the cold seasons. The cost of the work above mentioned would amount to approximately $275.00, and the work, if authorized, could be carried out under the supervision of a competent carpenter with the help of local Indians during the summer holidays.\n\nEncl.\n\nI am enclosing herewith plans of this school building showing in red the changes recommended in its roof, which if allowed, would greatly improve the conditions of the pupils' entrances throughout the year.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nBooth Bldg.,\nOTTAWA.\n\nT.S. Mills\nChief Engineer,\n\nPer:\nOttawa, July 8, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to certain repairs required at the Senior School. Following receipt of your letter of March 11th, the matter of repairs was taken up with the Surveys and Engineering Branch, and they submitted an estimate of $275.00.\n\nI do not know whether this amount was intended to cover the repairs to the roof which you mentioned. In their memorandum to us they specifically refer to their proposal to make alterations in the roof in order to improve conditions at the two entrances.\n\nThey are being advised today that, as far as the entrances are concerned, it is considered possibly a porch over each entrance would be sufficient and would involve very small expenditure. However, if their engineers consider that it is preferable to make alterations to the roof, we are giving them instructions to proceed.\n\nIf the repairs to the roof, mentioned in your letter, are different from the enlarging of the roof to prevent dripping, you may arrange for the necessary work, as I am under the impression, from your letter, that it will not involve any heavy expenditure. You may, also, arrange for the necessary plastering to replace what has fallen.\n\nI understand that Mr. Chene is going to Caughnawaga in the near future to supervise the reconstruction of the Caughnawaga United Church School, and, no doubt, he will consult you regarding the repairs to the Senior School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nFr. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nOttawa, July 8, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nRe: Caughnawaga Senior Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga Reserve, Quebec.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of Mr. Mills' memorandum of June 10th, with reference to alterations required at the Senior Day School on the Caughnawaga reserve.\n\nI note from the memorandum that the estimated cost of these repairs will be $275.00.

Mr. Phelan's attention was drawn to the remarks you made by telephone to Miss Walton, and another memorandum was prepared and sent to Mr. Wardle stating that whatever was required to provide suitable toilet accommodation should be done, and that if an additional stairs was required this should be built. Mention was also made of the fact that it might be necessary to provide a well.\n\nThe Purchasing Agent was also advised by telephone that the foundation of the school would be completed by the end of this week, and that the materials had not yet arrived. Your remarks re the firms from whom purchases were to be made (according to advice you received from the agent) were mentioned to the Purchasing Agent's office.\n\nWith reference to the materials for the school I believe it will be at least a week before they are shipped, as orders have not yet been placed.\n\nIf there is anything further you wish to be advised about I shall be glad to assist you in any way I can.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.R.L.

Kindly let me have your approval as early as possible.\n\nDirector.\n| Quantity | Articles                  | Weight | Price | Amount |\n|----------|---------------------------|--------|-------|--------|\n| 1        | Paint No 133              |        |       | $1.3   |\n| 1        | White Paint               |        |       | $1.8   |\n| 1        | White Paint               |        |       | $2.0   |\n| 1        | Paint                      |        |       | $3.5   |\n| 1/4      | Gal.

The system is of sufficient capacity to heat the entire building satisfactorily but requires much attention and is expensive in fuel, (Stove coil).\n\nIn mild weather the fire in the boiler still continues to burn resulting in the consumption of an unnecessary quantity of fuel. These conditions could be remedied by the installation of an electric blower for the burning of buckwheat anthracite, which equipment would consist as follows:\n\nOne 1/3 H.P. electric motor and blower of required capacity with automatic control, thermostat, completed and installed..................$145.00.\n\nOne set of cast-iron grates of the type used for the burning of all kinds of coals, installed.$80.00.\n\n(b) Eastern School, (boys).\n\nThis building is of the same dimensions and layout as the Kateri school where the same conditions prevail, as far as the heating question is concerned.\n\nThe cost of installing a blower of a similar type as that above described would also amount to.$225.00.\n\nShould there be funds available I would recommend that the alterations suggested herein be given favourable consideration.\n\nIt would appear that the above quoted report gives the information required by the Director of Indian Affairs as indicated in his memorandum to you of the 18th ultimo.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

Mr. Chene has now inspected the plants and his report is contained in Mr. Mills' memorandum, a copy of which is attached, from which it will be noted that the heating plants apparently are in fairly good condition and that he recommends in each case that an electric motor and blower be installed with the necessary grates in order that there may be a saving in fuel.\n\nDirector\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of August 15 last in connection with the cost of heating the Kateri and Eastern Schools this Branch is now in receipt of a report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch in which they recommend the installation of an electric motor and blower at each school. The estimated cost of this equipment would be $450.00. This amount cannot be provided at the present time but we would be prepared to include it in our estimates for the next fiscal year provided there would be sufficient saving to justify this expenditure.\n\nYou are aware of the cost of the fuel used in the Kateri and Eastern schools at the present time and you might consult Mr. Chene regarding the saving that would be effected by the installation of these blowers. This information should then be forwarded for my consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo in which you state that Mr. Chene considers a considerable saving could be effected by installing an electric motor and blower at the Kateri and Eastern Schools.\n\nIn addition to the cost of the blowers there would be the expense of the electricity for operating them. It is presumed that Mr. Chene has taken the latter expenditure into consideration.\n\nAbout June 1, 1939, you should again bring this matter to our attention and a definite decision will be made at that time regarding the installation of blowers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The reason for the electricity charge being so high is due to the fact that the account is for two months, when the minimum charge only was paid as the collector called to read the meter after the school hours, when it was closed. Herewith is the explanation letter from the Company.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTORONTO 2,\n\nJanuary 30th, 1939.\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nParliament Bldgs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe are enclosing herewith our cheque for $1.00 payable to the Receiver General of Canada.

The second item on their December account for the Senior School shows, under rate 105, electric stove, 144 kilowatts for a total of $3.60, when it should have read $4.02, as the employee omitted to add the .21\u00a2 monthly charge in that case, as can be seen in the back of the account.\n\nFor the same reason, on the Eastern school electricity account, he simply charged for one month's maximum of 1.4 Kw. a. at .33\u00a2 per Kw. instead of for two months as should have been done, therefrom the arrears items of .42 and .41, which are a just claim.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.

Please advise at once if you have obtained tenders, as requested. If so, these should be forwarded for our consideration. If you have no electrical firms on your list that could do this work, please let me know and the required names will be forwarded to you. As we have an enquiry from the Minister's office, I would appreciate it if you would reply before the end of the current week.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nJuly 4, 1940\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to transmit you herewith prices obtained from four different firms in connection with the repairing of the electric wiring system of the Senior School of Caughnawaga.\n\nThe prices were obtained from Mr. Edwards Beaivais of Caughnawaga, Mr. Isadie Garand of Chateauguay, Mr. Lucien Favreau of Laprairie and the B.B. Electric, 5632 Park Avenue, Montreal. The four above named are of the approved list.\n\nAlthough the tenders were requested to submit a price for the work that is absolutely necessary and a quotation on the whole work, Mr. Beaivais is the only one who made a price for part of the work. However his price for the entire job is higher than the three others.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, July 8th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing prices obtained from four different firms in connection with the repairs required to the electric wiring system at the Caughnawaga Senior School.\n\nOn reviewing your letter of May 6th it is noted that you stated that you were enclosing the report received from the Board of Examiners of Electricians for the Province of Quebec. However, this report does not appear to have been sent with your letter and, no doubt, it is still on your file. I would appreciate receiving it immediately as the prices quoted are much larger than we anticipated.\n\nDo you think it necessary to do all the work on which the four firms have quoted? We did not have all these facts before us when preparing our Estimates for the current fiscal year and, consequently, you will realize that, due to the reduction in our Appropriation, it is practically impossible to consider making such a large expenditure without first having made arrangements for it.\n\nAn immediate reply to this letter, enclosing the report of the Board of Examiners of Electricians, would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nGaiginawaga, Que.,\nJuly 10th, 1940.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant dealing with the repairs to be made to the electric system at the Caughnawaga Senior School.\n\nIn reply I beg to enclose herewith the report of the Board of Examiners of Electricians of this Province, as requested.\n\nRelative to the necessity of having all the work done I may say that according to the Examiner it should be done as the wiring system is considered unsafe. These defects were only discovered in the course of last Spring when considerable trouble was encountered quite frequently, which accounts for the fact that you could not be advised in time for the preparation of the Estimates for the current fiscal year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nPhilip Phelan Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 11, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nRe: Caughnawaga R.

Please let me know if the installation of heavy wiring to permit operation of this machine will increase the expenditure that will have to be incurred in making other repairs.\n\nIt is also noted that part of the recommendation of the Inspector reads: \"Install proper size wiring for electric iron and heater\". Are these being used in connection with handicraft work, and in this, too, I would like to know if the installation of proper sized wiring for the iron and heater increases the amount that will have to be expended?\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.

No additional expenditure is involved. With regard to the moving picture machine I wish to inform that the sisters have from time to time borrowed one from the Loyola College, where they showed educational films to the pupils of their schools. This has happened three or four times in the past three years.\n\nRelative to the electric iron I have to say that it is used in connection with handicraft work.

It would be useless to have the plaster replaced if the roof is not fixed beforehand. Mr. Robert says that he believes it would be a very small matter.\n\nMr. Garand, who is in charge of the electrical repairs at Senior School is having a plasterer come in to fix the walls at Senior School. May we use the same man while he is here? I think we will thereby avoid unnecessary expenses.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\nCopy sent to Principal\n\nOttawa,\nSeptember 20, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen I visited the Caughnawaga Reserve recently the Principal mentioned a small amount of plastering that was required at the Eastern School.

About 150 gallons of fuel oil had leaked into the ground.\n\nThe water of the well which was located near that tank became undrinkable as oil had seeped into the well. An Engineer was sent here and he instructed that the well should be pumped out from time to time stating that the oil would gradually be pumped and that the water would become normal.\n\nAt the present time there is only a slight taste of oil to the water and it is believed that very soon it will disappear.\n\nAs you are aware nobody resides at that School and besides the need of water for drinking purposes, the water from the existing well is quite suitable.\n\nAbout 15 gallons of water are needed daily for the pupils and the domestic science class, which is supplied by the janitors every day from the Kateri School which is located about 200 feet from the Senior School.\n\nHowever I have to inform that since the appointment of the new Superior several requests have been received in which she is insisting that a new well be bored, although it was explained that in view of the small quantity of water required for drinking purposes and the near possibility of utilizing the existing well as before, it would hardly be fair to incur the expenses of a new well, which would be considerable if an estimate is based on the cost of the drilling of the present one, which I understand cost over $800.00.\n\nWill you\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWill you kindly let me know if the Department will consider the drilling of a new well so that the new Superior be advised accordingly. At all events I would appreciate receiving a definite answer in order that this matter be closed.\n\nYours very truly\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nOctober 30, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant with reference to the well at the Caughnawaga Senior School.\n\nIt is noted that sufficient water for present requirements can be easily obtained from the Kateri School and that you expect that the water in the present well at the Senior School can soon be used. Under these circumstances the Department is not prepared to incur the expenditure that would be necessary to dig a new well.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.

I know that you will realize that it would be impossible for us to control expenditures if school principals proceeded with work without first obtaining authority.

It was absolutely necessary that Mr. George had to go to the other department to get water, so understanding the limited funds now available, I took it upon our own expenses of having...\nthe basin put in, to spare labor\nand to hasten the work of the\nCleaning Department. I expected\nit to be sent to me but I see\nthere must have been a mis-\nunderstanding somewhere.\nYou will find enclosed a\ncheck in payment for same.\nTo this day, I well remember\ninvolving the Department with\nissues without being appro-\npriately authorized to do so.\nVery sorry to have caused\nthis un-called-for expense.\n\nI am\nMost sincerely yours,\n\nS.M. Jean de Dieu,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nDecember 6, 1940.\n\nWITH CHEQUE\n\nDear Sister Jean de Dieu:\n\nI have your recent letter and am returning the cheque which you forwarded.\n\nI feel certain that if you review my last letter you will realize that expenditures must be authorized before being incurred. We are passing through very critical times and the amount of money at our disposal is limited and the only manner in which we can control expenditure is to insist on authorization being secured before expenditures are made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDecember 10, 1940.\n\nMemorandum: The Director\nSurveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nFollowing a recent inspection of the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve by the Assistant Medical Officer of this department it was reported that the water from the well at the Day School had an oily taste, and was not being used for drinking or cooking purposes in the domestic science class.\n\nThe cause of the oil in the water is said to be due to the fact that about 150 gallons of oil leaked into the ground in 1936 when the tank containing the fuel oil for the school was found to be leaking, and had to be replaced.\n\nNo one resides in the school and the water is required for drinking purposes during school hours only. The matter was first reported to the department in October by the Indian Agent, who stated, however, that it was expected that the oil in the water would soon disappear and the well be used again. He was instructed to obtain water for the Day School from the Kateri School, where the well contained good water.\n\nAccording to the Assistant Medical Officer's report, however, the drinking water is being drawn from the river. At the time that the artesian wells on the Caughnawaga Reserve were put down it was ascertained that the water from the river was not safe for drinking or domestic purposes. It is our intention to instruct the Indians Agent to see that the water used for drinking and in the domestic science class is taken from the well at the Kateri School, but I should like to know whether or not the well at the Day School is likely to improve or whether the oily substance in the water will continue for some time. If it was likely to disappear it would seem that it should have done so by now.\n\nFor your further information I would say that the tank containing the fuel oil which leaked into the ground was located close to the well in question.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The children appeared clean and healthy. The Sister in charge complained of an oil taste to the water. It was necessary to draw the drinking water from the river. Apparently oil had seeped through the ground from the oil burner tank and contaminated the water. While the water was not fit for cooking and drinking, it was used for other purposes. The cost of digging a new well and the piping would be considerable, and it was thought that as later this well might improve it would not be advisable to recommend any changes.\n\nW. L.

We are unable to offer any estimate of the length of time it would take to clear up the situation either with or without pumping.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Well at day school,\nCaughnawaga Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply to your memorandum of December 10th relative to the above, I am enclosing for your information a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills dated December 17th.\n\nI may say that Mr. G.H. Ferguson, Chief, Public Health and Engineering Division, Department of Pensions and National Health, was consulted on this matter but he could not suggest any remedy other than pumping. It would appear, therefore, that frequent pumping is the only remedy and that considerable time may elapse before traces of oil can no longer be detected. It is suggested that the well should be pumped out completely as frequently as it fills.\n\nDirector.\nT\u00e9l\u00e9phone 63-J\n\nCHATEAUGUAY BASSIN, D\u00e9cembre 1946\n\nM.
