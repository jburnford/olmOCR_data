Coudert, O.M.I., of White Horse, in which he urges that the teachers' salaries as well as the rent for the school buildings, at Burwash Landing, Teslin, Dease Lake and Klappan, be paid as soon as possible.\n\nHe has forwarded the T.D. 1A Tax Deduction Exemption Claim, duly signed by each school teacher and invoices covering the rent of each building.\n\nOne of his missionaries, the Reverend Father Carpentier, of Telegraph Creek, had to spend almost $1900.00 in relief for the Indians of his district and it is principally for this purpose that the Bishop urges that these bills be taken care of immediately, so that he will be in a position to reimburse this relief money. Reverend Father Carpentier bought these relief supplies from the Hudson's Bay Stores at Telegraph Creek and Dease Lake and the Bishop is anxious to pay the Company as soon as possible. Your early attention to this matter will certainly please the Bishop very much and will be of great help to him.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\nP.O.B.95\nWhitehorse,Y.T.\n\nJanuary 19,1946\n\nPhilip Phelan,Chief\nTraining Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr.Phelan;\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication of January 16,and call your attention to the following explanations:\n\n1.- Re Salary of our School Teachers.-In my letter of January 7 to Father O.PLourde I did not make any claim about the salary of our school teachers.-I am satisfied with the mode of payment the Branch has adopted lately,viz.,to pay our teachers through my office through a cheque made out directly payable to them.I perfectly well understand that such a cheque should not be issued unless the Branch has previously received the requested reports on the work for which they are to be paid.-Actually I have no complaint on the part of any of our teachers,and I think that all have received the cheques corresponding to their work of last summer.\n\n2.-Re Rent of our Mission Houses for School purposes and payment of other Services around such Schools.-The Bills I sent you through Father Plourde on January 2nd referred to the Rent of our Mission Buildings,belonging to our Corporation and which are being used for School purposes by the Branch;they also refer to some other services as wood cutting and janitor's services to the same schools;I consider those services as an extra imposition on our missionaries.By special agreement with said missionaries,it was decided that I would collect that money personally,for the benefit of the whole Corporation.This is the reason why I sent you aforesaid bills.\n\nIf you remember we discussed that matter together last May,and I was instructed through Father Plourde to send in at the end of the year our bills for both Rent of our School Buildings and Other Outside Services to said Schools(besides the regular salary,of course).-In the making of said Bills I followed exactly the Model Forms suggested to me,and the amount mentioned was also the amount I was promised at the time.\n\n3.- Correction of said Bills.-I admit,however,that I made some mistakes in the making of those bills,owing to the lack of proper informations.Several of our missionaires being actually here in Whitehorse for their annual retreat,I was able with their help to correct some of said mistakes;your own notes have proved also very valuable to me.\n\nRe Burwash Landing; Father E.Morisset has taught at Burwash Landing January,February,April,June and July;he has also taught in October,November and December;you will receive shortly the School Reports for these last three months;they have been duly sent in,at the end of December,to the Acting Agent in Dawson.\n\nTherefore:The Rent for said School and other Services rendered should cover eight months,instead of six,as in my previous report.\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\nRe: Dease Lake.\u2014Father Cl. Carpentier has taught in Dease Lake up to Feb. 16 of last year, and therefore, occupied our buildings for School purposes and used them up to that date. However, as the School was not approved for a period extending beyond January 31st, Father Carpentier thought it useless to send a report for the two extra weeks he taught.\n\nSimilarly last Fall, Father Cl. Carpentier went to Dease Lake for the purpose of conducting the School; he stayed there from the beginning of October to the middle of November; some four children attended the school, the other Indians having gone down to the Alaska Highway last summer and having failed to come back for the winter. I instructed Father Carpentier to send in a report of the time he had taught to those four children, since he had gone purposely to Dease Lake to conduct school, but he has been reluctant to do so under the circumstances, and I doubt whether he will turn in any report for such a short period of teaching and for so few pupils.\n\nYet our buildings were used just the same during the stated periods for school purposes, and I think that it would be only fair that we receive at least the money covering the rent and other extra services, which were practically the same for four children as they would have been for twenty.\n\nTherefore I still maintain my previous claim for three months of rent at Dease Lake and other additional services (fuel and janitor's work) for the Year 1945.\n\nRe: Klappan.\u2014Regarding my previous report for the Rent of the Building and other services for the Klappan School, I got somewhat confused over the months during which our buildings were occupied for that purpose, on account of the interruption caused last winter by Father Tanguay's sad accident. I applied for a rent of four months (as it should have been normally), while, actually, it appears from your school reports that our buildings were occupied there only three months, viz. from January 25 to March 9, and from April 1st to May 15.\n\nTherefore; the Rent for our school buildings and other services at Klappan School should cover only three months.\n\nRe: Liard Post.\u2014I also made a mistake of half a month for August, not being aware that Father Forget was unable to teach the last half month of the term for lack of pupils who had all gone back to the woods.\n\nTherefore; the Rent for our School Buildings and other services at Liard Post should cover two months and a half, viz June, July and half of August, instead of three months.\n\nRe: Teslin Lake.\u2014My previous report was correct. (Rent for three months, viz June, July and August).\n\nAs you will notice from this corrected report, it practically correspond to the report I had previously sent to you; I had forgotten two months for\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\nBurwash, and I had charged you one month and a half too much for Klappan and Liard Post, or even two months (if the Branch refuses to consider my claim for the extra time taught at Dease Lake). All in all it corresponds sensibly to the bills I submitted, and I would have been perfectly satisfied if you had settled it at once the way I had it.\n\nHoping that the above detailed explanations will prove satisfactory I remain,\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours sincerely in Christ\n\nJ.L. Coudert O.M.I.\n\nP.S.- I am forwarding copy of this communication to Father O. Plourde. He will provide you with the corrected Bills, if new Bills are necessary.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Feb. 6 | To Rent of Building used for Burwash Landing School for January, February, April, June, July, October, November and December, 1945 - 8 months at $35.00 a month | $280.00 |\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

I shall be glad if you will take this matter up with Father Morrisset and, after having done so, advise whether you wish the allocation of the buildings, which are apparently surplus to the requirements of the Highway organization at this time. Should you wish the buildings for departmental purposes, I shall arrange to have them declared surplus and advise War Assets that they are required by your Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.H.

Rowley\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, May 13, 1946.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nI attach, for your information a letter which has just been received and which explains itself. Please let me know if the building that Father Morisset has requested is at a new place or if it is at one of the places where authority has already been given for the operation of a seasonal school.\n\nWhile I have no doubt that Father Morisset is acting under your instructions, I might point out that it would be much more satisfactory to us if all such communications were handled through your office instead of by individual Missionaries.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nRight Reverend J.

I admit, however, that our present purpose is mainly concerned with the religious and moral uplift of those Indians, who have been sadly neglected in the past. Some had some affiliation with the Church of England in the past; others still belong to the Russian Church, and a few still adhere to their native belief.\n\n3.- If, therefore, the Branch cannot see its way clear to have the requested building released to our Mission free of charge for our purpose, kindly instruct Mr.L.H.Phinney, the Acting Special Commissioner, to take this matter up with the Sales Department of the War Asset Commission, 309 Taylor Bldg., Edmonton, Alta., where the Camp referred to, at Mile Post 937, is located.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 934-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\n937 is officially acknowledged as abandoned. I think that with a word of recommendation on your part and that of Mr. L.H.

Coudert O.M.I., Bishop of Rhodiapolis\nVicar Apostolic of Whitehorse\nOttawa, May 30, 1946.\n\nRe: Alaska Highway Abandoned Camps.\n\nDear Mr. Phinney:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of May 7, in connection with the above, this Department communicated with Right Reverend J. L. Coudert, O.M.I., Vicar Apostolic of Whitehorse, and I have just received his reply.\n\nBishop Coudert would appreciate receiving, free of charge, the allocation of a building from the abandoned camp at Mile Post 937 on the Alaska Highway for the purpose of using it at Mile Post 985. The building would be used by Bishop Coudert for the welfare of the Indians in that vicinity and, consequently, if transfer free of charge can be arranged, it would meet with this Department's approval.\n\nHowever, if it is not possible to transfer it free of charge, I would appreciate it if you would recommend to the Sales Department of the War Assets Corporation, 309 Tegler Building, Edmonton, Alberta, that the building be sold to Bishop Coudert at a reasonable cost, in view of the welfare purpose for which it will be used.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.

Coudert, Vicar Apostolic of Whitehorse. Bishop Coudert wishes to move this building to Mile 935 and use it as a welfare station in his Indian work.\n\n2. If you are prepared to release this building will you kindly say so and I shall then recommend a quick sale by War Assets Corporation.\n\n3. Bishop Coudert is in Whitehorse.\n\n4.

The Indians on the Mayo reserve are unfortunately not maintaining the improvement noted last year, the Rev. John Martin, native clergyman, who was stationed on this reserve and who contributed to any improvement in the living of these Indians, died during the month of March, and they have drifted back into their lazy and shiftless way again. A day school is conducted here and the pupils appear to be making good progress.\n\nG. Binning, A/Supt.\nExtract from Superintendent Binning's annual report for year 1937-38:\n\nMAYO\n\nA day school is conducted on the reserve by Miss Mary Martin, a native graduate of the Carcross Indian Residential School. The attendance is fair and the pupils appear to be making good progress. I have been informed by the Bishop of the Yukon that he has made arrangements with the Department whereby this school will be recognized by the Department for payment of the teacher but so far I have had no instructions in this regard from the Department.\n\n(Sgd.) G. Binning,\nA/Supt.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nDAY SCHOOL RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Mayo Village day School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1937.\n\nTeacher: Mary Martin\nP.O. Address: Mayo, Ontario\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the Instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Dawson J.J.\nthis March 15th, 1938\n\nAgents should see that full explanations are given by the teacher in the column for \"Remarks,\" if the school was closed during the quarter for other than authorized holidays, and should also themselves make any necessary comments in that column.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO TEACHERS\n\n1. Fill up all the columns in this Return.\n2. All the columns of the Return must be added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n3. Number and date of holidays to be inserted in the column for remarks.\n4. By the total number of school days in the quarter is meant the number of days in the quarter exclusive of Saturdays and Sundays. All authorized holidays will be allowed.\n5. The standing of each pupil must be signified by inserting opposite his or her name the figure 1 in the column designating the particular grade.\n6. No names other than those of Indian children are to be included in this return.\n7. The Quarterly Returns must end on the 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December respectively, and be immediately thereafter in each case transmitted to the local Indian Agent.\n8. When, owing to the number of pupils, the form of Return is not long enough to contain all the names, use another form, paging it as No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns. Do not increase the length of the form by pasting another, or portion of one, to it.\n9. The average daily attendance during the quarter may be ascertained by dividing the total number of days attendance of all the pupils by the number of days school was open in the quarter.\n10. Should the school be closed at any time during the quarter, the reason must be given in the column for remarks for such day or days.\n11. The school must be opened and closed punctually at the hours approved of by the Department.\n12. This form to be used for Day Schools only.\n\nForm No. 469\n### Quarterly School Return\n\n**Report of the Indian Days School**\n\n**School Reserve for Quarter ended December 31st, 1937**\n\n| Names of Pupils | Age | Boy | Girl | Band |\n|-----------------|-----|-----|------|------|\n| Mary Peter      | 15  |     | Mayo |      |\n| Alice Moore     | 10  |     |      |      |\n| Flora           | 8   |     |      |      |\n| Johnson Peter   | 8   |     |      |      |\n| David           | 7   |     |      |      |\n| Annie Lucas     | 13  |     |      |      |\n| Jimmy           | 9   |     |      |      |\n| Peter Hager     | 12  |     |      |      |\n| John            | 7   |     |      |      |\n| Peter Lucas     | 9   |     |      |      |\n| Sarah Davis     | 17  |     |      |      |\n| Jimmy           | 16  |     |      |      |\n| Jennie Malcolm  | 18  |     |      |      |\n| Sophie          | 12  |     |      |      |\n| Mary            | 9   |     |      |      |\n\n**Class of Study**\n\n| Grade | Very Good | Good | Fair | Bad | Conduct |\n|-------|-----------|------|------|-----|---------|\n|       | 1         | 2    | 3    | 4   | 5       |\n\n**Attendance**\n\n| Days Present | Days Absent |\n|--------------|-------------|\n|              |             |\n\n**Remarks as to Progress, etc.**\n\n- During the Month of October A 3rd 26 school has been held for 34 days and for 5 pupils.\n- A 3rd 1 for 3 weeks, and increased 50% on the 18th.\n- And during the Month of Nov.

I shall summarize your questions and give the answers I have obtained as follows:\n\n1. Unemployment Insurance Book: Teachers do not contribute. You should keep the book in case you change your employment.\n\n2. House Furnishings for Teachers: The Branch supplies all the reasonable requirements. You should send the Agent a list of what you require indicating what is available in local stores. He will nominate the dealer and arrange the purchase, forwarding the bills and vouchers to Ottawa for payment. For the time being please limit your requirements for kitchenware to whatever is necessary to serve meals to yourself and one guest.\n\n3. Fuel and Light: The Department supplies these subject to arrangements by the Agent who will probably wish to buy wood from the Indians. Fuel for lamps is to be ordered from the local dealer and vouchered by the Agent in the usual manner.\n4. Cost of Transportation: The Department makes no allowance to teachers and I know of no reduction fare. As a special concession to you, you will draw your salary from the date you left Whitehorse direct for Mayo. Your actual teaching duties will, accordingly, be rather light for the first few weeks.\n\n5. Adapting the Church to School Purposes: Reverend Mr. Wareham will indicate what the Church will allow. You should ask local tradesmen to give estimates and air mail these to the Agent who will order the work done and forward the bills and vouchers to Ottawa. Twenty-four new desks have been ordered which, with the Church benches, will rather crowd the accommodation. For the present please, keep the changes to the Church to a minimum as the Curriculum for the next year or two will be of such an elementary nature that it should be possible to carry on in a make-shift classroom.\n\n6. Tables and Cupboards to be Constructed Locally: The action which you have taken can somehow be squared with the procedure indicated in number five. These articles with the teacher's desk and chair which have been ordered will almost make it necessary to remove most of the church furniture while school is in session.\n\n7. Dispensary: On this subject, the Director of Indian Health Services is to correspond with the Agent.\n\n8. Welfare Work: The Chief of the Welfare Division is to correspond with the Agent on this subject.\n\n9. Janitor: We have found that the most satisfactory arrangement is to make an allowance for the janitor work, the money for which is paid upon receipt of a voucher. Actually, the money is paid to the teacher to be distributed at her discretion in quarters and half dollars to those who do the chores ordinarily assigned to a janitor. I think that it is a worthwhile educational activity to have the pupils participate in cleaning up and attending to the school with perhaps, token wages for such work as kindling the fire in the mornings, as this activity requires someone to make an early appearance. As the money allowed for the janitor is usually only about $10.00 a month, it will save paper work to claim for it quarterly.\n\nI am sending you copies of the list of articles, books, etc., which have already been ordered sent to Mayo or which the Agent has been authorized to purchase.\nDo you mind if I say that I suspect that your poor opinion of the fertility of the soil may, in part, be inspired by the remarks of some Indians who dislike the idea of working the ground. Reverend J. Martin, as Constable Ivor Mast, R.C.M.P. will tell you, made considerable progress with vegetables and might have transformed much of the Reserve if a flood and his fatal illness has not intervened. If gardening is handled as a school subject related to language and arithmetic, the attitude of the younger Indians might be changed.\n\nIf it is any comfort to you, may I say that the Indians on the hills surrounding the garden city of San Diego, California are in an even worse condition than some of our Yukon bands. In a former era with the leadership of the Mission, they had a prosperous agricultural economy. Now they lack leadership and vegetables.\n\nPlease give my regards to the Warehams and be assured that we appreciate, in part, at least, the efforts required to do successful church and school work in places like those where you live.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nC.A.F.

In many cases, the stocks are meagre and there is little variety in the items offered.\n\nTo overcome this situation and as a measure of assistance to the teachers, arrangements have been made with the Hudson's Bay Company to have requisitions for rations filled at Edmonton and shipped directly to the individual teacher.\n\nThe Nutrition Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare has prepared a ration list of the items required for one person living for one year in the North. We have secured approximate prices as quoted by the Hudson's Bay Company in Edmonton. Attached is this list, with the prices, of course, being subject to variation.\n\nOn the basis of this list the teacher may then prepare an order and forward same to this office. We will then place the order with a wholesale grocery firm in Edmonton and the items will be shipped by water transportation. The cost at wholesale price of the rations purchased in this manner on behalf of the teacher, together with transportation charges on same will be deducted on a monthly basis from the living allowance paid to northern employees of the Department. The maximum that can be deducted from the Northern Living Allowance is $7.4 a month (i.e.) $350.00 for Day School Teachers and $26.00 from Welfare Teachers.

It will be difficult to obtain approval for the appointment of Miss Connor, in view of the fact that she has no teaching qualifications whatsoever, nor has she any teaching experience in schools in Canada or in Eire. It is also noted that she is not a Canadian citizen.\n\nI have had a letter from Miss Joan Adams of Kelowna, B.C. from England, stating that she would shortly be returning to Canada and was interested in a vacancy in the Northwest Territories or the Yukon. You will recall her as a former teacher at the Teslin Joint School.\n\nI have two or three other applicants also, about whom I will write to you when I have complete details of their teaching records and experience.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\ncc Superintendent R.J. Meek\nJune 27, 1950\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nYour letter of June 17th re Mayo School has not yet reached me. I've been travelling in North America, so I'm unable to reply.\n\nI do not really think that you need have any fears that Miss Connor will not be an efficient and effective teacher. She is only 2 children who were too high as Grade IV last year. She comes with the highest possible recommendation. She has both ability and character, and her two or three years at College in Toronto have brought her into contact with University Pedagogic experts; she has taken the theoretical side of teaching, while she has had practical experience, more than any one who has just finished normal. I am ready to stake my reputation on her.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6478, file 935-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nreputation for sanity (if I have any) that she will not let\nthe departmental side of the work down; and will enlist the\nfull cooperation of the children. So I ask you to give her\na trial, and I will withdraw her if she does not make\ngood. She is very highly spoken of by those who have come\nin contact with her in Toronto\u2014two have added a postscript\nto letters on other subjects, congratulating me that she was\ncoming to Sutton.\n\nMrs. Lucy is going to do splendidly. I have a\nsensible competent nurse of very pleasing personality,\nshe will surely rise to meet every occasion. She goes to\nOld Crow next week. We shall go on a visit next\nafter Christmas.

Before we can have the account passed for payment it will be necessary to attach receipts from Julius and Helen Hagar who apparently did the janitor work at the request of the teacher.\n\nI suggest that you simply issue a voucher for janitor services in favor of the teacher and make no mention of the other two persons on it. It is common practice for us to pay the amount we allow for janitor services to the teacher and she recompenses whoever she employs to do the work.\n\nA separate voucher should be forwarded for the first three items on the voucher that we are returning to you.

Telegram dated June 4th, 1947, from Col. B.F. Neary authorized payment of 30 dollars per month for church house and Anglican church at Mayo Indian Village (used as a school). On September 17th, 1947, I submitted voucher No. 301 for $30.00, being rental of Church of England buildings at Mayo Village, for the month of August, 1947, and made payable to The Diocese of Yukon, c/o Bank of Commerce, Dawson, Y.T.\n\nI am sorry to admit that I unfortunately overlooked submitting further vouchers for rental for these buildings. This omission was brought to my attention by Archbishop R.M. Adams in a conversation yesterday. His Grace is now the Bishop of the Yukon, and will be residing in the Territory in future.\n\nAs this unfortunate omission extends beyond the present fiscal year, I am rather at a loss as to what procedure to follow. May I be advised as to payment of rental during the 1947-48 fiscal year please.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nIndian Agent.\nJune 4, 1948.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Whitehorse, Y.T.\n\nWe have your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to rental of building used for school purposes at Mayo.\n\nPlease forward a voucher for the months for which rent has not previously been paid.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nRe Mayo Landing Indian Day School. During a recent visit to Mayo an inspection of the school was carried out and has already been reported to you. A much larger enrollment than was anticipated has crowded existing accommodation to such an extent that efficiency and comfort are being impaired.\n\nA meeting of the adults of the village was held on May 19th, and the question of a new school was brought forward. The present building housing the school is the Church of England building, which, with a minimum of alteration, has been adapted for use as a schoolroom. It is not suitable. We are paying the Diocese of the Yukon a rental of $30.00 per teaching month for the use of the church, and also the teacherage. The latter building has been repaired and altered, it is very suitable for present requirements.\n\nFigures for initial work on a new school measuring 40' x 30' are as follows: with a ceiling of 9', about 120 logs needed, these can be obtained upriver from Mayo; a team of horses could be hired with harness and equipment for $5.00 per day, to haul logs to water, and again at Mayo, out of the water to the proposed site; six days hire, $30.00; four men could easily cut the required logs and place them on the site in 7 days, at the rate of $1.00 per hour 8 hours a day, total $224.00; charter of gas boat for one day $25.00 gasoline $15.00; cost of digging cellar 10' x 15', 8' deep, $50.00. Total: $344.00. This would simply mean the bare walls and roof poles, all interior work would be extra.\n\nAn appropriation of $350.00 for building exterior of new school would be well advised. Fortunately there is a sawmill at Mayo and building lumber could easily be obtained for all ordinary purposes.\n\n(R.J.

The Treasury Branch would not pass this account without receiving a receipt from these two persons.\n\nWe are prepared to allow $10. a month for janitor services at this school and the voucher should be issued in favour of the teacher. We feel that we can rely on the teacher to expend the amount for this purpose.

Unfortunately the lumber mills at Mayo shut down for the winter and no information could be obtained until quite recently.\n\nThe Mayo Lumber Co. is in a position to supply rough green lumber at $90.00 per M. They do not recommend the use of this lumber for a permanent building as it is neither kiln nor air dried.\n\nFor a satisfactory job of the proposed school building, it is recommended that all lumber come from Outside. I would suggest that one of the Vancouver lumber mills be the best source of supply. There is no lumber dealer in Whitehorse at the present time.\n\nI regret the delay in replying to your letter, but until very recently no authoritative person at Mayo could be interviewed.\n\n(R.J.

It is desired to reserve the church building for religious purposes.\n\nThe teacher will continue to live in the present residence, and so it is not presently necessary to build a teacherage.\n\nIt is proposed to build a log building for a classroom. A plan for this building was drawn up, but it would be well to compare this with plans for the completed buildings at Alexis or Nordegg before making a final decision as to plan and specifications.\n\nThe logs have been obtained, but their number and measurements should be verified to ensure that they will be adequate for the plan adopted. To secure a building of adequate length, \"splicing\" of logs may be necessary, i.e., logs of 24 ft. in length may have to have a twelve-foot piece added to them. This process does not affect the strength of the walls.\n\nYou will recall that funds to get out the logs had to be obtained by transfer as nothing had at that time been voted. I do not recall seeing an item in the estimates for building this school during 1949-1950. I note, however, that building materials have been ordered at Vancouver as follows:\n\nPurchase Order No. 13940G $749.05\n\" 13942G 627.80\n\nAs the logs cost over $400, and no work can be done now until spring (well after April 1st, 1950) it will be necessary to re-vote additional funds to complete this project. Just how much money should be voted will depend upon the plan which Mr. Gooderham recommends.\n\nIt is intended to employ Indians with an Indian (\"Charlie\") as foreman. The teacher, Miss Dougall, may be able to do the paper work and accounting.\n\nAs at Roseau River, Man., this area may sometimes flood. The school should be higher off the ground.\n\nC.A.F.

Miss S.A. Dougall, teacher, advises that the basement measuring 30 x 40, and six feet deep, has been dug. All logs have been cut, ready for construction. Logs designed for the basement have been milled on three sides, which is the custom in this part of the country.\n\nRobert Campbell of Whitehorse, shipped 500 b.f. spruce lumber to Mayo during September. Unfortunately, lumber and Donnacona from Reliance Lumber Co., Vancouver, did not reach Whitehorse until after the close of navigation, and consequently all this material is in the freight sheds at Whitehorse. Spring navigation should open about the last week in May, 1950.\n\nI advised Miss Dougall that our appropriation for the present fiscal year had been exhausted. The Indians of the Mayo Band are not primarily trappers, and are available for construction work until the opening of navigation in late May. May I be advised as early as possible after the beginning of the 1950 - 51 Fiscal Year, if money is available for construction to proceed on the Mayo Day School?\n\n(R.J.

No one who has inspected the building now used could doubt for a moment that it is quite inadequate and that the erection of a new building is an urgent and immediate necessity in order even to meet present demands. But these demands will increase and if the work of Indian Education in the Yukon committed by the Dominion Government to the Church of England is to be carried on with any degree of efficiency and success one thoroughly equipped central school giving some industrial training would seem to be a manifest necessity.\n\nWith the present building and the present grant this would be an impossibility, we therefore felt that we had strong ground for requesting the erection of a satisfactory building and such increase of the Annual Grant as might be necessary.\nnecessary to meet the increased annual expenditure involved.\n\nI beg to enclose a photograph of the building in which the school is being carried on and in which two teachers and I think sixteen children reside. I have also asked Rev. John Hawksley the Missionary having charge of this school to write you regarding the need of a new building.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you as soon as conveniently possible regarding these two requests. You will remember that Bishop Stringer asked that you would kindly communicate with me upon the subjects then discussed.\n\nI remain, dear sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd A.E.O'Meara.\nOttawa, April 16, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nRev. Mr. O'Meara, of Conrad, Yukon District, has written the Department asking for the erection and equipment of an adequate school at Carcross. He refers to an interview that he and Bishop Stringer had with you last fall on this subject.\n\nMr. O'Meara asks that a representative of the Government be appointed to investigate and report on school matters in the Yukon, and I would suggest that an officer be appointed for this purpose and a full report obtained so that the question could be intelligently dealt with.\n\nMr. Bragg, of Dawson, is Superintendent of schools for the Yukon Territory and has visited the Indian schools and would be able to report, should you select him for this purpose. Mr. Lithgow, Acting Commissioner, has also had a good deal to do with the Indian schools. Either of these gentlemen might be asked to furnish the necessary report, unless you have some other officer in view.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\nMr. Benson\n\nDr. Pedley says\nto let it be\ndecided at Dawson\n& to write fully\n\nHOD\nOttawa, April 23, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Rev. Mr. O'Meara, of Conrad, Yukon Territory, has written the Department, asking for the erection and equipment of an adequate boarding school at Carcross, and Bishop Stringer and he ask that a representative of the Government be appointed to investigate and report on school matters in the Yukon.\n\nThe Department would be obliged if you would take the Indian school question up with Mr. Bragg, Superintendent of schools for the Yukon Territory, who visits the Indian schools there, and furnish a joint report as to what you consider best to be done in the interests of Indian education there. If you are in favour of the Department's erecting a new boarding school at any particular point, it would like to be furnished with an approximate estimate of the cost of a suitable building for this purpose.\n\nThe question of the per capita allowance to be made to such a school would also need to be dealt with.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

Sirs,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ult., relative to Indian schools in the Yukon Territory and applying for the erection and equipment of an adequate boarding school at Carcross; and in reply I beg to say that, as suggested by you, the Department is taking steps to have an investigation and report on the whole school question there and on receipt of the same your application will be considered.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. E. O'Meara,\nConrad,\nYukon Territory.\nOttawa, June 17, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nOn April 25, last, Mr. Lithgow, Acting Commissioner, of Dawson, was asked to take up the school question in the Yukon with Mr. Bragg, Superintendent of Schools for that territory. Mr. Lithgow now incloses a report from Mr. Bragg, who has just concluded an inspection of all the Indian schools there.\n\nFrom Mr. Bragg's report it would appear that very little can be done to improve the condition of these Indians by education at present. Mr. Lithgow states that he thinks the money would be much better expended if arrangements could be made to move the whole Indian population back on a reserve near the Peel Indians or somewhere in that country than in attempting to educate them, as their present locations, which are in the proximity of mining and trading towns inhabited by white men, seem to work always to the degradation of the Indians, and the Indians living in the valley of the Yukon are getting to depend more and more on the Government for supplies and assistance, while the Peel Indians are comparatively self-supporting.\n\nThere is one school, however, the Carcross Boarding School, which is doing good work, but the building is quite inadequate to the demands made upon it and applications for admission have to be refused on account of lack of space. This is the school for which Bishop Stringer asked assistance in erecting and equipping an adequate building and, judging by the Inspector's report, the Department would be quite justified in expending a sum of money for this purpose in that one locality.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWith reference to Bishop Stringer's request for assistance in erecting and equipping an adequate building for school purposes at Carcross, it is observed that Acting Commissioner Lithgow was requested by letter of 23rd April last to furnish an estimate of the cost of such a building through Mr. Bragg, Supt. of Schools in the Yukon Territory, but this estimate has not been furnished by Mr. Bragg in his report recently received through the Acting Commissioner; and it would be well to have this before it can be decided whether funds voted for Schools in the Yukon will be sufficient to grant the aid asked if it is decided to give it.\n\n$5000.00 are voted for Schools in the Yukon and of this $3000.00 is paid to the Bishop annually as a grant leaving $2000.00 available for other school purposes.\n\nActing Accountant.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIt is represented that the Indian School at Carcross, Yukon, under the management of the Church of England, is having a hard struggle to maintain existence. The Church wants an Indian Agent appointed with authority to improve Carcross school and make it a boarding school and arrange to have it conducted as a boarding and technical school under the control of the Anglican Church in the Yukon.\n\nIt is represented that the Anglican Church is the only one interested in Indian education in the Yukon.\n\nKindly go into this matter and submit a report with proposals for improvement of the school and increased assistance.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 30, 1907.\n\nSirs\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ult., inclosing the report of Mr. T. G. Bragg, Superintendent of Schools for the Yukon Territory, on the Indian schools in that district.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if you will be good enough to obtain for the Department an estimate of the cost of erecting a suitable boarding school building at Carcross, the question of granting funds for this purpose will receive consideration.\n\nIn accordance with your request a cheque for $279.85 in payment of Mr. Bragg's expenses has been sent you.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

E. O'Keefe\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith quarterly returns from the Moosehide and Carcross Indian schools, the returns from the latter having been just now received.\n\nRegarding the proposed Industrial School to be erected by the Government at Carcross, I believe that Acting Commissioner Lithgow wrote you some time ago to the effect that careful inquiries would be made and a report forwarded to you dealing explicitly with this matter. I had hoped that we would be in a position to report definitely on the proposition long before this, but I have not yet been able to secure detailed information for which I asked, and do not care to deal with the matter in a haphazard way. I am still waiting for information on which something like reliable estimates may be made and shall report to you as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nJ.G. Brearley\nSuperintendent of Schools.\nRegarding the proposed Industrial School at Carcross, for which a grant is sought for new buildings, I beg to state that I made as complete a report as possible on this matter to the Commissioner of this Territory on December 14th, requesting him to forward it to your Department. When it reaches you, I would beg to suggest that your review in connection with it, my Annual report of last May to your Department, dealing with the Yukon Indian Schools generally, on which report my further suggestions and recommendations are, to some extent, based.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.C. Bragg,\nSupt. of Schools.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecy. Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nConrad, Yukon,\n28th January, 1908.\n\nFile No. 297287\n\nThe Hon. the Minister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Yukon Indian Schools. In pursuance of the interview had with you by Bishop Stringer and myself in the Fall of 1906, the Secretary of your Department on 27th April last wrote me that on receipt of a report which had been asked for, our application for the building and equipment of a new central boarding school would be considered.\n\nIn the course of the interview I had with you in November last you were, however, inclined to think it necessary to defer dealing with this matter until after some questions affecting Indian Schools in other parts of Canada had been settled. Subsequently I secured full information of these questions from both the Deputy Superintendent and the Secretary of our missionary Society, and I confidently submit to you that no one of these really affects the Yukon, and that the more fully you inquire into the conditions relating to Indian Education in the Territory the more clearly will it appear both possible and necessary to deal with the matter separately and upon its own merits.\n\nAlthough a copy of Mr. Bragg's report has not yet reached me from the Department, I have seen it as published in the Dawson News. It is scarcely necessary to point out how strongly that report supports our request in every material respect. You will allow me to emphasize one point of the report, namely that Mr. Bragg, knowing both the need and its immediate urgency, recommends that the matter be dealt with as speedily as possible.\n\nRegarding the amount of appropriation required for the\nbuilding and equipment, I beg to refer to my memorandum handed you. It does not clearly appear whether Mr. Fragg includes a Principal's residence in his estimate of $5000. However this may be, we trust you will recommend the full amount of $10,000 as set out in memorandum or at least $7,500. It is of course understood that the actual expenditure would be based upon detailed plans and estimates approved by the Department.\n\nSimilarly regarding equipment maintenance, it would be satisfactory if the amount of appropriated in past years namely $5000 were again appropriated, and if the actual grant were subsequently determined. If new buildings were erected during the coming Summer, an increased rate of grant would be required from about the 1st September.\n\nThe necessity of pushing forward this work is great. The limit of accommodation has long ago been reached. We are constantly compelled to refuse applications. We most earnestly request that at the present Session of Parliament you will secure the appropriation necessary for erecting new buildings during the coming summer, so that we shall be in a position to assure the Indians that their children can be received during next Fall.\n\nThe question of continuing Day Schools which is raised by Mr. Fragg I do not think it necessary at present to discuss.\n\nI remain Dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose you herewith a copy of a report by Mr. T. G. Bragg, Superintendent of Education for the Yukon Territory, concerning the proposed Industrial School for Indians at Carcross. In this report you will notice the following paragraph:\n\n\"I feel convinced that such a boarding school is the only satisfactory means of dealing with Indian education in the Yukon Territory, that the ordinary day schools are practically useless and the energy and money expended in maintaining them are comparatively barren of results.\"\n\nWith respect to this paragraph I might point out that Bishop Stringer does not agree with the opinion therein expressed by Mr. Bragg. I do not think that there is anything else in the report to which the Bishop takes exception.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nCommissioner.\nOFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION.\n\nLawson, Y.T., 14th December, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit for your consideration the following report concerning the proposed Industrial School for Indians at Carcross.\n\nIn my report to the Department of Indian Affairs last Spring I dealt with the general conditions of the education of the Indians carried on by the various missions of the Church of England, so far as I have been able to observe them, and I beg to draw your attention to that part of my report in which I compared the results obtained at the Moosehide and Selkirk Day schools with the much better results obtained at the Carcross Boarding school. The building in which the latter school has been conducted is wholly inadequate to accommodate satisfactorily even the few pupils who have been placed there, and the equipment is extremely meagre; yet in spite of all the disadvantages, I could not help being impressed most favourably with the progress made and the excellent work that has been done. I feel convinced that such a boarding school is the only satisfactory means of dealing with Indian education in the Yukon Territory, that the ordinary day schools are practically useless, and the energy and money expended in maintaining them are comparatively barren of results. Therefore, if the Department of Indian Affairs is desirous of having efficient educational work done among the Yukon Indians generally, I would beg to recommend that a substantial grant be made for the erection of suitable buildings at Carcross, giving ample accommodation for all Indian children from all parts of this Territory, who would probably be induced to attend an Industrial school.\n\nThe work to be provided for in such an industrial school should include, in addition to the ordinary rudiments of a school education, carpentry and gardening for the boys and possibly blacksmithing, and cooking and general domestic service for the girls.\n\nAlexander Henderson, Esq., K.C.\nCommissioner, Y.T.\nDawson.\nAs to building and equipment, I regret that I cannot go into very precise details. I think it would be well to provide accommodation for not less than 35 boarders. The main building should provide for a kitchen, a dining room, two class rooms, three private rooms for the staff and four dormitories, two for the boys and two for the girls with separate entrances, all under one roof. In addition there should be a building for a workshop, laundry and bath separate from the building. It would probably be best for a married man to preside over such a school, and in that case there should be a residence for a principal.\n\nAs to approximate cost I think $8,000.00 might be sufficient for suitable buildings if economically spent, but this amount would probably not be sufficient for furnishing as well, for which another thousand dollars might be needed.\n\nIf the department of Indian affairs should favor a grant of this nature the money might go further and be used to better advantage if it were put directly under the control of the Bishop of Yukon, who could attend personally to all details of construction and submit to the Government a full report of all expenditure conditions in this country would render it difficult and expensive for Government officials directly to superintend such work.\n\nRegarding the cost of maintenance I regret that I have no data on which I could make at present any recommendation. This matter could be adjusted on the basis of a comparison with the cost of similar institutions in Western Canada, making due allowance for a proportionate increase in the cost of all supplies in this Territory.\n\nIn the Department of Indian Affairs should look with favor upon the proposal herein recommended I would respectfully suggest that the matter be dealt with as speedily as possible, so that new buildings may be erected next summer. Suitable accommodation and greater facilities are urgently needed to ensure anything like efficient work on a scale commensurate with the population to be served.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nT.G.Bragg, Superintendent of Schools\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ult., including a copy of the report by Mr. T. G. Bragg, Superintendent of Education for the Yukon Territory, concerning the Proposed Indian Industrial School at Carcross, and in reply I beg to say that Mr. A. W. Novell, Indian Superintendent for British Columbia and Rev. A. F. Green, Inspector of Indian Schools for that Province, have been instructed to visit the Yukon with a view to making full enquiry into the educational requirements of the District in respect to the Indian population.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlexander Henderson, Esq., M.C.,\nCommissioner,\nYukon Territory,\nDawson, Y.T.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAugust 14, 1906\n\nThe Secretary of Indian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nOn the 15th ultimo we arrived at Carcross, Y.T., where we were met at the station by the Rev. A.F.O'Meara and the Rev. Mr. Hawksley, who stated that they had been advised by the Department of our coming and were prepared to assist us in every way towards gaining the required information touching the conditions of the Indians in the Yukon Territory.\n\nOn this occasion the desirability of having a boarding school permanently established at Carcross was fully gone into.\n\nThe Reverend gentlemen referred to were of the opinion that it was sufficiently central in its situation to insure a sufficient number of pupils being enrolled from the different tribes or bands of Indians, to make it a success.\n\nAt the present time a Boarding School for the Indians is being maintained at that place by the Rev. Mr. Hawksley, the particulars of which have no doubt been furnished the Department, by the Rev. gentlemen named, from time to time.\n\nMr. Green inspected the pupils, of which there were ten boys and eight girls, who were fairly well grounded in the elementary rudiments of reading, writing, spelling and arithmetic.\narithmetic. The pupils are bright and well behaved.\n\nThe buildings, at present utilized as dormitories and class rooms, are altogether inadequate, and we were given to understand, by the Rev. gentlemen named, that provision has already been made for the establishment of a fully equipped boarding school at that point.\n\nx x x x\n\nWe have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servants\n\nA.W.Vowell\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\n\nA.B.Green\nInspector of Indian schools, B.C.\nOttawa, October 6, 1908.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nOf interview with Bishop Stringer and the Rev.

They propose, so I understand, to take up the question of a site for the school at Carcross and advise the Department.

He expects to leave Athabasca Landing about the 4th or 5th of June and will not be back there until some time in September or October.

Condon, Esq., M.P., has brought to my attention a request from Miss Collins, maker of the Indian school at Carcross, for a special grant to assist in providing better kitchen equipment for teaching cooking to the young Indians at that school. The grant made to the Bishop of Yukon is not sufficient to enable him to provide anything like adequate equipment along this line and, as far as I am aware, no final decision has yet been arrived at regarding the building of a new Industrial School for Indians at that point. In the meantime, I would beg to suggest that your Department were\nInstructions to the Administrator of this Territory to enable him to make a small grant for this purpose out of the Indian Fund placed at his disposal by your Department (which fund can, I am informed, be used at present only for relief in accordance with specific instructions) or that your Department make a small special grant direct to the Nation in accordance with the requirements set forth in her letter to Mr. Condon, M.P. I have just written Mr. Condon to this effect. The Nation points out that any equipment now provided would be suitable and available for use in any proposed Industrial School. Miss Collins, the Nation, is energetic, competent and possessed of good judgment and would know how to get good results if she was provided with the opportunity of carrying out her ideas.\n\nP.S. I am awaiting your reply re inspection of Indian schools this year as per my inquiry in my last communication.\n\nT.G.

Frank Oliver,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFrom information received indirectly, I understand that your Department has in view the erection of a new Indian school at Carcross or vicinity. I am glad to learn that this is likely to be an accomplished fact in the near future. I have been a good deal away from civilization during the last year, and am rather in the dark with regard to the arrangements that have been made, or the conclusion your Department has come to. I am very anxious to see the school on a satisfactory basis, so far as its support in the future is concerned. I know that your department will do what they can in this direction, and I should be glad to have a reasonable assurance of the adequate support of the school under the new regime. It is difficult at present, to tell exactly what the cost of running the school will be in connection with the new building. I gave Mr. Bragg, Supt. of Schools for Yukon, an estimate of the cost for the year 1909. I presume that was required in order to make some estimate of the cost for the future. I should like to suggest that the estimate of the cost of running the school be gone into in detail during the first year after the new school is built, and then that a block grant be made based on the actual cost. I am very anxious that the school should be carried on as economically as possible, but at the same time\nI dislike the idea of having continuous financial difficulties in connection with the school. Practically no other funds are available at present.\n\nI shall be glad if your Department will take up this matter, and that the decision will be satisfactory, and for the best interests of the school.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Yukon.\nPrince Albert, Saska., 9th Aug., 1910.\n\nHon. Frank Oliver,\nMinister of the Interior,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Oliver,- Re Per Capita Grant, and site of Carcross School.\n\nOn the 8th instant I sent you at Edmonton from Calgary as I passed on the train the following telegram according to the suggestion you made to me at Carcross:- \"Am willing try running Carcross School $200.00 per capita. Recommend site Sherron's homestead two miles from Carcross. Writing particulars. Could I meet you Edmonton about eighteenth. Answer Synod Prince Albert\". On arrival here at Prince Albert this evening I received your telegram from Edmonton stating that you expected to be in Ottawa on the eighteenth. I should like to have seen you again on the question but must be content to write. I have consulted Archdeacon Canham and others on the subject of the cost of running a boarding school at Carcross and have come to the conclusion that a grant of $200.00 per capita from the Government is the smallest amount that we could attempt to run the school with. While agreeing to a definite grant for this year if you think it absolutely necessary, I wish at the same time to ask your Department to leave the question open for one year if possible. You can readily understand how difficult it is to\nto decide now what it will cost to run the school but after\none year we should be able to make a fair estimate. I should\nmuch prefer that instead of a per capita grant a block grant\nshould be made each year for a few years at any rate, such\nblock grant being based on the recommendation of Mr. Bragg\nthe superintendent of schools in Yukon or anyone else appoint-\ned for that purpose. The books and accounts of the school\ncould be referred to this person to aid him in his decision.\nI think you will see the reasonableness of this plan for a\nyear or two at least. If you think it necessary to fix a per\ncapita grant for the coming year I would draw your attention\nto the fact that the cost of living in Yukon is much greater\nthan in other parts of Northwest Canada. The annual expendi-\nture in connection with the education of white children in\nYukon Territory is between $175.00 and $200.00 per capita and\nthis is exclusive of board and clothing. The additional heavy\nexpenses of heating and lighting required in a boarding school\nand also travelling and other expenses which taken altogether\nmight reasonably be calculated at $100.00 per capita and this\nis putting it at a very low figure. This rough comparison is\nmade simply to aid in arriving at a proper estimate and I\nthink it is reasonable to expect the Indian Department to give\nat least $200.00 per capita. Living expenses in Yukon are\ngenerally considered to be twice as great as in more easily\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\naccessible parts of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. In making the calculation of $200.00 per capita I am counting on spending a considerable sum in addition to be provided from other sources.\n\nWith reference to the homestead of Mr. Wylie Sherman, which I am recommending should be purchased as a site for the Indian Boarding School, I wish to explain that this is the same Mr. Sherman concerning whom Mr. Percy Reed, Mining Recorder at Carcross, spoke to you with a view to having the date of the patenting of his homestead postponed for a year or so. He seems a good steady man and has worked hard to obtain his homestead. Now, however, on account of illness in his family he wishes to go outside and has not sufficient money on hand for the purpose and he is therefore willing to sell his homestead at what he considers a sacrifice provided the school gets the benefit of the location and provided that you will as Minister of the Interior release him of his obligations as per Clause 18 of the Homestead Regulations. It has cost him I think much more than $1000.00 to clear the land he has under cultivation. The matter rests in your hands and I hope you will be able to make over the homestead for school purposes. I have no hesitation in recommending this as the most suitable site known to me. I am expecting to hear from Major Snyder shortly as to his opinion and he will probably write you directly as well. I\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI rather hesitated in recommending any of the other sites but since Mr. Sherman has made this reasonable proposal I have no hesitation whatever in saying that this site seems to me as well as to others whom I have consulted much better than any of the others proposed. I expect to be in Prince Albert until about Saturday after which for a week or so my address will be in care of Rev. C. G. Owen, Christ Church Rectory, Vancouver, after which my address will be Whitehorse, Yukon. I am as anxious as yourself that the building of the school will proceed as quickly as possible. I am sending you a copy of letters addressed to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, which were written in consequence of our conversation at Whitehorse and on the train to Edmonton; it seemed better to address these to the Department in case they should miss you at Edmonton.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIsaac O.

In connection with this letter I refer you to my letter addressed to you from Prince Albert dated Aug. 7, which gives my reasons for thinking the Sherman homestead at Carcross the most suitable location for the proposed new Indian Boarding School. Major Synder in the enclosed letter expresses his opinion that the above site \"comes more nearly meeting all the requirements.\" I trust this will enable your department to come to a definite conclusion and that you will see your way to the purchasing of the homestead from Mr. Sherman.\n\nI enclose you a copy of a letter I wrote to Mr. Oliver from Prince Albert, the latter part of which explains the question of the Homestead. I wish also to point out that the option I have\nTaken from his Sherman for the sum of $500 at the end of September. If your department decides to take over the homestead and the Minister of the Interior will release his Sherman of his obligations as per Clause 12 Homestead regulations, will you please take steps at once to acquire the property.\n\nI expect to come Vancouver for Carcross Saturday Sept. 3rd and I shall be glad to do anything to expedite matters. If you send me instructions I could, with the assistance of Mr. Percy Head, Surveyor Recorder at Carcross, complete the transfer of the property from his Sherman. Please let me know in what name the property is to be held.\n\nI shall be only a few days in Carcross and Whitehorse before going on to Dawson.

Stringer\n\nBishop of Yukon.\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your letter of Sept. 21st, 1910, No. 297298/5, I beg to formally accept, as Bishop of the Diocese of Yukon, the terms therein laid down, regarding the new arrangements for the Carcross Indian Boarding School.\n\nI am quite willing to accept the responsibility, and to do the best that I can, under the circumstances. At the same time, you will readily understand that the financial arrangements of an Institution of this kind, must, for the first year or so, be rather in the nature of an experiment.\n\nI refer to my letter of August 9th, 1910, written from Prince Albert, Sask., addressed to the Hon. Frank Oliver, a copy of which I sent you from Vancouver on the 24th of August, 1910. I then requested your Department to make a per capita grant of, at least, Two Hundred Dollars, but to leave the question open for one year if possible. At the same time, I can quite understand that your Department wish to have a formal acceptance of the terms stated by you in your letter of Sept. 21st.\n\nIf, after a reasonable experiment of a year or two, I find\nthat it is impossible to properly maintain the school on the funds at our disposal, I will, of necessity, have to refer the matter again to your Department. I hope, however, the per capita grant of Two Hundred Dollars for Thirty Pupils will be sufficient.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nI. O. Stringer\n\nBishop of Yukon.\nOttawa, April 12, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of reports upon the day schools in the Yukon Territory.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque for $2250.00, being the earnings for the June, September and December quarters, last, has been forwarded to Your Lordship's address. It has also been decided to forward now the balance of the earnings for the fiscal year ending March 31st, viz.- $750.00, and a cheque for this amount will go forward at an early date. I would ask Your Lordship to be good enough to forward the return for the March quarter with as little delay as possible. The question of grant for the boarding and industrial schools will be dealt with in another communication.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

For that fiscal year Parliament voted the sum of $3,000.00 for the Yukon schools and already cheques have been sent you for all this amount. The per capita grant will, however, be paid for the Carcross Boarding School from the first of the present month up to thirty pupils, computation to be based upon the average attendance. Returns will have to be forwarded promptly by the Principal at the end of each quarter and a supply of the forms for this purpose is being sent you under separate cover. These differ somewhat from the returns for the day schools, but they are self-explanatory.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

In this connection it is thought the following instructions should be given in order that you may be enabled to prepare the quarterly returns in compliance with the requirements of the Department.\n\nAll the columns of the return should be properly filled in under the different headings as called for each column correctly added. The register number of each pupil should be given; the boys to be numbered as No.1, 2, and following numbers respectively, and the girls No.01, 02, respectively. In no case is the same register number given to any one pupil. A new pupil upon entering the school is to be given a register number, the number following that given the previously admitted pupil. In the case of each girl admitted, her number should always be prefixed by the numeral 0, as above.\n\nMiss F.

Care should be taken to fill in the columns under the heading \"Attendance\". The date of admission of each pupil is to be given by day, month and year.\n\nThe \"No. of days attendance during quarter\" means the total number of days each pupil was in residence at the school during the quarter, while the column \"Total No. of school days in quarter,\" means the total number of days each pupil attended class during the quarter.\n\nThe reasons for the absence of all pupils should be given, together with the dates of all absences each quarter, in the column for that purpose.\n\nIt will not be necessary to fill in the column under the heading \"Amount payable for each pupil\". The quarterly grant is computed and paid on the total average attendance of the number of pupils in attendance for the authorized number for which the grant is payable.\n\nThe grant cannot be allowed for any pupil under seven years of age who is admitted to the school after April 1st last, but any under that age, admitted previous to that date will be paid for.\n\nIt is hoped that you will exercise due care in the preparation of your quarterly returns, as owing to the loss of time which would be occasioned in returning them for any corrections required, much delay would result in the payment of the grant.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAsst.

I have had to tell them that this is contrary to the regulations of your Department. Over and over again I have been asked to do something for these children, who live in places where there are no school facilities.

Unless something is done for these children, they must remain without the advantages of schooling, and they will thus grow up in ignorance.\n\nOnly one way occurs to me in which the difficulties could be overcome. Some of the parents could give a small amount towards the upkeep of a school. I shall endeavor also to secure other additional financial aid. It has occurred to me that we might utilize a small log building, which is situated on the homestead acquired by your Department for the Carcross Indian Boarding School. The building would have to be repaired and put into order, and perhaps enlarged by a small addition, but would then give sufficient accommodation for the present, without incurring any great cost.\n\nI know of about half a dozen white men who are married in a regular manner to Indian women, and who apparently intend to spend all their lives in this country, but who because of their employment as hunters, trappers or miners, are not able to take advantage of the white schools. Their\nchildren are practically excluded from the Indian school also. The parents are anxious to have their children educated, and it seems very desirable that something should be done for them.\n\nIf this experiment which I now propose, does not prove a success, the arrangement could be cancelled at any time.\n\nHoping to have a favorable reply from you\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJames O.

I expect to make further enquiries before making any report upon the school and I would like you to send me a statement of all the money paid to them on account of the Grant together with a statement of what the grant is to cover and the names of the pupils shown upon the last statement on file in the Department.

D. Evans, Principal.\nMrs. E. D. Evans, Matron.\nF. Harding, Farmer.\nMrs. F. Harding, Cook.\nMiss F. Hutchison, Teacher.\n\nThis, in my estimation, appears to be too large for the attendance, and the present facilities for handling the pupils.\n\nThe Principal, prior to his engagement by the school, was employed on Indian work in Alaska, and it is doubtful whether he has had any experience in Industrial School\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nOf Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSchool work.\n\nMr. Harding, who is supposed to be the farmer, is an ex navy man, and prior to his engagement, had only been in this country a few weeks.\n\nMiss Hutcheson, the teacher, has been with the school for a number of years.\n\nComplaints were made that the pupils had not been receiving sufficient nourishment, and from that cause, they were developing tubercular troubles, and I found, upon investigation, that these complaints were, during the winter, well founded, and I found that the pupils were not receiving, at the time of my visit, the nourishment to which they were entitled.\n\nThe Missionary Society supplied this school with a cow and a number of hens, and prior to my arrival, milk and eggs were being sold regularly in the village, and the Principal told me that the children did not care for either milk or eggs, and as they could not use them all themselves, they sold the surplus. This, however, was not borne out by my investigation, as I found that the children were given to understand that they could not have these things, and that they must say that they did not care for them. This, to my mind, was not very creditable to the management, and I informed the Principal that the selling of milk and eggs must stop immediately, and that the children must receive whatever eggs and milk were produced.\n\nI found that during May and June the Principal bought, in Skagway, Alaska, the following articles, from funds supplied by the church authorities for the maintenance of the\nthe school:\n\nMay 11th, 3 Rugs and duty upon same, $74.25\nJune 10th, Second hand Printing outfit, $350.00\n\nThe printing outfit is entirely unnecessary and useless and is of no benefit to the school in any way, and the money paid for its should have been used in supplying nourishment for the children.\n\nThe heating of the school was also the cause of much comment and I found that during all of last winter the temperature had been kept much higher than was necessary and that the children suffered physically from confinement in overheated rooms and lack of ventilation, and at the time of my visit, in June, although the weather was exceedingly fine and the temperature about 70, a fire was being maintained in the furnace and all of the children were sleeping in the dormitories, although the boys were specially anxious to go into camp, as had been their custom at the old school.\n\nIn going over the list of pupils furnished me under your letter of July 4th, and covering the attendance for March quarter, I am informed that No.29, J. H. Adams, is an American Indian boy, and comes from Eagle, Alaska, and that No's. 022 Annie de Wolfe, and 023, M. Anderson, are both half breeds and come from the vicinity of Twelve Mile, which is some distance below Dawson, and if such is the case, these names should not appear upon the attendance report for the payment of grant.\n\nUpon my visit to the school I found everything about the school building tidy and clean, although the dormitories bore evidence of having been prepared for my visit.\nvisit. The furnishings supplied by the Department had not yet arrived.\n\nThe ground under cultivation had not been extended, and only that portion which had been previously cultivated was being worked, and with the present staff, some considerable amount of clearing should have been done to prepare for an extension of the farm and vegetable gardens.\n\nUpon my return to Carcross, in October, I was unable to visit the school building, and I cannot say whether any improvement in the conditions had taken place since my previous visit, but from reports, I am led to believe that the management is far from being satisfactory.\n\nThe recruiting to the school is coming from the Indians who are a long distance from Carcross, and the Indians in the immediate vicinity are taking their children away from the school, and a feeling of distrust in the management is spreading among the Indians, and unless some change is made in the management in the near future, the church authorities will find difficulty in inducing the Indians to allow their children to go to the school.\n\nA complete list of the furnishings in this school belonging to the Government should be furnished by the Principal, in the same manner as Industrial Schools, and the church authorities should be asked to submit a statement of the expenditures at the school, to enable your Department to know how the grant is being used.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector,\nfor the Office of the Auditor General.\nOttawa, December 12, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to inform Your Lordship that the Department is in receipt of a report on the Carcross Boarding School from Mr. Stockton of the Auditor General's Department, who was requested to make an inspection of the school, in which he states that immediately upon his arrival at Carcross he was met by a number of the people of the town who had complaints to make as to the manner in which the school was being conducted and, as they had the well being of the school at heart, he considered that inquiry should be made as to the management. Following are the results of his inquiries:\n\nThe Principal, he considered, is inexperienced in school work. The farmer is an ex-navy man and prior to his engagement had only been in this country a few weeks.\n\nComplaints were made that the pupils have not been receiving sufficient nourishment and from that cause they were developing tubercular troubles. He found upon investigation that these complaints were during the winter well founded and that the pupils were not receiving, at the time of his visit, the nourishment to which they are entitled. He states that the Missionary Society supplied the school with a cow and a number of hens and prior to his arrival.\n\nRight Rev. I. O. Stringer, D.D.,\nBishop of the Yukon,\nDawson, Y.T.\narrival milk and eggs were being sold regularly in the village. The Principal told him that the children did not care for milk or eggs and, as they could not use them all themselves, they sold the surplus. This, however, was not borne out by his investigation, as he found that the children were given to understand that they could not have these things and that they must say that they did not care for them.\n\nMr. Stockton states that during May and June the Principal bought in Skagway, Alaska, the following articles from the funds supplied by the church authorities for the maintenance of the school:\n\nMay 11th, 3 rugs and duty upon same $74.25\nJune 10th, Second hand Printing outfit $350.00\n\nThe printing outfit was entirely unnecessary and useless and was of no benefit to the school in any way and the money paid for it should have been used in supplying nourishment for the children.\n\nThe heating of the school was also the cause of much comment and Mr. Stockton found that during all of last winter the temperature had been kept much higher than was necessary and that the children suffered physically from confinement in overheated rooms and lack of ventilation, and at the time of his visit in June, although the weather was exceedingly fine and the temperature about 70, a fire was being maintained in the furnace and all the children were sleeping in the dormitories, although the boys were specially anxious to go into camp, as had been their custom in the old school.\n\nMr. Stockton states that he found everything about the school building clean and tidy and the dormitories bore evidence of having been prepared for his visit.\n\nThe ground under cultivation had not been extended and\nand only that portion which had been previously cultivated was being worked and he considers that a large amount of clearing should have been done to prepare for an extension of the farm and vegetable gardens.\n\nRecruiting for the school is being done among the Indians who are a long distance from Carcross and those in the immediate vicinity are taking their children away from the school and a feeling of distrust in the management is spreading among the Indians and unless some change is made in the management in the near future the church authorities will, Mr. Stockton, states find difficulty in inducing the Indians to allow their children to go to the school.\n\nIn view of this report the Department considers that it is most desirable that a change in the management should be made.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, February 18th, 1913.\n\nRight Rev.

This Department does not consider that it is in any way responsible for the education of Half-Breeds, and it is thought that the Government of the Yukon should give material assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRight Rev.

Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 24th ultimo, in reference to the Principalship of the Carcross Boarding School, and in reply beg to say that the contents thereof have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nI wish to acknowledge your communication of Nov. 15th, which followed me up and reached me on my way to Dawson, hence the delay in answering.\n\nIn this letter you state that Mr. Stockton, of the Auditor's general Department, who, in the past Summer inspected the Carcross Indian Boarding School, advises the Department, that there, on the roll, two half-breeds, Annie deWolfe and Mary Anderson, Nos. 832 and 833 respectively, and also one American Indian J.H. Adams No. 29 and you ask me for an explanation, referring me to your official letter of July 23rd last, in which you made the statement that \"The grant will be paid for the children of regular members of Indian bands in the Yukon only, not for half-breeds.\"\n\nI wish to inform you that Annie deWolfe and Mary Anderson were discharged from the School in the month of July last, even before your official letter reached Dawson. These girls had been in the school for some time, under the old regime, and were not recently admitted, as your letter would imply. They were not in the school at the time of Mr. Stockton's last visit to Carcross, and in fact were sent home about two months before he left the Territory. He got his information either during his visit to Carcross in June, or else from someone who had inaccurate knowledge of the circumstances.\nWith reference to J.H. Adams\u2014 it is a debatable question, whether he is a Canadian or an American Indian. He was born on the Canadian side, and was baptised by my predecessor, Bishop Bompas, and for some time lived with his people at Forty Mile on the Canadian side of the Boundary. He also lived for a time at Eagle, just across the Boundary, on the American side. I believe his parents are both dead. The tribe of Indians to which he belongs have been going and coming across the Boundary. However, he is now dismissed from the school. I do not know from whom Mr. Stockton got his information, but it would be difficult to prove that he is an American Indian. Many of our Indians live near the Boundary of Alaska, and sometimes hunt and live for longer or shorter periods on the American side. We have no desire to admit children of American parents in to the Carcross Indian School, but sometimes it would be difficult to determine their nationality, and I do not imagine your Department, would wish us to exclude all children who spend part of their time on the Alaskan side, if they can be fairly considered Canadian Indians.\n\nTrusting that the above explanation will be satisfactory,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsaac C. Stringer\n\nBishop of Yukon.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nMarch 31, 1913.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish formally to reply to your communication of December 12th last, with reference to Mr. Stockton's report of the Carcross Indian Boarding School. While in Ottawa in January, I gave a personal explanation on some points, to Mr. Scott. He asked me to give a written answer as well, and the apparent seriousness of some of the complaints, necessitates a written statement. I am sorry my reply has to be rather lengthy, but most of the complaints can be understood only by explaining the surrounding circumstances.\n\nIn the first place, certain of the criticisms are necessarily based on personal opinions, and are hard either to prove or disprove. Take for example the complaints that the children were not receiving sufficient nourishment, and that the building was kept too hot, and was poorly ventilated. I believe Mr. Stockton spent only two or three hours at the school, and so far as his personal observations were concerned, I am quite willing to accept his criticisms, and have tried to profit by them, and by the information received therefrom. But possibly his judgment in the various matters referred to, was based to a considerable extent, on the complaints made by the Carcross people, who, as he says met him on his arrival, and who made a point of stating things derogatory to the management of the school. Probably some of these people believed certain exaggerated stories that were in circulation, and I have no wish to judge them harshly. But I cannot forget that some of the same people criticised just as severely, the former management. Reports regarding the lack of food supplied the children, have been made periodically ever since the school was founded. Take an illustration\u2014When I arrived in Carcross in January of this year, a committee representing the white population called on me, and complained with much emphasis and vehemence, that Archdeacon Janham was starving an Indian boy named Jacob Njootli, who was living with him. So far as I could learn almost the whole white population believed this, and they did not take the trouble to investigate the truth or falsehood of the report. After careful and impartial enquiry, I found the accusation was utterly false and misleading, and I think...\nI was able to prove it to the satisfaction of everyone. It was gratifying to have this matter straightened out, and if the people who complained to Mr. Stockton, had come to me when they had an opportunity, or had written me, I could have corrected many misleading and exaggerated reports, and also would have had an opportunity of remedying any defects or mistakes in the conduct of the school.\n\nDuring the year under criticism, I visited the school three times, spending about two weeks in and around the school on each occasion, and had a better opportunity than any casual visitor, to notice things. I was also quite alive to the possibility hinted at, namely that the best side would be shown for my benefit. However, I knew each pupil, and always have found the children very free in telling me things that happen around the school. I was more anxious than anyone else that the school should be a success in every way. I am quite free to acknowledge that some mistakes were made, and these were pointed out from time to time to the Principal and members of the staff. However from my own observations, and from the observations of others whom I asked to look into the question after certain reports became current, I do not believe the children suffered from lack of nourishment. I always gave emphatic directions that the children should be well fed, no limit was put on the amount of food that was to be supplied to the children, and there could be no motive for starving them. To me and to others whose opinions I obtained, the children appeared to be well nourished. It is a difficult question on which to make an absolute pronouncement, and I merely give my opinion after careful enquiry.\n\nRegarding the question of overheating and lack of ventilation, it is again largely a matter of opinion. I believe that careful attention was always paid to the ventilation, judging from my own observation, and from information gathered through others. With reference to the overheating I accept Mr. Stockton's opinion of what he personally observed, but I emphatically repudiate some of the absurd and exaggerated reports that reached me, and which no doubt, reached him. I know Mr. Evans was particularly anxious during the Winter of 1911-1912 lest the pipes should freeze in cold weather, and at such times kept the fires going all night. Because of outside criticisms, he was less exacting in this direction during this Winter, with the result that the water pipes froze up, entailing...\nconsiderable expense for repairs.\n\nI now come to the more specific complaints:\n\n1st\u2014Mr. Stockton states \"That the Missionary Society supplied the school with a cow and a number of hens and prior to his arrival milk and eggs were being sold regularly in the village. The principal told him that the children did not care for milk and eggs and, as they could not use them all themselves, they sold the surplus. This, however, was not borne out by his investigation, as he found that the children were given to understand that they could not have these things and that they must say they did not care for them.\"\n\nThe Missionary Society had nothing to do with the purchase of cow and hens, and gave nothing towards the expense. A few of the hens were given by some friends, the majority I purchased myself as also the cow, thinking they would be profitable investments or would at any rate pay for themselves. I discussed the matter beforehand with the Principal, and his dealings were quite open and above board. On account of the absurd importance given to the question of selling milk and eggs, I have investigated the matter very carefully, with this result:\u2014The cow was a good milker and for a time gave thirteen quarts per day. Some of the children did not care for cow's milk, not an uncommon thing among native and even white children unaccustomed to cows milk. Mr. Evans asked the children if they would rather sell some of the milk, and buy something they liked instead. They said yes they would like that. There were sixty hens, and it was thought best to sell a few of the eggs (fresh) at a good price. He could buy the same kind of eggs as there would be if packed away, at a cheaper price later on. For about three weeks milk and eggs were sold to a very limited extent by the children under the supervision of Mr. Harding, who gave me an itemized statement of the amount of money taken in and how expended. The members of the staff considered it a little industry that was helpful all around till they learned that it was being criticised and then it was dropped. In all the sum of $16.45 was taken in for milk and eggs\u2014five dollars of this was paid towards the freight on the cow and hens and the remainder was spent by the children themselves for jam, maple sugar and other such things which they liked. The statement\nto the effect that the children were told to say that they did not care for the milk and eggs seems to have little force under the circumstances. The sale of $16.45 worth of milk and eggs at Carcross prices would not make much difference in the food supply of the school. After a thorough enquiry, I exonerated Mr. Evans and do not consider it a serious offence either in intention or result. The most that could be said in criticism is that it might be considered a lack of judgment, and yet it was heralded from one end of the country to the other as a most serious accusation.\n\n2nd\u2014The complaint that the principal bought in Skagway three rugs and a printing outfit.\n\nThe rugs were never charged to the school. Mr. Evans took one, Mr. Harding another, and Rev. W.G. Blackwell of Whitehorse the third as personal property. I fail to see any offence in this transaction and only an enemy could have given Mr. Stockton the information for the purpose of making a complaint. Even if used for and charged to the school it would scarcely be a grievous offence if I became responsible for the payment.\n\nWith regard to the Printing Outfit\u2014It was not paid for out of the school funds, and I do not consider it has any necessary connection of spending money in supplying nourishment for the children. Mr. Stockton states that it was entirely unnecessary and useless. It may have been a mistake to procure it just at that time, but the responsibility rests on me, not on the Indian Department, and I can assure you the purchasing of it has not, and will not interfere with the food supply for the children. I have been assured by some who have a considerable knowledge of printing presses, that it will answer our purpose, but I am not an expert on the subject, and it yet remains to be seen as to whether it was a wise investment.\n\nI am pleased that Mr. Stockton found everything about the building clean and tidy. After a casual but careful enquiry, I do not think the staff had time to prepare for his visit as the news of his arrival preceded him only a very short time. Other visitors who came entirely unannounced, have borne out this his one and only recommendation of the staff.\n\nMr. Stockton states that a large amount of clearing should have been done to prepare for an extension of the farm and vegetable gardens. I did not intend or expect that much should\nbe done in this direction the first year especially. The ground already cleared is sufficient to keep a man or two busy for the first couple of years till the ground is got into shape. However, I have no fault to find with this criticism as it is a matter of opinion. I hope we may be able to make the best possible use of the ground which can be profitably cultivated.\n\nIn answer to the last complaint that recruiting for the school was being done at a distance, I wish to state that such recruiting had no connection with the unpopularity of the management. Most of the school children have come from the Northern part of the Diocese, as our workers have been longer among the Indians of the North, and the parents are more anxious to send their children. It is true that last Summer I brought eight children from some distance, at the earnest request of the parents, during a long itineration, but it was during this long absence that the local criticism became severe and this so called recruiting would have been done just the same, no matter how popular the school was locally. On the other hand, it is also true that a feeling of distrust was being engendered among the Indians of the vicinity, due largely to the influence of a few white people who personally disliked Mr. Evans. I do not pretend to say that the management of the school was perfect, some mistakes were made, and an endeavor was made to correct these from time to time. However I considered most of the criticisms that were made so public were unjust and I felt I should give you my opinion.\n\nI think the discipline of the school was excellent and the management of the school at least as good as at any time in the history of the school. Apparent faults that generally would be overlooked were magnified into grievous offenses partly because of the increased critical attention paid the Institution in the new costly Government building, and partly because of local jealousies and other circumstances which I need not explain, and some of which would be difficult to explain intelligently to anyone who did not know the surroundings.\n\nIt is my belief that Mr. Stockton's opinion, was to some extent influenced by exaggerated reports\u2014 it could scarcely have been otherwise. And yet how quickly opinions change. Some of those who criticized Mr. Evans most severely, afterwards realized\nhow unjust some of the exaggerated reports were, and expressed to me their regret at his leaving the school. However, it is now a thing of the past. Mr. Evans resigned his position as Principal and has given up his work in the school.\n\nWe hope that under the new management the school may prosper more and more, and that much good work may be done in training the Indian children, and making them a credit to the Indian Department which I know is anxious to co-operate with us in every effort for the advancement of the Indians of the country.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsaac O. Stringer\nBishop of Yukon.\nOttawa, May 13, 1913.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 31st of March, last, in reference to the management of the Carcross Indian Boarding School by Mr. Evans.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Your Lordship's explanations are quite satisfactory to the Department.\n\nThe Department trusts that under new management the school will prosper as it has done in the past and that eminently successful results will be obtained. I wish to assure Your Lordship of the hearty co-operation of the Department in this work.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

There seems to be quite sufficient room in the building for at least 35 pupils.\n\nWe find the financing of the School a very serious question, and I feel if the number of pupils allowed was increased to 35 it would permit us to take in some other children who wish to enter, and would also be a relief financially.\n\nTrusting that you will be able to concede to this request.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Yukon.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe Bishop of the Yukon has asked for an increase in the number of grant earners at the Carcross Indian Boarding School from thirty to thirty-five. Mr. Ogilvie states that there is dormitory accommodation for thirty-six pupils in this school and, in view of this fact, I would recommend that the Bishop's application be granted, as it will materially assist them in meeting their obligations.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 5, 1913.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to Your Lordship's letter of the 28th ultimo I beg to say that the Department will allow the grant for thirty-five pupils at the Carcross Indian Boarding School from the beginning of the current quarter, if this number is in residence.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. I. O. Stringer,\nBishop of the Yukon,\nKincardine, Ont.\nThe publication of this little paper fills two objects; it informs those who are interested regarding the work in this northern diocese, and it gives opportunity to the boys of the school to learn a little about type setting and press work. These two ideas we have sought to combine, so that all we expect from subscriptions is to cover the cost of material and the postage. Small as the subscription is it would be appreciated if the many friends of the Yukon diocese would just remember to send it year by year. We take this opportunity of thanking those who have subscribed up to the present, and also to acknowledge a number of letters encouraging us in the undertaking.\n\nOur readers will please remember that \"Northern Lights\" has two circulations, namely, the Yukon itself, and \"Outside\", as the rest of the world is termed in the language of the North. There are perhaps many things that would interest \"Outsiders\" that would appear trivial or commonplace to the Yukoner. We are trying to build up a paper that will be interesting to church people the world over, and we ask all that are interested for their cooperation.\n\nDiocesan News.\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe last communication from Bishop Stringer stated that he and Mrs. Stringer were intending to sail for Canada during July. They will come North immediately after the General Synod in Vancouver.\n\nIs it all right to keep Sunday on Monday provided you do not know the difference? That is the problem that is at present bothering the Rev. C.S. Swann of Carmacks and Little Salmon. It appears that the people in that part of the world got a day out of their reckoning, and did not discover their mistake till the first boat arrived en route to Dawson.\n\nThe Diocese of Yukon extends its sincerest sympathies to Bishop Rowe of the neighboring diocese of Alaska, in his recent sad bereavement by the death of his wife.\n\nSchool News.\n\nAlthough there was an unusual quantity of snow last winter, still the spring was fairly open, and as a result gardening was begun nearly two weeks earlier than the year before. Carcross is not by nature adapted to farming. The elevation (2,164 feet) gives cold nights even in the hottest season, so that things grow better in Dawson, although that is much further north. Another drawback is that some seasons there is very little rain. This has been overcome near the school by a small irrigation ditch connected with the falls. We are able to forestall the season by planting the first seeds in the hotbed; thus we had such things as lettuce, radishes and cress by the middle of May. The plowing was begun on May 4th, and the whole crop was in before the end of the month.\n\nFeed for the horse and cow is quite a problem at the school. There is a hayfield belonging to the diocese, but as the yield there depends on the height...\nStaff\n\nPATRON.\n\nRight Rev. I. O. Stringer, B.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Yukon.\n\nRev. W. T.

These seem to be doing fairly well, and will in any case be a great help.\n\nBy the kindness of the members of the Woman's Auxiliary the children of the school are supplied with clothing for another year. Thirty bales in all were received, coming from Montreal, Kingston, London, Toronto and the diocese of New Westminster. These contained twenty-four complete outfits, besides a large quantity of undesignated things to be used as occasion required. Although the members of the staff will acknowledge the bales separately, so that their letters will arrive in time for the opening meetings, we wish to take this opportunity of publicly thanking those who have done so much to make our work among the natives in the Yukon possible. The clothes-basket was conspicuously acceptable, and, owing to exceptionally careful packing, arrived in perfect condition.\n\nThe last meeting of the J.W.A. was held at the School July 7th. All the members were present but two. When the books were closed it was found that there was $10.00 available for missions. This money had been earned by the children during their play hours, and so was entirely their own. It was voted to send $5.00 towards the children's work in the diocese of Honan. With regard to the other $5.00 there was quite a lively discussion, the boys being more interested in the Eskimo work and the girls in the School for the Blind at Gifu, Japan. The Eskimo work finally won; but not to be outdone the girls have decided to go to camp and earn another $5.00 before the meetings begin again in the Fall, which will go to the work at Gifu.\n\nThe Indian Agent made an official visit to the School in June.\n\nThe School gratefully acknowledges the following gifts:\n\nMiss E.C. Gage, Duluth, Minn. $5.00.\nMrs. Pauls, Carcross. Clothing.\nMrs. Lauderdale, Carcross. Clothing.\n\nSt. Saviour's, Carcross.\n\nThe Carcross Indians, almost to a man, left to attend a great semi-religious gathering in Whitehorse at the beginning of April. Some have returned since, the rest have got employment on the steamer and at the wood camps.\n\nEarly in May the Rev. W.G. Blackwell visited the mission at Teslin. During the same month Rev. Brett spent a Sunday here on his way to Teslin.\n\nIn June the Rector left on a visitation of the Diocese. If back in time he may proceed to Vancouver to attend the General Synod. During his absence the church and parish will be in charge of the Rev. W.T. Townsend.\n\nCarmacks and Little Salmon.\n\nThere is to hand a list of those who have contributed to the new church and mission house at Carmacks. The small pretensions of this paper and the length of the list of those who have chosen this tangible way to show their interest in the Yukon make it impossible to publish the names in detail, as was the intention. The list includes names from France and Ireland as well as Canada. Anyone wishing to contribute toward this, the newest branch of the work to be taken up in the diocese, may\nNorthern Lights\n\nAddress all correspondence to the Editor of \"Northern Lights,\" Carcross, Yukon Territory, Can.\n\nSubscription 25 cents a year.\n\ndo so through the Rev T.G.A. Wright,\n95 Maple St., London, Ont.\n\nDuring the winter, services were held regularly at Carmacks in the Road House. The average attendance was about eight, the smallness of which is due largely to the clique difficulty so prevalent in small places. We hope for better things in the future. Whenever there were any Indians here services were held for them in their tents, there being as yet no church building. The ordinary petty medical work of the northern missionary was done; in one case a broken leg was set. This belonged to a little Indian girl from Lake Lake. Her parents refused to let her go to Whitehorse, so first aid was all that could be done. We are glad to say that the leg healed well.\n\nThe Indians at Little Salmon were away most of the winter tending their traps, but the missionary in charge, Rev C. Swanson, paid seven visits during the winter months, holding services whenever there was anybody to come, and teaching two boys. These latter are very promising indeed. They paid for their tuition by teaching in their turn. Their pupil, the missionary himself, was not as bright in learning their language as they in learning his. It is very hard to learn a new tongue simply by hearing. With the advent of Spring the Indians came out over the ice, and some by the first water. Services have been held and have been very well attended. We are also holding school in the afternoon for the boys and girls, and in the evening for the adults.\n\nThe Indians all through the territory seem to have been the victims of a scourge of \"La Grippe.\" Little Salmon was no exception. At every tent we were met with the same story. \"Me head sick. Me bones all sick too.\" However it has all passed off now, and the general state of health is quite good. There are one or two cases of incipient consumption. In May a little girl died in a very advanced stage of tuberculosis.\n\nWe are now waiting for the arrival of some lumber to make seats and desks for the Church and school. At present we are using rough-hewn logs.\n\nIn March Mr. and Mrs. Swanson paid a visit to Nansen Creek. Mrs. Swanson traveled the whole way in quite a blizzard and three feet of snow. Not bad for a Cheechako! In this tough too Mr. Swanson started to go to the Polly River Indians, but was unable to get a guide and dogs, so the trip had to be postponed. By the kindness of Mr. W. Drury he will be able to go on the first trip of the steamboat Klondike with her annual supply for the Ross River Store. This trip is particularly interesting and important, from the fact that the Mackenzie River Indians, or at least a band of them trade at this store. Mr Field of Selkirk visited them last year for a very short time. They were evangelists in the diocese of Mackenzie River, and it is important that mission work should be kept up among them, as the Roman Church is only too keen to make proselytes of Protestant Indians.\n\nSt. Paul's, Dawson.\n\nThere have been many improvements made in the church buildings within the last few months. The vestry has been renovated by the Dawson branch of the Woman's Auxiliary and the members of the Vestry. Theabling rooms are greatly improved by the building of compartments for cassocks and surplices. A cupboard has also been built in which to keep the Bishop's and clergy's robes. One of the members of the Vestry has volun-\nteered to supply sufficient paint, and\nwith the help of several others to paint\nthe church fence. A bishop's chair,\nmade of unpolished English oak, has\nbeen placed in the chapel, together\nwith a new clergy chair.\n\nIt has been the custom at Dawson\nfor years for most of the people to climb\nthe \"Dome\" on the night of June 21st,\nto see the \"Midnight Sun\". As that\ndate this year fell on Sunday it was\narranged to have a midnight service on\nthe summit. The collection went to-\nwards a new operating room in the\nGood Samaritan Hospital.\n\nThe Ven. Archdeacon Canham vis-\nited Dawson this summer during his\nvisitation of the diocese. He arrived in\ntime to officiate at the Communion ser-\nvice on the first Sunday in July.\n\nSt Barnabas' Moosehide.\n\nThe Indians of Moosehide have had\na good winter's hunt, and have sold\nmuch meat. They are at present in\ngood health, and in some measure pros-\npering. There is, however, from time\nto time, considerable drunkenness which\nwe profoundly regret. We feel we\nmust go on perseveringly against this,\nwith faith in God. The Authorities are\nnot able to do very much to suppress\nthis curse amongst the Indians, owing\nto prevailing difficulties.\n\nIn spite of their weaknesses and\ntemptations they attend church well,\nwhich may be taken perhaps as a sign\nof their desire for spiritual help.\nThere are some backsiders who for\nsome reason have given up their work\nfor God. For such we must pray and\nwork.\n\nIt is encouraging to listen to a pupil\nin the Sunday School reading the Word\nof God in the Indian tongue, and who\nin early years attended our day-school\nreceiving her first lessons in reading\nthere. The Service for children which\nis held once a month in the English\nlanguage is much appreciated. The\nelder ones listen attentively, sing well,\nand join intelligently in the worship.\n\nThe Indian day school has been\nvisited recently by the Indian Agent.\nA good number of pupils attended and\nwent through their examination.\nMany of the children have to leave the\nschool when their parents go away to\nhunt. Several of the young men attend\nand occasionally one or two of the\nwomen. The pupils are making steady\nprogress. The younger ones are an-\nxious to attend school.\n\nThe Station at Forty Mile has been\nvisited, and Divine Services held for\nthe Indians and Whites. The Sacrament\nof the Lord's Supper was administered\nto the Indians. The church there has\nbeen somewhat burnt.\n\nSt. Andrew's, Selkirk.\n\nThe usual Indian exodus has taken\nplace to the fish camps at the lake.\nThe jackfish is the favorite catch.\nCaribou and moose hunting have been exten-\nsively followed, and meat has been plen-\ntiful. What bids fair to become the\nmost popular pursuit among natives and\nwhite people alike is the search for the\nrare breeds of foxes, silver-gray and\nblack. The price offered for these\nanimals alive is sometimes as high as\n$1000 for silver-grey, and even higher\nfor black. A Coffee Creek Indian, now\nin Selkirk, realized some $500 for a\nyoung silver-grey fox. Such rewards for\nIndians are calculated to work much\nharm upon their morals. With no idea\nof money value, with little or no ten-\ndencies towards economy, such fortunes,\nas they may well be called, will, it is\nfeared, produce discontent and selfish-\nness.\n\nChurch attendance, both Indian\nand white, has been on the whole good,\nwhile the school has been open as often\nas the constant journeysings of the chil-\ndren's parents will permit.\n\nThis paper was largely set up and\nprinted by Jimmie Wood and Alfred\nEllis, pupils of the School.\nJ.D. McLean Esq,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDept' of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of Aug 28th file # 297298/7 with copy of the correspondence and agreement relating to the maintainence and management of Indian boarding schools enclosed.\n\nI am notifying the authorities of the school that when repairs are needed in the future application must be made for such and that the sanction of the Department obtained before having them carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSup't of Indians.\nDiocesan News.\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe Bishop of Yukon, the Right Rev. L.O. Stringer, returned to his diocese in September, after a very successful year in England. As has already been stated, the Bishop was in England endeavouring to raise the $50,000 necessary to complete the endowment of his diocese. He was so far successful that he raised all but $5,000 of that amount. On his way to Dawson he visited the various missions along the route, staying over at Carcross, Whitehorse and Carmacks, and paying a flying visit to Selkirk. The Bishop was accompanied to Dawson by Mrs. Stringer and their four boys; their daughter, Miss Rebecca Stringer, remained in Toronto, where she is attending Hartsgate College.\n\nCarmacks and Little Salmon.\n\nRev. C. Swanson has been very busy at Carmacks in the building profession. A Church has been erected, 26 x 18, with a chancel 9 x 12. It is hoped that this winter there will be good attendances in it. A new house has also been started for the missionary, as the present residence, 14 feet square is hardly big enough.\n\nMrs. Swanson went to the W.A. meeting in Carcross, leaving her husband to build a small addition to the Little Salmon house, and to make the seating in the Church. This latter is now complete, and, with two good desks for the school, forms an excellent equip-\nStaff\n\nPATRON.\n\nRight Rev. L. O. Stringer, B.A., D.D.\nBishop of Yukon.\n\nRev. W. T.

The Indians particularly welcomed their old Missionary, who had labored among them for many years, the mission house being the headquarters for many visitors.\n\nChrist Church, Whitehorse.\n\nRalph, the youngest of Rev. W. G. Blackwell's five boys, is at the time of writing down with a mild attack of scarlet fever, and the house is in quarantine. For this reason the article by Mr. Blackwell, which usually appears in this paper under the head of Whitehorse is not available. Up to the present the pulpit at Whitehorse has been filled by the Ven. Archdeacon Caubham and Rev. W. T. Townsend.\n\nDuring his stay in Whitehorse the Bishop extended Mr. Blackwell's field of labor by making him responsible for the work in the direction of Champagne.\n\nSt. Saviour's, Carcross.\n\nThe return of our good Bishop after more than a year's absence from the Diocese was warmly welcomed by us all. We had much to tell him, but a great deal more to learn from him. He is well pleased with the work he has done with the endowment fund, and comes back to us with a load of anxiety removed. The Endowment Fund is not completed, but there is hope of its being so in the near future. The Bishop's stay here had to be short, but we were glad to have him even for one Sunday. He had yet about 500 miles further to go to reach home, and from news received since he started, it seems he is having a somewhat trying time. There is delay on route, and we have heard nothing definite as to cause of it.\n\nThe Rector returned from his visitation of the Diocese early in September having traveled some 1200 miles. At all the Missions visited the works are meeting with encouragement.\n\nSt. Paul's, Dawson.\n\nThe work of St. Paul's is very encouraging in its steady progress, and in its outlook for the future. The members of the congregation attend the services regularly, and contribute generously to the support of the work. At the evening service on July 5th the Ven. Archdeacon Sunk, of the Diocese of Alberta, preached a powerful sermon to a large congregation. The Rev. G. D. Christian, formerly missionary in charge at Nome, delivered an inspiring address at St. Paul's on Sunday evening, August 2nd. The annual children's flower service was held on Sunday afternoon, August 30th. The church was beautifully decorated for the occasion with plants and flowers, and the services on that day were well attended by scholars, parents and friends. On Sunday evening, Sept 30th, the service was of a special character, being the occasion when the congregation and friends bade farewell to several members of the N. W. M. P. who left Dawson on Monday morning to go to the front.\n\nThe ladies of the Senior Woman's Auxiliary are working most faithfully toward the completion of their sale, which they propose to hold sometime during November. The members of the Junior Branch of the Woman's Auxiliary are also laboring enthusiastically. In a northern parish such as St. Paul's, it is impossible to underestimate the work of the Woman's Auxiliary in the Church.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nClergy of Diocese\n\nSchool News.\n\nThe School crops have been successfully harvested. Owing to the short time that the School has been on the present site, the amount of ground under cultivation is not large, but new ground is being added each year. This year the yield was about 8 tons of hay, 2 tons oats and 1 ton to be used as fodder, 60 bushels of potatoes and other garden vegetables in proportion. On account of the elevation and latitude many things that would naturally be expected cannot be raised at all.\n\nDuring the month of August Mr. J. Hawksley, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Yukon Territory, paid an official visit to the School in connection with the new workshop and septic tank which have been constructed by the Department of Indian Affairs. The workshop will aid greatly to the efficiency of the work done by the School, as manual training is by far the most important thing for an Indian boy, who has to earn his living in the Yukon. It is hoped that the septic tank will successfully solve the drainage problem, which has been a source of trouble for some time.\n\nBishop and Mrs. Stringer stayed some days at the School on their way home from England. During his stay the Bishop held a Confirmation Service in Carcross, at which Bella Njootli, one of the girls of the School and daughter of the Rev. Amos Njootli of Rampart House, was confirmed. Bella returns to her Arctic home next summer, where it is hoped that she will have a strong influence for good.\n\nWith the passing of Miss F. Hutchison, who last month resigned her position as teacher in the School, the Staff loses the last of its old members. Miss Hutchison came to Carcross in 1905. She has worked under Bishop Bonpars, Rev. J. Hawksley, Archdeacon Canham and Mr. Evans as well as the present management. She knew the School as a couple of log shacks, and has seen it grow into the present commodious building. Miss Hutchison has known real pioneer missionary life at a time when conveniences were by no means as numerous as at present, and we believe that all who are interested in the Yukon Diocese will join with the members of the Staff in wishing her every happiness in her well earned rest. Miss Hutchison's address for the present will be 2010 Inverness St., Vancouver.\n\nFur raising has come to be one of the recognized industries of the Yukon, and Carcross at present leads the Territory both in number and size of its fur farms. The larger boys of the School have made their spending money, not only in hunting gophers and rabbits or fox feed, but in some cases in catching live minks. The money the boys make in this way is their own, though we try and advise them not to spend it foolishly, as they are somewhat prone to do. Alfred has started an account in the Postal Savings Bank. We hope that others will follow his example.\n\nThe School gratefully acknowledges the following gifts:\n\nT.H.C., Carcross..................$10.00\nW.S.W., Whitehorse.................5.00\n\nThis paper has been wholly set up by Jimmie Woolf and Alfred Ellis, pupils of the Chooutla Indian School.\nOttawa, November 21, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nThe attention of the Department has been called to the apparently large staff employed at the Carcross Boarding School.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit to this school the Department would like you to be good enough to furnish a report giving the names of the staff and the amount of salary which each receives and you should especially state fully the nature of the duties which each performs.\n\nThe last quarterly return received from this school shows that there were thirty-two pupils in residence and, if the salaries of the staff are paid from the per capita grant which the school receives for this number of pupils, it is thought that the expenditure for this purpose would be out of proportion to the other expenditures required in carrying on the work of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Townsend is Principal, and has everything to do with the teaching, and the acceptance and dismissal of pupils etc. Mr. C.F. Johnson is General Manager and has to do with everything relating to the plant and fabric including improvements. I think this arrangement will work satisfactorily as it will divide the responsibility. I visited the school in September and found everything going on very satisfactorily. I might mention that Miss F. Hutchison has resigned as she felt unable on account of her age to continue. Miss Sibley has been added to the staff as an assistant. I am glad to learn that a new workshop has been erected and also a septic tank built. It is a great pleasure to know that the Rev. J. Hawksley has been appointed as Indian Agent, and I am sure the Indian affairs of the Territory will be more satisfactorily attended to than formerly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 11, 1915.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to Your Lordship's letter of the 21st ultimo I beg to say that your request that all communications and cheques in connection with the day schools in the Yukon Territory should be sent to Your Lordship instead of to Archdeacon Ganham has been noted.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDept' of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated Nov 21st, 1914, file #297298/1 in reference to the apparently large staff employed at the Carcross Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn connection with the above I beg to submit the following report.\n\nDuring my visits to the Carcross School I was a guest there and thus had a good opportunity of observing the staff at their work. Their time was fully occupied with the various duties in the several departments, they appeared to have very little time for recreation, this was a matter I called to the attention of the Principal. In a place like Carcross where everything has to be done on the premises the work seems endless. My experience as Principal of the school for three years, 1906 to 1909 verifies this.\n\nBeing within easy reach of the Bishop of Yukon and wishing to supply the Department with accurate information as early as possible, as I do not anticipate having to visit the school until the opening of navigation (it being so costly to make a trip in winter) I interviewed the Bishop who kindly gave me the following information.\n\nThe present members of the staff are:-\nThe Rev W.T. Townsend, B.A. Principal.\nMr C.F. Johnson Manager.\nMrs * * * Housekeeper.\nMiss E.J. Naftel Girl's Matron.\nMiss A. Appleyard Boy's Matron.\nMiss R. Sibley Kitchen Assistant.\n\nThe Bishop says that he has gone into the matter very care-\nfully. It would be to the advantage to the Church of England financially to manage with a smaller staff inasmuch as the Gov't grant is not sufficient to cover all expenses and that he has to look to other sources for the balance. After several years experience, and after learning all he could from the experience of other such institutions he has come to the conclusion that six workers are essential to efficient service. It might be possible to manage with five but it would mean very hard work and considerable strain on each one.\n\nIn many cases workers in boarding schools throughout Canada have broken down in health because of the continuous strain. The workers have very little relaxation. In most avocations a person has some part of the day or week free from responsibility. In an Indian boarding school the strain is continuous, even Sunday is not exempt. A public school teacher for instance may have hard work and much responsibility from 9 A.M to 4 P.M but he or she has certain hours free from the responsibility and tension of keeping order and giving instruction. Such freedom is almost unknown in an Indian boarding school and can only be attained in any degree by having the helpers relieve one another. This cannot be done unless there is a sufficient number of workers. During the greater part of the day all the staff have some special duties, the children too have their allotted tasks to perform and as a rule they need constant supervision in order to have the work done properly and in a workmanlike way. If the work in the class room were all it would be a comparatively easy task, but instruction is also given in other branches of work, carpentry, work in the woods, hunting, fishing, printing, care of live stock, gardening, washing, ironing, mending, scrubbing, sewing and cooking, all these require more or less supervision.\n\nIt means so much to have the workers satisfied, with the present they are all satisfied, with one less they would all be dis-satisfied, I feel sure that resignations would be more frequent if the number were reduced.\nThe salaries paid are very small compared with the general run of salaries in the Yukon. They are as follows:\n\nRev W.T. Townsend - $1200 without board\nMr & Mrs Johnson - 900 with board\nMiss E.J. Naftel - 400\nMiss A. Appleyard - 400\nMiss R. Sibley - 300\n\nTheir duties overlap more or less but generally speaking may be designated as follows. Rev W.T. Townsend teaches the day school, gives physical drill, superintends the publication of the little paper \"Northern Lights\", takes the boys out at certain times, and as Principal sees after the acceptance and dismissal of the pupils, and conducts the general correspondence.\n\nMr Johnson has charge of the school plant, superintends the heating and water supply and has oversight of all the outdoor work of the pupils. He also looks after the hay and the firewood, gives instruction in the care of live stock, gardening, carpentry, and blacksmith work, in addition he has the ordering of supplies and keeps the accounts.\n\nMrs Johnson the housekeeper in addition to care of the food and clothing gives special instruction in cooking, jam making, and laundry work and many other small things that crop up daily take up her time and attention.\n\nMiss Naftel is girls matron, she teaches sewing, mending knitting, etc., and is responsible for the girls generally, their deportment and cleanliness.\n\nMiss Appleyard is the boys matron whose duties are similar to those of Miss Naftel, she also gives assistance in the laundry.\n\nMiss Sibleys duties are for the most part confined to the kitchen preparing meals with the assistance of one or two of the girl pupils and attending to the cleanliness of the kitchen utensils.\n\nMr Townsend is a qualified teacher with considerable exper-\nience, in addition to his work as principal of the school he has certain missionary duties to perform for this reason part of his salary is paid from Church sources.\n\nMr Johnson is peculiarly fitted for his position as manager. He is an engineer and a good all round mechanic and could get three times as much wages as an engineer. His ability as a mechanic to repair many things about the school which before his coming were done by a tradesman at the expense of the Department has undoubtedly saved the Dep't quite a sum of money, I might venture to say hundreds of dollars.\n\nMiss Naftel and Miss Appleyard have both had special training and a good deal of experience.\n\nMiss Sibley joined the staff last Sep't to fill the place vacant by the resignation of Miss Hutchison. It might be mentioned in passing that Miss Hutchison after leaving the school wrote (without any ulterior object) voluntarily expressing her opinion that six workers were necessary to carry on the work of the school efficiently.\n\nThe financial statement for the year ending March 31st 1913 showed a total expenditure of $7640.00. Last year it would be somewhat more. Deducting say $350.00 for Mr Townsend's board the total amount for salaries will be $2850.00 and board including Mr Townsend's entire salary, adding the board and salaries together for the whole staff it would not amount to more than is paid for the services of two qualified teachers in the public schools in Dawson.\n\nThe Bishop strongly expresses the opinion that a staff of six workers are absolutely necessary for the work. At the same time he states that he will gladly consider any recommendation from the Dep't and would like their opinion on the question after reading this report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, February 15, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo in reference to the staff employed at the Carcross Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that your explanations regarding the staff at present employed and the duties which each performs have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Being rather a heavy list I thought it better to submit it to the Department before incurring the expenditure with the suggestion that if sanction is given for the purchase of the drugs, they should be ordered from Vancouver as that would be cheaper than buying them here and the freight charges would be less.

The Department desires that you will purchase the articles in question in Vancouver from a firm on the patronage list and that you will arrange to have the drugs sent to the principal of the school at Carcross. The drugs should be pure and of the best quality and should be securely packed. A list of the articles supplied should accompany the consignment together with an account in detail and in duplicate for the goods and a receipt for the prepaid shipping charges. The principal of the school will be notified of the arrangement and told that when he receives the consignment he should certify the account for payment, provided he finds the drugs in good order. When the account reaches the Department it should be certified by the principal and the question of payment will be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. M.

Messrs Brown & Beaton of Vancouver have been requested to supply the articles in question and to make shipment to you. They have been told they should send with the drugs their account in duplicate and that they should attach thereto a receipt for the prepaid shipping charges. If the drugs reach you in good order, it is desired that you will certify the account and forward it to the Department with a view to payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

It is desired that you will supply the articles mentioned and that you will make shipment of the same to the Rev. W. T. Townsend, Principal, Carcross Indian Boarding School, Carcross, Yukon. The drugs should be pure and of the best quality and should be securely packed. You should send your account to Mr. Townsend and it should be rendered in duplicate. Kindly attach thereto a receipt for the prepaid shipping charges on the consignment. Kindly advise Mr. Townsend of the date of shipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMessrs. Brown & Beaton,\nDruggists,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, April 25th., 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th instant, I beg to say that Messrs. Brown & Beaton of Vancouver, have been requested to make shipment to the Rev. W. T. Townsend, Principal of the Carcross Indian Boarding School, of the drugs which the Department has been asked to supply for use at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Yukon.\nDiocesan News, General.\n\nRev. C. C. Brett, after five and a half years' work in the Diocese, has resigned and left for Eastern Canada the middle of February. He and Mrs. Brett and child, Marion, journeyed out from Selkirk by stage to Whitehorse.\n\nMr. Brett's work has been chiefly at Champagne and Teslin, which latter place he left last summer for Selkirk, much to the regret of the residents of Teslin, both Whites and Indians. Mr. Brett left entirely at his own request. We wish them every happiness and prosperity in their future sphere of work. We would not be surprised to hear of Mr. Brett being on his way to the front.\n\nJonathan Wood, an Indian Catechist from Moosehide, has gone with his family to Selkirk, where his wife's relations live. James Wood, his son, who recently graduated from the School, is to teach the Indian day School. 'Jimmie' was our head printer for two years.\n\nSt. Paul's, Dawson.\n\nThe annual congregational meeting was held on Monday evening January 16th. Various reports were submitted which showed growth in the Church's activities. The total income for the year 1915 amounted to $2940, being an increase of $800 on the previous year. Mr. A. C. Lee was reappointed Rector's Warden and Mr. W. G. Radford was elected People's Warden. In order that the parish may be better able to attain self support, Mr. Joseph Bunnell (Verger) and Mr. Alfred Ramsley (Side-man) have voluntarily undertaken to do the Janitor work for the year.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, February 6th., and also on March 10th., the Choir of St. Paul's Church rendered most acceptably a service of song. The entire collections, amounting to $97, were devoted to the Red Cross Society. Amongst the paper and silver money donated at the time of the first recital were two gold nuggets, which were afterwards valued at $7.\u2014A reminder of early days.\n\nPaardeburg Day, Sunday February 27th., was duly observed in Dawson by a joint service in St. Andrew's Church (Presbyterian), which was held under the auspices of the \"Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire.\" The Rev. F. H. Back read the lesson, and the Rector of St. Paul's delivered the address. The collection, which amounted to $863, was devoted to the \"Patriotic Fund.\"\n\nThe Dawson lodge of the Independent Order of Oddfellows attended divine service at St. Paul's on Sunday evening, March 5th. Bishop Stringer conducted the service and expressed a hearty welcome to the members and their friends, after which the Rector preached an appropriate sermon.\n\nThe pioneer Church of the Territory was fittingly honored on the evening of March 12th. by the attendance at St. Paul's of the Yukon Order of Pioneers. The occasion was unique, in that this was the first church parade organized by...\nthe Order. The members are real pioneers, since all 'mashed' into the Territory over the rugged Chilkoot or White Pass, before July 1st., 1899, that is previous to the time when the railway which now connects Skagway with Whitehorse commenced operations. In search for the gold that perishes the miners have undergone numerous hardships, and to the story of the unsearchable riches of Christ and the gold that perishes not, these present listened most attentively.\n\nSchool News.\n\nWe have been having trouble this quarter with the water supply. The water for the school ordinarily comes from a well beneath the basement, being pumped from there to a tank in the attic, from which the plumbing is supplied by gravity. This winter the well went dry, so all the water had to be hauled from the creek near the school. During the extremely cold weather the creek froze to bottom, and then the nearest water was a mile and a half away, except what was got by melting snow and ice.\n\nThe Right Rev. L.O. Stringer, our Bishop, visited the south end of his Diocese in March, and stayed a few days at the School. There was much to be done, and the Bishop had time for very little else besides business while he was here. On Saturday, March 25th., Rev. W.G. Blackwell and Mr. W.S. Watson came over from Whitehorse between trains, and the Bishop called a meeting of the Advisory Committee for the Southern Yukon. This committee consists of four members: Ven. Archdeacon Canham, Rev. W.G. Blackwell, W.S. Watson, Esq., and Rev. W.T. Townsend, with the Bishop as chairman. The Bishop returned to Whitehorse the same day. From there he has paid a short visit to Champagne Landing. He intends to visit several stations on his way back to Dawson.\n\nOn Friday, April 14th., Mr. Townsend made a trip to Tagish by dog team, and held service there on the following Sunday, returning to Carcross on Monday. On his return journey Mr. Townsend had a passenger, Mrs. Scott of Tagish, who is assisting in the school as Girls' Matron during Miss Naftel's absence. Mrs. Scott was at one time Matron of the Isolation Hospital at Edmonton, so found no difficulty in taking up the work at the School.\n\nOn April 19th., Miss Naftel left for a six weeks' holiday. She plans to reach Toronto in time for the annual meeting of the Diocesan Woman's Auxiliary, spending a couple of days in Victoria en route.\n\nThe Children of the School have taken a keen interest in the mite box collection. On Easter Sunday when the money was counted, there was an array of heads close around the desk. The amount given was fifteen dollars ($15).\n\nChrist Church, Whitehorse.\n\nOn Sunday, March 26th., the Bishop of Yukon administered the rite of Confirmation to four adult male candidates. The Bishop preached a very powerful sermon on Acts 8:17. After the service there was corporate communion for the newly confirmed candidates.\n\nOn April 11th., Bishop Stringer, assisted by the Rector, gave an illustrated\nNorthern Lights\n\nAddress all correspondence to the Editor of \"Northern Lights\", Carcross, Yukon Territory, Can.\n\nSubscription 25 cents a year.\n\nlecture to a large number of Indians from Champagne, Teslin, Laberge, and Whitehorse, which was enjoyed by all present.\n\nMrs. W. J. Studhart, secretary of the Woman's Auxiliary, received the sad news of the death of her brother at the front.\n\nCarmacks and Little Salmon.\n\nThe Indians have been keeping pretty well to the hills this year, as fur has been very plentiful and of good price. There was not the scarcity of food and consequent suffering that some of us anticipated.\n\nAbout the middle of January, Rev. C. Swanson went across to Ross River with an Indian, having a very good trip favored by fine weather all the way. On a long trip such as this (200 miles), a great deal depends on one's dogs by day and robe by night. The load consists of food for the trip, dog food (rice, grease and dry-meat), blankets, mail, extra clothes etc., snowshoes and an axe; in all about 100 pounds. With such a light load the driver can ride whenever he wishes. At night when making camp the order of the day is as follows. Make camp with green brush, cut dry wood and start a fire. Unhitch dogs and tie them up. Make tea and cook the food. Cook the dogs' food and feed them. Bed.\n\nThe trip was unfortunate in its results. The last day of the journey was windy. The first day at the Fort was very windy, the next was fifty degrees below zero, the next sixty, and so on for ten days. It seemed as if the weather had broken after twelve days, and the missionary was due home, so he started off.\n\nThe return trip was good, though cold, as it was from thirty to fifty below. Mr. Swanson travelled alone without mishap and duly arrived home in six days. The trail was heavy, and was badly drifted.\n\nAfter his return Mr. Swanson stayed at Carmacks for two months. Service were held for Whites and Indians. The former were much better attended than heretofore.\n\nThe Mission was honored in March by the arrival of the Bishop. He stayed four days and held one week night service, and as well visited everybody in the vicinity. There is one criticism to make of the visit\u2014it was not long enough. We are like Oliver Twist and want more\u2014much more!\n\nChurch Camp Mission.\n\nImmediately after Christmas Mr. Buck visited Sulphur, Granville, Humber and Dominion Creeks, holding services at the first three. In spite of the extremely cold weather there was a remarkably good attendance.\n\nAfter a short stay in Dawson the Missionary set out on a three weeks' trip to Steward City. Services were held at Quartz Creek, Eureka Creek, Black Hills, Henderson Creek and Steward City. At Quartz Creek and Black Hills nearly the whole population was present, and the interest shown in the smaller centres was equally fine. When men and women will come for miles on foot or by dog team amid the bitter cold of a Yukon winter to attend Christian worship, it may surely be believed that the force and value of religion is still being felt even in these days of materialism, where faith in God and the cross of Christ is to some a stumbling block and to some foolishness.\n\nDuring the extreme weather in the latter part of January and the beginning of February, except for a week-end trip to Bear Creek, the Missionary was\nNORTHERN LIGHTS.\n\ncompelled to remain in Dawson. As soon as the weather grew warmer Mr. Back paid another visit to Sulphur, Gold Run and Hunker Creeks, and then on February 28th set out for his second trip to Mayo. Except for glaciers and running water on Clear Creek the trail was good, and Minto Bridge was safely reached on March 5th. Two splendid services were held at Mayo Landing with an attendance of well over forty at each. The Indian settlement has, for a time at least, been transferred to thirty miles above Fraser Falls. This district is a little better hunting and trapping ground, and is removed from the insidious temptations of the saloon. Haggart, Galena, Johnson, Highway and Duncan Creeks were visited, and services held at the first three, and at Minto Bridge as well. The latter place is a distributing centre for the mines. The ore from the Silver King Mine is the richest yet taken out, and it is hoped that the mineral wealth of the district will attract many new settlers, and that a prosperous community will spring up. A church and library are badly needed at Mayo, where great interest has been shown in the religious work that has so far been accomplished. The trip back to Dawson (165 miles) was completed by the Missionary in 6\u00bd days, and was extremely difficult.\n\nMr. J. M. McCormick, the Superintendent at Winnipeg, is expected to visit the Yukon in the early summer, and a hearty welcome is assured him.\n\nSt. James', Fortymile.\n\nAn account of our Christmas entertainments, which was unavoidably postponed until New Year's Eve, was promised in this number. The immemorial event duly took place in the presence of a crowded audience of both white people and Indians. The tree was almost hidden by the splendidly brave array of glistening decorations and gifts. These latter were handed around accompanied by voice and gesture, and to the evident delight of the recipients. The children especially enjoyed the fun and the wonder of anticipation, as their little fingers fumbled with paper and string, in which many presents were carefully disposed. When the tree had assumed more or less its normal appearance, the strains of the gramophone were added to the incessant chatter and laughter which prevailed. The ceremony of providing for the comfort of the inner man was the next item on what proved to be a varied programme. A goodly supply of ham and meat sandwiches, and eggs ditto, was twice and thrice produced, followed by cakes enticing to the palate, and in addition \"the cup that cheers, but not inebriates\". The meeting had begun about 8.30, and as 11 o'clock approached, the reminder that the last half hour of the old year would be spent as belated so solemn a time, produced the necessary restraint over perfectly natural and delightful merriment. A hymn sung, verses read with remarks regarding life's prospect, the good resolutions made, the hope that the Great War would soon end followed by a lasting peace the outcome of the determination of an awakened earth, and that so far as may be, all wars, all cruelty and oppression may cease.\n\nOur heartiest thanks are given to the many good friends far and near whose kindly thoughts and deeds added so much materially to our success. The Mission Band of All Saints', Toronto, as usual was well to the fore with its many charming gifts.\n\nIt is most encouraging to relate as an instance of spiritual progress, that a Men's Bible Class has been started, and has, under God, every prospect of continuance.\n\nThis paper was set up and printed by the boys of the School.\nDawson, Y.T. May 19th, 1916.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of April 28th, file 297,298-1, in reference to the drugs which the Department has been asked to supply to the Carcross Indian Boarding School.\n\nThe Rev W.T. Townsend, principal has been notified that his request has been granted and that the drugs will be shipped direct to the School by Messrs. Brown & Beaton of Vancouver.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nA Trip to Rampart House.\n\nBY THE REV. J. A. DAVIES, B. A.\n\n\"May be we'll get away tonight\". Thus daily for two weeks did Mr. Schaefer, hunter and trapper, who had not been to town for twenty years, express the uncertainty of the departure of the trading boat \"Rampart\" bound on its annual return trip from Dawson to Rampart House. However a start was made on Wednesday afternoon, July 26th. At last it seemed as if patience had been rewarded as our craft was swept down stream at the thrilling rate of six miles an hour. A new boiler had just been installed, the ship's crew were Indians and four \"White\" had enjoyed a comparatively long stay in the midst of civilization, and things generally betokened a speedy trip. But within an hour and a half it was easily realized that something had gone wrong, for our boat was now drifting helplessly in a very swift current. Great fear was entertained lest the boat should strike a sandbar which stretched far into the river. Happily it was missed, and after twenty minutes in which time we had drifted a considerable distance, we were able to make shore. The needed repairs to the steam valves were of such a nature as to incur a delay of nineteen hours. Thursday, at midnight, we reached Forty Mile, the last Canadian port on the Yukon river. Here, with Mr. Field the Missionary-in-charge and other friends, an enjoyable chat about the war and other up-to-date topics was indulged in. The \"wee sma' hours\" came all too soon, when it became necessary to go aboard again. A heavy rain was falling, which easily penetrated the roof of a new cabin which had recently been built on the barge. On this occasion and many others, a couple of waterproof sheets rendered valuable service. We left Forty Mile, which is 32 miles from Dawson, at 6 A.M., and arrived at Eagle, the first stop in Alaska, at 3 P.M. Clearance papers had to be obtained, and two passenger boats made the port that afternoon, we were delayed 6 hours. The time on shore passed quickly, chatting with friends who were returning to Dawson, and who were vividly impressed with the sights and smells of our boat\u2014a mixture of dogs, Indians, dried meat, smoked fish, etc. The next town\u2014Circle City\u2014is 180 miles from Eagle, which we passed on Sunday evening. Earlier in the day the Indians on board sighted a porcupine climbing the river, and although the porcupine provides a favorite Indian dish, they refrained from killing it because of their respect for the day. After making shore a service was held which was attended by all on board. Schaefer remarked that he had not been to a service for more than a dozen years. Monday morning we left the mountains of the Upper Yukon and travelled through the Yukon flats for a distance of 90 miles, when we reached Fort Yukon, which stands in the Arctic circle. Fort Yukon is one of the oldest posts formerly occupied by the Hudson Bay Co., and the scene of many of the memorable labours of the late Archdeacon MacDonald.\n\nOne mile below Fort Yukon, the\nNorthern Lights\n\nAddress all correspondence to the Editor of \"Northern Lights\", Carcross, Yukon Territory, Can.\n\nSubscription 25 cents a year.\n\nPorcupine river, a side stream 1000 miles long, enters and discharges its waters. Our craft now left the Yukon waters and pushed upstream against the delightful current of the Porcupine. In the afternoon we landed for wood at an Indian camp and incidentally found an old squaw suffering from a badly festering head. After bathing the head with an antiseptic solution, some relief was afforded by the application of clean bandages and dressing. The next day was fine and dry when the washing was done before breakfast in the morning. Sally, an Indian girl returning from Carcross school, fell overboard. Fortunately she was seized instantly and lifted on deck, little the worse for her experience, though wet and affrighted. A series of minor accidents ensued during the next few days, such as bursting of steam pipes and the dripping of tubes. Delay seems to be the hallmark of travel up sidestreams in the North. The following Sunday I found a new treasure in the prayer book. Generally we think of the Prayer Book as being specially fitted for public use, but possibly it is equally profitable for private use, and specially in the light of its associations. Evening service was conducted by the Indians. The \"whites\" were unable to be present as they were engaged in making repairs necessitated by an accident which happened in the afternoon. The next evening we were afforded a rather exciting experience. We had now reached a sharp bend in the river where the water was very swift on a riffle, caused by a long gravel bar. The bank on the opposite side was undercut for several feet. The boat pulling with full steam almost attempted to force its way, but as soon as it reached the foot of the riffle the barge and boat were swept around and rushed downstream. Happily the engines responded promptly to the handling of the engineer and kept the boat in midstream, otherwise large and night might have been lost. A second attempt to pass the riffle proved successful, and when we got out for the night it was with feelings of thankfulness for travelling mercies vouchsafed through another day. One hundred miles from Fort Yukon we entered the mountainous region and saw the range of hills everywhere. Perhaps the most striking part is known as \"Howling Dog\". At this particular point the cliffs on both sides of the river are high and vertical, and of a beautiful brownish colour. When dogs were howling there they have no choice on whether the \"Howling Dog\" bluffs but to swim. Invariably as they pass these towering rocks they are said to howl; hence the name \"Howling Dog\". Thirty miles from Rampart House we encountered very smooth water again and were hours travelling further. Saturday evening we came to a cliff called \"Swoozie\" where it was necessary for nine men to pull on a line. After thirty minutes of strenuous hauling, when the boat was within a few feet of the head of the riffle, the line broke. The immediate result was that the boat and barge were violently rushed downstream and unfortunately the bottom of the barge struck a rock. After making sure it was found that the barge was leaking badly. One of the Indian boys was told off for the night to pump the water out of the barge until a steam syphon could be fixed. Instead of attending diligently to his duties he fell into the arms of Morpheus. About two Sunday morning, with a heavy rain falling, it was discovered that twenty cases of pneumonia developed in five, two of which were fatal. During the absence of Mr. Swanson at the camp, the services were conducted twice by Bishop Stringer and once by Archdeacon Cumham.\n\nSt. Paul's, Dawson.\n\nAt the request of the Bishop the Rector of St. Paul's, Rev. John A. Davies, has made a visit to Rampart House Mission. An account of the trip will be found in the leading article of this issue. Mr. Davies was away from Dawson for seven weeks. During his absence the Rev. F. H. Buck took charge of the parish, and conducted the regular services.\n\nSt. Paul's congregation is being greatly depleted. Many members have already left the North, and many more purpose leaving before the close of navigation. Many of the men of the Church have enlisted for overseas service, including former curate George Black, Captain Yukon Infantry Company, and William G. Radford, church warden.\n\nThe annual W.A. service was held in St. Paul's on August 15th. The Rev. D. Fitty administered the Holy Communion, assisted by Mr. Bush while Mr. J. M. McCormick, Superintendent of the Church Camp Missions preached the sermon.\n\nSt. Barnabas', Moosehide.\n\nThe Indians of the mission have lately been busy getting in their crops from the garden. Potatoes grew well this year. Chief Silas has two sows stored in the mission pig pen. The latter had about 400 lbs. of potatoes from his gardens, all of excellent quality. One man had some large cabbages and numbers of others have been grown. Meat has been fairly plentiful, as hounds have been occasionally seen up the Yukon. Some of the young men have been engaged on steamboats; others have been busy with rafts of wood, and helping white men on their farms. One or two of the older school boys have been so engaged.\n\nJames Wood and his father are back in the village. The latter gives valued help to the missionary. It is hoped that James will soon recommence his Sunday school class. The health of the village has been good for the last few months; and there is only one in the hospital at present.\n\nThe White River Indians had a happy and pleasant time here. Classes, services, and school were held for them, and a large number were confirmed. The Bishop and others visited the mission and rendered very great help. The natives very much appreciated what was done for them, and went back to their hunting grounds with happy and contented hearts. Julius Kendt has gone to teach the Indians at Mayo. He needs our prayers.\n\nSt. James', Forty-mile.\n\nThe peace and quiet of our parish was agreeably disturbed by visits of Dawson residents during the summer. Forty-mile has assumed a new role, independent of its mining industry, so greatly diminished of recent years, by becoming a centre for leisure resort. The cares and distractions of \"city life\" may henceforth be dissipated by sundry trips to the oldest camp in the Territory.\n\nThe Indians have had a successful fishing season and will continue the dog salmon fishing until the end of September. No sickness, either among the white people or natives, has occurred; and all are anticipating a happy and useful time during the long winter months.\n\nThrough the kindness of the Bishop and his Dawson friends, the expenses towards a new floor for the church have been met. The church is now in\nChurch Camp Mission.\n\nDuring the first week of July Mr. Buck visited the power plant of the Canadian Klondike Company at the North Fork of the Klondike. Here a huge reservoir is being constructed, which will supply the need of the Company for several years. A splendid service in the open air attended by the whole camp, was held by the missionary, and it certainly sounded grand to hear the old familiar tunes ring up to God in the great cathedral, of which the starry heavens formed the roof.\n\nEarly in July Mr. J. M. McCormick arrived from Winnipeg to inspect the work in the Yukon. No time was lost in commencing the work. Splendid services were held at Black Hills and Eagle Creek, where Mr. McCormick, with usual force told the people the \"old old story of Jesus and His love\". It is safe to say from the serious reverent faces of the men, and their hearty handshakes, that the message was not given in vain. The dining room of the Mission at Fox Gulch was visited, and a series of photographs taken of the different mining operations on Bonanza and Eldorado Creeks.\n\nThe following week Mr. McCormick, accompanied by Mr. Buck, journeyed to Mayo on the steamer \"Vigilante\". A splendid service was held by Mr. Buck at Fraser Falls among the Indians, and three babies were baptized. The missionary and an Indian boy rowed forty miles to Mayo next day. Highest Creek, Mint-a-Bridge, and the Silver King mine were visited in turn, and inspiring services were held.\n\nAfter this \"Mac the Sky Pilot\" and his crew returned to will be as well known and liked in the valley as he is among the railway construction camps of the Rockies, or the workers on the Welland Ship Canal, where the mission is performed so good a work for God. Leaving Mr. Buck at Mayo, Mr. McCormick returned to Dawson. A service at Mayo was held by the former, attended by nearly everyone in town, and the walls of the log school house rang as the dear missionary sang the well known hymn, \"Jesus loves me of all others most\". It is at times like these that one can set aside all his doubts and fears, and feel of a truth that God is close beside him. Before leaving the district, the missionary visited Haggard's Landing, a little English settlement away in the midst of the North, but where the services of the Church are indeed appreciated. Several requests for a celebration of the Holy Communion at the next visit of the missionary were received.\n\nOn the return trip Dawson a service was held on the S.S. \"Vigilante\". Many passengers from Dawson were on board, Capt. Barrington and all the men who could be spared were present. One of the men accompanied the singing on his guitar. The people remained for some hours after the service singing hymn after hymn. All agreed that they had seldom enjoyed a Sunday evening as they did that one.\n\nAs far as the facts go, Mr. McCormick left Dawson for his home in Winnipeg, accompanied by the best wishes of all with whom he came in contact during his brief stay in the Yukon. He suffered considerably from the unaccustomed fatigues of the long day's marches, but he bore them with the greatest calmness and self-control that have made him for so many years the leader in the Church's work among the men in the camps.\n\nFor the ensuing six weeks Mr. Buck remained in charge of the church in Dawson, in the absence of the Rev. J. A. Davies at Rampart House. Since the latter's return Mr. Buck has held services at Fox Gulch, Gold Run, and Sulphur Creek. As there were his farewell services before his journey outside with the Yukon Contingent, they were exceedingly well attended, despite the worst inclement weather and many were too weak to attend. We offer missionary's good luck and safe return. Next Sunday he will visit Quartz Creek, which will be his last service before leaving for the Front.\n\nSchool News.\n\nAgain there have been changes on the Staff. Mrs. Dean found the work very heavy, as her health was not of the best. She had wished to resign in June, but stayed on till late in August, as there was a little difficulty in finding a suitable worker. Miss C. E. Bennett, the new member of the Staff will be known, at least by name, to many of our readers. She is a graduate of the Danforth House in Toronto. Her experience in Indian work has been gained at Less Slave River, while she has had a couple of years experience in parish work at St. Paul's in Edmonton.\n\nNearly all the members of the Staff have now had their holidays. Miss Appleton spent hers at Fort Moody and Vancouver. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson and their two children are camping at Tagish. They have just sent in part of their sport some trout that would make English anglers green with envy.\n\nThis has been a season of visitors. Besides between two and three hundred tourists, we have had a number who were directly connected with the work in the Yukon. Mr. McCormick, Superintendent of the Church Camp Mission, was able to stay several days with us on his return from Dawson. Mr.\nThe past summer has been very unfavorable for gardening. The Spring was late and cold, so that many of the crops did not germinate. Yet in spite of many blights and in the absence of our potato crop, we had a harvest yet. The yield was as follows:\u2014 Potatoes 15 bushels, turnips 50 bushels, carrots 5 bushels, and other garden truck in good quantities. The fall semester had a telling effect on our crops. We managed to get sufficient for our needs, but the quality is much inferior to other years.\n\nThe School gratefully acknowledges bales from the following churches: St. James\u2019 Cathedral, Church of the Redeemer, St. Michael\u2019s of Montreal; St. George\u2019s of Kingston; St. Mark\u2019s, St. Michael\u2019s, St. Paul\u2019s, All Saints\u2019, St. James\u2019 and St. George\u2019s of Vancouver; St. Matthew\u2019s of Abbotsford, B.C.; and one bale from Tamworth, Ont.\n\nA PRAYER USED AT NOON HOUR, BY THE CHILDREN OF THE SCHOOL.\n\nO Lord, we pray Thee for our soldiers, who are fighting the battles of our country, lead them on at all times to put their trust in Thee; give them courage in time of danger, and mercy in time of victory. We also pray Thee, O our God, for the doctors, nurses, and others engaged in their service and skill in the healing both of pain and sorrow; And all we ask in the name of our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nThis paper was set up and printed by Alfred Ellis, Frederick Boss, and David Kwatlatl, pupils of the Chooutla Indian School.\n\nWhen the wind was favourable, we made use of an improvised sail but for 4 days the wind was contrary and we were compelled to use the oars. The return trip to Fort Yukon occupied 6 days during which time I conducted 3 Communion services\u2014each time to Indians isolated from the missions. By day we ate fish, ducks, fish, and moose, and at night the camp was set by night slept beneath the trees. On returning at Fort Yukon the social life of the Indians proved that I was a temporary Indian in more ways than one.\n\nOn account of a delay in the steam boats up bound on the Yukon a stoppage of 10 days was unavoidable. However, the opportunity of addressing the Fort Yukon Indians was afforded by the courtesy of the Rev. William Loebl, native missionary at Fort George, and also of assisting the medical mission of Dr. Burke, in his services for the \u201cwhite\u201d population. Moreover it was a great pleasure to enjoy the friendship and hospitality of Dr. and Mrs. Burke. It may be of interest to note that when a boy William Loebl was trained by the late Arch-\nStaff\n\nPATRON.\n\nRight Rev. I. O. Stringer, B.A., D.D\nBishop of Yukon.\n\nRev. W. T. Townsend, B.A., B.D.\nPrincipal & Editor of Northern Lights\n\nMr. C. F. Johnson, Manager.\n\nMiss A. Applevard, Housekeeper.\n\nMiss E. J. Naftel, Girls' Matron.\n\nMiss C. E. Bennett, Boys' Matron.\n\nDeacon MacDonald and is a living testimony to the enduring and valuable work accomplished by the veteran pioneer missionary amongst the natives of the North, both in Alaska and Yukon. A steamer up-bound reached Fort Yukon September 6th, which conveyed me back to Dawson by the 11th. As an experience the trip was invaluable. It afforded me the opportunity to understand the Indian more fully, and acquaint oneself with the necessity of living with the Indian in order to reach him personally and spiritually. Moreover one cannot but feel most strongly that it is the duty of the Church to provide the Indian with such training, moral and intellectual, whereby he may protect himself from the many ravages which have beset him since the advent of the miner and trapper.\n\nDiocesan News, General.\n\nAgain the work in the Yukon is meeting with losses. Before this paper reaches our readers the \"Nestor\" of the Yukon clergy will have left the Diocese. Archdeacon Canham has been in the North since the early eighties. Among other places he has been stationed at Fort McPherson, Tanana, Selkirk, and Carcross. At the last named place he has resided for the past six years, where his many friends deeply regret that Mrs. Canham's failing health compels him to leave the North. Dr. Canham's advice, founded on years of experience, will be a real loss to the work in the Diocese.\n\nRev. F. H. Buck, who for the past year has done such splendid work among the miners on the Klondike Creeks, has enlisted for overseas service. We are sure that the prayers of our readers will be constant for his safe return to his work in the far North.\n\nIn mission work as in everything else, when the men go to the Front the women take their place as far as possible. The Bishop has secured one new worker, Miss Kathleen Martin of Vancouver. Miss Martin is to teach the Indian day school at Selkirk, and incidentally to do as much mission work among the natives as possible.\n\nChrist Church, Whitehorse.\n\nRev. C. Swanson took charge here, holding his first services on July 9th. Whitehorse is a prosperous place at present, as the copper mines close to town are all working at high pressure. There are close to 250 men working there, or as many as the total population of Whitehorse. In addition the mines at Conrad, and other places, which have been long idle have now restarted.\n\nAn epidemic of measles has been sweeping through the town, affecting both Whites and Indians. The latter were isolated in the Reserve some three miles from Whitehorse, with a constable of the R. N. W. M. P. and Mr. Swanson to look after them. Thanks to the energetic measures of quarantine enforced by the Police, the epidemic was stamped in three weeks. No fresh cases have been reported. When the adult women began to be affected, the authorities sent a woman from the town, who looked after the children and taught them much needed lessons in cleanliness. This disease (measles, not cleanliness) is very virulent among the\nA Trip to Rampart House.\n\nBy the Rev. J. A. Davies, B. A.\n\n\"May be we'll get away tonight\". Thus daily for two weeks, did Ab. Schafer, hunter and trapper, who had not been to town for twenty years, express the uncertainty of the departure of the trading boat \"Rampart\" bound on its annual return trip from Dawson to Rampart House. However a start was made on Wednesday afternoon, July 26th. At last it seemed as if patience had its reward as our craft was swept down stream at the thrilling rate of six miles an hour. A new boiler had been installed, the ship's crew\u2014five Indians and four \"Whites\"\u2014had enjoyed a comparatively long stay in the midst of civilization, and things generally betokened a speedy trip. But within an hour and a half it was easily realized that something had gone wrong, for our boat was now drifting helplessly in a very swift current. Great fear was entertained lest the boat should strike a sand bar which stretched far into the river. Happily it was missed, and after twenty minutes, in which time we had drifted a considerable distance, we were able to make shore. The needed repairs to the steam valves were of such a nature as to incur a delay of nineteen hours. Thursday, at midnight, we reached Forty Mile, the last Canadian port on the Yukon river. Here, with Mr. Field the Missionary-in-charge and other friends, an enjoyable chat about the war and other up-to-date topics was indulged in. The \"wee sma' hours\" came all too soon, when it became necessary to go aboard again. A heavy rain was falling, which easily penetrated the roof of a new cabin which had recently been built on the barge. On this occasion and many others, a couple of water-proof sheets rendered valuable service. We left Forty Mile, which is 52 miles from Dawson, at 6 A.M., and arrived at Eagle, the first stop in Alaska, at 3 P.M. Clearance papers had to be signed, and, as two passenger boats made the port that afternoon, we were delayed 6 hours. The time on shore passed quickly, chatting with friends who were returning to Dawson, and who were vividly impressed with the sights and smells of our boat\u2014a mixture of dogs, Indians, dried meat, smoked fish, etc. The next town\u2014Circle City\u2014is 180 miles from Eagle, which we passed on Sunday evening. Earlier in the day the Indians on board sighted a porcupine swimming the river, and although the porcupine provides a favourite Indian dish they refrained from killing it because of their respect for the day. After making shore a service was held which was attended by all on board. Schafer remarked that he had not been to a service for more than a dozen years. Monday morning we left the mountains of the Upper Yukon and travelled through the Yukon flats for a distance of 90 miles, when we reached Fort Yukon, which is within the Arctic circle. Fort Yukon is one of the oldest posts, formerly occupied by the Hudson Bay Co., and the scene of many of the memorable labours of the late Archdeacon MacDonald.\n\nOne mile below Fort Yukon, the\nNorthern Lights\n\nAddress all correspondence to the Editor of \"Northern Lights\", Carcross, Yukon Territory, Can.\n\nSubscription 25 cents a year.\n\nPorcupine river, a side stream 1000 miles long, enters and discharges its waters. Our craft now left the Yukon waters and pushed upstream against the delightfully clear current of the Porcupine. In the afternoon we stopped for wood at an Indian camp and incidentally found an old squaw suffering with a badly festering boil. After bathing her hand in an antiseptic solution some relief was afforded by the application of clean bandages and dressing. The next day was laundry day when the washing was done before breakfast. At noon Sally, an Indian girl returning from a successful hunt fell into the river. Fortunately she was seized instantly and lifted on deck, little the worse for her experience except wet and affrighted.\n\nA series of minor accidents occurred during the next few days, such as bursting of steam pipes and the dumping of tubs. Delay seems to be the hallmark of travel up side streams in the North. The following Sunday I found a new treasure in the Prayer Book. Generally we think of the Prayer Book as being only suitable for public use but possibly it is equally profitable for private use and specially in the light of its associations. Evening service was conducted for the Indians. The \"whites\" were unable to be present as they were engaged in other work which necessitated an accident which happened in the afternoon. The next evening we were afforded a rather exciting experience. We had now reached a sharp bend in the river where the water was very swift on a riffle, caused by a long gravel bar. The bank on the opposite side was undercut for several feet. The boat pulling with full steam ahead attempted to force its way, but as soon as it reached the foot of the riffle it began to list to one side and immediately rushed downstream. Happily the engines responded promptly to the handling of the engineer and kept the boat in midstream, otherwise barge and freight might have been lost. A second attempt to pass over the riffle proved successful and shortly after noon on the night it was with feelings of thankfulness for travelling mercies we chafed through another day. One hundred miles from Port Yukon we returned to the mountainous region and saw the majestic range of the Rockies. Perhaps the most striking peak is known as \"Howling Dog.\" At this particular point the cliffs on both sides of the river are high and vertical, and of a beautiful brownish colour. When dogs are heard howling there is no chance on reaching the \"Howling Dog\" bluffs but to swim. Invariably they pass these towering rocks they are said to howl, hence the name \"Howling Dog.\" has been introduced. Thirty miles from Rampart House we encountered very swift water and again passed several hours travelling 3 miles. Saturday evening we came to a riffle named \"Sweegee\" where it was necessary for 9 men to pull on a line. After 30 minutes of strenuous hauling, when the boat was within a short set of the head of the riffle, the line broke. The immediate result was that the barge and barge were violently rushed downstream and unfortunately the bottom of the barge struck a rock. After making a thorough examination it was found that the barge was leaking badly. One of the Indians boys was told off for the night to pump the water out of the barge until a steam syphon could be fixed. Instead of attending diligently to his duties he fell into the arms of Morpheus. About two Sunday morning, with a heavy rain falling, it was discovered that the Indians had been busy getting in their crops from the garden. Potatoes grew well this year. Chief Silas has two sacks stored in the missionary's cellar. The latter had about 600 lbs. of potatoes from his garden, all of excellent quality. One man had some large cabbages, and members of others have been grown. Meat has been fairly plentiful, as hunting trips are occasionally made up the Yukon. Some of the young men have been engaged on steamboats; others have been busy with rafts of wood, and helping white men on their farms. One or two of the older school boys have been so engaged.\n\nSt. Paul's, Dawson.\n\nAt the request of the Bishop the Rector of St. Paul's, Rev. John A. Davies, has made a visit to Rampart House Mission. An account of the trip will be found in the leading article of this issue. Mr. Davies was away from Dawson for seven weeks. During his absence the Rev. F. H. Buck took charge of the parish and conducted the regular services.\n\nSt. Paul's congregation is being greatly depleted. Many members have already left the North, and many more purpose leaving before the close of navigation. Several of the members of the church have enlisted for overseas service, including Commissioner George Black, Captain Yukon Infantry Company, and William G. Radford, church warden.\n\nThe annual W. A. service was held in St. Paul's on August 15th. The Rev. B. Totty administered the Holy Communion, assisted by Mr. Buck; while Mr. J. M. McCormick, Superintendent of the Church Camp Missions preached the sermon.\n\nSt. Barnabas', Moosehide.\n\nThe Indians of the mission have lately been busy getting in their crops from the garden. Potatoes grew well this year. Chief Silas has two sacks stored in the missionary's cellar. The latter had about 600 lbs. of potatoes from his garden, all of excellent quality. One man had some large cabbages, and members of others have been grown. Meat has been fairly plentiful, as hunting trips are occasionally made up the Yukon. Some of the young men have been engaged on steamboats; others have been busy with rafts of wood, and helping white men on their farms. One or two of the older school boys have been so engaged.\n\nJames Wood and others are back in the village. The latter gives valued help to the missionary. It is hoped that James will soon recommence his Sunday school class. The health of the village has been good for the last few months; and there is only one in the hospital at present.\n\nThe Peel River Indians had a happy and pleasant time here. Classes, services, and school were held for them, and a large number were confirmed. The Bishop and others visited the mission and met the Peel River Indians. The natives very much appreciated what was done for them, and went back to their hunting grounds with happy and contented hearts. Julius Kendi has gone to teach the Indians at Mayo. He needs our prayers.\n\nSt. James', Fortymile.\n\nThe peace and quiet of our parish was agreeably disturbed by visits of Dawson residents during the summer. Forty mile has assumed a new role, independent of the mining industry, so greatly diminished of recent years, by blossoming out into a health resort. The cares and distractions of \"city life\" may henceforth be dissipated by sundry trips to the oldest camp in the Territory.\n\nThe Indians have had a successful fishing season, and will continue the dog salmon fishing until the end of September. No sickness, either among the white people or natives, has occurred; and all are anticipating a happy and useful time during the long winter months.\n\nThrough the kindness of the Bishop and his Dawson friends, the expenses towards a new floor for the church have been met. The church is now in\nChurch Camp Mission.\n\nDuring the first week of July Mr. Buck visited the power plant of the Canadian Klondike Company at the North Fork of the Klondike. Here a huge reservoir is being constructed, which will supply the needs of the Company for some time. A splendid service in the open air attended by the whole population was held by the missionary, and it certainly sounded grand to hear the old familiar tunes ring up to God in the great cathedral, of which the starry heavens formed the roof.\n\nEarly in July, Mr. J. M. McCormick arrived at Winnipeg to inspect the work in the Yukon. No time was lost in commencing the work. Splendid services were held at Black Hills and Eureka Creeks, where Mr. McCormick, with usual zeal, told the people the story of the glory of Jesus and His love. It is safe to say from the serious reverent faces of the men, and their hearty hand clasps, that the message was not given in vain. The reading room of the Mission at Fox Gulch was visited, and a series of photographs taken of the district, including pictures on Bonanza and Eldorado Creeks.\n\nThe following week Mr. McCormick, accompanied by Mr. Buck, journeyed to Mayo on the good ship \"Civilian.\" A splendid service was held by Mr. Buck at Fraser Falls among the Indians, and three babies were baptized. The missionary and an Indian boy rowed forty miles to Mayo next day. Higher Creek, Minta Bridge, and the Silver King mine were visited in turn, and inspiring services were held. After this, \"Mae the Sky Pilot\" and his cheery personality will be as well known and liked in the Yukon as he is among the railway construction camps of the Rockies, or among those of the Welland Ship Canal, where the mission is performing so great a work for God. Leaving Mr. Buck at Mayo, Mr. McCormick returned to Dawson. A service at Mayo was held by the former, attended by nearly everyone in town; and the skills of the big bass drum and the deep manly voices sang the well-known hymn, \"Jesus lover of my soul.\"\n\nIt is at times like these that one can lay aside all his doubts and fears, and feel a truth that God is close beside him. Before leaving the district the missionary visited Quartz Creek, a little English settlement away in the wilderness of the North, but where the services of the Church are indeed appreciated. Several requests for a celebration of the Holy Communion at the next visit of the missionary were made.\n\nOn the return trip to Dawson a service was held on the S.S. \"Vidette.\" Many passengers from Dawson were on board. Capt. Barrington and all the men who could be spared were present. One of the men accompanied the singing on his guitar. The people remained some hours after the service singing hymns. After the hymn, all agreed that they had seldom enjoyed a Sunday evening as they did that one.\n\nA few days later Mr. McCormick left Dawson for his home in Winnipeg, accompanied by his best wishes of all with whom he came in contact during his brief stay in the Yukon. He suffered considerably from the unaccustomed fatigues of the longday's marches, but he bore them with the same gameness and self-control that have made him for so many years the leader in the Church's work among the men in the camps.\n\nFor the ensuing six weeks Mr. Buck remained in charge of the church in Dawson, in the absence of the Rev. J. A. Davie at Rampart House. Since the latter's return Mr. Buck has held services at Fox Gulch, Galt River, and Chipibin Creek. As there were his fare well services before his journey outside with the Yukon Contingent, they were exceedingly well attended, despite the most inclement weather; and many were the wishes expressed for the success and safety of the return. Next Sunday he will visit Quartz Creek, which will be his last service before leaving for the Front.\n\nSchool News.\n\nAgain there have been changes on the staff. Miss Dean found the work very heavy as her health was not of the best. She had wished to resign in June, but stayed on till late in August, as there was a little difficulty in finding a suitable worker. Miss C. E. Bennett, the new member of the Staff, will be known at least as near to many of our readers as she is a graduate of the Deafness House in Toronto. Her experience in Indian work has been gained at Lesser Slave Lake, while she has had a couple of years experience in parish work at St. Paul's, Edmonton.\n\nNearly all members of the Staff have now had their holidays. Miss Appleyard spent hers at Port Moody and Vancouver. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson and their two children are camping at Tagish. They have just sent in a part of their crops, some root that would make Eastern gardens green with envy.\n\nThis has been a summer of visitors. Besides between two and three hundred tourists, we have had a number who were directly connected with the work in the Yukon. Mr. McCormick, Superintendent of the Church Camp Mission, was able to stay several days with us on his return from Dawson. Mr.\nThe past summer has been very unfavourable for gardening. The Spring was late and cold, so that many of the seeds did not germinate. Yet in spite of many blank places in the field our potato crop was the largest yet. The yield was as follows: Potatoes 15 bushels, turnips 50 bushels, carrots 5 bushels, and other garden truck in small quantities. The dry summer had a telling effect on our hay crop. We managed to get sufficient for our needs, but the quality is much inferior to other years.\n\nThe school gratefully acknowledged gifts from the following churches: St. James' Cathedral, Church of the Redeemer, St. Simon's and St. Paul's of Toronto; St. Martin's of Montreal; St. George's of Kingston; St. Mark's, St. Michael's, St. Paul's, All Saints', St. James' and St. George's of Vancouver; St. Matthew's of Abbotsford, B.C.; and one bale from Tamworth, Ont.\n\nA PRAYER USED AT NOON HOUR BY THE CHILDREN OF THE SCHOOL.\n\nO Lord, we pray Thee for our soldiers and sailors, who are fighting the battles of our country; teach them at all times to put their trust in Thee; give them courage in time of danger, and mercy in time of sickness. We also pray Thee, O God, for the doctors, nurses and ministers, give them tenderness and skill in the healing both of pain and sorrow: And all we ask in the name of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.\n\nAmen.\n\nThis paper was set up and printed by Alfred Ellis, Frederick Boss, and David Kwatayi, pupils of the Choontla Indian School.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nPATRON.\n\nRight Rev.

As an experience the trip was invaluable. It afforded me the opportunity to understand the Indians more fully, and acquaint oneself with the necessity of living with the Indians in order to reach him personally and spiritually. Moreover one cannot but feel most strongly that it is the duty of the Church to provide the Indian with such training, moral and intellectual, whereby he may protect himself from the many ravages which have beset him since the advent of the miner and trapper.\n\nDiocesan News, General.\n\nAgain the work in the Yukon is meeting with losses. Before this paper reaches our readers the \"Nestor\" of the Yukon clergy will have left the Diocese. Archdeacon Canham has been in the North since the early eighties. Among other places he has been stationed at Fort McPherson, Tanana, Selkirk, and Carcross. At the last named place he has resided for the past six years, where his many friends deeply regret that Mrs. Canham's failing health compels him to leave the North. Dr. Canham's advice, founded on years of experience, will be a real loss to the work in the Diocese.\n\nRev. F. H. Buck, who for the past year has done such splendid work among the miners on the Klondike Creeks, has enlisted for overseas service. We are sure that the prayers of our readers will be constant for his safe return to his work in the far North.\n\nIn mission work as in everything else, when the men go to the Front the women take their place as far as possible. The Bishop has secured one new worker, Miss Kathleen Martin of Vancouver. Miss Martin is to teach the Indian day school at Selkirk, and incidentally to do as much mission work among the natives as possible.\n\nChrist Church, Whitehorse.\n\nRev. C. Swanson took charge here, holding his first services on July 9th. Whitehorse is a prosperous place at present, as the copper mines close to town are all working at high pressure. There are close to 250 men working there, or as many as the total population of Whitehorse. In addition the mines at Conrad, and other places, which have been long idle have now restarted.\n\nAn epidemic of measles has been sweeping through the town, affecting both Whites and Indians. The latter were isolated in their Reserve some three miles from the townhouse, with a constable of the R. N. W. M. P. and Mr. Swanson to look after them. Thanks to the energetic measures of quarantine enforced by the Police, the epidemic was stopped in three weeks. No fresh cases have been reported. When the adult women began to be affected, the authorities sent a woman from the town, who looked after the children and taught them much needed lessons in cleanliness. This disease (measles, not clearliness) is very virulent among the\nNorthern Lights.\n\nPublished at the Chootla Indian School.\n\nNo. IV. CAR CROSS, YUKON TERRITORY, CAN., NOV., 1916 Vol. IV\n\nA Trip to Rampart House.\n\nBy the Rev. J. A. Davies, B. A.\n\n\"May be we'll get away tonight.\"\n\nThus daily for two weeks did Ab. Schaefer, hunter and trapper, who had not been to town for twenty years, express the uncertainty of the departure of the trading boat \"Rampart\" bound on its annual return trip from Dawson to Rampart House. However a start was made on Wednesday afternoon, July 26th. At last it seemed as if patience had its reward as our craft was swept downstream at the thrilling rate of six miles an hour. A new boiler had been installed, the ship's crew five Indians and four \"Whites\" had enjoyed a comparatively long stay in the midst of civilization, and things generally betokened a speedy trip. But within an hour and a half it was easily realized that something had gone wrong, for our boat was now drifting helplessly in a very swift current. Great fear was entertained lest the boat should strike a sandbar which stretched far into the river. Happily it was missed, and after twenty minutes in which time we had drifted a considerable distance, we were able to make shore. The dreaded remains to the steam valves were of such a nature as to incur a delay of nineteen hours.\n\nThursday, at midnight, we reached Forty Mile, the last Canadian port on the Yukon river. Here, with Mr. Field the Missionary-in-charge and other friends, an enjoyable chat about the war and other up-to-date topics was indulged in. The \"wee sma' hours\" came all too soon, when it became necessary to go aboard again. A heavy rain was falling, which easily penetrated the roof of a new cabin which had recently been built on the barge. On this occasion and many others, a couple of waterproof sheets rendered valuable service. We left Forty Mile, which is 32 miles from Dawson, at 6 A.M. and arrived at Eagle, our first stop in Alaska, at 3 P.M. Clearance papers had to be signed, and as two passenger boats made the port that afternoon, we were delayed 6 hours. The time on shore passed quickly, chatting with friends who were returning to Dawson and who were vividly impressed with the sights and smells of our boat\u2014a mixture of dogs, Indians, dried meat, smoked fish, etc. The next town\u2014Circle City\u2014is 180 miles from Eagle, which we passed on Sunday evening. Earlier in the day the Indians on board sighted a porcupine swimming the river, and although the porcupine provides a favourite Indian dish, they refrained from killing it because of their respect for the day. After making shore a service was held which was attended by all on board. Schaefer remarked that he had not been to a service for more than a dozen years. Monday morning we left the mountains of the Upper Yukon and travelled through the Yukon flats for a distance of 90 miles, when we reached Fort Yukon, which is within the Arctic circle. Fort Yukon is one of the oldest posts, formerly occupied by the Hudson Bay Co., and the scene of many of the memorable labours of the late Archdeacon MacDonald.\n\nOne mile below Fort Yukon, the\nNorthern Lights\n\nAddress all correspondence to the Editor of \"Northern Lights\", Carcross, Yukon Territory, Can.\n\nSubscription 25 cents a year.\n\nPorcupine river, a side stream 1000 miles long, enters and discharges its waters. Our craft now left the Yukon waters and pushed upstream against the delightfully clear current of the Porcupine. In the afternoon we stopped for wood at an Indian camp and incidentally found an old squaw suffering with a badly festering hand. After bathing the hand with an antiseptic solution, some relief was afforded by the application of clean bandages and dressing. The next day was laundry day when the washing was done before breakfast. A noon, usually an abundant returning from Carcross school, fell overboard. Fortunately she was seized instantly and lifted on deck, little the worse for her experience except wet and affrighted.\n\nA series of minor accidents occurred during the next few days, such as bursting of steam pipes and the dropping of tubes. Delay seems to be the hallmark of travel up sidestreams in the North. The following Sunday I found a new treasure in the Prayer Book. Generally we think of the Prayer Book as being specially fitted for public use, but possibly it is equally profitable for private use, and specially in the light of its associations. Evening service was conducted for the Indians. The \"whites\" were unable to be present as they were engaged in making repairs necessitated by an accident which happened in the afternoon. The next evening we were afforded a rather exciting experience. We had now reached a sharp bend in the river where the water was very swift on a riffle, caused by a long gravel bar. The bank on the opposite side was undercut for several feet. The boat pushing with full steam ahead attempted to force its way, but as soon as it reached the foot of the riffle the barge and boat were swept around and rushed downstream. Happily the engines responded promptly to the handling of the engineer and kept the boat in midstream, otherwise barge and freight might have been lost. A second attempt to pass over the riffle proved successful, and when we tied up for the night it was with feelings of thankfulness for travelling mercies vouchsafed through another day. One hundred miles from Fort Yukon we returned to the mountainous region and saw the majesty of Nature everywhere. Probably the most striking part is known as \"Howling Dog\". At this particular point the cliffs on both sides of the river are high and vertical, and of a beautiful brownish colour. When dogs are travelling on shore they have no choice on reaching the \"Howling Dog\" bluffs but to swim. Invariably as they pass these towering rocks they are said to howl; hence the name \"Howling Dog\" has been introduced. Thirty miles from Rampart House we encountered very swift water once again and were 6 hours travelling 3 miles. Saturday evening we came to a riffle named \"Sweezer\" where it was necessary for 9 men to pull on a line. After 30 minutes of strenuous hauling, when the boat was within a few feet of the head of the riffle, the line broke. The immediate result was that the boat and barge were violently rushed downstream and unfortunately the bottom of the barge struck a rock. After making shore it was found that the barge was leaking badly. One of the Indian boys was told off for the night to pump the water out of the barge until a steam syphon could be fixed. Instead of attending diligently to his duties he fell into the arms of Morpheus. About two Sunday morning, with a heavy rain falling, it was dis-\nSt. Paul's, Dawson.\n\nAt the request of the Bishop the Rector of St. Paul's, Rev. John A. Davies, has made a visit to Rampart House Mission. An account of the trip will be found in the leading article of this issue. Mr. Davies was away from Dawson for several weeks. During his absence the Rev. F. H. Buck took charge of the parish, and conducted the regular services.\n\nSt. Paul's congregation is being greatly depleted. Many members have already left the North, and many more propose leaving before the close of navigation. Many of the men of the Church have enlisted for overseas service, including Commissioner George Black, Captain Yukon Infantry Company, and William G. Radford, church warden.\n\nThe annual W. A. service was held in St. Paul's on August 15th. The Rev. B. Totty administered the Holy Communion, assisted by Mr. Buck; while Mr. J. M. McCormick, Superintendent of the Church Camp Missions preached the sermon.\n\nSt. Barnabas', Moosehide.\n\nThe Indians of the mission have lately been busy getting in their crops from the garden. Potatoes grew well this year. Chief Silas has two sacks stored in the missionary's cellar. The latter had about 600 lbs. of potatoes from his gardens, all of excellent quality. One man had some large cabbages and members of others have been grown.\n\nMeat has been fairly plentiful, as hunting trips are occasionally made up the Yukon. Some of the young men have been engaged on steamboats; others have been busy with rafts of wood, and helping white men on their farms. One or two of the older school boys have been so engaged.\n\nJames Wood and his father are back in the village. The latter gives valued help to the missionary. It is hoped that James will soon recommence his Sunday school class. The health of the village has been good for the last few months; and there is only one in the hospital at present.\n\nThe Peel River Indians had a happy and pleasant time here. Classes, services, and school were held for them, and a large number were confirmed. The Bishop and others visited the mission and rendered very great help. The natives very much appreciated what was done for them, and went back to their hunting grounds with happy and contented hearts. Julius Kendi has gone to teach the Indians at Mayo. He needs our prayers.\n\nSt. James', Fortymile.\n\nThe peace and quiet of our parish was agreeably disturbed by visits of Dawson residents during the summer. Forty mile has assumed a new role, independent of its mining industry, so greatly diminished of recent years, by blossoming out into a health resort. The cares and distractions of \"city life\" may henceforth be dissipated by sundry trips to the oldest camp in the Territory.\n\nThe Indians have had a successful fishing season, and will continue the dog salmon fishing until the end of September. No sickness, either among the white people or natives, has occurred; and all are anticipating a happy and useful time during the long winter months.\n\nThrough the kindness of the Bishop and his Dawson friends, the expenses towards a new floor for the church have been met. The church is now in\ngood condition throughout, and a Celtic cross crowns the little belfry. Again we wish to express our thanks to all kind friends, both in Dawson and in our little parish, who have so liberally assisted in the completion of the work.\n\nThe services continue to be regularly attended by white people and Indians respectively. The school (except for about three weeks) was kept open during the holiday season three or four days a week. It was considered that the usual long period of holiday was a detriment to successful progress in school work. The men's Bible class is held regularly once a week.\n\nGreat interest was taken in the plebiscite held on August 30th. The voting took place at the post office. Seventeen votes were cast, ten being in favor of Prohibition and seven against. This unexpected result caused much satisfaction to the \"dry\" supporters.\n\nA remarkable instance of two unarmed men, by name Dryden and Sparks, beating off a bear with sticks, occurred on polling day. The men were on their way from their claim to vote, when their dog disturbed a bear and her cubs cranberry feeding. At a call from his master the dog returned followed by the bear, which immediately attacked Dryden, who, seizing a stick, attempted to defend himself. Accidentally falling, the bear now fully enraged, jumped on him, pinning him to the ground. His companion also arming himself with a stout cudgel, belabored the bear's nose to such effect as to cause her to release her victim and to turn upon her new assailant. Blow after blow was aimed at this vulnerable part of bear anatomy, whose owner, recognizing that discretion was the better part of valor, finally quitted the field. As a matter of fact the creature's nose was so badly punished, that for many a long day she will probably not look a human being in the face. Dryden and Sparks beat a hasty retreat, ever and anon looking back for fear of a renewed assault. Dryden was badly bruised and scratched about the face and shoulder, but otherwise was uninjured. He declares that but for the prompt and courageous conduct of his friend he must have lost his life, being absolutely at the bear's mercy. This story is one of the few bear stories which possesses the merit of being true.\n\nChurch Camp Mission.\n\nDuring the first week of July Mr. Buck visited the power plant of the Canadian Klondike Company at the North Fork of the Klondike. Here a huge reservoir is being constructed, which will supply the need of the Company for some time. A splendid service in the open air, attended by the whole camp, was held by the missionary, and it certainly sounded grand to hear the old familiar tunes ring up to God in the great cathedral, of which the starry heavens formed the roof.\n\nEarly in July, Sup't J. M. Mc Cormick arrived from Winnipeg to inspect the work in the Yukon. No time was lost in commencing the work. Splendid services were held at Black Hills and Eureka Creeks, where Mr. McCormick, with usual force told the people the \"old old story of Jesus and His love\". It is safe to say from the serious reverent faces of the men, and their hearty hand clasps, that the message was not given in vain. The reading room of the Mission at Fox Guleh was visited, and a series of photographs taken of the different mining operations on Bonanza and Eldorado Creeks.\n\nThe following week Mr. McCormick, accompanied by Mr. Buck, journeyed to Mayo on the good ship \"Vidette\". A splendid service was held by Mr. Buck at Fraser Falls among the Indians, and three babies were baptized. The missionary and an Indian boy rowed forty miles to Mayo next\ncovered that the barge was within 3 inches of being underwater. On becoming forcibly acquainted with his danger every person on board seized his bed and hurled it to the shore as quickly as possible, and thus was our immediate danger averted. After the barge had been duly repaired we resumed our journey but did not reach our destination until August 16th. Distance covered 50 miles. Time 22 days.\n\nOn arrival at Rampart House all the Indians of the district, 125 in all, were assembled on shore waiting to shake hands and extend a cordial welcome. After being enthusiastically received, it was necessary to listen to all the individual trials and woes of the past year which ranged in importance from the death of Paul Stephen's mother-in-law to William's tug-out need of a ball of twine wherewith to repair his fish net, and old Eliza's desperate request for a pipe of tobacco. In the evening the ship's pilot made a feast and a dance. The whole community was invited. The first call having been sounded there was no alternative but to partake of an abundant repast of mulligan with 50 or 60 other guests in a cabin 15 feet square. Supper ended personal appreciation had to be shown by witnessing a few \"jigs\" and \"squares\" in the traders' warehouse. The days were all too short. Services were held in the church daily. Personal help and counsel were given to Amos, the native clergyman. An English day school was opened with twenty pupils enrolled, whose ages range from 6 to 16. Jacob Njoottli, a graduate of Carcross school is in charge. The older people were told of the need of self-support in so far as practicable. Their willingness to help was shown in the amount of the annual collection which realized $56 in cash and $24 in furs. The men voluntarily promised to go to the woods sometime during the coming Winter and cut suitable logs wherewith to erect a schoolhouse 14 x 20 feet. The annual Communion service was administered on Sunday morning August 20th when 71 Indians attended. Amos read the service in the native tongue, except the parts to be read by the priest. First he recited the \"Order For Morning Prayer\", followed by the Holy Communion, which included the various exhortations and all the offertory sentences. Such zeal on the part of a native is not to be belittled, although it may be more or less trying to an outsider. The collection plate was piled high with gifts which included 34 boxes of matches, 2 planks of Hudson Bay tobacco and $8.50 in cash. The evening service was conducted in English for the benefit of the trappers and others.\n\nNext morning I began my return trip in company with 2 Indian families, 3 children, and 11 dogs, in a poling boat. When the wind was favourable we made use of an improvised sail but for 4 days the wind was contrary and we were compelled to use the oars. The return trip to Fort Yukon occupied 6 days during which time I conducted 3 Communion services each time to Indians isolated from the missions. By day we dined on ducks, fish, and moose, around the camp fire, and by night slept beneath the trees. On arriving at Fort Yukon the socialism of the Indians proved that I was a temporary Indian in more ways than one.\n\nOn account of a delay in the steam boats up bound on the Yukon a stopover of 10 days was unavoidable. However the opportunity of addressing the Fort Yukon Indians was afforded by the courtesy of the Rev. William Loola, native missionary in charge, and also of assisting the medical missionary, Dr. Burke, in his services for the \"white\" population. Moreover it was a great pleasure to enjoy the friendship and hospitality of Dr. and Mrs. Burke. It may be of interest to note that when a boy William Loola was trained by the late Arch-\nhim to leave the North. Dr. Canham's advice, founded on years of experience, will be a real loss to the work in the Diocese.\n\nRev. F. H. Back, who for the past year has done such splendid work among the miners on the Klondike Creeks, has enlisted for overseas service. We are sure that the prayers of our readers will be constant for his safe return to his work in the far North.\n\nIn mission work as in everything else, when the men go to the Front the women take their place as far as possible. The Bishop has secured one new worker, Miss Kathleen Martin of Vancouver. Miss Martin is to teach the Indian day school at Selkirk, and incidentally to do as much mission work among the natives as possible.\n\nChrist Church, Whitehorse.\n\nRev. C. Swanson took charge here, holding his first services on July 9th. Whitehorse is a prosperous place at present, as the copper mines close to town are all working at high pressure. There are close to 250 men working there, or as many as the total population of Whitehorse. In addition the mines at Conrad, and other places, which have been long idle have now restarted.\n\nAn epidemic of measles has been sweeping through the town, affecting both Whites and Indians. The latter were isolated in their Reserve some three miles from Whitehorse, with a constable of the R. N. W. M. P., and Mr. Swanson to look after them. Thanks to the energetic measures of quarantine enforced by the Police, the epidemic was stopped in three weeks. No fresh cases have been reported. When the adult women began to be affected, the authorities sent a woman from the town, who looked after the children and taught them much needed lessons in cleanliness. This disease (measles, not clearliness) is very virulent among the\n\nDiocesan News, General.\n\nAgain the work in the Yukon is meeting with losses. Before this paper reaches our readers the \"Nestor\" of the Yukon clergy will have left the Diocese. Archdeacon Canham has been in the North since the early eighties. Among other places he has been stationed at Fort McPherson, Tanana, Selkirk, and Carcross. At the last named place he has resided for the past six years, where his many friends deeply regret that Mrs. Canham's failing health compels him to leave the North. Dr. Canham's advice, founded on years of experience, will be a real loss to the work in the Diocese.\n\nRev. F. H. Back, who for the past year has done such splendid work among the miners on the Klondike Creeks, has enlisted for overseas service. We are sure that the prayers of our readers will be constant for his safe return to his work in the far North.\n\nIn mission work as in everything else, when the men go to the Front the women take their place as far as possible. The Bishop has secured one new worker, Miss Kathleen Martin of Vancouver. Miss Martin is to teach the Indian day school at Selkirk, and incidentally to do as much mission work among the natives as possible.\n\nChrist Church, Whitehorse.\n\nRev. C.

Field, Forty Mile.\n\nMcTavish is a printer by trade, and the time he spent with the boys in the print shop is having a telling effect in the getting out of the present issue of the paper. Mr. Hawkshaw, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Yukon, made his semi-annual visit of inspection during the last week of August. At the same time the Bishop was with us. He was returning to Dawson from the Provincial Synod in Edmonton. Our next visitor was Miss K. Martin, a new worker in the Diocese. Miss Martin is to be located at Selkirk, where she will teach the Indian day school.\n\nTwo of our oldest pupils, Charles Teyah and Jessie Charlie, graduated this year. Jessie deserves special mention, as she has been at the school for ten years. During the past year she was able to help in the school work by teaching one of the primer classes.\n\nOn the invitation of Archbishop Du Vernet, Rev. W. T. Townsend made a trip to Atlin, B.C. With the exception of two miles on a little puffing railway between the lakes, the journey is entirely by water. Atlin is the centre of a thriving mining district. During the past summer there was a large tourist traffic, as the trip is one of the finest in the North. There is no minister of any denomination in the camp, although the Church of England has both a church and a rectory. Captain Hathorn, a retired officer of the British Navy, acts as voluntary lay-reader. Mr. Townsend received a hearty welcome, and enjoyed every minute of his stay.\n\nThe past summer has been very unfavourable for gardening. The spring was late and cold, so that many of the seeds did not germinate. Yet in spite of many blank places in the field our potato crop was the largest yet. The yield was as follows: Potatoes 115 bushels, turnips 50 bushels, carrots 5 bushels, and other garden truck in small quantities. The dry summer had a telling effect on our hay crop. We managed to get sufficient for our needs, but the quality is much inferior to other years.\n\nThe School gratefully acknowledges bales from the following churches: St. James' Cathedral, Church of the Redeemer, St. Simon's and St. Paul's of Toronto; St. Martin's of Montreal; St. George's of Kingston; St. Mark's, St. Michael's, St. Paul's, All Saints', St. James' and St. George's of Vancouver; St. Matthew's of Abbotsford, B.C.; and one bale from Tamworth, Ont.\n\nA PRAYER USED AT NOON HOUR, BY THE CHILDREN OF THE SCHOOL.\n\nO Lord, we pray Thee for our soldiers and sailors, who are fighting the battles of our country; teach them at all times to put their trust in Thee; give them courage in time of danger, and mercy in time of victory. We also pray Thee, O our God, for the doctors, nurses and ministers; give them tenderness and skill in the healing both of pain and sorrow; And all we ask in the name of our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nThis paper was set up and printed by Alfred Ellis, Frederick Boss, and David Kwatlatch, pupils of the Chooutla Indian School.\nday. Highest Creek, Mint Bridge, and the Silver King mine were visited in turn, and inspiring services were held.\n\nAfter this \"Mac the Sky Pilot\" and his cheery personality will be as well known and liked in the Yukon as he is among the railway construction camps of the Rockies, or the workers on the Welland Ship Canal, where the mission is performing so great a work for God.\n\nLeaving Mr. Buck at Mayo, Mr. McCormick returned to Dawson. A service at Mayo was held by the former, attended by nearly everyone in town, and the walls of the log school house rang as the deep manly voices sang the well known hymn, \"Jesus lover of my soul\". It is at times like these that one can lay aside all his doubts and fears, and feel of a truth that God is close beside him.\n\nBefore leaving the district, the missionary visited Haggart Creek, a little English settlement away in the wilds of the North, but where the services of the Church are indeed appreciated. Several requests for a celebration of the Holy Communion at the next visit of the missionary were made.\n\nOn the return to Dawson a service was held on the S.S. \"Vidette\". Many passengers from Dawson were on board. Capt. Barrington and all the men who could be spared were present. One of the men accompanied the singing on his guitar. The people remained for some hours after the service singing hymn after hymn. All agreed that they had seldom enjoyed a Sunday evening as they did that one.\n\nA few days later Mr. McCormick left Dawson for his home in Winnipeg, accompanied by the best wishes of all with whom he came in contact during his brief stay in the Yukon. He suffered considerably from the unaccustomed fatigues of the long day's marches, but he bore them with the same gaiety and self-control that have made him for so many years the leader in the Church's work among the men in the camps.\n\nFor the ensuing six weeks Mr. Buck remained in charge of the church in Dawson, in the absence of the Rev. J. A. Davies at Rampart House. Since the latter's return Mr. Buck has held services at Fox Gulch, Gold Run, and Sulphur Creek. As these were his fare well services before his journey outside with the Yukon Contingent, they were exceedingly well attended, despite the most inclement weather; and many were the wishes expressed for the missionary's good luck and safe return. Next Sunday he will visit Quartz Creek, which will be his last service before leaving for the Front.\n\nSchool News.\n\nAgain there have been changes on the Staff. Mrs. Dean found the work very heavy, as her health was not of the best. She had wished to resign in June, but stayed on till late in August, as there was a little difficulty in finding a suitable worker. Miss C. E. Bennett, the new member of the Staff, will be known, at least by name, to many of our readers. She is a graduate of the Deaconess House in Toronto. Her experience in Indian work has been gained at Lesser Slave Lake, while she has had a couple of years' experience in parish work at St. Paul's in Edmonton.\n\nNearly all the members of the Staff have now had their holidays. Miss Appleyard spent hers at Port Moody and Vancouver. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson and their two children are camping at Tagish. They have just sent in as part of their sport some trout that would make Eastern anglers green with envy.\n\nThis has been a summer of visitors. Besides between two and three hundred tourists, we have had a number who were directly connected with the work in the Yukon. Mr. McCormick, Superintendent of the Church Camp Mission, was able to stay several days with us on his return from Dawson. Mr.\nJ.D.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nSir,\n\nRegarding Alfred Ellis, he is, as the Bishop says, \"an exceptionally good boy\". I have called the Bishop's attention to this fact that as Alfred Ellis is not settling on a farm or learning any particular trade or business there may be some difficulty in obtaining a grant for him. The case is somewhat different to that of Mary Silas who received a grant for one year only while training as a nurse. I might add, as a suggestion, that if a grant was made for Alfred Ellis it might be looked upon as one way to help financially without increasing the per capita grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Hawkey,\nIndian Superintendent.\nDear Sir:\n\nLast year one of our boys in the Carcross Indian Boarding School named Alfred Ellis, graduated, as he had passed the age limit. He is an orphan and has been in the school from the time he was a small child. He was willing to remain on at the school, and temporary arrangements were made to retain his services as a worker to be paid at the rate of $20.00 per month. He is an exceptionally good boy, and is especially useful in the printing shop and the shoe repair shop.\n\nI wish to ask your department to allow him at the rate of $20.00 per month. I understood that sometimes you help graduate students, and this seems to be an exceptional case. We may need to give him more than this after a time, but if your department will allow at this rate it would help out materially. The school, of course, would provide his board which costs a good deal, especially at the present time.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you in this matter and I am sure you will take an interest in the case of this boy. I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. O. Stringer\nBishop of Yukon.\nDiocese of Yukon,\nCanada.\n\nDawson, Y. T.\nJuly 26th 1918\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to ask you for a grant of $700.00 towards defraying the expenses of fuel for the Carcross Indian Boarding School. During the last year about (150) one hundred and fifty cords of wood were used. The staff together with the older boys did a great deal of work in providing a portion of this. Last year we had a number of big boys in the school who were a considerable help. Most of these are leaving the school this Summer, and Mr. Johnson, the principal, has decided that it will be impossible to procure the wood themselves for next Winter. He is therefore endeavouring to get someone outside to supply one hundred (100) cords of wood by contract. The staff and the boys will also do what they can in procuring wood. We find, further, that if the bigger boys have to spend all their spare time in getting wood the teaching of other practical departments, such as carpentering, has to be neglected.\n\nAs you can readily understand, the cost of supplies for the school has gone up tremendously the last couple of years, and we find it increasingly difficult to finance the school with the per capita grant which the department has given us. If it were possible to increase the per capita grant to $200.00 it would, of course, help us out of the difficulty.\n\nI shall be glad if you will do what you can in the matter, and oblige,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. O. Stringer\nBishop of Yukon.\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nSir:\n\nCopies of two letters sent by the Bishop of the\nCreek to the Department were received at this office with\na request that I write you re the matters dealt with\nin the letters.\n\nRegarding the wood for fuel I may say that it is\nbecoming increasingly difficult to procure it in conse-\nquence of having to go further afield for it. If Mr\nJohnson secures some one to supply 100 cords it will\nprobably cost $8.00 or $9.00 per cord, a heavy addition-\nal expense to the school and with the greatly increased\ncost of supplies it is placing a heavy financial burden\nupon the Bishop at a time when it is difficult to ob-\ntain funds for carrying on his work. I mention these\nmatters for your consideration.\n\nRegarding Alfred Ellis, he is, as the Bishop says,\n\"an exceptionally good boy.\" I have called the Bishop's\nattention to this fact that as Alfred Ellis is not set-\ntling on a farm or learning any particular trade or busi-\nness there may be some difficulty in obtaining a grant\nfor him. The case is somewhat different to that of Mary\nSilas who received a grant for one year only while train-\ning as a nurse. I might add, as a suggestion, that if\na grant was made for Alfred Ellis it might be looked\nupon as one way to help financially without increasing\nthe per capita grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nSeptember 7th, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir -\n\nYour two communications of July 26th, last, one application for a grant of $700.00 towards defraying expenses of fuel for the Carcross Indian Boarding School, and the other for a grant for Alfred Ellis, have been brought to my attention.\n\nWith regard to the former, I realize the extra strain that war conditions have placed upon the management of this institution, as well as similar institutions throughout Canada. Beyond the small increase in the per capita grant made sometime ago, no special provision has been made by Parliament to meet these abnormal demands.\n\nWith regard to the boy, Alfred Ellis, while I quite appreciate the recommendations that you give him, I think the Department may be considered to have dealt very fairly with him in so much that it has educated him for 13 years at a cost of nearly $5,000.00. At 18 years of age he should be in a position to earn his own living, either in the institution itself or the work he is engaged in at present or outside. Of course the costs of management including wages such as this must be borne by the school from their per capita funds or other available funds.\n\nI regret very much that it is not possible for me to consider favourably either of Your Lordship's requests.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

Smith have been secured for teaching at the school.\n\nDr Smith began his career as a public school teacher, he afterwards took a degree in medicine and practiced for a time then took a theological course and entered the Ministry of the Church of England, he has been for some time Rector of Georgetown, Ont. He expects to take up his duties at the school sometime in Feb. Miss C.E. Bennett is doing the teaching at present.\n\nThe Rev A.C. Field, who is on furlough just now is expected to return sometime this month and to take up his residence at Selkirk when he will re-open the Indian Day School which has been closed since Miss K. Martin resigned to take up War Work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, February 4, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th ultimo informing the Department that the Manager of the Carcross Indian Boarding School reports that the services of the Rev. Dr. G. Smith have been secured for teaching at the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the appointment of Dr. Smith as teacher of this school.\n\nIt is noted that the Rev. A. O. Field was expected to return last month and take up his residence at Selkirk and re-open the Indian day school there, which has been closed since Miss K. Martin resigned to take up war work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst.

Dr. C. Smith as teacher at the Carcross Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is very satisfactory to learn that the Department approves of the appointment. No information has yet come to hand as to whether Dr. Smith has arrived at the school, he was expected to take up his duties in Feb.\n\nRegarding the Rev. A.C. Field, he wrote me in Dec that he expected to be in Selkirk early in Jan, the last advices from there state that he has not yet arrived but was expected any time now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nDawson, Y.T.

The Manager, Mr. C.F. Johnson, writes me that it is most difficult to finance the school at present. He states that the expenses since the beginning of the war have gone up about 75%. He has tried to practice every economy but it is scarcely fair to the staff or to the children that they should be stinted in the matter of food and other advantages. I shall be glad if you will look into this matter. For further information regarding the increased costs I would refer you to Mr. C.F. Johnson, the Manager of the School. If you write to him he would be able to give you details. I would respectfully request that the Department should either increase the per capita grant or give a war bonus. The situation has become worse, and though I have written you before on the subject I feel that I should again strongly urge that you should do something to help out in the present time of distress.\n\nI remain\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. P. Stringer\nBishop of Yukon\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nBishop Stringer, of Yukon, is asking for an increased per capita grant or a war bonus for the Carcross Boarding School. He bases his claim on the increased cost of maintenance which, he states, has gone up about 75% since the beginning of the war.\n\nThe school is in receipt of a per capita grant of $210.00 for 35 pupils; there are 29 on the roll with an average attendance of 26 for the past year.\n\nMr. Superintendent Hawkesley in his report on this school says that it is doing excellent work. His report is accompanied by a financial statement of receipts and expenditure for the year ended 31st of December, last, which shows an expenditure of $16,829.35 and receipts to the same amount, of which $6,689.95 was received from the Department and the balance of $10,139.40 was made up as follows:\n\nClothing from Woman's Auxiliary ........ $1,217.00\nMonetary gifts ......................... 1,638.00\nSundry bonuses ......................... 36.18\nFarm and Garden ....................... 2,932.50\nDeficiency paid by Diocese of Yukon .... 4,315.72\n\n$10,139.40\n\nYou will see that the Diocese of Yukon paid the deficit of $4,315.72 which must have been a heavy drain on its funds and it is to relieve the diocese of similar calls in the future that Bishop Stringer is asking for an increased grant.\n\nMartin Bower\nOttawa, May 1, 1919.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 27th of March, last, in which you ask for an increase in the per capita grant allowed the Carcross Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is asking Parliament for a flat increase in the per capita grant to all Indian residential schools and, if this is allowed, the Carcross school will benefit.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. I. O. Stringer\nBishop of Yukon,\n37 Dorchester Square,\nLondon W.2.,\nEngland.\nDawson, Y.T. Canada. May 13th, 1919.\n\nThe Right Rev:\nThe Bishop of Yukon,\nR.E.F. France.\n\nRt Rev Sir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated March 27th, with copy of letter sent to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, enclosed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that judging from the date of your letter I have no doubt that it has long since been received and acted upon by the Department therefore I should think there is little to be gained by my endorsing the request, however I will write to the Department re your application.\n\nFor your information I may tell you that I forwarded, early in April, the financial statement of the receipts and expenditures of the school which shows that the cost to the Diocese was considerably over $4,000.00, this may have some effect on the Department's decision re your application.\n\nThe expenditures at the school this year which have already been sanctioned by the Department will be heavy. The repairs to the roof damaged by fire, the installation of a heavy sheet metal smoke stack for the furnace, $100 or nearly so for paints, etc., and possibly a new barn, are items which may perhaps influence their decision on your application. However I feel assured that your letter will receive sympathetic consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent.\nSir:\n\nThe Bishop of Yukon has sent me a copy of the letter written to the Department asking for either an increase in the per capita grant or a war bonus on account of the increased cost of living since the beginning of the war. In a covering letter he asks me to look into the matter and endorse the request.\n\nIt is quite true that the cost of living in the Yukon, which before the war was very high, has gone up considerably since war broke out and I have no doubt the financing of the school has been quite a strain on the Bishop's funds as may be seen from the financial statement already forwarded.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a copy of my reply to the Bishop's letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, June 11, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th ultimo stating that the Bishop of the Yukon has sent you a copy of the letter written to the Department asking for either an increase in the per capita grant to the Carcross Boarding School, or a war bonus, on account of the increased cost of living since the beginning of war and has asked you to look into the matter and endorse the request, and enclosing a copy of your reply to the Bishop's letter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that His Lordship was informed on the 1st ultimo that the Department is asking Parliament for a flat increase in the per capita grant to all Indian residential schools and, if this is allowed, the Carcross school will benefit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The balance due will be forwarded when the return is received.\n\nThe item of $5,000, which was included in the supplementary estimates to cover the expenses already incurred in connection with St. Paul's Hostel, Dawson, has not yet been passed by Parliament.

F. MacKensie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Yukon.\nDawson, Y.T.,\nNovember 14, 1922.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Doctor reports that he was called to the Carcross school as it was feared, by the Principal, that a case of measles had developed. On examination of the pupil it was found to be a simple rash. The pupil has quite recovered and there is a clean bill of health at the school.\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI shall be obliged if you will let me know at your earliest convenience if permission has been given by your department for our school at Carcross to receive, as from the beginning of this year, 40 pupils instead of 35 as heretofore.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.B.R. Westgate\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, April 28, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, relative to the pupilage at the Carcross Indian Boarding School, and in reply I am pleased to state that 40 pupils will be allowed as from the first instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. R. W. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41 - 43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have been informed by the Bishop of Yukon that the Rev Dr Westgate has written him in reference to the enlargement of the Carcross Indian Residential School to provide accommodation for 200 pupils. Whether I should write on this matter until asked to do so by the Department is a question, however, with all due respect to Dr Westgate I venture to suggest that he is not sufficiently familiar with the conditions here to form any reliable judgment as to the need of enlarging the school. Last summer he visited Carcross and Whitehorse at the south end of the Territorial Road very few Indians, talked the matter over with the Principal who at that time had less than a year's experience in the Yukon under these circumstances a knowledge of the real need of enlargement could not very well be obtained.\n\nThe Bishop of the Yukon says that it is out of the question to fill a school large enough to accommodate 200 pupils. Accommodation for 50 or 60 at the most would be ample and he was not certain that this number could be kept up regularly.\n\nIf I may be permitted to express an opinion on this subject I would say that under existing conditions the school as it now stands is large enough to meet the demands. It will be seen from reports of past years that the school has not always been full only in the last year or two have the full number been in residence. From experience I find how difficult it is to get Indian parents to send their children to a residential school, a candidate or two on the waiting list does more to enhance the value of the school in the Indian mind than a constant pleading for children to fill vacancies.\n\nThese northern Indians are quite a different type to those of the plains not nearly so far advanced in civilization, many of their old superstitions remain and are not easily overcome. They do not fully realize as yet the benefit of education I speak from 35 years experience of work amongst them.\n\nAll these things have to be taken into consideration before the expenditure in enlargement is undertaken and I respectfully submit them to you for that purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawkesley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 25, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 2355-3 of the 16th ultimo, in which you refer to the plans for the development of the Carcross Indian Residential School. I have noted that the Bishop of the Yukon and yourself are of the opinion that if provision is made for the accommodation of from 50 to 60 pupils, the needs will be met for the time being.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., has brought to the attention of the Department the advisability of enlarging the school at Carcross. He has suggested a pupilage of 100, but I wish to assure you that it will be some time before the funds for Indian Education will be able to provide a new building at this institution. We have been assured that there is now accommodation for 40 pupils and the pupilage of the Carcross Indian Boarding School has been increased to this number as from the first of the fiscal year. The Department is pleased to have your report and recommendation in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawkesley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nSir,\u2014 I beg to inform you that the following members of the staff of the Carcross Indian Boarding School have resigned their positions and left the school.\n\nMiss Dorothy Griffiths on April 27th, for reasons of health.\nMr Hobbs, farmer and general assistant, on May 5th,\nMiss M.A. Coppinger, teacher, on June 21st.\n\nThe principal writes that he is daily expecting the arrival of two women and one man to fill the vacancies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Rev. G. A. Bagshaw, until recently Rector of the parish of Alberni, Vancouver Island, has been given the position of Acting Principal of the Carcross School to succeed the Rev. W. Barlow who has been transferred to the Principalship of the Peigan School. Mr. Bagshaw left Vancouver on Saturday August 15th to enter on the duties of his office. He was accompanied by Mrs. Bagshaw who despite the fact that she is handicapped by deafness will be of immense service to him in his work. Mr. Bagshaw who was born in England in 1867 has many excellent qualifications for the position on which he has just entered. He was educated at Longborough Grammar School and at the age of 18 became Assistant Master at Braminster Grammar School, Dorset. In 1887 he was master at a private school at Cheltenham, and in 1890 was third master at the Magdalen College, Brackley. Thus before coming to Canada he was for six years connected with scholastic work. He came to Canada in 1892 where he received Ordination. He was vicar of St. Philip's, Cedar for fourteen years and for the past six years has been rector and rural dean of Alberni. In addition to his scholastic attainments Mr. Bagshaw possesses many of the other practical qualifications which are so essential in a man occupying the position\nof Principal of an Indian Residential School, and I trust that the action thus taken in connexion with his appointment may meet with the approval of your Department.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF.\nOttawa, Sept. 8, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your 2335-4 of the 11th ultimo and to inform you that the Department has approved of the appointment of the Rev.

He also refused to vacate the premises.\nI do not wish to place a charge against\nhim, but do want him off the premises. I am afraid\nthat when I return to the School he will assault me\nagain\".\n\nOn January 8th, acting on instructions\nof the Officer Commanding White Horse Sub-District,\nI proceeded to Carcross. The Revd.-Arthur,Bagshaw orders\nThomas Lewis off the premises in my presence. Thomas\nLewis demurred at first, but when I pointed out to him\nthat his staying in the school necessitated force being\nused to eject him, and that constituted assault and\nleft him liable to arrest; Thomas Lewis vacated the\npremises forthwith.\n\nCASE CONCLUDED.\n\nReg:- No 5713.\n\nThe Officer Commanding,\nR.C.M.Police.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nThe Rev Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School reports that Mr T. Lewis, farmer and general helper was dismissed on January 4th. No particulars of the cause of the dismissal are given beyond an assault on the person of the Principal.\n\nHe also reports that there is considerable trouble with the drainage from the baths and washbasins in the bathrooms. The waste water backs up and overflows and seeps through the ceiling of the office and one of the hospital wards. I have authorized him to engage the services of Matthew Watson, who installed the plumbing, to attend to the matter at once. There may be a partial stoppage through corrosion of the pipes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Mission Fields\n\nHERSCHEL ISLAND AND SHINGLE POINT.\n\nVery little information has come through from the Arctic Coast since the last issue of Northern Lights. A wireless message early in the New Year indicated that everything was going on as usual. We can imagine the Reverends W. A. Geddes and A. C. McCullum carrying on the services and holding school at one or other of the central stations, and also making trips to the different settlements of Eskimos on the Arctic Coast.\n\nThe long, dark, sunless days are well over by the middle of January, and as the length of sunlight increases about half an hour each week, the missionaries and Eskimos among the hills take a new lease of life and gladness seems to replace the gloom. The song intoned by the Eskimos on the return of the sun after an absence of many weeks seems to express the feelings of all. Translated into English it means \"Now we shall live another year; we have seen the sun once more.\"\n\nRAMPART HOUSE AND OLD CROW.\n\nFrom latest reports received the Indians were well and prosperous. During the early part of the winter the caribou swarmed over the hills in greater numbers than usual, and the people were able to get a good supply of meat for themselves and their dogs. This meant much for the Indians as very few fish were caught last summer. Foxes and other fur bearing animals were plentiful and the people expected a good season's catch.\n\nJohn Tizya, the veteran Indian Lay Reader, conducts services regularly at Old Crow. They miss Mr. Moody who is now located at Fort Yukon.\n\nTwo young children died at Old Crow, but otherwise the general health has been very good.\n\nMrs. Julia McDonald, the widow of the late Archdeacon McDonald, is making her home again this winter at Old Crow where her son, Neil McDonald, has a trading post. Her letters are quite cheerful and she sends cordial greetings to all her friends.\n\nHEAD OF PEEL AND PORCUPINE.\n\nSome of the Indian men from this place came into Mooseshide for the Christmas season but Richard Martin remained to hold services for those who were left behind. He reports having had a very happy time with the people who appreciated the services of the Church especially at the Christmas season. On his arrival in Dawson in January he received a wireless message from his brother, the Rev. John Martin, who formerly lived on the Yukon side, and who is now stationed at Akla-vik, stating that Jane's daughter, Maggie, was married on Christmas Day. Mr. Fred Firth, youngest son of Mr. John Firth, the patriarchal retired officer of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort McPherson, Bishop Rompas Memorial Church, Mooseshide.\n\nThe Christmas festivities are at an end in this little village, and the\nIndians are getting back to their usual routine of work, hunting, trapping and wood chopping.\n\nThe Christmas and New Year Services in church were very well attended. The natives who had several opportunities of preaching to the congregations, and their words were attentively listened to by the people. The Bishop has been amongst us, and encouraged and cheered us by his presence and example. The Church was filled by an eager and expectant congregation on Christmas morning, when the Holy Communion was administered to a good number of Indians.\n\nThe usual collection was made on behalf of the Indians, and subscriptions were also made by the natives towards the expense of painting their church next summer. They seemed glad to give to these objects according to their means.\n\nPed River Indians have returned to their hunting grounds in the woods. Their stay in the village amongst the Mowichelle Indians and in church with the people was found very helpful and inspiring, especially so with regard to the hymn-singing. They led all the hymns in church with much ability.\n\nThe lay-reader and others were always ready to give of their best in this good work. One of them was busy for a few days sitting for his examination with a view to being admitted to Deacon's Orders by his Lordship the Bishop.\n\nThere were a large number of gifts on the children's Christmas tree, many of them very useful articles. All are indebted to kind friends who so generously contributed to the pleasure and enjoyment of the young folks. Teaching in school is continued as usual. The winter term was commenced a few days ago with a good attendance.\n\nA number of the Indians have been sick and some are still ailing. All are well cared for by the Indian Department.\n\nWe are depending on the goodwill, interest and prayers of the readers of our mission notes for continued patience, perseverance, and success in the work under God's blessing and guidance.\n\nBenjamin Toty\nSt. Mary's Church, Mayo.\n\nWhile we have no direct communications from Northern Lights from Mayo, we have other reports indicating that the Church work in Mayo and Keno is having an exceptional winter.\n\nThe Rev. G. F. Leigh, who was recently ordained for this work, is entering into his labors with great enthusiasm and the people are responding.\n\nLieutenant Talbot, who was recently transferred from Dawson to Mayo, and who is a talented musician, has given invaluable services in organizing and training a choir.\n\nMayo and Keno are making steady progress and a general spirit of optimism prevails throughout the camps.\n\nSt. Paul's Church, Dawson.\n\nThe Christmas and New Year's Season in Dawson was favored by the most ideal weather imaginable. For several days before Christmas and for several days after we had entered on the new year, not once did the thermometer drop as low as zero, and at the time this article is written (January 12th) the weather is still very mild.\n\nThe Christmas Services at St. Paul's were attended by about the usual numbers in spite of the declining population, and the reports given at the annual parishioners' meeting were of very encouraging nature. While the Sunday School records are not available for the whole history of the parish it is doubtful if they were ever higher than in 1925, which showed an average attendance of 147 for four and an income of over two hundred dollars. The congregations have kept up remarkably well in comparison with former years, and the church collections during 1925 were larger than they have been since 1916.\n\nIt may seem strange to our readers to find in this article a sense of satisfaction in keeping up with the past, but we have only to state that in 1909 the population of Dawson exceeded twenty thousand and that it has gradually declined until in 1925 there were considerably less than one thousand in Dawson.\n\nThe Woman's Auxiliary in all its branches have excelled in the work of their activities. The payment on the parish hall and rectory has been met in full and the missionary assessment on the parish has been oversubscribed by a considerable amount.\n\nOn the last Sunday evening of the year the rector of St. Paul's Church conducted a service at Bear Creek. There are only five families at Bear Creek this winter (two of the five have since moved into Dawson) but the people came from creeks adjoining until a congregation of thirty had assembled.\n\nResignation of Bishop Lucas.\n\nThe Right Reverend J. R. Lucas, D.D., Bishop of Mackenzie River, has resigned as Bishop, his resignation to take effect at the end of March.\n\nFor thirty-four years Bishop Lucas has served as missionary, Archdeacon, Diocesan Secretary and Treasurer, and Bishop in the remote districts of Athabasca and Mackenzie River. He was consecrated Bishop in succession to Bishop Rowe in 1913. His zeal and perseverance have been remarkable and both Bishop and Mrs. Lucas will be much missed throughout the whole of Mackenzie River.\n\nMay God continue to bless and use them wherever they may be located.\n\nThe choice of a successor rests with the Provincial Synod of Rupert's Land. Between the meetings of the Provincial Synod the selection is made by an appointed standing committee representing all the Dioceses of the Province. They meet the people who are interested that God may guide them and that the most suitable man may be chosen.\n\nNorthern Lights extends congratulations to Rt. Rev. P. T. Rowe, Bishop of Alaska, on the response which he has received to his appeal for assistance to missions with the epidemic of influenza last summer at Fort Yukon and other parts of his diocese. In a recent issue of Spirit of Missions it was stated that the response to his appeal had reached the sum of nearly fifteen thousand dollars, and subscriptions were still coming in.\nSt. Paul's Hostel, Dawson.\n\n(By Bishop Stringer)\n\nThis year the Hostel was the scene of one of the brightest and merriest Christmas records for this comparatively young Institution. On the night before Christmas a number of visitors shared the warm hospitality of the Hostel's executive and staff at a cheery dinner party which was followed by the arrival of Santa Claus and his wife and the disbursement of many presents which weighed down the branches of the Hostel's prettily decorated Christmas Tree. Amidst the tinkling of sleigh bells, and with many a twinkling eye in the capable and bearded-faced old gentleman and his wife, who were attired in their crimson and time honored regalia, the messengers of good cheer burst in upon the merry band of enthusiastic children and happy guests.\n\nThere were presents for everybody. How the youngest and most delightful of them all rejoiced! The girls fondled their newly delivered dolls in raptures of appreciation, while soon the newly acquired steam engines, jack knives and other presents which the boys received, were very much in evidence.\n\nOn Christmas morning the staff and the children all assembled so early in St. Paul Cathedral Church where the Christmas spirit was co-mingled in the touching services and the beautiful anthems. Music which breathed with the delightful charm of the Christmas spirit added a realistic touch to the appropriate sermon delivered by the Rector, Archdeacon Shirley.\n\nEvening followed with a special feast of good things to eat for all the children and the staff, making their Christmas one of good cheer filled with sweet memories.\n\nA few of the children, whose parents live within reach of Dawson, were able to spend part of the holiday season in their own homes, but in the majority of cases, relations and friends of the children live at long distances from Dawson. But although, however, the Hostel, are brought to a very close realization of the joys that the great holiday season holds in store.\n\nNew Year's Day also proved an enjoyable holiday for the children. With the passing of this happy season, all again settled down to the routine of studies and duties, but with a much greater anticipation of the holidays festivities which will linger clearly in their memories for another year.\n\nTwenty Years A Bishop.\n\nDecember 17th was the twentieth anniversary of the consecration of the Rev. I. O. Stringer as Bishop of Yukon. The consecration took place in St. John's Church, Winnipeg in 1905.\n\nOn the evening of the anniversary a public reception was held at the rectory and the people of Dawson, irrespective of creed, came in large numbers to extend their congratulations to Bishop and Mrs. Stringer and to wish them continued health to carry on their work.\n\nA presentation in recognition of the event is to be made at a later date, as soon as communications can be received from the distant parts of the diocese.\n\nNorthern Commercial Company\n\nLIMITED\n\nPioneer Company of the North\n\nGeneral Stores at Dawson and Mayo, Y.T.; also Fairbanks, Nenana, Hot Springs, Tanana, Circle City, Fort Yukon, Eagle, Ruby, McGrath, Tacoma, Old Hamilton, Mission, St. Michael and Nelson Island, Alaska.\n\nLeading Outfitters and Dealers in Raw Furs\n\nHOME OFFICE: COLEMAN BUILDING, SEATTLE, WASH.\nOur Subscription List.\n\nOur subscription list continues to grow slowly but steadily.

At the end of the year we were sending out 1470 copies of Northern Lights.\n\nIn addition to this we have distributed a great many copies free of charge to tourists and visitors.\n\nFinancial Statement of Northern Lights For 1925.\n\n| Revenue          |        |\n|------------------|--------|\n| Balance from 1924| $8 48 14|\n| Subscriptions    | $167 26|\n| Advertisements   | $25 00 |\n| Donations for Yukon work | $91 50 |\n| Loan from Bishop Stringer | $100 00 |\n\n| Expenditures     |        |\n|------------------|--------|\n| Printing         | $263 50|\n| Photos and cuts  | $7 09  |\n| Stationery, postage, etc. | $49 38 |\n| Donations paid for work in Yukon | $91 50 |\n\n| Bank balance Dec. 31, 1925 | $20 52 |\n| Loan from Bishop Stringer | $100 00 |\n\n| Assets           |        |\n|------------------|--------|\n| Advertisements due | $37 50 |\n| Bank balance      | $20 52 |\n\nDeficit on year's work - $41 98\n\nWhile the deficit for the year shown as $41 98 it must be observed from the financial statement that subscribers to Northern Lights have given $91 50 in donations for work in the Diocese of Yukon other than Northern Lights.

Coming into Yukon in the great stampede of 1898, telling his friends in England that he expected to be back in two years, he made the North his home and his last resting place on earth.\n\nWhile he came to engage in mining he was soon back in his chosen profession, teaching. In speaking at the funeral Bishop Stringer said that the deceased had been a teacher for over fifty years and had, he thought, rendered a longer service to the educational work of Yukon than any other teacher had ever rendered.\n\nThe cause of death was cancer, yet he stuck to his duty to the end. He taught school on Friday, going into the hospital on Sunday where, within three weeks, he passed away.\n\nHe was a loyal and devoted churchman, serving as layreader on Quartz Creek where he was engaged in mining, and in Dawson and Whitehorse he was choir master. Religion entered deeply into his daily life and gave him a wonderful influence over his pupils. In them his life and ideals will continue.\n\nOur deepest sympathy is extended to Mrs. Galpin in her bereavement.\n\n$500 for $390.60\n\nTHE PRAIRIE CHURCH\n\nby J. A. Shirley, M. A., B.

In reply I beg to state that for two or three months past our Society has been very deeply concerned about the conditions which have obtained at this institution. Our concern arose in the first place, out of the illness of one of the lady agents (Mrs. Morrison) who tendered her resignation and returned to her home in British Columbia. Another lady agent was immediately secured and sent to the School to take her place. Just at that time an epidemic of influenza laid hold on the School and prostrated a number of the children and two lady members of the staff. The children I am happy to be able to state have all, so far as I have been informed, made a good recovery and I heartily wish that I could make the same statement with regard to the members of the staff. One of these, (Miss Ingram) as soon as she was convalescent and able to travel, tendered her resignation and has since returned to her home in Victoria. The other lady agent Miss Helen Bushell was so seriously ill that she had to be taken to the Hospital at Whitehorse. For some weeks we had hopes that she too might recover, but in this we were sadly disappointed, when we received a telegram on June 14th stating that she had died on the previous day. As soon as information was received that the numerical strength of the staff was reduced below its normal strength through the serious illness of these two lady agents, steps were taken to secure others to take their place, and although appointments have not yet been actually made, it is expected that this will be done in the very near future.\n\nFrom the above information it will be clear to you that\nA certain amount of disorganization in the daily routine of the School was inevitable. When Miss Bushell's services were no longer available for the Kitchen duties, Miss Ridgeway who is the teacher and head matron, and a fully qualified dietician, felt it her duty to leave the class-room and take over the Kitchen work in order that the health of the school and staff should suffer as little as possible. When she retired from the class-room I was under the impression that Mr. Bagshaw, the Principal had undertaken this duty. This he appears not to have done, and I have written to him asking for an explanation. That he, as Principal of the School, should have taken over these duties, there is no question in my own mind whatever, except that certain circumstances which have not yet been reported to me, made it impossible for him to do so. As I have written to him for an explanation I do not see that further action can be taken until this has been received.\n\nThere is a strong probability that I myself may visit this institution during the month of August, but in the meantime I should like to assure you that the whole situation is receiving our Society's very careful attention and I hope to be able to inform you in the near future that completely satisfactory conditions again obtain.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the quarterly returns of attendance at the Carcross Indian Residential School for the quarter ending June 30th, 1926.\n\nThe school is still under staffed, two Matrons are needed teaching in the classroom has been suspended since April 15th.\n\nThe Principal has arranged for the summer holidays to commence on JULY 5th. Six pupils are being discharged, list will be sent later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.\nIndian Superintendent.\nAsst Deputy and Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that the following have been added to the staff of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nMiss Ada Rebekah Nevill. Born in Newfoundland. Age 57 years. Previous experience, six and a half years at Alert Bay and one and a half years at Lytton Indian schools.\n\nMiss Margaret Cameron. Born in Scotland. Age 35 years. Previous experience, two years at the Gordon and Elkhorn Indian schools.\n\nThe staff is now complete we may therefore expect improvement in the condition of things which have been unsatisfactory lately mainly owing to the school being understaffed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst Deputy and Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 17th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, informing the Department of the changes that have been made in the staff of the Carcross Indian Residential School. We note that the staff is now complete, and it is, therefore, confidentially expected that there will be an improvement in the recent rather unsatisfactory management of this school owing to its being understaffed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of June 28th, file No 166-1-10, in reference to the general conditions at the Carcross Indian Residential School, mainly through the illness of two members of the staff, one of whom died in the Whitehorse hospital.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I have recently returned from a visit to the above school and regret that I have to report that I found things much disorganized. No teaching had been done since April 15th; Miss Ridgeway was acting as cook and in addition had undertaken all the nursing duties to members of the staff as well as to some of the pupils. She was on the verge of a nervous breakdown and had to go away for complete rest. Some of the older girls took charge of the kitchen. Miss Nevill arrived from the Alert Bay school and took over the kitchen work, a girl's Matron was expected from Vancouver in a few days.\n\nDiscipline was at a low ebb. Three of the boy pupils ran away from the school they got as far as Whitehorse where they stole a boat and started down the Yukon River. They were seen about 10 miles below the town by an ex-pupil who called them ashore, flagged a passing steamer and returned the boys and the boat to Whitehorse. I had just reached there on my return from a visit to the Champagne Indians, I took charge of the boys and returned with them to the school. Their joint fares for steamer and train was $21.50. Two of the truants were new boys who found the regulations of the school irksome. It is fortunate they were seen otherwise I am afraid they would have come to grief in some of the rapids.\n\nThe members of the staff were discontented, not so much with regard to their pay which is about $1.00 per day, as the meager rations they were allowed which are considered insufficient. This seems to be the main reason why there so many changes.\n\nThe usual examination was postponed until my visit in September when the teacher will be free to attend the schoolroom.\n\nSome of the local Indians requested me to allow their children leave the school as they were not being educated.\nIt would appear that too much freedom is allowed the pupils especially in the matter of visiting the town which is about two miles from the school, and attending dances which keep them out late.\n\nThere is a good deal of criticism, both among whites and Indians, regarding the unsatisfactory state of affairs. The Bishop of Yukon visited the school recently, he wrote me saying, \"You will find things at the school unsatisfactory. I hope you may be able to do something to straighten up matters.\"\n\nWhen the Principal was spoken to in reference to the state of affairs he claimed that it was due to the slowness of the Indian and Eskimo School Commission in filling vacancies.\n\nAre the school authorities liable for the amount disbursed in returning the three truants to the school?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley.\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 23rd, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, reporting on the general conditions at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as stated in our letter to you of the 17th instant, it is expected now that the school has been fully staffed, there will be a decided improvement in the general conditions throughout the school and the work being performed by the pupils in the classroom. We understand that it was the intention of a representative of the Missionary Society of the Church of England to visit this institution during the present month, when the situation would receive his attention. The Principal should not permit the pupils to visit the town at night and attend dances.\n\nRelative to the case of paying the amount disbursed in returning the three pupils who ran away from the school, I beg to say that the amount paid by the school authorities in having these pupils returned should be taken from the grant advanced to you to cover the cost of travelling expenses of pupils at this school. Proper receipts should be attached to your vouchers covering the charges in returning these three pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawbeley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letters dated August 17th and 23rd, file No. 166-1-1, in reference to conditions at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I have recently visited the above school and found that a remarkable improvement had taken place. The staff, with the exception of the principal, who, by the way has resigned, the resignation to take effect before the end of the year, appears to be quite competent and are filling their various positions satisfactorily. The pupils are now under control, discipline is greatly improved I think we may expect good results from now on.\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting the Rev Dr Westgate for a short time during which matters concerning the school were discussed. Will write later in reference to this.\n\nThe painting of the exterior of the building was well under way. I had the opportunity of examining the material the painters were using and found that it was of excellent quality and quite up to specifications. By now the painting should be completed.\n\nThe work in the classroom was going on regularly. An examination of the pupils was held all the pupils did very satisfactory work thereby showing that the teacher was thorough and painstaking in her efforts.\n\nArrangements were made for the purchase of the rough planking and asbestos authorized by the Department.\n\nAll the pupils appear to be happy and contented.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst Deputy and Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nIt is with many regrets that I sever my connection with Northern Lights. The publication has been one of the most interesting features of my four years work in Yukon, and has brought me into contact with a great many people. I am leaving Yukon to become assistant in the work at All Saint's Church, Pasadena. As a considerable number of our readers live in California, and many others visit there, we hope to meet many personally whom we have as yet only met through the columns of Northern Lights. I desire to express my appreciation of the support and encouragement given me by our readers during these last four years and trust that the same kindly consideration will be given to my successor as editor, Rev. W. H. L. West of Whitehorse.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. A. Shirley\n\nIt is really with fear and trembling that I take over the editing and management of Northern Lights because I fear that to follow after one who has accomplished so much, is far beyond my limitations. Nevertheless it will be my objective to maintain the fine standard that has been attained to by my predecessors in office.\n\nThe success of the publication not only depends upon our correspondents in various parts of the Diocese but upon our subscribers who have so generously supported the paper in the past.\n\nTo our correspondents in the various posts manned by the Diocese may I ask for your cooperation. Send your news items in early and regularly and much delay and disappointment will be avoided.\n\nTo our subscribers may I ask for your continued support. You can assist by not allowing your subscription to fall behind. I feel that only this reminder is needed in order to have all delinquents send in their arrears, otherwise it will in future be necessary to cut them from our mailing lists, as the sum charged, twenty-five cents per annum, the smallest coin in use in many parts of Yukon, is not exorbitant and barely covers the cost of printing, mailing, etc.\n\nMay I therefore ask for your cooperation.

H. Byrne, B.A., a graduate of Emmanuel College, Saskatoon, was made a Deacon.\n\nFollowing the Litany, the Ordination Service took place, the sermon being preached by Rev. G. A. Bagsshaw, Principal of the Choota Indian School of Carcross. The candidate was presented by the Rev. W. H. L. West, L. Th., Rector of Christ Church, Whitehorse. The Ordination proper followed, the Rt. Rev. I. O. Stringer, B. A., D. D., Bishop of Yukon, officiating, and other Missionaries present were Mr. G. C. Ashbee, Missionary in Charge of Little Salmon and Carmacks, and Mr. Alex J. Stringer, who is in charge of the Mission at Champagne Landing.\n\nFollowing his ordination Rev. J. H. Byrne preached at the Evening Service, and later went on to Carmacks and Little Salmon to initiate the new recruit for the work at these points, afterwards going to the Ross River settlement. It is understood that after his return Mr. Byrne is to temporarily succeed Rev. J. A. Shirely in Dawson, and will be in charge of the pro-Cathedral until a successor is found for this part of the work.\n\nWork was commenced at Teslin early in June, and although there were not many Indians at the post school was commenced. Bishop and Mrs. Stringer visited us on the 14th. A service was held in the evening, which was well attended by both the white and native people. There was a celebration of Holy Communion the next morning, and many infants were baptized in the afternoon. At 11.30 p.m. with the aid of a flashlight the Bishop baptized another infant, and he and Mrs. Stringer left on the Thistle at midnight. Their visit was much enjoyed by all.\n\nBut a few days after the departure of the Thistle and the great majority of the Indians came down to the post. The school attendance rose to 33, but the usual epidemic of a mild flu meant a very fluctuating attendance.\n\nOne very sad accident took the heart right out of the native people. Matthew Jackson, one of the young men, met his death while engaged in cutting the winter wood. He being the eldest son and only newly married, made his loss keenly felt. He was laid to rest on the ninth day of July.\n\nThe services were well attended considering the fact that this summer the Indians were much more\n\n(Continued on page 8)\nCarmacks and Ross River.\n\nThe missionary activities at the centres, Little Salmon, Carmacks and Ross River, commenced for the year 1926 with the arrival of Messrs Ashbee and Byrne at Whitehorse on June 3rd, from the Steamer Princess Mary.\n\nOn the Sunday following their arrival Mr. Byrne was ordained to the Diaconate. This necessitated a stay in Whitehorse of one week.\n\nOn Wednesday, June 9th, both missionaries started down the river on the Steamer Casca. At Little Salmon a large number of Indians had already gathered and more were expected. Here Mr. Ashbee received his initiation into Indian work. Mr. Byrne, who had been in the work for the two previous summers, remaining for a or two for that purpose.\n\nThursday evening was spent in renewing acquaintances both by visiting at the camp and games. Friday school was opened with an attendance of thirteen. The attendance increased considerably subsequently and a promising summer seems to be ahead. On Saturday Mr. Byrne left for Carmacks, leaving Mr. Ashbee to carry on at Little Salmon.\n\nAt Carmacks the greater part of the time was spent in repairing the mission house, which has to undergo a thorough overhauling in preparation for permanent residence. During the week's sojourn two services were held for the white people and one for the Indians. Of the latter there were just a few in the village.\n\nNorthern Commercial Company\n\nLIMITED\n\nPioneer Company of the North\n\nGeneral Stores at Dawson and Mayo, Y.

Last winter having been a poor fur year in this district it has been difficult to get children to day school for any length of time, as the Indians are compelled to make frequent excursions in search of moose meat. Altogether thirty-two scholars have attended school this summer, although only half that number have been regular in their attendance. Church services have all been well attended.\n\nThe weather has not been good, there having been one or two thunder storms and heavy rain on several occasions. This has resulted in a number of minor cases of sickness, and two fatal cases of pneumonia. Little Salmon Johnnie died in Whitehorse General Hospital on July 4th, and Pat Pelly died at Little Salmon on July 10th. Both were buried in the burial ground at Little Salmon. The two deaths in such a short time have cast a cloud over the tribe at Little Salmon, and most of them left the district soon after the second death.\n\nAn interesting event took place at St. Peter's Church on the 15th July, when the first wedding since 1914 was held there. The contracting parties were Mr. George E. Walker, trader, of Little Salmon, and Miss Jessie Smith, of Whitehorse. The Rev. W. H. L. West, L.Th., Rector of Whitehorse, performed the ceremony, and Mr. G. C. Ashbee, missionary at Little Salmon, was \"best man.\" After the wedding the Rector and best man were guests at the wedding breakfast at the home of the bride and bridegroom.\n\nAt eight o'clock the same evening Mr. West and Mr. Ashbee, with Donald, Mr. Walker's son, left for Carmacks in a row boat.\nApart from a few over zealous mosquitos, during a halt which was made for a midnight lunch, the forty-five mile trip was most enjoyable, though a little strenuous. Arriving at Carmacks at 2.45 a.m., a few hours sleep was taken, followed by a visit to all the white families in the village. There were no Indians there so the \"trio\" returned on the Steamer Whitehorse in the evening. First aid was successfully rendered by the missionaries to a lady tourist who was taken ill on the boat, as there was no doctor on board.\n\nA large number of minor sicknesses and casualties have been dealt with. There is a vast amount of work to be done among this people. In addition to teaching the Gospel message, consistent education in hygiene, personal cleanliness and right living, as well as in the three \"R's,\" is essential. All these things take time and patience, but with God's help, and the prayers of all those who are interested in the spreading of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth, the seed consistently sown will grow, and the result will be true-living, God-fearing Indian men and women.\n\nTeslin Lake\n(Continued from page 3)\n\ntransient than usual. The tragic death of one of their prominent young people meant that a number were planning to leave much earlier than they would ordinarily have.\n\nThe student missionary found the people very willing to learn, and appreciated the presence of one to teach them more about their Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.\n\nTaylor & Drury Limited\nGeneral Merchants\nDealers in Raw Furs\n\nOutfitting Big Game Hunters and Prospectors a Specialty.\nGeneral Stores at Whitehorse, Teslin Lake, Carmacks, Selkirk, Ross River, Pelly Banks and Mayo.\n\nOwning and Operating the Steamer Thistle.\n\nHead Office: Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the appointment of the Rev. G. A. Bagshaw as Acting Principal of our Society's School at Carcross in the Yukon, was terminated at the end of last month, and that the Rev. W. H. L. West, L.Th., Rector of Whitehorse has been appointed Acting Principal under temporary engagement, until a permanent appointment can be made. Mr. West will be unable to reside at the School but he will pay a weekly visit to the same, and this along with the services of an otherwise complete staff, should insure adequate supervision of the School's activities until a resident Principal has been secured. No effort is being spared on our part to secure a suitable man, and when one has been found you will be notified of the same.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\nThe Rev G.A. Bagshaw, Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School writes that Mr T. Storey and he have both resigned their respective positions in the school and will be leaving Carcross on December 29th. Both resignations have been accepted by the Indian and Eskimo School Commission.\n\nUp to date I have no information as to whether the Commission are sending anyone to fill these vacancies. It is to be hoped that they will have someone there to take over the charge by the time the above named gentlemen leave; the institution cannot get along very well without a man during the winter when the heating and lighting plants need so much attention. Unless the vacant positions are promptly filled it will leave the school in the hands of the four ladies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 28th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of November 23rd, last, relative to the resignation of Rev. G. A. Bagshaw, Acting Principal, and of Mr. T. Storey, of the Carcross Indian Residential School, and requesting to be informed as to whether the Missionary Society of the Anglican Church have appointed anyone to fill the vacancies.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform you that in a communication from Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, dated the 2nd instant, he stated as follows:\n\n\"I have to inform you that the appointment of the Rev. G. A.

Deputy and Secretary.\nSeason's Greetings.\n\nAs this will be the last issue of Northern Lights before the holiday season we take this opportunity of extending our best wishes for a Happy Christmas and a Bright and Prosperous New Year to all.\n\nWith Bishop Stringer On The Porcupine.\n\nThe Rev. A. C. McCullum was ordained to the Priesthood by the Bishop of the Diocese on Sunday, August the first, at Old Crow on the Porcupine river.\n\nMr. McCullum had arrived a few days before from the Arctic Coast, coming by way of the portage over the mountains to La Pierre's House.\n\nThe Bishop met him on the river and spent a week or more with him visiting the Indians along the Porcupine.\n\nThe ordination service was held in the little log building used for a Church, the congregation consisting of all the Indians with the few white residents, the building being packed to the door.\n\nNo other clergyman was available to assist and Mr. McCullum was presented by Mr. Neil McDonald, a son of the late Archdeacon McDonald, a trader at Old Crow village.\n\nThough the surroundings were most primitive the service was impressive and solemn.\n\nDuring the week spent at this place the Indians were busy erecting a new log church, giving their time freely and without charge.\n\nMr. McCullum hoped to have his radio in working order before winter.\n\nDawson and Moosehide.\n\nBishop Stringer returned from the Porcupine about the middle of August and on Sunday, the 22nd of August, he ordained as Priest the Rev. J. H. Byrne, B.A.\n\nThe Rev. Canon B. Totty assisted, and the sermon was preached by Rev. G. H. Moody, who was visiting in Dawson at the time.\n\nOn the same day Rev. Richard Martin, a Takudh Indian, was ordained to the Diaconate in the Bishop Bompas Memorial Church, Moosehide. The Rev. Canon Totty, who had done much during the past several years in preparing the candidate for Holy Orders, presented him to the Bishop who preached the sermon.\n\nBefore the close of the service the new Deacon spoke to the people, asking for their prayers that he might be kept humble and be used in God's work among his people as he travelled from place to place.\nDuring the summer months the little town of Carcross takes on quite a different aspect.\n\nWhereas during the winter months we could have numbered our population on the fingers of our two hands, now during the summer months we have been alive with the \"dainty, painted, powdered and gay\" that Molloy sings about in his \"London Bridge.\" Over three thousand tourists have passed through Carcross this summer, either to the North or to Atlin and Ben-McChree. They have helped us to look on the brighter side of life with their free and easy manner, and they have been generous, kind-hearted and thoughtful. Our little Church has oftentimes been full to overflowing at the morning service with tourists who have always given us the glad hand and a merry smile after the service in thankfulness that they have been privileged to worship once more in the House of God as a unit in that vast company of God's worshippers, irrespective of creed and caste. They have also been generous in their alms:\n\nThe Chootla Indian School, Carcross.\n\nWe regret to have to report the passing of one of our staff, Miss Helen Bushell, who held the position of kitchen matron. Miss Bushell came to us on the tenth of March and was taken seriously ill six weeks later. She was removed to the hospital at Whitehorse where, after a lingering illness, she passed away on Sunday, June 13th. The remains were brought to Carcross and rested in the little Church until Wednesday, June 16th, when the interment took place at the Indian Cemetery. The Burial Service was read by the Principal, assisted by the Rector of Whitehorse. Six boys from the School bore the coffin to the graveside. Many friends from Carcross attended the funeral, and the whole school, attended by the staff, walked in procession. Numerous tributes of flowers and cards of sympathy covered the casket. The late Miss Bushell was a native of Salisbury, England, being born there 43 years ago. She has left two brothers, A. B. Bushell of Chingford, England, and H. J. Bushell, of Kensington Road, Toronto.\n\nWe are glad to report that we have now a full and efficient staff. Miss Nevill, who has seen much service in Mission Schools, is our kitchen matron; Miss Ridgeway, teacher; Miss Smith, boys' supervisor; Miss Cameron, girls' supervisor. Mr. Storey, who came to us at the same time as the late Miss Bushell, is an enthusiastic general assistant. His labours in the gar-\nden have borne good results. We have a splendid crop of all kinds of vegetables and our hay crop is twice as large as last year.\n\nWe have now 36 pupils in the school.\n\nThe Department is having the School painted and many necessary improvements are being looked forward to for the benefit of all concerned.\n\nDr. Westgate, Field Secretary for the Indian and Eskimo Commission, paid us a visit during the month of August and was well pleased with the condition of things in general.\n\nWhitehorse.\n\nThe summer has passed and we are now down to our regular winter population. The tourists have gone but during their stay in our midst much work was done amongst them in the way of giving lantern lectures, services, and assistance in any other way possible in order to make their stay the more enjoyable. Much appreciation was voiced regarding our efforts to cater to the growing tourist traffic.\n\nArmistice Day was fittingly remembered. First at the monument a short service of commemoration was held under the auspices of the Daughters of the Empire, the Rector of Christ Church leading in prayer and giving a short address. On Sunday evening, November 14th, the Old Log Church was crowded to capacity, when a special service was held in honour of those who gave their all for the sake of the Empire. The service was of an appropriate character, and the War Veterans attended in a body, and the remaining citizens turned out en masse for the occasion. The service closed with the sounding of the \"Last Post\" by Drum Major Smith, late of the 47th Battalion, C. E. F.\n\nCarmacks.\n\nOwing to the need at Dawson the work at Carmacks this summer has been of a much interrupted and unsatisfactory character. The best that could be done was done under the existing circumstances.\n\nDuring the two visits of the Rev. J. H. Byrne, the first of a week's duration in June before his trip to Ross River, and the second of two weeks after his return in July. Most of the time was devoted to rendering the mission house habitable for the winter time, a work much needing to be done. Five services were held, three for the white population and two for the Indians. The former were especially well attended and enjoyable and we trust helpful.\n\nRev. Byrne was assisted during his second visit by Mr. G. C. Ashbee from Little Salmon.\n\nIt is hoped that next year with the return of Rev. J. H. Byrne the work will assume a more stable character.\n\nNews In Brief.\n\nRev. G. H. Moody was married during the summer to Miss Anderson. Miss Anderson has worked both in the Carcross School and in St. Paul's Hostel. Rev. Moody was in charge of the mission at Rampart House and Old Crow and for a time Rector of Dawson. They are now at Eagle.\n\nRev. F. H. Buck, who left Mayo for the outside, is now Principal of the Cranbrook High School.\n\nC. F. Johnson and family have returned from their year's leave of absence. They were accompanied by Miss M. R. Austin and Miss M. Whittaker, who have taken positions in St. Paul's Hostel.\n\nDuring the summer the Revs. G. F. Leigh and J. H. Byrne were ordained to the Priesthood. The former is still continuing at Mayo, and the latter at Dawson.\n\nCaribou have been reported as numerous during the season so that all should have an abundant supply of food for the winter.

The snow fall so far has been light, so light in fact that we have not had enough for good sleighing and as a consequence the supplies of fuel have been somewhat limited. We have had one cold spell, the thermometer going well below the zero mark and registering 42 degrees below in Whitehorse. Curling and Winter sports are now getting under way, and if the weather man is not too severe we may hope for some very good sport during the long winter months. December 21st, will mark the passing of the shortest day and then we will see the days gradually lengthen out and a great part of the winter is broken, although as a general rule the worst is yet to come, as January, February and March are usually the coldest months. However Yukoners are a merry lot and will make the best of whatever may come their way. It is said that humour played an important part in the winning of the war and humour will play its part in passing away a winter however severe the laws of nature care to inflict upon us.\n\nTaylor & Drury Limited\n\nGeneral Merchants\nDealers in Raw Furs\n\nOutfitting Big Game Hunters and Prospectors a Specialty.\nGeneral Stores at Whitehorse, Teslin Lake, Carmacks, Selkirk, Ross River, Pelly Banks and Mayo.\n\nOwning and Operating the Steamer Thistle.\n\nHead Office: Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that our Commission are recommending to our Executive Committee in Toronto that the Rev. W. Tinney be nominated to your Department for the position of Principal of our Carcross School. Mr. Tinney was for some time Acting Principal of the Mackay School, The Pas, Manitoba, where his services were perfectly satisfactory to our Commission. Since then he has had a three year's course in St. John's Divinity College in this City and has been Ordained by the Archbishop of Rupert's Land to the Diaconate in our Church. He will, in due course, be advanced to the Priesthood and hopes that he may be able to complete his Arts Course extra murally. Mr. Tinney is a married man with four young children and arrangements are being made for him to enter on his duties before the end of March. Our Commission are of the opinion that all matters pertaining to the Carcross School will be carefully and satisfactorily administered under Mr. Tinney's Principalship.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, February 16, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, Field Secretary, M. S. C. C., has nominated the services of Rev. W. Tinney for the position as principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School. Mr. Tinney has had previous experience in Indian residential schools, where his services were satisfactory. Dr. Westgate informs the Department that arrangements are being made for him to enter on his duties before the end of March. The Department has approved of his appointment and hopes that he will meet with every success in his management of this school. I shall be pleased if you will give Mr. Tinney any assistance you can as he takes up his duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

It is noted that arrangements have been made for him to enter upon his duties before the end of March next. We hope that he will meet with every success in his work as principal of this school.

Bagshaw, Acting principal and Mr T. Storey, general assistant at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is gratifying to learn that the Missionary Society of the Anglican Church are taking active steps to secure suitable successors to the above named. It is to be hoped that they will be able to fill the vacancies at an early date.\n\nThe Rev W.H.L. West is only able to stay two days a week at the school and while the staff of ladies is an excellent one yet it is scarcely to be expected that they can adequately cope with the many duties to be attended to especially during the winter when the heating and lighting plants need so much attention. Mr West is undoubtedly doing all he can to keep things going.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Chooutla Indian School\n\nI. HISTORY\n\nThe Indian Boarding School now known as the Chooutla Indian School, was first established at Carcross in the spring of 1906. For some years previous a small school had been conducted at Fortymile (below Dawson), under the personal supervision of the late Bishop Rossiter. The object at that time was to supply a home for orphans and neglected children, but the need for solid educational work was so pressing, that the advantages of the school were given to all that could possibly be crowded in.\n\nThe original Carcross School consisted of two 'shacks', one of which was of logs. This was not long, however, before the Government was brought to see the solid nature of the work being done for the Indian children of the Yukon, and persuaded that a better accommodation was a necessity. As result the present commodious building was erected by the Department of Indian Affairs, and, in the fall of 1911, placed at the disposal of the Church of England, to be used as a boarding and semi-industrial school for Indian children.\n\nII. OBJECTS AND METHODS\n\nThe school has accommodation for thirty-five children. These are drawn from all parts of the Yukon, some from the immediate vicinity, some from the more northerly parts of the Territory, well within the Arctic Circle, and from many points between.\n\nThe Bishop (Right Rev. I. O. Stringer), in his travels through the Yukon, is continually seeking out suitable children. His aim is to get the best both in health and intellect, so that the graduates of the School may form in their several cases a foundation on which the missionaries can build, in their endeavours for the physical and spiritual benefit of the natives.\n\nThe Staff of the School had this object especially in view in drawing up its programme. One half of the day is spent in the classroom. There the children are given, whenever possible, an ordinary common school education. During the other half of the day they are taught the things most necessary to uplift them and their friends at home to something nearer the Christian standard of cleanliness and industry. The girls are housekeeping, sewing, etc., and the boys, gardening, rough carpenter and blacksmith work, and countless other things which will be useful in the kind of life that they will likely lead. Nor is it forgotten that mere cleverness without the Christian character will never save a man or woman.\n\nThe work is essentially missionary. Every member of the Staff is here because he or she is a missionary, and believes that the knowledge of Jesus of Nazareth and trust in Him, alone can save the decreasing Indians of the Yukon, and make them good and useful citizens of the greater Canada of the future.\n\nIII. MEANS OF SUPPORT\n\nThe connection of the School with the Department of Indian Affairs has created in many quarters a wrong impression. The idea seems to be spread that the School is supported by the Government, and is therefore in need of nothing. The Government supplies the buildings, some of the materials, pays the wages in repair, school books, the drugs, and gives a yearly per capita grant. The Church of England supplies the clothing, travelling expenses, and makes up the deficit, which is never less than $2,500 a year. No one, who has not lived in the North, has any idea of prices. A well known Yukon business man after hearing the annual report of the School, gave it as his opinion that he would not have believed it possible to run an institution of this kind so cheaply in any part of the Territory.\n\nIV. NEEDS\n\nThere is one great limitation to all work of this kind and that is lack of ready funds. Again and again we have to consider how many necessary things we must do along without. There are branches of training that Indian children ought to have, but which cannot be included because we lack the means to procure the help and supplies. There are also special needs that, varying from time to time, cannot be definitely stated, but about which any one interested can receive information either from the Superintendent of the School, or from the Bishop, the Right Rev. I. O. Stringer D.D., Dawson, Y.T.\n\nThis work is worthy of support; first, because it is carried on in obedience to the command to \"go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature,\" and secondly because it aims at turning into self-supporting and producing citizens, a race whose care is now a heavy expense to the Canadian Government.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of February 16th, file No 166-1-1, in reference to the appointment of the Rev W. Tinney to the position as principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted that the Department has approved of his appointment and you may rest assured that I will give any assistance possible to Mr Tinney as he takes up his duties.\n\nHaving had previous experience in an Indian residential school the prospect of the work at Carcross being carried on with a measure of success seems hopeful.\n\nThis school being somewhat isolated and the pupils being of mixed tribal origin it is not an easy place to manage successfully.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst Deputy and Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report the following changes on the staff of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nMiss Nevill, kitchen matron, and Miss Janet Smith, boys matron, have both resigned their respective positions. The vacancies have been filled by Miss Constance M. Winterburn as kitchen matron. She was born in Bolton, Lancashire, England, her age is 19 years, was assistant cook in the Winnipeg General Hospital for one year before coming to Carcross.\n\nMiss Muriel S. Blackburn, girl's matron, born in Liverpool, England, age 23 years, she was two years at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School before coming here and previous to that was a clerk in a drug store for 4 years. Both are very capable and energetic and will, no doubt, do good work at the school.\n\nMiss Margaret Cameron has been transferred from the girls to the boys dormitory.\n\nThe present staff is one of the most efficient I have seen at the school for some time.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, December 12, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th ultimo, informing the Department of the changes on the staff of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the changes mentioned by you have been noted and are approved. It is also noted that you consider the present staff as now constituted is the most efficient that has been at this school for sometime.

Winterburn went with her to Winnipeg. The principal does not state whether Mr. Winterburn is returning to the school.\n\nMiss Ridgeway, the teacher is resigning at the end of the current month on account of throat trouble. She is going to Vancouver for treatment.\n\nIt is to be regretted that these unfortunate circumstances have arisen as the staff was a very efficient one.\n\nThe application and health certificate of Roy Barrett, No 57, has been forwarded to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.D.

Mr Bentley is a farmer from England with 3 years experience in Canada. Mrs Bentley has had teaching experience both in England and Canada. Miss Bertram is from the Hay River School.

He states that both these ladies have had considerable experience and appear to be fully qualified for the duties to which they have been appointed.\n\nAnother male assistant is to be added to the staff shortly.\n\nWe are pleased to see a fully qualified nurse appointed to the staff of this institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nReport on the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn June a visit was made to the above school. The school was on vacation owing to an epidemic of illness which has been prevalent since the beginning of the year, when all the pupils and staff were victims of Influenza which has been followed by an epidemic of septic pneumonia resulting in the death of two pupils. The serious cases were sent to Whitehorse Hospital for treatment. At the time of my visit I found the institution clear of the epidemics and all the pupils in good health.\n\nThe classroom being closed the usual examination was not held however I examined the written work of the pupils done the week previous to the closing of the classroom which showed marked progress during the past term. Two pupils, Alice Moses and William Chitze passed the entrance examination for High School, Alice gained 86% of the marks and William 56%. The questions set were the same as in the public School of Dawson.\n\nThe Staff appear to be unsettled, the Principal and the teacher have both tendered their resignations to the Indian and Eskimo School Commission, up to date neither of these resignations have been accepted. Miss Ostergarde R.N., recently arrived to fill the position of head matron and girl's supervisor has resigned and will be married in August to the Missionary at Carmacks. Miss Bertram, the kitchen matron is compelled to resign through a complete breakdown in health. The recently arrived Miss Doris Muir, boy's matron, has settled down to her duties and Mrs Thompson has been engaged as kitchen matron.\n\nThe cultivated land including the newly cleared portion was all planted and the crops showing up nicely, given a good season free of frosts the crops should be quite an increase over last years.\n\nThe stock is in fine condition, 5 head of cattle, 1 team of horses, 2 pigs and 30 chickens. A team of dogs is also kept for winter use.\n\nGood stocks of warm serviceable clothing were on hand for the pupils and a further supply was received during my visit.\nThese Indian children are brought up chiefly on a meat diet in their native homes and do not thrive so well on a largely farinaceous diet. The meals supplied them at the school are good wholesome and plentiful but after consultation with Dr Wride a larger quantity of native meat was recommended to be given, it is felt that this would strengthen them and ensure more vitality and power of resistance when faced with illness.\n\nOwing to recent discharges of pupils already reported the number of pupils is at a low ebb, it is confidently hoped that new recruits will be secured to fill vacancies.\n\nLaundry equipment to supersede the hand machines now in use is needed. A washing machine and an extractor driven by a gas engine would be an ideal plant, will send an estimate of the cost of such an equipment to the Department later on.\n\nAnother need is a recreation room for the boys, they have to use the laundry as a play room in winter.\n\nThe Indian and Eskimo School Commission are asking for a chapel I do not consider such a building necessary for an institution of the size of the Carcross school.\n\nThe school has passed through a trying year, we hope when the new term begins all arrangements will be complete and a fresh start made.\n\nDawson, Y.T.,\nJuly 9th, 1929\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith report on the Carcross Indian Residential School which was visited last month and which, it is hoped, will prove satisfactory to the Department.\n\nEnclos.2.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

Miss Ostergaard, head matron has resigned to be married and is now at Carmacks with her husband the Rev G.C. Ashbee. Miss Bertram, kitchen matron has resigned and left the country through ill health.\n\nMr and Mrs R. Thompson of Whitehorse have been appointed to fill the positions of general assistant and kitchen matron, these appointments have not yet been confirmed by the Commission, it is expected that they will be approved.\n\nMrs W. Tinney is acting as head matron and girls supervisor and the Rev W. Tinney is teaching in the classroom, both these positions will be vacant at the end of the month.\n\nUp to date there is no word from the Commission regarding any one being appointed to fill these vacancies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 1, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, reporting the changes in the staff at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the department is communicating with Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, M.S.C.C., and requesting him to take this matter up with the Indian and Eskimo Commission with a view to making permanent arrangements for the carrying on of the work at this school. When the Department has been notified by the Commission of the names and qualifications of the principal and staff appointed to fill the vacancies mentioned in your letter you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nCarcross, Y.T.\nOttawa, October 1st, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Mr. Indian Superintendent Hawksley relative to the resignations in the staff at the Carcross Indian Residential School. He states that Rev. W. Tinney, principal, resigned from the end of September, and that Rev. J. H. Byrne, lately rector of Dawson, will take charge until the services of a principal can be obtained; also that Mr. E. H. Bentley, general assistant, and Mrs. Bentley, teacher, have both resigned and left the school, Miss Ostergard, head matron, has resigned to be married and that the kitchen matron, Miss Bertram, has also resigned, and that temporary arrangements have been made to carry on the work, but that up to the date of his letter no word had been received regarding anyone being appointed to permanently fill the vacancies.\n\nThere have been considerable changes in the staff at this school during the past year, which are detrimental to the work of the school and also in the care of the equipment. The Department would be pleased if the authorities of the Indian and Eskimo Commission would give the matter of obtaining a permanent staff early consideration, and I shall be pleased to have the names, qualifications, etc., of the officers nominated by the Commission to carry on the work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Wentgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWinnipeg, Man. October 5, 1929\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of October 1st, in which you refer to a communication received from Mr. Indian Superintendent Hawksley, relative to changes in the staff at the Carcross Indian Residential School, and in reply I beg to state that although certain changes have taken place in the personnel of the staff, the conditions are not, I think, quite so bad as they might appear when viewed from a distance, and in the light of the information you appear to have received from your representative.\n\nIn the first place, it is true that the Rev. W. Tinney resigned from the Principalship of this school at the end of September, but the appointment of the Rev. J. H. Byrne, which was made at short notice to fill the position of Acting-Principal, was intended to be a permanent appointment subject to the approval of your Department, and he has already signified his willingness to remain for one year at least. Mr. Byrne is a capable man and I trust it may be possible for our Commission to secure his services for an indefinite period.\n\nMrs. Byrne is a fully qualified teacher, and she will take the place of Mrs. Bentley who resigned. When Mrs. Bentley resigned, her husband, of course, severed his connection with the school also, but our Commission were fortunate in being able to secure the services of Mr. and Mrs. Thomson who entered on their duties immediately after the Bentleys withdrew, Mr. Thomson taking the position of Farm Instructor and Mrs. Thomson that of Kitchen Matron to succeed Miss Bertram.\nThe retirement of Miss Ostergaard, the Head Matron, upon her marriage to the Rev. C. C. Ashbee, left the Head Matronship vacant, but our Commission are appointing a Kitchen Matron so that Mrs. Thomson, who is a Graduate Nurse, may take over this position.\n\nThe frequent changes of staff agents at our Society's Indian Residential Schools are always deeply regretted by our Commission and they do their very utmost to prevent this. They regret the changes which have taken place at the Caroross School during the past year, but they believe that the work has not suffered to any appreciable extent in consequence, and I can assure you on behalf of our Commission that, despite the remote situation which this school occupies, the interests of your Department and of our Society are being very carefully safeguarded.\n\nIn a telegram just received this morning from Mr. Byrne, the Acting Principal, he points out the very urgent need of different items of equipment, etc., and our Commission have asked their bankers to place $100.00 immediately at his disposal to meet some of the more urgent of these. Amongst other things he asks to be supplied at once with a sturdy one-horse waggon, and it would be a great help to our Commission if your Department could authorize them to spend the sum of approximately $150.00 to provide this very necessary item of equipment. I sincerely trust that this help may be forthcoming in the immediate future, and will be obliged if you will kindly notify me by wire if this sum may be expended for the waggon mentioned.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.S.\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office\nDawson, Y.T. October 4th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report the following changes of the staff of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Rev. W. Tinney, Principal, and Mrs. Tinney, Head Matron have resigned and left the school on September 30th. Miss Ostergaard, R.N., Head Matron resigned in August. Mrs. Tinney took over her work. Mr. E. Bentley, General Assistant, and Mrs. Bentley, Teacher both resigned last month. Mrs. Bentley has since been appointed to the Moosehide Indian day school. Miss E Bertram, Kitchen Matron was compelled to resign through ill health.\n\nThe following appointments have been made to fill the vacancies.\n\nThe Rev. J.H. Byrne, B.A. of Emmanuel College, Saskatoon, to be principal. Mrs. Winnifred Byrne to act as teacher pro tem. She has a second class certificate from the Saskatchewan Normal School. Both are of English birth.\n\nMr. R. Thompson, General Assistant, a returned soldier. Mrs. R. Thompson, R.N., Head Matron. Both were born in England. Mrs. Thompson is at present acting as kitchen matron until the vacancy is filled. It is expected that a teacher and kitchen matron will be appointed shortly. Miss Doris Muir continues to fill the position of Boys Supervisor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 22nd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, informing the Department of the changes in the staff of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that these changes have been noted and are approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In this connection the Department is communicating with Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, M. S. C. C., and requesting him to take the matter up with the Indian and Eskimo Commission, with a view to the appointment of a principal and other members of the staff. When advice is received from the Commission, regarding the names and qualifications of the principal and staff appointed to fill the vacancies mentioned in your letter, you will be informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nCarcross,\nY. T.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter 166-1-1 dated the 14th instant, in connection with our Carcross School, and to inform you that the Commission are fully alive to the requirements at that School and are using every effort to satisfactorily fill the vacancies.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Byrne took over the work at this School with the understanding that it should only be for a period of one year, as Mr. Byrne had Post Graduate work which he wished to do in the autumn of 1930. Several applications for the vacant Principalship have been received, but up to the present no definite appointment has been made. Miss Spence the Girls' Matron was quite new to the work and found it uncongenial. The resignation of Miss Smith came as a distinct surprise to the Commission as they were quite unaware that she had any thought of training for a nurse. A suitable agent, however, to fill the vacancy of Kitchen Matron has been found in the person of Mrs. Miller of Limerick, Sask., who comes to the Commission quite highly recommended by the W.A. It is also anticipated that a suitable teacher will be appointed in the near future in order to go forward at the same time as Mrs. Miller.\n\nDr. Westgate is at present in Vancouver and is making a point of endeavouring to secure a suitable man for the position of Principal, in B.C., in order that the vacancy may be filled without delay. The Commission fully expect that a full staff will be in residence at the Chootla Indian School before the first of September next, and as soon as arrangements have been completed and definite appointments made, a further\ncommunication will be addressed to your Department.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secy-Treas.\nIndian Residential School Commission.\n\nE.M./JF\nREPORT ON THE CARCROSS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe above school was visited last June. Arriving there on Saturday afternoon no work was undertaken until Monday morning when the examination in the class room. The work of both the senior and junior grades was very good and reflects much credit upon the teacher, Mrs J.H. Byrne. The daily register was neatly kept and quite up to date. The school material was not up to standard in the way it was kept, in fact it was in an untidy state.\n\nThe interior of the institution showed many signs of neglect, several doors were off their hinges, there were numerous broken windows and the walls of some of the rooms were very untidy, the pupils have been allowed to write their names on the blackboard and decorate it with other designs, unsightly stains of water streaked the walls in several places. A few of the rooms were kept neat but taking the institution as a whole it presented a general appearance of carelessness, a good deal of litter was lying around both inside and outside of the building. The pupils have been allowed to chalk upon the walls on the exterior of the building which does not add to its appearance.\n\nThe new porcelain bath and the 24 new taps that were, it was said, so urgently needed and were sent to the school last December, I found the bath standing in a room used as a bedroom and being used as a receptacle for soiled clothing, it has not been installed, six of the new taps had been attached the rest were stowed away.\n\nThe boys and girls no longer use the separate entrances provided but use both entrances promiscuously. Discipline is very lax, the pupils are very noisy, deportment is at a low ebb.\n\nA great deal of time has been spent by the principal and his assistant and some of the elder boys in constructing a very crude flume and water wheel at the little waterfall at the back of the school, disfiguring the one beauty spot of the place and so far getting little benefit from it. The principal has an idea that the little creek at the back of the school can be made to do many things. Some years ago I took this matter up with a practical engineer. His opinion was that when the creek was at its highest level and discharging most water not more than 10 or 15 horsepower could be developed. In the winter this creek freezes solid and is utterly useless for any purpose. A dam was built across the creek by the Principal this was washed away by the first freshet. It appears to me that it is not worth while spending so much time and money on it.\n\nBefore leaving the school the principal asked me to write to the Indian and Eskimo Commission in reference to the food supplies sent in. I felt it was not within my province to do this but promised to bring the matter to the notice of the Department. I am now quoting his own words, \"I requisitioned for 12 barrels of flour for the quarter June to September, I have received only 7 barrels. I asked for 150 lbs of rice and the same amount of white beans, I received only 50 lbs of each, there are no vegetables in the place. I am expected to make 1 lb of jam or 1 lb of lard spread 65 slices of bread; several other things were mentioned, however, are sufficient to show the difficulties he has to contend with. Among the white people and Indians there is a strong rumour that the pupils are insufficiently fed. Dr H.J. Munro of Whitehorse stated that he considers the pupils should have a more generous diet. From what I saw of the meals served to the pupils, they were sufficient in quantity but very monotonous.\n\nDawson, Y.T.\nJuly 22nd, 1930.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAtlin, B.C.\nJune 28th 1930,\n\nMr Superintendent Hawksley,\nThe Carcross Indian School,\nCarcross, Y.T.\n\nSir,\n\nUpon going forward with the intention of sending some more children to the Indian School at Carcross, the following information has come to light, and therefore is at once submitted.\n\nIt is rumoured that at nights some boys of the Carcross town, or elsewhere meet the elderly girls of the school, and this is done by some back stair case or fire escape. Also that the girls manage to arrange such meetings when allowed out during the daytime, and it is thought most likely when visiting the town of Carcross.\n\nTo back up this seemingly wild rumor, somebody in Carcross mentioned to me whilst passing through, that \"the big girls were running around quite a bit\" but who I was told me so is I am sorry to say has been forgotten.\n\nEvery effort has been taken to knock such a rumor on the head with the result that two children will be sent to your school some time after the first of the coming month. The parents in this case will be leaving at that time for their next winter's quarters on the Taku river, and will therefore be out of touch with your school for the rest of this year.\n\nMight I be advised if this is correct, and if so they shall be turned over to your safe keeping, as soon as possible.\n\nI quite expect that the above rumor is simply talk, but thought it my duty to advise you of what I had heard.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nCarcross,Y.T.  \nJuly Ist,1930.\n\nSir;\u2014 I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of June 28th. in reference to the rumours that have come to your knowledge regarding the elder girls of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that there is no truth in the report that the girls get away from the school at night for the purpose of meeting the boys over in town. It is quite within the range of possibilities when they go over in the daytime. Owing to the school being understaffed the girls do go over to town without proper supervision.\n\nUnquestionably the discipline here is very lax, I have brought this to the notice of the Principal. Naturally the Principal says there is no truth to all these rumours and I agree with him that things are not anything like so bad as represented but I do think that all the pupils are allowed too much liberty and that the general supervision is very far from what it should be.\n\nYou may, with confidence, send on the two pupils from Atlin as soon as convenient to you, the holidays make no difference to their reception.\n\nThe correspondence in reference to the Anderson children has been returned to Telegraph Creek.\n\nThanking you for your letter and for the information contained therein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley.\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nHarper Reed.Esq.\nIndian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek.B.C.\nDawson Y.T. July 2nd, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a report of my recent visit to the Carcross Indian Residential School, also a letter received from Mr. Harper Reed, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C., with a copy of my reply to Mr. Reed.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nVictoria, B.C., August 30, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nIn accordance with Departmental instructions to you contained in letter dated April 30th I have inspected the Stikine Indian Agency with headquarters at Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nIt is further recommended that a special inspection be made at the Carcross Indian Residential School which at present seems to bear an unsavoury reputation in the North, with a view of bringing it to a higher degree of efficiency and in order that the children of Anglican families in the Stikine Agency may be given suitable and satisfactory residential school accommodation and supervision. Of course, this recommendation is made subject to a satisfactory report being made by our medical officer respecting the physical fitness of the applicant pupils.\n\nC. C. Perry.\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B. C.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that after consultation with our General Secretary, and Bishop Stringer, our Commission have decided to recommend the Rev. H. C. M. Grant for the position of Principal of the Choutia Indian Residential School at Carcross, Yukon, and trust that this recommendation may receive the approval of your Department.\n\nAs information has reached our Commission that this school is at present quarantined on account of an outbreak of chicken pox, and that Deaconess Topping, the Head Matron is also ill, arrangements are being made for Mr. Grant to proceed to Carcross at the earliest opportunity. It is fully expected that he will be able to travel by C.P.R. steamer leaving Vancouver on Nov. 13th, and so should reach Carcross not later than Nov. 16th.\n\nIn support of our Commission's recommendation that Mr. Grant be given the appointment in question, I beg to state that for some years he served as a layman on the staff at our Hay River and the Mackay schools. From the Mackay school he proceeded to Emmanuel College, Saskatoon, where he completed his studies in theology, and was Ordained to the parish of Mortlach in the Diocese of Qu'Appelle by Bishop Harding.\n\nDr. Hallam, who was Principal of Emmanuel College when Mr. Grant was in residence there, states that he is industrious, willing, and capable in various ways. He also states that he is attractive and gets on well with others. With regard to Mrs. Grant he states that she is a great help, and he highly recommends Mr. Grant for the Principalship of the school in question.\n\nSimilarly favourable reports have also been received from the Bishop of Qu'Appelle and the Superintendent of the Mission.\nof which the parish of Mortlach forms a part.\n\nI shall be glad to have your approval of Mr. Grant's appointment, and your approval of the action taken by our Commission in arranging for him to proceed to Carcross at the earliest opportunity to help to relieve the strain imposed upon the present staff through the outbreak of chicken pox.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, November 3, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, nominating Rev. H. C. M. Grant as teacher of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Rev.

Up to date no report of a new principal being sent in has come to hand. The position has been vacant since the end of August.\n\nMrs Miller, girl's matron, who came to the school last September has resigned, she left the institution in October.\n\nMr Frank Ginn, general assistant, came last May. He has also resigned and leaves the school on the 17th of this month.\n\nThe present staff consists of Miss Louise Topping, who is acting principal, head matron and teacher; she is also doing the duties of girl's matron at present. Miss Doris Mair is the boys matron and Miss Agnes Smith is kitchen matron.\n\nMiss L. Topping is a Deaconess, trained in Toronto. She was born in New Brunswick and is 33 years of age.

MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise the Department that I am informed by Mr. Harper Reed, Indian Agent, Stikine Agency, at Telegraph Creek that complaints have reached him from Indians of his Agency that conditions are not as might be expected at the Chootka Indian Residential School, Carcross, Yukon Territory. Letters received by Agent Reed are to the effect that the children at the school are not taken proper care of, are poorly clad, deprived of sufficient food, neglected as to their health and not properly supervised as to their moral conduct. It is further stated that the older female pupils are allowed their freedom in Carcross where they associate with white lads in the white community.\n\nAgent Reed has referred to the visit to Stikine Agency, in August last, of Mr. Assistant Commissioner Perry to whom at that time similar complaints were made. Mr. Perry's official report of August 30th, 1930, pages 6 & 9, dealt with the matter and recommended that a special inspection of the Carcross school be made for reasons given therein.\n\nThe Department will be aware, of course, that Carcross, being in Yukon Territory, is not part of the jurisdiction of this office, but as one of our Agents complains with respect to British Columbia Indian children attending the Carcross School, it is thought that the matter might properly be brought again to the Department's attention, together with a suggestion that if the Department should consider an inspection advisable under the circumstances and there being no School Inspector, in all probability, in the Yukon, a visit may be made by the newly appointed School Inspector Barry, who is now attached to this office, sometime during the coming summer when he is in the northern part of the Province. This, of course, is simply a suggestion in case the Department may wish to have such an inspection and is not intended as desiring to in any way interfere with affairs now in the jurisdiction of another Commissioner - Mr. Hawkesly. It is quite possible that Mr. Hawkesly may have reported on the conditions at the School in which case representations made to Agent Reed by certain Indians might be considered in conjunction with such reports.\n\nI may say that Mr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, will likely be a busy man for some time with his regular work and might ill be spared for the trip to Carcross during the present - the first - year of his appointment, but if the Department feels that a visit by him to Carcross may have good results, no doubt this could be satisfactorily arranged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 19, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to complaints that reached Mr. Indian Agent Reed, Stikine Agency, from the Indians of his Agency, regarding conditions at the Carcross (Choutla) Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that during the past year there have been frequent changes in the staff at this school and, as a result, the general conditions have, no doubt, not been satisfactory. Mr. Superintendent Hawksley, Dawson, informed the Department in December, last, that the school now had a complete staff, and he was of opinion that the members were efficient and that the discipline and general conditions would improve. We are, however, communicating with Mr. Hawksley and informing him of the report that reached Mr. Agent Reed. We are requesting him to make, as soon as possible, a thorough inspection of the work at this school, and to forward his report to the Department. It is not considered necessary to have Mr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, visit Carcross. When we have Mr. Hawksley's report, Mr. Reed will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, February 19, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has been informed that Mr. Indian Agent Reed, Stikine Agency, at Telegraph Creek, B.C., has received complaints from Indians of his Agency that conditions at the Carcross Indian Residential School are not as might be expected. It is stated that the children at the school are not taken proper care of and poorly clad, deprived of sufficient food, neglected as to their health and not properly supervised as to their moral conduct. It is also stated that the older female pupils are allowed their freedom in Carcross, where they associate with white lads in the white communities.\n\nIn this connection, I would refer to various reports from you regarding the frequent changes in staff at this school, which, no doubt, occasioned the conditions complained of. However, as reported by you in letter dated December 19th, last, that this school now had a complete staff and the work under their charge should make good progress, it is hoped that there has been a decided improvement in conditions.\n\nI have to request that you will visit this school and make a thorough inspection of the general conditions. You should report specially on the quantity of food and clothing supplied, discipline, classroom activities, cleanliness of pupils and school and the latitude allowed the pupils in their associations outside the school, as well as any other matters which may come under your notice. The Department will be pleased to have as full a report as possible at your early convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Bread is served at all meals.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated February 19th, file No 166-1-1, in reference to the reported conditions at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that reports and rumours carried by Indians are not always reliable. Some have really wonderful imaginations and can relate a very feasible story based on the very slimmest of facts. Forty-three years experience in dealing with these northern Indians has taught me this.\n\nIt is very true that under the late principal, the Rev J.H. Byrne, the school experienced a really serious decline in cleanliness, discipline, deportment of the pupils and care of the institution generally. These things were brought to the notice of the principal when I visited the school in June 1930. To my great surprise I found that the elder girls were allowed to spend the whole of Sunday at the Indian village, situated across the lake opposite the school. The parents or relatives of these girls do not live in Carcross. For the first time in the history of the school a young Indian from the village entered the girl's dormitory at night by means of the fire escape. Fortunately the offender was discovered, through the alertness of Miss Muir, Boys Matron, before any real harm had been done. No action was taken against the offender which, I think, was a great mistake. Mr Byrne did not report this during my visit to the school. At my request a stop was put to the elder girls visiting the Indian village nor were they to be allowed to visit the town of Carcross unless accompanied by some member of the staff. On my return visit to the school last September I found that matters in this particular point had very much improved. The Rev J.H. Byrne had left and Deaconess Topping was acting principal pending the appointment of a new man.\n\nThe Rev H.C.M. Grant arrived in November, since his arrival the conditions at the school have greatly improved.\n\nRegarding the pupils being poorly clad, this certainly is not true. I inspected the clothing stores and found an ample supply of good, warm serviceable clothing suitable to our rigorous climate. There were also several bales of clothing that had not been opened. All the pupils were comfortably and suitably clothed and were neat and clean in appearance. Upon inquiry of the pupils as to whether they had enough clothing, their reply was \"We have lots of it\".\nThe question of food is not so satisfactory. It is not true to say that the pupils are deprived of sufficient food. During the past year I spent two weeks at the school, I visited the kitchen at meal times to see what was being served to the pupils. The quantity was sufficient to give each pupil ample for its need even though they had good appetites and generally there was some left over. If a pupil becomes hungry between meals they can always get something to eat by applying to the kitchen matron. It seems to me that the diet is not varied enough and the pupils tire of the sameness of the meals and that may be the reason why a pupil sometimes leaves the dining room without having complete satisfaction and possibly complains to others of not getting enough to eat. The staff can scarcely be blamed for this. The provision stores are kept down to what may be termed a dangerous limit. Several of the principals have complained about the requisitions that they have sent in to the Indian and Eskimo School Commission, Winnipeg, being cut down to the lowest possible limit. Surely a principal knows what provisions he needs to carry on with better than someone located so far away. This close cutting of supplies might prove serious if a blockade or breakdown occurred on the single line of railway that supplies the Yukon. I have known the line to be blocked for nearly one month at a time. An emergency supply of provisions should be kept on hand in case of accident. Instead of this the staff have to exercise the very strictest economy to make the supplies last out the quarter, even at that they sometimes run out of some items, especially if they happen to have some visitors. I make a practice of taking my provisions along when I visit the school. There is much room for improvement in the quantity and variety of the supplies sent by the Commission.\n\nFor a time the supervision of the pupils was not all that it should have been partly due to the school being understaffed and partly to the laxity of the late principal who certainly did not understand the nature and characteristics of the Indians. Under the present staff this defect has been materially remedied.\n\nThe health of the pupils is carefully watched. Dr Wride visits the school once a quarter and examines each pupil and is ready to go at any time when an emergency call is sent in. An ample supply of medicines is always kept on hand. A registered nurse takes care of the general health of all the pupils. The school is well ventilated and the staff see to it that there is plenty of fresh air.\n\nNeither Indians or Whites are allowed to loaf around the school premises or grounds.\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Mr Harper Reed at the school last June, he had the opportunity of going over the school though it was not an opportune time for his visit, the workmen were busy.\nIn the improvements that were made last summer consequently the place was much upset. Mr. Reed made no complaints to me at the time but later wrote much on the same lines as your letter. I gave him an explanation of the whole case and assured him that he need have no hesitation in sending any prospective pupils he had for the school.\n\nThe Bishop of Yukon has recently visited Dawson, on his way here he visited the Carcross school, staying five days. He stated that it gave him much pleasure to see the marked improvement that had taken place under the new staff. The Bishop saw the school in April of last year when things were at their worst.\n\nReferring to your request that I visit the school for the purpose of making a thorough inspection I wish to say that, in view of the improvement that has taken place, and taking into consideration the high cost of making a trip from Dawson to Carcross at this time of the year, the round trip would cost at least $350.00, and after consultation with the Gold Commissioner it was considered advisable to postpone the trip until the opening of navigation when the round trip will cost one third of the present rate. It is hoped that this will meet with the approval of the Department. It would be quite the middle of April before I could reach the school if I left here by the next stage. A thorough inspection will be made when I visit the school on the opening of navigation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 22, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nIn February, last, Mr. W. E. Ditchburn, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, forwarded a complaint which the Indians of your Agency made regarding conditions at the Carcross Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that a report has been received from Mr. Hawkeley, Indian Superintendent for the Yukon, which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Reports and rumors carried by Indians are not always reliable. Some have really wonderful imaginations and can relate a very feasible story based on the very slimmest of facts.

H. C. M. Grant took up duties as Principal. It is also noted that the pupils have an ample supply of good warm, serviceable clothing, also that there has been an improvement in the food supplied for their use. It is further noted that more strict supervision is kept over the pupils and that the older girls are not allowed to visit the Indian village on Sundays. You should inform the Principal that he is not to permit the pupils to be absent from the school overnight, unless for urgent reasons, and the girls should not be allowed to visit the town of Carcross if they are not accompanied by a member of the staff.\n\nIn view of the cost of making a special trip to the school, I have to say that it will be satisfactory for you to make a thorough inspection into the general conditions at the time of your next visit to the school, and you might again communicate with the Department.\n\nThe copy of the menu of daily meals served the pupils, prepared by the Principal and forwarded under cover of your letter of the 27th ultimo, has been received.\n\nThe Department is communicating with Mr. Indian Agent Reed, Stickine Agency, informing him of the improvement in conditions at this school under the management of the new Principal and staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\n\nT.

Topping who resigned at the end of the school year for health reasons.\n\nThe new teacher is Miss F.M. Whyte, born at Blackheath, London, England on March 22nd, 1886. She has passed the Oxford Senior Local Examination and has studied at the Universities of Bonn and Lausanne. During the past year she has been a governess in Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe principal states that, judging from first impressions, she appears to be a capable teacher from whom we may expect good results.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F.

It is noted that these drills are held each week and that the children, who were in bed asleep when the alarm sounded, were able to clear of the building in creditable time.\n\nIt would not appear necessary, however, to hold these drills at such frequent intervals during the winter months, as there is danger of the children taking cold when leaving the school unclad. While the Department requires that fire drills be held at regular intervals, the Principal should use discretion as to the timing of the drills.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mankind has since 1919, made a half-hearted attempt to secure such a peace. Peace might be said to be the lack of war, but in reality it is something far greater than that. Peace is a complete harmony between every man. It calls for the knocking down of national, geographical and racial barriers. If man would gain such a peace as he demands or desires, he must build contrary to the manner in which he has built. His peace must be built upon the revelation of God revealed in the humanity of Christ.\n\nJ. B. Phillips says of peace: \u201cPeople only see peace as an attractive state of things actually during a war. When they have peace, they do not value it.\u201d In the light of the past decade this statement is exceedingly true to us. In the world struggle of 1914-18, the predominating desire of the world was peace. When that peace was obtained men promptly forgot about the economic distress, the loss of life and the maimed and incapacitated people left in the wake of the gigantic European struggle and set about creating an atmosphere of discontent and jealousy which has resulted in half a dozen minor wars in various parts of the world. These wars affected more or less isolated groups. They had no power of dragging the world powers into another general conflict.\n\nAfter the Great War, we saw the birth of the League of Nations, which was a gigantic organization composed of the major nations of the world for the avowed purpose of establishing international peace and the prevention of war. In 1931-32 arose a condition calling for the League to exercise its authority. I refer to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Here was a nation making an apparent unprovoked attack upon another. Here was a nation throwing to the four winds of heaven the principles for which a large part of the world was working. The reply of the League of Nations to this challenge was a formal and solemn pronouncement of censure upon the aggressor. That is what we had labour for!\n\nNow we are faced with a problem which is much the same except that the two nations involved, Italy the aggressor, and Ethiopia the invaded, are both members of the League of Nations, and both Christian. Both parties have covenanted to keep peace and to accept the findings of the League and if possible, to settle their dispute by means that will not cause the world at large to topple over\u2014the way it did after war. But when nations within the organization fly at one another\u2019s throats; when the terms of the covenants made are violated; when other nations withdraw or refuse to enter the organization so that they will not have to pass their opinion in regard to any infringement of the codes, how are we ever going to achieve the fondest of our dreams: World Peace?\n\nThe burden of the present crisis is falling upon three or four great nations. Many of our people are dissatisfied with the League of Nations and its work and openly make the charge that the League has failed in its purpose and its work. Recently Great Britain has been very severely criticized by different parties and by the press over her attitude to Italy\u2019s invasion of Ethiopia. In the London Daily Mail appeared this extract:\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nTHE LEAGUE OF MISCHIEF\n\nIf Signore Mussolini, as the result of the present crisis, succeeds in ridding the world of the meddling, muddling, peril-to-peace League of Nations, he will have performed a great international service. He will also have relieved this country of a most dangerous entanglement, seeing that British Governments today have to spend a large part of their time in what they call \"upholding the prestige of the League\" and trying to keep it alive instead of attending to British interests.\n\nIn the Detroit News appeared the following:\n\nUP TO BRITAIN?\n\nThe outstanding fact is that Great Britain can stop the war (in Ethiopia) if she has nerve enough to face the consequences, which necessarily would be troublesome.\n\nAs Archbishop Temple said recently in a broadcast in England: \"First let us be quite clear that the will of God for mankind is peace and goodwill. War cannot break out except through some departure from His will.\" Archbishop Temple attributes this present failure of the world to gain peace to two sources, namely that we have not yet learned to apply our faith to this problem and that our worship of Jesus Christ is incomplete.\n\nIf we as professing Christians, individually and collectively as nations, could only see that war is a scandal to those who profess the faith of Christ, and if only we could see that Christian fighting Christian is nothing but a mockery of the Christian principles, there would be less talk of and fewer attempts at war, and greater strides made for world peace. If only we would stop playing the hypocrites if the members of the League of Nations would put away hypocrisy and acknowledge in word and deed that war is incompatible with Christian civilization, then we would see the dawn of world peace. I grant that it would require something that many individuals and groups of statesmen of the world are not ready to give, namely, themselves wholly over to Christ and to acknowledge that He has complete authority over all parts of life.\n\nThe only way the world will ever find peace is to find it the way that He proclaims. To find it by the way of love, and that can only be done by living the way The Christ called His disciples to live. That is the way of peace.\n\nLet us then strive honestly, without hypocrisy as individuals and as nations, to do what St. Paul advised us to do: \"Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another.\"\n\nWe profess to be Christians, to be civilized, to be progressive, to have raised our standard higher than it has been held by any previous civilization.\n\nIn the name of God therefore let us get down to facts; let us throw ourselves back upon his promises and His way and bring to pass the thing that we most desire in this present day\u2014International Peace.\n\nNOTES FROM THE MISSIONS\n\nCARCROSS, Choontin School.\u2014In July a wedding of great interest took place in St. Saviour's Church, Miss Dorothy Griffiths of Welland, Ontario, and Mr. H. S. White were united in Holy Matrimony. The Bishop of the Diocese performed the ceremony, the Principal was the best man, Corporal Kingston, R.C.M.P., gave the bride away and Miss M. D. Hoehn of Oak Lake, Manitoba, was the bridesmaid. The Church was suitably decorated with lovely flowers sent from Ben-My-Chree for the occasion. Miss Vincent sang a solo during the signing of the register. The bride wore a lovely ivory satin gown and carried a bouquet of delphiniums grown at the school, the first of the season. After the ceremony a reception was held at the home of the Principal, where friends of the happy pair gathered to wish them every blessing. The table was tastefully decorated with flowers, the centre-piece being a lovely three-tiered wedding cake. After the reception the bride and groom left for a short honeymoon in the district. Mrs. White is now the new staff of the school as Boys' Supervisor, a position left vacant when Miss Seale went on furlough.\n\nDuring the holidays the younger boys spent an enjoyable time under canvas at Ten Mile while the elder boys were busy with the hay.\n\nThe Staff of the school have recently made a voluntary donation towards the Restoration Fund of $211.00. This is in addition to the amount subscribed by them during the past three years.\n\nThree of our pupils returned to their home this year. These we commend to your prayers. One of them has been placed in charge of the Indian Day School at Old Crow and is reported to be doing very well.\n\nWe had quite a number of visitors during the summer months, among them being Rev. and Mrs. Jenkins and Mr. and Mrs. French of Whitehorse; Mrs. Johnson; Miss Vincent of Winnipeg; and Mrs. Wheatley of Manitoba.\n\nWe are glad to say that we have been able to start a Senior Branch of the W. A. among the Indian women of Carcross. They have their own officers and are running it on true W. A. lines with a little help from the school. Donations of deer skins, beads and wool were received in order that they might begin clear of debt. These gifts we thankfully acknowledge.\n\nBishop and Mrs. Geddes paid us a flying visit on their way out.\n\nWe have extended our farming a little, having added a couple of pigs to our stock. These are well housed in a pig pen erected by the Farm Instructor and the older boys.\n\nMiss M. I. Dunn joined our Staff as teacher in August. She comes to us with ten years' experience of Indian School work. May her stay with us be long and happy.\n\nCARCROSS, St. Saviours.\u2014The Rev. H. C. M. Grant, Principal of the Indian Residential School, has conducted services in St. Saviour's Church, Carcross, during the absence of Mr. Vincent, who has been stationed at Teslin for the summer months. At this post the natives, about 120 in number, are all away at their hunting and trapping grounds throughout the winter.\nWHITEHORSE, Christ Church.\u2014Owing to shortage of space in the last issue of this paper we were unable to enter any notes concerning the parish of Christ Church.\n\nDuring the Tourist Season, the Rector, Rev. C. H. Jenkins, gave twenty-six illustrated lectures on the Yukon and the work of our Church in this territory. Attendances at the lectures were very gratifying and were very much appreciated by those who attended them. It is hoped that next year we may have more new views to add to the collection we already have.\n\nIn the month of June the Annual Diocesan meeting of the W. A. was held in Whitehorse.\n\nWe are sorry to report that we have had a number of deaths recently in our little community. A few weeks ago Mrs. Thomas, an elderly woman, died here and died several days later in the hospital. Then one of the old timers of the town of Whitehorse, Mr. E. J. Hummacher, a well-known Northern photographer, passed away.\n\nA few days after Mrs. Thomas, our oldest Indian, died at the age of 85.\n\nOn Sunday evening, November 16th, the annual Remembrance Service was held in Christ Church, the Rev. C. H. Jenkins conducting the service. We are very grateful to some of our members for their aid given that night to make the service successful. This service is the most popular of the year and was very well attended, there being 90 persons present.\n\nAll our branches of the W. A. are working steadily forward. Mrs. Jenkins at present is preparing her group of girls to present a concert at the latter part of this month or else in the first week of December.\n\nChrist Church has lost two able workers in the persons of Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Coulter, who left early in October to take up residence in Victoria, B. C.\n\nWe are glad to report that Mrs. W. S. Watson is improving rapidly after her operation. Mrs. Watson is at present in Vancouver, B. C.\n\nDAWSON, St. Paul's.\u2014The Rev. A. C. McCullum and Mrs. McCullum with their two little sons arrived in Dawson on August 2nd, which parish Mr. McCullum has recently been appointed to.\n\nThe Junior Branch of the W. A. had a very successful day on the 17th of August.\n\nOn August 4th, Rt. Rev. W. A. Goddes, D.D., Bishop of Yukon, ordained to the Priesthood in St. Paul's Church, Rev. Leslie G. Chappell.\n\nHarvest Thanksgiving Services were held on Sunday, September 4th. The Church was beautifully decorated on this occasion by the Chancel Guild under the supervision of Miss Rhoda Swift. Special music was given, and all services well attended.\n\nThe programme for parish activities has now been completed and the various organizations hope to soon have their work under way. We trust that with earnest effort and cooperation on the part of all, the work of this parish will be greatly blessed and much good result.\n\nRev. L. G. Chappell kindly consented to take charge of the choir work for this coming season.\n\nRt. Rev. W. A. Goddes and Mrs. Goddes, with their little son David, left for the south on August 14th. We are indeed sorry to see them leave but trust that the Bishop's health will be greatly improved when they return to us in the spring.\n\nFORT SELKIRK.\u2014We were very happy to welcome Mrs. Ferrabee when she visited Fort Selkirk. Many of the members of the W. A. returned to the post to meet her, and a very pleasant meeting of the Branch was held at the home of the President, Mrs. Coward. Mrs. Ferrabee's visit was a great inspiration to us, and has made us feel that we have the Right Hand of Fellowship of the great Dominion-wide organization.\n\nThe Bishop, who was at Selkirk at the same time as Mrs. Ferrabee, administered the Rite of Confirmation on Monday, July 15th. Three candidates were presented and immediately after Confirmation they received their first Communions.\n\nYour prayers are asked for these three persons, that they may prove themselves Christians.\n\nThe Church Bell has now been removed to the Belfry in the Church. Hitherto it was outside the Mission House on a scaffolding. Messrs. Lar- kins, Larson and Lehland, trappers from the Macmillan River, very kindly undertook this work, and we are very grateful to them.\n\nThese three men also repaired the sidewalk of the Mission House.\n\nCarmacks Mission was opened during the months of July and August. The response to our efforts here was most encouraging and it was with regret that we had to leave.\n\nThe Selkirk W. A. report a very successful year and at present are making plans for the forthcoming Winter. Sunday, October 6th, was observed as W. A. Sunday. The Selkirk Branch celebrated the Jubilee of the Organization. The members had a Corporate Communion at 8 a.m. and at Matins a special address on the W.A. was given. The attendance showed that there is no lack of enthusiasm for the W. A. among all the people here.\n\nThe Church at Fort Selkirk now has a very beautiful Font, a Memorial to Mrs. Bompas, the wife of the first Bishop of Yukon. This is a gift from the Diocesan W. A. and our thanks go to that generous Society.\n\nWe also thank the Yukon Diocesan W. A. for the gift of a Service Book for use in the Church at Selkirk and the Moosehide Mission for the Lectern which they sent us.\n\nThe Ministers recently made a journey down the river North of Selkirk to visit the people along the way before the freeze-up. These lonely woodcutters and trappers and the small band of Indians need your prayers.\n\nWill you pray for them?\n\nDAWSON, St. Paul's Hostel.\u2014Very favourable reports on the school work of the children were sent us by the teachers at the close of the summer vacations. Two-thirds of the boys being first in Grade VII, while two girls took second and third places in Grade VIII. In the Junior W. A. competitions also the girls were a great credit to their branch, two of them taking first prizes, one for knitting and one for sewing, and another girl received the special prize for the study book. In addition two of the three prizes awarded to the Rev. D. E. for the best work in history at school were won by Hostel children.\n\nAt the close of the school year in June a few of the children returned to their homes for the summer months, and those who remained spent a week each in the Church Camp at Rock Creek, the boys being in charge of the Rev. A. Anderson, and the girls under\nthe care of Miss Swift. During the remainder of their holiday, the boys assisted in the cultivation of the garden and spent much of their leisure time swimming in the many ponds among the 'tailing piles'.\n\nWhile on a tour of the Yukon, we had as our guest, Mrs. Ferrabee, Dominion President of the W. A. The staff and children quickly learned to love her for her charming personality, and for the keen interest she displayed in the work of the Hostel.\n\nOn August 6th, Mrs. Johnson with Margaret and Charlie, left Dawson on their way to Toronto, where they are making their home. The children gave Mrs. Johnson a 'nugget' serviette ring as a token of love for their retiring Matron, and all were present at the dock to wave them farewell and wish them every happiness in their new home.\n\nOn Discovery Day (August 17th) the children were given an opportunity to take part in the procession through the streets. Dressed in old-fashioned attire and complete with their bundles and 'babies', they became the passengers on an old-time overland stage to their own delight and the amusement of the spectators. Later, several of them won prizes in the children's races, and all enjoyed the afternoon entertainment provided by the Pioneers.\n\nThough a few children left us during the summer, our numbers remain unaltered with the coming of new arrivals. All of them are well and back at school, where we hope they will continue to be a credit to themselves and to the Hostel.\n\nHIGH GRADE\n\nFOXES AND MINK\n\nLivestock and Pelts\n\nWATSON'S FUR FARM\n\nCARCROSS, YUKON, CANADA\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of a report from the Principal of the Indian Residential School, Carcross Y.T., in reference to fire drills held at the school during the month of November 1935.

During this inspection trip all points of the Agency were visited with the exception of the Francis Lake district, and conditions were found to be improved over last year.\n\nx x x x\n\n7. I visited the Indian Residential School at Carcross and found everything there in good order; there are forty pupils in residence and they all appeared to be happy and contented. An outbreak of measles during the spring laid low practically all of the pupils but happily all recovered without any ill effects. I found the school clean and sanitary, the food supplied the children is good and all well dressed. The school staff are to be congratulated in regard to their work with these children. I went into the matter of the repairs etc., which you have authorized, with the Principal and these matters will be attended to and further report submitted.\n\nx x x x\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. Binning\n(Signed)\n\nA/Supt. Dept. Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nRe: Annual report for year ending March 31, 1938.\n\nCHOUTLA INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL: The school which is attended by Indian children from all parts of the Territory is situated a few miles from Carcross. The Rev. Mr. Grant is the principal and there are 48 pupils in residence at present. I inspected this school four times during the year and found evidence that the school is being conducted according to the requirements of the Department.\n\nFire drills are held at irregular intervals and the pupils thoroughly instructed as to their actions in the event of fire. The new fire escape stairs are a decided improvement over the old iron ladder fixed to the side of the wall. The buildings were all found in good condition and I would draw your attention to my report of July 2nd, 1937, in regard to requirements at this school. The school is too small for the amount of pupils, and the question of alterations or extension should be given attention as soon as possible and in this regard I would draw your attention to paragraph 4 of my report of July 2nd.\n\nThe repairs to the workshop mentioned in paragraph 1 of that report has now been completed and found very helpful, especially in regard to the cellar which was properly fixed for storage of winter vegetables.\n\nIn regard to the conduct of the school, I found the food supplied at the school to be good and wholesome and the meals varied so that the children do not get the same food too often. An ample supply of fresh vegetables are grown at the school every year. All the children were found to be well and warmly clothed and the pupils receive good training in manual work, the girls being taught cooking, laundry work, knitting and sewing, while the boys are taught farming, care of stock, carpentry and shoe repairing. The training in school is good, a good\naverage of marks being obtained by the pupils in the various subjects. The health of the children during the year has been good, no epidemics. A resident nurse looks after the health of the children, medicine being supplied by the Department and if hospitalization is required the patient is sent to the Whitehorse General Hospital. The principal and staff are to be congratulated on their work in this school, everyone appears to have the welfare of the children at heart and are trying to instill the idea of good citizenship into the minds of the children.\n\n(Sgd.) G. Binning,\nA/Supt.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nThe Chooutla Indian Residential School was first established at Carcross in the spring of 1903. It then consisted of two shacks, one of which was constructed of logs.\n\nFor several years previous a small school was conducted at Fortymile, under Bishop Bompas, who made it a matter of personal concern. Mrs. Bompas also took a deep interest in the work.\n\nFor several years it was carried on as a home for orphaned and neglected children. After Bishop Bompas had visited Caribou Crossing (now called Carcross) and had resided here for some time, in 1901 and 1902, he realized that this place had many advantages as a location for the school and in the spring of 1903 he removed the institution from Fortymile to Carcross. Miss Ellis, who was in charge of the school at the time, accompanied the children up the river, there being eight or ten children in the school.\n\nA small house in Carcross was procured from P. H. Poole and here the school was comfortably established. In 1908 the staff was composed of Bishop Bompas, as teacher, and Miss Ellis, matron. Bishop and Mrs. Bompas lived in a log building, on the opposite side of the water, formerly erected as a roadhouse.\n\nIn order that the school children might be closer to the mission, the bishop in 1904 exchanged the school building for a log house occupied by the detachment, and originally used as a telegraph office. This was the first of the school until recently erected communal buildings located two miles from the school.\n\nmust go on. The writer feels that the following points will convince even the most sceptical that a new school building or buildings should be provided as soon as possible for the Indian children in the Yukon:\n\n1. Every child, whether white or Indian, is entitled to an education.\n\n2. It would be a terrible thing in this day and age if anyone could point to a certain group of people living in Canada and say there is a group of people who have been deprived of an education. There is absolutely no foundation for the common belief that the Indians of Canada are a vanishing race. While their numbers have varied considerably during the last thirty years, declining from 110,000 in 1967 to 104,000 in 1924, latest returns issued by the Department of Mines and Resources show that there are now approximately 114,000 Indians resident in the Dominion.\n\n3. Hunting and trapping, the natural life of the Indian, will soon be a thing of the past. The Indians will then have to turn to some other means of livelihood. The education that is now being given them is partly for the purpose of enabling them to meet changing conditions. We must prepare the Indian in some way for the time when he can no longer depend upon hunting and trapping as a means of livelihood.\n\n4. In our school at the present time there are several orphans. What would become of them if there was no residential school?\n\n5. A few days ago the medical officer of our school requested the writer...\nCarcross Indian Residential School,\nCARCROSS, Yukon.\n\nFebruary 5th 1940.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nDAWSON, Yukon.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nSome time before the fire which destroyed the school and workshop on April 17th 1939 there was quite an epidemic of stealing in the school. The articles stolen by the pupils consisted of tools, food and the personal belongings of the staff. When these cases of theft were first reported to me the culprits were strapped on the hands and all the scholars were told that if stealing did not cease more severe measures would be taken. The scholars were told that if there were any more cases of theft the guilty one, whether a boy or girl, would be laid across the classroom desk in the presence of the whole school, clad only in their night attire, and strapped on a different part of their anatomy than their hands. Stealing still went on. Those, about whose guilt we had no doubt were dealt with in this manner. So severe was this strapping that the child had to be held down by the Head Matron and Farm Instructor. I naturally thought at the time that this form of punishment would bring about the result desired. It didn't. Stealing still went on. Realizing that corporal punishment had little or no effect the staff member suggested a course of action that had been followed in another school. In this case, though, it was used to prevent girls from running away from school and it consisted in cutting off all the hair off the head of the offender. It was suggested to me that possibly this form of punishment would bring results. Accordingly all children were warned what would happen if anything else was stolen. It was only a matter of a few days before this form of punishment had to be used. It checked stealing at once.\n\nWe did not have much to contend with stealing until after the fire. I might mention that at the time of the fire a considerable number of articles that were taken out of the burning buildings were carried off by the onlookers. The Head Matron saw one Indian woman, the mother of one of the school girls, going home after the fire with a staff bath towel. Articles that the men on the staff were sure had been taken out of the burning buildings could not be found and the only conclusion that could be arrived at was that they were stolen by the Indians.\nOne article of value that was stolen whilst the fire was in progress was a diamond ring the property of the Head Matron. She stated that its value was approximately $100.00. A week or so after the fire it was found in the possession of one of the Indian school girls.\n\nSince then there has been one case of theft after another and the staff and Principal have been at their wits end to know the best way to deal with the problem. We tried to avoid hair-cutting as we were aware that this form of punishment was resented by the parents of the children. I would like to bring the following cases to your attention:\n\n1. Last summer two of the school boys were out herding cattle. Corporal Pearson of the R.C.M.P. received a complaint about the theft of two tins of tobacco out of a house occupied by a carpenter working for the Northern Airways Limited. It was found out that these two boys were the thieves. The officer of the R.C.M.P. talked to the boys about their conduct and advised them strongly to behave themselves in future. The action I took was to make these two Indian boys pay for, out of a small salary they were earning, two tins of tobacco and give same to the person they had robbed.\n\n2. A school girl stealing boy's clothing out of the boy's residence. She was strapped on the hands for this offence.\n\n3. Mr. Matthew Watson, General Merchant of Carcross informed me that school boys were bringing in notes bearing the forged signatures of some Indian residing in Carcross or vicinity. These notes called for groceries, candies, etc. On investigating the matter it was found that 4 school boys had been engaged in this practice. They were given corporal punishment.\n\n4. A short time after this incident Mrs. Takamatsu (Indian) came to my office and reported that some boys had taken a One Dollar bill out of a drawer in her house. I paid her the amount that was stolen and punished the two school boys concerned by depriving them the privilege of having a permit for two months. When they would otherwise be playing they were given work to do.\n\n5. A white resident of Carcross, whose house is quite near the Boy's Residence, reported to me that during his absence one night some person had entered his house and stolen cigarettes and a bottle of vanilla extract. Even though he did not say that he suspected school boys I had an investigation. The only result obtained was that one Indian boy accused another of this theft.\n6. On the first night our present Farm Instructor was at the school he informed me that a package of cigarettes was stolen out of his room. The boy who took these was found out and the cigarettes recovered.\n\n7. Before the present Farm Instructor arrived his predecessor reported that a bottle of beer was stolen out of his room. The boy who took same was let off with a warning. It was his first offence.\n\n8. About three months after the theft of a bottle of beer, Mr. Matthew Watson, General Merchant of Carcross let me know that one of the school boys (the same who took the bottle of beer) brought a mink skin in to be sold. After questioning the boy as to where he got the skin Mr. Watson told him to call in the next day. In the meantime another Indian came to the store and stated that someone had stolen a mink skin out of the house in which he was living. On hearing these facts I questioned the boy and he admitted the theft. He realized that this time he could not be let off with only a warning.\n\n9. Another boy about this time broke into our Store House and stole a can of pears. His guilt was established, the pears recovered, and as a punishment he was given a very close haircut. After this theft all the children in school were told that the next child or children, be they boy or girl, who was caught stealing they would be given a very close hair-cut.\n\n10. Quite recently the Head Matron advised me that the Kitchen Matron was having difficulty in making the bread she baked last as long as she thought it should last. Our reserve supply of bread is stored in a locked building just behind the building used as a Kitchen and Dining Room. The Kitchen Matron was advised to count the loaves of bread one evening and check same in the morning. Seven loaves of bread were missing. We have not been able to find out who was the thief.\n\n11. On February 1st 1940 the Head Matron phoned me up to say that two school girls (Lilly Johnson and Rowena Baum) had been caught red-handed by the Kitchen Matron stealing bread. The amount they were in the act of stealing was approximately one loaf. Both these girls had the hair on their head cut off.\n\n12. Today, February 5th 1940, the Kitchen Matron advised me that some of her clothing had been stolen and there seems to be no question but that the theft was committed by one or more of the school girls.\nFrom the aforementioned cases you will see that not only have various articles been stolen but that different methods of punishment have been used. Insisting that the supervision of the children be of a more exacting nature did not bring the results desired. Reprimanding a child accomplished nothing. Corporal punishment was also useless. The only thing that has brought results was cutting of their hair.\n\nAs quite a bit of resentment has arisen amongst the Indians regarding this form of punishment it would be appreciated if you would advise whether such a procedure meets with your approval. I would be glad to receive any suggestions that you might care to make on how to handle this most difficult situation. Some of the Indians claim that if the children were given enough to eat they would not steal. I make a point of going into their Dining Room nearly every day and have noted that they are given an ample supply of good and wholesome food. The absurdity of this claim of the Indians is shown by the fact that food is by no means the only articles stolen.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.C.M.

Grant, Principal.\nYUKON TERRITORIAL COURT\n\nDAWSON, Jan. 12th, 1942.\n\nDear Clarence:\n\nReferring to your letter of October 17th perhaps the following information will be of use to you. No doubt it is all available from your own files but you may not have it in summarized form.\n\nI have not had an opportunity of inspecting the residential school at Carcross, nor do I know much of the results which are being achieved by it. My general observation of the work of such institutions in the north, however, is that they do little to equip the Indian for the type of life which he must of necessity live in this country. Rather they make the Indians dissatisfied with the way of life to which he must almost inevitably return. However I realize that this is a controversial question and the schools appear to be conducted in accordance with departmental policy.\n\nThe Hostel which is maintained by the Anglican Church at Dawson is for half-breed children. I do not think there are any full blood Indian inmates. The children in residence attend the local schools. I note that it has been suggested that the school at Carcross might be closed and a consolidation effected with the Hostel at Dawson, making use of the old residence of the Commissioner, for accommodation.\n\nBishop Geddes has not been in the Territory since my arrival so I have had no opportunity of discussing this suggestion with him. However it appears to me that the idea is open to many objections, perhaps the chief being that the cost of maintenance of an institution at Dawson would be much higher than at Carcross because of higher freight rates on supplies, the increase in cost of fuel etc. There is not sufficient adjoining ground available to grow potatoes or other root crops to assist in maintenance or to train the native children in agricultural pursuits. Moreover the building itself is most unsuitable and the remodelling, which would be necessary before it could be so used, would be very expensive.\n\nIt may be that a lengthier experience will result in qualification of some of the views herein expressed, but in the meantime you have my present reactions to your letter. You will appreciate that I have written quite frankly in this connection and also as regards the more personal matters which are the subject of separate correspondence.\n\nJ. E. Gibben,\nMay 28, 1942.\n\nDr. Harold McGill,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI write to confirm our conversation of last Tuesday regarding the Indian Residential School at Carcross.\n\nYou will recall that the building there was destroyed by fire some two years ago and that since then the school has been housed in temporary buildings which leave much to be desired. With the arrival in Carcross of the American troops these buildings and their location are proving far from satisfactory.\n\nI am given to understand that the buildings in Dawson, formerly occupied by the R.C.M.P., have been standing idle for the past four years. These buildings would from all reports prove very satisfactory temporary housing for the school until such time as the building in Carcross itself can be replaced.\n\nI wish to ask, therefore, that the Department would consider obtaining these buildings for the use of the school and arrange for the children to be moved to Dawson for the time being. The Principal of the school has estimated that the cost of removal would be in the neighborhood of $2,000.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLAD K.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 2)\nOttawa,\nJune 4, 1942.\n\nEX'D\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere is an Indian residential school at Carcross, Y.T., which is operated for us by the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada. The main building was destroyed by fire three years ago and we have been using several rented buildings in the meantime.\n\nRecently a large number of American troops have arrived in Carcross and the Church of England authorities consider it advisable for us to move the school. They advise us that buildings in Dawson City, Y.T., formerly occupied by the R.C.M.P., have been standing idle for the past four years.\n\nI should appreciate your advising if these buildings could be secured by this Department and, if so, I should like to know the number of buildings, the size of each and any other information that you may have regarding them. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nR.C.M.P.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\n1. In reply to your letter of the 4th instant, it is regretted that the R. C. M. Police Buildings at Dawson cannot be made available for the use of your Department, due to important and rapidly changing police conditions in the Yukon.\n\n2.

T. Wood,)\nCommissioner.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of May 28 we wrote to the R.C.M.P. with regard to the vacant buildings owned by them in Dawson. The following reply, which speaks for itself, has now been received:\n\n\"In reply to your letter of the 4th instant, it is regretted that the R.C.M.

McGill,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nSince receiving your letter of June 17th with reference to accommodation for the Carcross Residential School, I have been in further communication with both Carcross and Dawson. It becomes increasingly evident that, if at all possible, the school should not be left in its present location for another winter.\n\nI am informed that in addition to the R.C.M. Police buildings at Dawson, about which I wrote to you on May 28th, and which in your reply you stated would not be available for the school, there is still another vacant building in Dawson known as \"Government House.\" I am therefore, writing to ask that the Department consider obtaining the use of this building for the Indian Residential School. I understand that it would require a certain amount of alteration for this purpose, but that it would be infinitely preferable to the present temporary accommodation at Whitehorse.\n\nThere is a further consideration which I would venture to suggest might be kept in mind when this matter is referred to the R.C.M.P. \"Government House\" might very well meet the requirements of R.C.M.P. for the additional accommodation of the police in Dawson. If therefore, it could be used for that purpose, and the other building, referred to in your letter of June 17th, made available for the school, I am given to understand that the needs of both parties could be satisfactorily met.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLAD:S\n\nJuly 3, 1942.\nOttawa, July 8, 1942.\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nI have your letter of July 3, in further reference to possible accommodation that might be obtained for the Carcross Indian Residential School. I am forwarding a copy of your letter to our agent at Dawson and on receipt of his reply will write you again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nReverend Canon L. A. Dixon, M.A., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, July 8, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of a letter which has just been received from the General Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nOwing to conditions now existing at Carcross, the Church of England feels that the residential school should be moved to Dawson. I communicated with the R. C. M. P., in an endeavour to obtain vacant buildings owned by them, but was informed that these were not available as the R. C. M. Police intended to use them.\n\nYou will now note that Canon Dixon suggests a \"Government House\". Please make immediate enquiries and let me know if this building could be secured and, if so, by whom it is owned and the yearly rent that would have to be paid. Any other information that you can obtain regarding this building should also be forwarded. An immediate reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. J. E. Gibbon,\nIndian Agent,\nDawson, Yukon.\nDawson, Y.T.,\nAugust 5th, 1942.\n\nSir:\n\nYour letter of July 8th not having been sent\nAir Mail has only recently come to hand.\n\nAlthough I see Bishop Geddes frequently he has not\nmentioned to me as Indian Agent the desire of the Church\nfor the transfer of the residential school from Carcross to\nDawson. However, before receipt of your letter I had learned\nthat efforts were being made to secure the former Court house\nfor school purposes. I may say that the contemplated move has\nbeen the subject of discussion in many quarters and I have\nheard much criticism.\n\nI have not seen the Carcross school site but understand\nthat it is situate some two miles from town, that there is\ngood water available and that there is adequate acreage for cul-\ntivation close at hand. The present location is close to the\nrailroad and at the same time is in a district where there is\nample fish and game available. Furthermore I am told that fuel\nis obtainable at far lower cost than in the Dawson area.\nCarcross is situate in the Southern part of the Yukon Territory\nwhere the greater proportion of the Indian population is to be\nfound.\n\nDawson is some three hundred and fifty miles from\nCarcross as the crow flies and much further than that in terms\nof freight haul. Obviously the cost of supplies is much higher\nin this area. I question whether the climate is any more severe\nhere but fuel costs are much higher and are on the increase as\ndealers have to go farther afield for wood.\n\nThere is no acreage available for cultivation (where root\ncrops etc. could be raised) in the near vicinity to either of the\nGovernment owned buildings mentioned.\n\nThese buildings are located right in the City of Dawson\nin close proximity to a resident white population and within\neasy access to the business district and the waterfront. From my\nobservations in the N.W.T. and in Dawson itself I am of opinion\nthat the Indians are much better off when kept away from close contact with the white population. Indeed as Indian agent I am at present concerned over the situation which exists here by reason of the presence in town of many of the natives from the Moosehide settlement.\n\nAs regards the buildings themselves I understand that these are all under the control of the Federal Department of Public Works. The building which Canon Dixon speaks of as Government House is the former official residence of the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory and has not been occupied as such since 1916. Mr. G.A. Jeckell, the Controller of the Yukon Territory, advises me that plans of this building and full particulars with regard thereto are available in the Department of Public Works at Ottawa. Mr. Jeckell, Bishop Geddes, and the writer inspected this building in February last and certainly the conclusion which the Controller and I came to was that the cost of remodelling it for school purposes would be very high.\n\nFormerly all maintenance charges for Government House passed through Mr. Jeckell's hands. He has looked up his records and now advises me that in 1914 and 1915 the last two years in which the house was occupied for the full twelve months the fuel costs were respectively $3,938.34 and $3,332.71. The price of fuel in Dawson has increased from thirty-five to fifty per cent since the period of these figures.\n\nYour letter perhaps did not call for this reply, but the local opposition to the proposed project which I have noted, has prompted me to set these matters before you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.E.

The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory. In view of the opinions expressed in this communication, I am not at all sure that it would be wise to consider the transfer of the Carcross Residential School to Dawson. It would appear that certain buildings, vacant until now, will be necessary for police and other accommodation in the immediate future. Apart altogether from the difficulty that might be experienced in securing any of these buildings, the cost of heating the Government House building appears to our officials here to be almost prohibitive. These heating costs, of course, would have to be paid from the per capita grants. We are not at all sure either that the materials necessary for the reconstruction of the building and certain repairs could be secured at this time.\n\nIt has occurred to me that certain buildings, now occupied by the military forces in or around Carcross, or a certain amount of lumber from these buildings, might after the war be available for the construction of a substantial building for residential school purposes in the Carcross district. I am of the opinion, therefore, that the Principal should be encouraged to remain at Carcross, using the buildings we have rented for classroom and dormitory accommodation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nRev.

Gibben, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDawson, Yukon.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some time past I have been considering the step which I now am taking with reference to the Chooutla Indian Residential School at Carcross, Yukon.\n\nI have felt that the present facilities for sanitation and hygiene were inadequate, but at the same time I have realized the valuable work the school was doing and hence I did not wish to see it discontinued. Certain developments have made it clear to me that some action should be taken. These are:\n\n1: The increased incidence of communicable disease due to the large influx of population.\n\n2: The occurrence of an epidemic of measles at the school and in which every child was affected with but one exception. There has been one fatality due to the epidemic.\n\n3: The lack of skilled nursing personnel and the increasing difficulty of keeping a nurse at the school under the present living conditions.\n\nUnder the present arrangements the school does not remotely satisfy the usually accepted standards of sanitation. The dormitories are overcrowded, the water supply is unprotected, and the lavatories and toilets are wholly inadequate. For example the boys' dormitory has 22 boys sleeping in a room 16 x 22 x 10 feet; this in addition to a large drum heater. The girls dormitory is not so congested but does not give an adequate amount of cubic-footage of air space per person.\n\nThis state of congestion can and will only lead to an increase in the incidence of communicable disease and I believe that it is not in the best interests of the children to live under such conditions.\nI have therefore decided to condemn the buildings of the residential school as unsuitable for their purpose. A copy of my declaration is enclosed. I am certain that this is in the best interests of the children and at the same time it may stir the Church or the Departmental authorities into doing something to improve the conditions in this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"F.

I should like to direct your attention particularly to the declaration dated September 30, 1942, issued by Dr. F. Burns Roth, Medical Health Officer for the district.\n\nThe Carcross Residential School was destroyed by fire on April 17, 1939. It was decided at that time not to proceed with the erection of a new building but that temporary buildings, consisting of one or two unoccupied residences, should be rented as dormitories and classrooms for the pupils. The annual rent of these buildings is $1140.00.\n\nThe Carcross School has at this date an enrolment of 40 pupils for whom we pay per capita grants amounting to $250.00 annually. The last audit report indicates that the cost of operation per pupil per annum amounts to $553.55. This high cost of operation may, in part at least, explain the failure of the school to secure skilled nursing personnel. The pupils in attendance at this school, I should add, are in the main illegitimate and children from broken and disrupted homes. It has been found from experience that it is exceedingly difficult to provide care for these children apart from residential school accommodation, owing to the nomadic habits of the Yukon Indians.\n\nI am today communicating with the Anglican Bishop, the Right Reverend W. A. Geddes, in the hope that more suitable buildings can be secured. I do not\nOttawa, October 15, 1942.\n\nMy dear Bishop Geddes:\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by J. E. Gibben, Esq., Indian Agent, Yukon Territory, from F. Burns Roth, Esq., M.D., Medical Health Officer for the district. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be at all possible to secure more suitable buildings for the accommodation of the 40 pupils that have been enrolled at the buildings now condemned by Dr. Roth. It would be in my judgment exceedingly difficult to proceed with the construction of a new residential school at this time. It is our hope that certain buildings now occupied by soldiers, or the lumber from these buildings, might be used for the construction of a school, immediately following the close of the war. In the meantime, I have been wondering if you have considered the desirability of erecting one or two additional Indian day schools, with sufficient accommodation for the teacher and his family. If such schools were established, would it be possible to secure a fully qualified male teacher, who with his wife might provide for the education and general care of the Indians? If we were successful in securing such a teacher, we would perhaps have to pay him a higher salary than we have been paying for such work until now. I am anxious that you should survey conditions in the Yukon, from the standpoint of Indian education, in the light of Dr. Roth's decision, and let the Department and Dr. Westgate\n\nRight Rev. W. A. Geddes, D.D.,\nBishop of Yukon,\nDawson, Yukon.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 2)\nhave any comments and recommendations you may care to send forward.

Gibben,\nIndian Agent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nNovember 11, 1942.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wired to you from St. John, N.B., with reference to the critical situation which had arisen in the school at Carcross. I have since received a copy of Mr. Hoey's letter of October 21st to Dr. Westgate informing him that it had been decided to reduce the pupilage in the school from 40 to 20.\n\nIn connection with the decision which has thus been made I would draw your attention to the statement in my aforementioned telegram that to reduce the numbers of children in the school would seriously increase the operating costs.\n\nThe per capita rate for the Carcross school is $250.00. With the discharge of 20 pupils this means a corresponding annual loss in income of $5000.00. While there will be some savings on items like food and clothing, the major items of expense, namely staff and overhead, will remain unchanged. Thus, whereas with a pupilage of 40 the per capita grant was sufficient to run the school, with the pupilage reduced to 20, the same per capita rate must result in heavy loss.\n\nI write to ask, therefore, that under these special circumstances the Government will see its way to assume responsibility for this loss - or at least a considerable part of it.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nL. A. Dixon\n\nLAD K.\nOttawa, November 16, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCILL\n\nRe: Operation of Carcross Residential School\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by this Branch from the Reverend Canon L. A. Dixon, General Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nWhen the Carcross Residential School was destroyed by fire on April 17, 1935, an assurance was given to the Anglican Church authorities that the school would be rebuilt just as soon as the funds necessary for this purpose could be secured, and that in the interval funds would be provided to rent two or three houses that appeared available at that time for the conduct of classes and for dormitory accommodation. These houses have recently been condemned as insanitary by the Medical Health officer of the district, who issued an order that the building be closed. Later, however, the building was re-opened with an enrolment of 20 rather than 40 pupils.\n\nI am not at all sure that we are justified in spending at this particular time, or indeed at any time, the sum of $10,000 on the education of 20 pupils. This per capita grant does not include money paid for a night watchman or for incidental expenses such as repairs, the purchase of textbooks, etc. I am disposed to think, without knowing much about local conditions, that this money might be more profitably spent in the establishment of one or two day schools at certain centres and in the employment of a nurse, qualified to give instruction in dietetics, etc.\n\nMr. Phelan and I have spent the last week in carefully reviewing the requests received for the repair and general upkeep of our residential school buildings. The appropriation available in the 1942-44 estimates is sufficient to meet no more than 50% of the amounts requested. In addition to these requests, however, there are requests for new buildings, particularly from the Anglican Church, and requests from all the churches for the new buildings necessary for the promotion of vocational instruction. Therefore, unless the Government is in a position to provide the funds necessary to meet these requests, I am of the opinion that it would be sheer folly to build additional residential schools anywhere in the Dominion. The policy of the Government in respect to the construction of Indian day and residential schools has never been clearly defined at any time since I entered the Department. In this connection I should like to\nrefer to my memorandum to you on the operation of residential schools, dated May 31, 1940. In view of the fact that representatives of the churches have made arrangements to meet the Minister toward the end of December, with the object of discussing with him the desirability of a substantial increase in the present per capita grant allowances, it has occurred to me that the policy of the Government in respect to the building of residential schools and the operation of these schools might very well be reviewed prior to the Minister's interview with the representatives of the churches.\n\nIn respect to the request submitted by Canon Dixon, my recommendation is that a special grant be made to the Carcross school to enable this school to operate without loss during the present academic year and that this grant be made on the understanding that the school will cease to operate on the 30th of June next. I recommend, also, that the Church be told definitely that it is not our intention to rebuild the residential school in the Yukon Territory at any time during the years immediately ahead of us.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, November 16, 1942.\n\nRe: Special Grant - Carcross Residential School.\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 11, in which you remind me that the reduction in the pupilage at the marginally noted school will result in the loss of revenue to the Church, amounting to approximately $5,000.00 for the present academic year.\n\nYou are aware, no doubt, that our per capita grants are based on the actual enrolment at residential schools. No provision has been made in the existing Treasury regulations for the payment of special grants. However, I appreciate fully the unusual conditions existing at Carcross, and it is my hope that some ways and means may be discovered whereby a special grant can be made to this school.\n\nIt is my understanding that arrangements have been made whereby representatives of the churches will meet with the Minister in December, with the object of securing additional financial assistance for the operation of residential schools. If such is the case, the special assistance necessary at Carcross is a matter that might be discussed with the Minister and the officials here at that time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nReverend Canon L.

I do not know what thought was given to the home conditions of pupils, but assume that the Rev. Mr. Grant would do what he thought best in the circumstances.\n\nIn this connection I also acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo with copy of communication addressed to Bishop Geddes.

I am grateful for the assurance that the emergent situation which exists there will be given sympathetic consideration.\n\nI note that arrangements are being made for representatives of the churches to meet with the Minister in December and shall see that this matter is brought up at that time as you suggest.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLAD K.\nDear Dr. McGill;\n\nI thank you for your letter of October the fifteenth dealing with the subject of Indian Education in the Yukon, with particular reference to the Carcross Residential School and the question of Indian Day Schools in the Yukon.\n\nI note that you hope to obtain from the American Army some of the buildings now being built by them in the southern Yukon, the lumber from which could be used in the erection of a new School after the war. From what I have seen, even if we only secured a small fraction of these buildings we should have ample for our need. I should like to suggest that with the buildings you should also endeavour to secure one of the many portable sawmills that they have as well as one of the smaller Diesel Caterpillar tractors of which there are hundreds in Yukon. There will be some material required for the larger building that will not be found in the smaller ones but with the additional equipment I have suggested we should be able when the time comes to erect the building at very little cost.\n\nIn May last I suggested to Dr. Westgate, that an effort should be made to secure one of the two large buildings situated in Dawson, and owned by the Government, to house our school. Unfortunately that effort did not succeed. I know that there is considerable opposition on the part of the authorities to having the School in the Town of Dawson, and if the School were to be located here permanently I too would oppose, not because of any antipathy to the Indians but because I believe that the School can best fulfill its purpose outside the town. But as an emergency measure solely for the duration of the war it was unjust to refuse us one or other of the two buildings. The only other building in the Territory is also owned by the Government and located at Mayo. It was until this year used as a Hospital. It is smaller and not so suitable as either of the others.\n\nWith the intense activity now going on in southern Yukon I feel strongly that we should move the Carcross School further north for the duration of the war. I should also like to point out that the epidemic, which was the occasion of the drastic action taken by Dr. Roth, affected Champagne, Whitehorse, Teslin and their environs far worse than\nRegarding the question of Indian Day Schools I am convinced that if we could provide sufficient day schools we would best meet the needs of our Indian population. But to place Education within the reach of every Indian Child by this means would entail an expenditure more than ten times what we are spending today. To my mind the only feasible solution is to have one Residential School together with a number of day schools located at those centers where a sufficient number of children can be had to make the teachers efforts worthwhile.\n\nIf the Indian Affairs Branch wishes to have one or more Indian Day Schools opened in the Yukon and will provide the salary for the teachers I shall be quite willing to endeavour to secure suitable teachers and arrange to have the schools established. There are several possible areas for such schools, viz., the Indian Village near Mayo; \"Big Lake\" west of Carmacks; Carmacks; Teslin; somewhere in the Champagne area, west of Whitehorse; Ross River; and possibly Whitehorse.\n\nI think it was most unfortunate that your Branch three years ago withdrew the grants from our seasonal Indian Day Schools. No expenditure that your Branch made in Yukon brought better returns for the small cash outlay involved than the Seasonal Day Schools. At these centers during the summer months it was possible to get together as many as 30 children in some instances. We may not have been able to take them very far on the Educational Highway but they were learning to read and write, a little arithmetic, and perhaps even more important, the elements of Hygiene, Sanitation and Health habits. All this was cast aside for a saving of less than $250.00 per school.\n\nNothing can now be done until next summer about moving the Carcross School. By March next we should be in a better position to judge what the year 1943 will be bringing to us in Yukon and I should then like to submit to you a definite proposal regarding this School for the duration of the war.\n\nIf you should decide to proceed with the opening of one or more new Indian Day Schools in the Yukon I shall be glad to hear from you as soon as possible, for while it will not be possible to do anything about the actual starting of the school till the first of June next, yet it will take some time to secure suitable teachers, and also the material for the construction of the necessary buildings.\n\nYou will already have been made familiar with the measures taken to deal with the situation at Carcross for this winter. I think it was the only possible solution. We could not have sent all the children home for some of the children have no home.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Yukon\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 21, 1942.\n\nDear Bishop Geddes:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of November 11 and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nI am disposed to think that some misunderstanding has arisen in respect to the operation of seasonal schools in the Yukon Territory.

In the estimates of this year I note that provision has been made for the operation of the following schools: Champagne Landing, Old Crow Village, Rampart House, Teslin Lake, and Whitehorse, in addition to the two more or less regular schools at Moosehide and Selkirk. The total amount set apart for the operation of these schools is $2,790.\n\nIn recent years when our estimates have come up for discussion, the desirability of keeping seasonal schools in operation throughout the Dominion has been very fully discussed. There is a feeling amongst a number of our officials that unless qualified teachers can be secured for the operation of these schools, the expenditure made to keep them open and in operation is a sheer waste of money. However, we have never definitely decided to close them.\n\nWe are experiencing at the present time, and have been experiencing for the last 10 or 12 years, the utmost difficulty in securing the funds necessary to keep our residential schools in a state of repair and to provide the money necessary for their operation. In view of existing conditions, this difficulty is likely to confront us for a great many years to come. I doubt very much, therefore, the wisdom of continuing to erect additional residential schools unless we can see our way clear to keep these schools in a reasonable state of repair.\n\nRight Rev. W. A. Geddes, D.D.,\nBishop of Yukon,\nDawson, Yukon.\nnumber of suggestions have been made by our field officials in respect to the operation of Indian day schools. A proposal has been made, for example, that a fully qualified teacher be employed for the operation of two seasonal schools. This would enable the teacher to devote approximately five months to the operation of each. Another suggestion frequently submitted is that a supervising principal be placed in charge of an Indian day school in one of our outlying districts and that he be made responsible for the inspection and general direction of the schools in the adjoining territory. If a teacher could be secured whose wife was also a fully qualified teacher, who could take charge of the school in the absence of her husband, this proposal might prove feasible. I feel it is only fair to you and to the church authorities to state that at the present time the trends here are definitely against the construction of additional residential schools anywhere in the Dominion. You are probably aware, of course, that with the exception of certain replacements of schools destroyed by fire, no new residential schools have been built at any time in recent years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nYou will find attached a memorandum dated November 16 submitted to me by Mr. Hoey and dealing with the operation of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nThe facts set forth and the observations made by Mr. Hoey have a much wider application than to the question of the Carcross school itself. Mr. Hoey refers to his memorandum dealing with the general question of residential schools dated May 31, 1940. I have carefully re-read this memorandum and have discussed the matter with Mr. Hoey and Mr. Phelan.\n\nI am in full agreement with the views held by the officials in charge of Indian education that the time has come when a definite decision should be reached regarding our policy in respect to residential schools. I hold, and have long held the opinion that the educational requirements of the great majority of Indians could be met by day schools to the decided benefit of the Indians and to the financial advantage of the taxpayer.\n\nAs it has been pointed out very plainly by Mr. Hoey many times, both verbally and in writing, our vote for several years past has not been sufficient to keep these buildings in a proper state of repair. A steady deterioration is taking place in our physical equipment and the question must be decided whether we are to go forward in developing a residential school system or to direct our efforts in another direction.\n\nLately I have been disagreeably impressed by a number of police reports concerning truancy from these schools.\n\nIn Mr. Hoey's memorandum of May 31, 1940, mentioned above, you will note his recommendation that a number of dilapidated residential schools that are costly to repair and operate be closed and Indian day schools be substituted therefor. On page 3, paragraph 2, of the same report you will note the figures he gives showing that the amount saved in one year in per capita grants through the closing of certain residential schools would almost meet the cost of building Indian day schools to take care of the pupils affected.\n\n(over)\nI am in full agreement with Mr. Hoey's recommendation that a number of these residential schools be closed and day schools substituted therefor. I would suggest that as soon as war regulations regarding building materials permit, the building of day schools and the closing of certain residential schools be proceeded with, in accordance with the plans and recommendations made by Mr. Hoey and outlined above.\n\nSeveral days ago, a letter was received from Bishop Geddes of the Yukon, dealing with the Carcross school and carrying the suggestion that a system of day schools might be introduced into the Yukon.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nYou will find attached a memorandum dated November 16 submitted to me by Mr. Hoey and dealing with the operation of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nThe facts set forth and the observations made by Mr. Hoey have a much wider application than to the question of the Carcross school itself.

McGill,\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Dr. McGill,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of November 21st. I note your remarks regarding the difficulty in securing funds to erect buildings for Indian Residential Schools. I am glad to note however that an exception is made in the case of the replacings of buildings destroyed by fire. I am not sufficiently conversant with the problem of Indian education in other parts of Canada, but as far as the Yukon is concerned I am quite convinced that one Indian Residential School can fully meet our need for that type of institution and that other than our Carcross Indian Residential School, no other such institution is needed in this territory.\n\nI am a little concerned about the first paragraph in your letter regarding grants for the Seasonal Day Schools operated by our Church at Teslin, Champagne and Whitehorse. These three Schools have been operated by our Church during the past three summers but we have been unable to receive the grants from your Department that formerly were paid. In fact in 1940 when the return for the Teslin Day School was forwarded to Ottawa it was returned with the notification that no grant would be paid. I gather from your letter that the funds for these Schools are in the estimates that have been approved by Parliament and I shall be grateful if you can advise me as to how we can secure the grants for these Schools that we have been operating.\n\nWith Seasons Greetings, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBishop of Yukon\n\"G\" DIVISION.\n\nYuken Sub-Division,\nCarcross Detachment.\nJanuary 4th, 1948\n\nThe Officer Commanding,\nYuken Sub-Division,\nR.

Police,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\n1. Sir: FORWARDED 2-2-43. On the night of 23-12-43 two coloured United States soldiers named Cpl. A. JONES and Pte. J. L. JAMES, feloniously entered the Indian residential school at Carcross, Y.T., with the assistance and connivance of the following three Indian female children who are residents of the school:\n\nMabel Sidney aged 12 years\nGrace Smarch aged 10 years\nEmma Sidney aged 8 years.\n\nPte. James went to bed with Mabel Sidney and Cpl. Jones went to bed with Grace Smarch. In the early morning of 23-12-43 they were detected by the principal of the school who informed the R.C.M.P. Police who arrested the two men and turned them over to the United States Military Authorities. It has come to light that these two men have done the same thing in the school on previous occasions.\n\n2. It is stated by the girls and their statements supported by competent medical testimony of Captain Faison, United States Army, that the girls were not seduced, no penetration in the slightest degree having taken place. Nevertheless, the offences committed by these two men amount to indecent assaults upon females.\n\n3. The two soldiers are to be tried by a United States Army Court Martial. They have both been transferred from Carcross to Haines, Alaska, with their Company. We are to be advised of the result of the Court Martial.\n\nSTILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.\n\nD.D 31-3-43.\n\nD.J.

This Company was located about seven miles east of Carcross, on the highway.\n\n4. It was later ascertained that these two soldiers had been in bed with two of the girls at the school, namely Mable and Grace Smarch. In the afternoon of the 23rd, the writer, Lieut. W. Mosier, who had been detailed by Captain Nelson, Medical Officer for this Company, visited the school for the purpose of investigating the two girls in question. We were accompanied by Captain Nelson, Lieut. Mosier, and myself. The following statements, in connection with this affair, were obtained:\n\nStatement of Mable Sidney:\n\nMy name is Mable Sidney. I am 12 years old, and have attended the Chocotla Indian Residential School at Carcross for two years. I have known and talked to five soldiers since the U.S. Army came to Carcross. Two of these soldiers were coloured. These two soldiers have been over to see me several times. The last time they came to see me was last night. They came about supper time to the girls dormitory. Grace Smarch let them in, and they hid in the attic under the girls dormitory. They stayed in the attic until about 9:00 o'clock, when Mrs. Davis, the Matron, locked the door to the girls dormitory. After the door was locked Grace Smarch went and got them out of the attic. They went to bed with Grace and myself, but we told them to stay on top of the bed. They would not do so. I removed my day clothes and went to bed with one soldier. The soldier did not remove his clothes and talked for awhile. He wanted to make love to me, but I did not want him to. He insisted, I got out of bed but he held me back, so I got in bed with him, but he did not want him to do anything, but I finally did let him make love to me. Then I put on my night clothes and went to sleep. He came in, and when he had left again the soldier came in. The other soldier who had been in bed with Grace Smarch then pushed Grace's bed under the trapdoor in the attic himself. Grace pushed the bed back into place. The police then came in and found the soldiers. They took them away. These soldiers had been seen with other girls. These girls are not here now. Several times he grasped my legs. He did not remove his clothes, his pants and loosened his belt, moving up and down. He did not\n\nStatement of Grace Smarch:\n\nMy name is Grace Smarch. I am going to the Chocotla Indian Residential School last fall. I knew two American soldiers. They have been in bed with me several times, with two of the girls at the school. The last time they were here was about supper time. Emma Sidney and all the other girls had gone to bed in the girls dormitory before we went to the attic under the girls dormitory. Emma Sidney and I were washing the dishes in the attic when we went back to the dormitory. Mrs. Davis, the matron, had locked the door about 9:00 o'clock. Mable told the police about Mable and I. (CONTINUED ON)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 2)\nWith reference to the above I beg to report that at approximately 3:30 a.m. of this date, shortly after the writer had returned from a patrol of the town, Miss Katherine Oke, a member of the staff of the Choctula Indian Residential School, Carcross, Y.T., called at this Detachment and advised that she had been sent by Mr. Grant, Principal of the school, and that he (Mr. Grant) wanted the Police at the school immediately, as he had found a Negro soldier in the girls dormitory at the school. The writer immediately proceeded to this school, accompanied by Cst. MacDonald.\n\nOn arrival at the school we found the Rev. H.C.M. Grant, the above mentioned Principal of the school, on guard outside the girls dormitory, the door of which he had locked. Mr. Grant advised that some short time previously he had made a check of the girls dormitory, during his rounds as night watchman in the absence on account of sickness of the regular night watchman, and upon checking this dormitory he had noticed that some of the girls, there being nine girls altogether in this dormitory, had gone to bed with their day clothes on, which is strictly against the rules of the school. Upon discovering this he had made a check of all the beds, and upon opening a corner bed, the occupant of which was covered up with bed clothes, he had discovered a Negro soldier in bed with one of the main girl students of the school. He had asked the soldier what he was doing there, and then thinking the soldier might be armed, he had left the dormitory, closed the door after him, and had then sent Miss. Oke for the police. He was quite sure that this soldier had not escaped, as there was only one way he could get out, unless he broke through the door, which was locked from the outside.\n\nAfter Mr. Grant had imparted this information, the writer proceeded into the dormitory, leaving Cst. Donald to watch the outside of the building. The dormitory was thoroughly searched, it consists of only two rooms, a porch at one end. No trace of this soldier could be found. None of the windows had been tampered with, so it was certain that he had not made his escape in that manner. The rest of the building was then searched but without result. Mr. Grant suddenly thought of the attic, which is situated above the dormitory. This trapdoor was pushed back, and the writer heard in the attic. The writer climbed on the roof of the dormitory and looked through the trapdoor, seeing two soldiers of the U.S. Army coloured troops lying on the floor, and another one hiding behind a box in the same attic. These soldiers were arrested, and taken to the Detachment. On the same date they were handed over to the authorities.\nStatement of Grace SMARCH (Continued)\n\nbut they didn't. We were afraid to undress for bed. The soldier I was with removed my clothing, and lay on top of me in the bed. He moved around and up and down on top of me. I told Mable to pull him off, which she did. I went and slept with one of the other girls. While this soldier was in bed with me and was lying on top of me, he had the front of his pants unbuttoned. The lower part of his body was touching mine, and was in between my legs. He did not put anything into me. The soldier I was with went back into the attic. The other soldier was in bed with Mable. Later Mr. Grant and the Police came in and took these soldiers away.\n\nENDS.\n\nStatement of Emma SIDNEY.\n\nBEGIN:\n\nMy name is Emma Sidney. I am 8 years old. There were two colored soldiers in the girls dormitory at the Choctaw Indian Residential School last night. Grace Smarch and I let them into the dormitory while the other girls were at supper. They hid in the attic over the girls dormitory until Mrs. Davis, the matron, locked the door to the dormitory at about 9:00 o'clock, then Mable told them to come down. They went to Mable's bed and talked to her. They then went to bed with Grace and Mable. I went to sleep and did not wake up until the Police and Mr. Grant came in and took the soldiers away.\n\nENDS.\n\n5. The other girls sleeping in this dormitory were also questioned, but they claimed ignorance of everything except the fact that the two coloured soldiers had been hiding in the attic, and had come down to the dormitory later, after Mrs. Davis had locked the dormitory door. Mrs. Davis, being very deaf, had not heard anything at any time during the night, even when the Police came in and made considerable noise searching the building. Mrs. Davis sleeps in a room adjoining the dormitory.\n\n6. Captain ELSON, the Medical Officer, examined the two girls. After completing his examination he advised that these two girls had not been harmed physically in any way. No penetration having been subjected to the slightest degree. This matter has been made subject of a General Court Martial. The charge being that the two soldiers belonged, since their arrival from transfer from the Chilcotin Barracks at Haines, Alaska, before this Company was there, an identification lineup was held, to see if the two girls could pick out the soldiers in question. This was at the request of the Company Commander. There were five other coloured soldiers in this lineup. Grace Smarch picked out Jones, without any hesitation, as the one who had been in bed with her; and Mable Sidney picked out JAMES, also without any hesitation, as the soldier who had been in bed with her. This corroborated Mr. Grant's statement that JAMES was the soldier he had seen in bed with Mable Sidney.\n\nThe Indian village at Carcross, which includes the above mentioned school, has been out of bounds for all U.S. Army personnel ever since the Army arrived at this point. These restrictions were issued by various Company Commanders, but in spite of this it would appear that these two soldiers, although knowing that it was out of bounds, had been visiting the girls dormitory at the school periodically over a period of time, and with the assistance of the girls at the school, had been able to do this without being caught. Their own admission the usual procedure was to wait until the police went to dinner at the hotel, and then sneak across the bridge to the Indian village, and hide in the bush at the rear of the girls dormitory at the school, until the girls and the staff went to dinner, and then one of the girls would let them into the dormitory, where they would hide in the attic until the door to the dormitory was locked by Mrs. Davis, the girls matron. They usually\n\n(continued on page four)\nRe: T/Cpl. Andrew JONES, No. 34072850, & Pte. James L. JAMES,\nNo. 34106903, U.S. Army - Indecent Assault (292) CCC.\nCarcross, Y.T.\n\nTHEY USUALLY stayed in the building until about 6:30 a.m., when the dormitory was unlocked again by Mrs. Davis, and the girls and the staff had gone to breakfast. They would then leave the dormitory, walk through the bush and across the bridge, first making sure that there was no one around who might see them.\n\n8. Lieut. Mesier stated that he would advise this Detachment as to the outcome of this Court Martial.

Jeckell, Esq.,\nController, Yukon Territory,\nDevonshire Hotel, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWhen you were here recently we discussed St. Paul's Hostel at Dawson very fully and I undertook to advise you on certain points after discussion with the Acting Deputy Minister. It was decided -\n\n(1) That the responsibility for the care of indigent white and half-breed children in the Yukon Territory is not with the Indian Affairs Branch but rests with the Yukon Council.\n\n(2) That the rate of $250 per annum charged for each white or half-breed child accommodated at St. Paul's Hostel is not exorbitant.\n\n(3) That parents who can pay for the care of their children should do so.\n\n(4) That Council responsibility for the care of any child in St. Paul's Hostel should begin only when the Controller has approved of the admission of the child.\n\n(5) That there is no reason from a departmental standpoint why Dawson children whose parents can house and feed them should be cared for in St. Paul's Hostel, especially when they are attending Public School.\n\nI am informed that the Indian Affairs Branch is discussing with Bishop Geddes a suggestion that arrangements be made for accommodating in St. Paul's Hostel a number of the Indian children who could not be accommodated in Carcross school. No doubt advice of the decision reached will be sent directly to the Indian Agent at Dawson and will probably reach him before you return there.\n\n(over)\nI am to request that you bring to the attention of the Yukon Council the responsibility of that body for the care of indigent white and half-breed children in the Yukon Territory and the facilities offered by St. Paul's Hostel.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, February 19, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nBishop Geddes, who visited Ottawa on the 16th, 17th and 18th of this month, discussed very fully with the officials of the Welfare and Training Service and with myself the existing educational facilities for Indian children in the Yukon and additions or extensions that might be made to these facilities in the immediate future.\n\nIn view of the fact that this Branch is no longer assuming responsibility for the payment of an annual grant to the St. Paul's Hostel, the proposal first made by the Director of Lands, Parks and Forests, that a number of 'teen age Indian girls might be given a certain amount of training in the hostel in house-keeping and elementary domestic science, was fully discussed with the Bishop. We can see no objection to this course of training for Indian girls. The age of such girls, however, should not exceed 16 and they should be admitted to the hostel only after medical examination and with the usual departmental approval. We do not think that the number of these girls at any stated period of time should exceed 10.\n\nWe also discussed with the Bishop the utilization of the court-house building in Dawson for Indian residential school purposes. If the Anglican Church authorities are of the opinion that this building would be suitable for the accommodation of 30 or 40 Indian pupils and if it is the intention to discontinue the operation of the Carcross School, there would be no objection on our part to the payment of the usual per capita grant. It should be kept in mind, however, that in the estimates of this year and next year we have only made provision for the payment of per capita grants for 40 pupils at Carcross. This means that the Indian pupils enrolled at the St. Paul's Hostel, the Carcross School or the court-house building should not\n\nMr. J. E. Gibben,\nIndian Agent,\nDawson, Yukon.\n\np.t.o.\nexceed 40. I should add also that no special provision has been made in our estimates for extensive repairs to the court-house. I am of the opinion, however, that the church authorities have in mind the removal of the equipment and furnishings now at Carcross to the building at Dawson, should this building be made available to them for use as a school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could find it convenient to discuss the subject matter of this letter with the Bishop, immediately following his return to the Yukon.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, February 28, 1943.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nYou have been good enough to send me a copy of a letter dated the 19th instant which you have addressed to Mr. J.E. Gibben, Indian Agent at Dawson.\n\nI am enclosing you a copy of a letter which I have written today to Controller Jeckell who is about to return to the Territory. I am also enclosing a copy of a letter which Mr. Jeckell wrote to me on the 19th instant about the Courthouse Building. This was in reply to one which I wrote to him at the request of Mr. C.D. Sutherland, Chief Architect, Department of Public Works.\n\nAs the building is required by the mission authorities for the accommodation of Indian children, it seems that the letter conveying the information to Mr. Sutherland should go from your branch.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, February 22, 1943.\n\nG.A.

Gibben, Indian Agent at Dawson, for I believe that\nyou would like to have this information when you are discussing\nthe affairs of St. Paul's Hostel with the members of the Yukon\nCouncil on your way back to Dawson.\n\nI have just this minute received your letter of the\n19th instant about the Courthouse Building and will pass along\na copy of it to the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch.\nHowever, it is evident from the penultimate paragraph of Dr.\nMcGill's letter, a copy of which is enclosed, that the Indian\nAffairs Branch is willing to pay the per capita grant to a\nlimit of 40 pupils altogether, whether these are housed in St.\nPaul's Hostel, the Carcross School, or the Courthouse Building.\n\nDirector.\nThe Devonshire Hotel,\nVancouver, B.C.\nFebruary 19, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the eighteenth inst. in which you advise that Bishop Geddes has asked permission to use the R.C.M. Police barracks (formerly the Courthouse Building) at Dawson for Indian Mission School purposes.\n\nI note also that you have communicated with Mr. C.D. Sutherland, Chief Architect, Dept. Public Works, respecting the matter and that he suggests we ask for an expression of opinion on the subject.\n\nAs the R.C.M. Police are not using the building and as you state Commissioner Wood has stated to you he has no objection to the proposed arrangement, and as this particular building does not appear to be required at present for any branch of the government service located at Dawson, I would say as representative of the Department of Public Works that I can see no objection to the Indian Affairs Branch making use of it for any purpose that it may consider desirable.\n\nHowever, it would appear to me advisable for the Indian Affairs Branch to obtain an expression of opinion from Mr. J.E. Gibben, their agent at Dawson. I believe he has furnished a report to the Department respecting the unsuitability of Dawson as a location for an Indian residential school because of the high cost of maintaining such an institution at Dawson where the cost of fuel, food stuffs, etc., are much higher than in Carcross area and also because of the undesirability of placing Indian children attending a residential school in the midst of a settled white community of the size of Dawson.\n\nYours truly,\n\"G.A.

Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 24, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nBishop Geddes, who visited Ottawa a few days ago, intimated to me that it was his intention to drop off at Winnipeg, with the object of discussing with you the operation of the Carcross Residential School.\n\nBishop Geddes was of the opinion that it might prove advantageous to transfer the pupils now enrolled at the Carcross School to the court-house building at Dawson, provided that the court-house building could be secured for residential school purposes. In view of the fact that the Carcross School is operated by your Commission, our discussion with Bishop Geddes was of an exploratory character and no definite decisions were reached.\n\nIf it is the intention of your Commission to use the court-house building, an application for the building should be sent forward through this Branch to the Department of Public Works, at an early date. If you and Bishop Geddes reached any definite conclusions, you might let me know what your policy is likely to be in due course and if it is your intention to utilize the court-house building you should send in a separate application for the building and one that could be sent forward to the Public Works Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:-\n\nWhen Bishop Geddes called here on the 20th inst. on his way back to the Yukon, he informed me that during his recent visit to Ottawa, he had conferred with Commissioner Wood of the R.C.M.P., regarding the possibility of having the Mounted Police building at Dawson made available for Indian Residential School purposes until a new school building had been provided to replace the one destroyed by fire at Carcross, and that the Commissioner informed him he knew of no reason why this step should not be taken. The Bishop agreed, however, to confer with Mr. Jeckell of the Yukon Branch of Government, to ascertain if he knew of any reason why the Mounted Police building should not be made available for the purpose mentioned, and after contacting Mr. Jeckell in Vancouver, he (the Bishop) wrote to me, in part, as follows:-\n\n\"Trans-Canada Air Lines\"\n\n\"I saw Mr. Jeckell in Vancouver yesterday and he told me that he had informed Ottawa that as far as he knew the Government were not likely to need the Old Mounted Police Building in Dawson and that if the Department of Indian Affairs wished to have it they could. I think it would be well if you wrote to Dr. McGill and requested him to ascertain from Mr. R.A. Gibson of the Lands, Parks, and Forests Branch, if this building is available for the school. It was originally built for the Court House and later used as a barracks by the R.C.M.P. I shall discuss the question of the move fully with Mr. Grant and when I get to Dawson I will send you full details of the building as to size, interior arrangements, etc.\"\nThe Mr. Grant mentioned is the Rev. H.C.M. Grant, Principal of our Carcross School.\n\nIn response to the suggestion made by the Bishop, I am now writing to ask if you will kindly consult Mr. Gibson of the Lands, Parks, and Forests Branch of Government and complete arrangements for the taking over of the Mounted Police building in Dawson for the specific purpose of housing the activities of our Carcross School until such time as a new School building can be erected. The date of the transfer of the limited activities of the School now being maintained at Carcross can be fixed by agreement, and other details worked out after we receive the information promised by the Bishop in the closing part of the above quotation from his letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW*WS\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa, March 2, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Murphy:\n\nThe Carcross Indian Residential School, operated by the Government in cooperation with the Church of England, was totally destroyed by fire on April 17, 1938. This school had at that date an enrollment of 40 pupils, for whom per capita grant of $250.00 was paid annually by the Indian Affairs Branch of this Department.\n\nIt would appear that immediately following the destruction of the school building an attempt was made to rent two or three dwellings that were then available, for classroom purposes. This arrangement, however, has proved to be in no sense satisfactory and the buildings have now been condemned by the medical health officer for the district. We are in receipt of a letter from the Reverend Dr. Westgate, Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission of the Anglican Church, in which he expresses a desire to secure for residential school purposes the Mounted Police building at Dawson. It is our understanding that this building is at present vacant. Dr. Westgate in his letter states that the Right Reverend W. A. Gleddes, Bishop of the Yukon, who recently visited Ottawa, discussed with Commissioner Wood the desirability of utilizing this building and that the Commissioner informed him he knew of no reason why this step should not be taken.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could let us know in due course if your Department would be prepared to place this building at the disposal of this Department and the Anglican Church authorities for the education of Indian children in the Yukon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.

There is definitely a feeling of opposition on the part of the white residents of Dawson. I do not know whether this matter was discussed with Controller Jeckell when he was in Ottawa, but I recall that when our Minister was in Dawson last August both he and Dr. Camsell expressed their disapproval of any project which would bring the Indians in closer contact with the residential white population of centers such as Dawson.\n\nI note your remarks with regard to the placing of a limited number of Indian girls in St. Paul's Hostel. I shall also keep in mind in any discussion with Bishop Geddes the fact that the provisions made for per capita grants is limited to forty resident pupils all told.\n\nJ.E.

He recalls the conversation he and the Minister had with Mr. Gibben when they were at Dawson last fall and does not disagree with the inference Mr. Gibben took of the conversation they had at that time, namely that it would be better to keep the Indians further removed from the residential white population in centres such as Dawson.\n\nHowever, in this particular instance Doctor Camsell feels that the proposal of the church to use the court house building at Dawson is only a temporary expediency and must not be considered permanent. We have not sufficient funds to rebuild the school at Carcross. The buildings now being used by the church there are not in any way suitable. Consequently, the only alternative is to temporarily move the children to the proposed building at Dawson.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, March 27, 1943.\nOttawa, March 30, 1943.\n\nMr. J.

The former Courthouse Building in Dawson, although it appears to me to require extensive remodelling, will afford ample accommodation for forty Indian pupils. Under the circumstances the Bishop states that he can see no point in housing any of the teen age Indian girls in the Hostel.\n\nIf the Indian Residential School is to be moved to Dawson, I am of the opinion that segregation of the pupils should be maintained as far as possible.\n\nJ.E.

E.

The Council respectfully submits that future Councils should not feel bound to accept this year's grant as a precedent, and should have placed before them full information if future grants are to be considered regarding the need for assistance from Territorial funds for any sectarian institution.\"\n\nWill you please let me know whether any of the Indian children who are being transferred from Carcross to the Courthouse Building at Dawson will be cared for in St. Paul's Hostel, or will any other Indian children be placed in that hostel.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, May 10, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. R. A. Gibson, Director,\nLands, Parks & Forests Branch.\n\nRe: Enrolment of pupils, St. Paul's Hostel,\nYukon Territory.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your memorandum of May 7, in which you seek information with respect to the enrolment of Indian pupils at the St. Paul's Hostel.\n\nI may state that the Carcross Residential School was condemned as insanitary and unfit for occupation by Dr. Frederick Burns, medical health officer, in October, 1942. As the result of certain negotiations, however, the medical officer agreed to the operation of the school on the understanding that the pupilage would be reduced from 40 to 20, and the enrolment at this school has remained at the lower figure to this date.\n\nWhen Bishop Geddes visited the Department a few weeks ago, he discussed with the officials ways and means whereby the enrolment at Carcross might be increased to the original figure. At that time it was suggested to him that no serious objection would be raised if approximately 19 of the senior girls, who had been recently discharged, were transferred to the hostel at Yukon and that if such a transfer were made the enrolment would be by this action increased from 20 to 35, or at least per capita grants at the rate of $250.00 would be paid for 32 pupils.\n\nHowever, when the Anglican Church authorities secured the court-house building at Dawson and decided to transfer all the pupils from Carcross to that building, it became evident that it would not be necessary to\ntransfer the 12 senior girls to the hostel, as ample accommodation for the full enrolment was available at the court-house building. I should emphasize that provision has been made in the estimates for the fiscal year 1943-44 for the education of 40 pupils at an Anglican residential school in the Yukon territory, but no funds are available for the education of additional pupils. It is my understanding that steps are being taken by the church authorities to have the equipment, desks, textbooks, etc., now at Carcross, transferred to the court-house building and that, in view of all the circumstances, it will be to the advantage of the church to have all the Indian pupils provided with instruction in a single building.\n\nDirector.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Commission are in receipt of a telegram from the Rev. H. C. M. Grant, Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School, stating that owing to the loss of the services of his teacher through ill health, the resignation of his Kitchen Matron and Boys' Supervisor, he will be unable to keep the School open unless these vacancies can be filled by the 15th inst. Owing to lack of time and the difficulty of securing suitable agents, under existing conditions, the Commission are unable to supply his needs. May we request, therefore, that authority be granted by your Department to close the School on the 15th June, instead of the 30th and re-open it on the 15th August or on such date as adequate arrangements can be made? Your favourable consideration of this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.\n\nEWM: S\nOttawa,\nJune 4, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 2nd instant, the Department approves closing the Carcross Indian Residential School on June 15 and re-opening it on August 15.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur Society has given a great deal of very careful consideration to the question of transferring the activities of the Carcross Indian Residential School from Carcross to Dawson until such time as a school can be provided to take the place of the one destroyed by fire. Your Department has already agreed in principle, and authority has been given to our Commission by the Executive of our Society to complete the transfer. Before taking any definite steps in the matter, however, the Commission have requested me to secure specific information from your Department on the following points:-\n\n1. It is understood that the R.C.M.P. Building at Dawson, which will be made available for the activities of the Carcross School, has accommodation for at least 40 Indian children. Will your Department authorize the admission of at least 40 pupils and meet the cost of their transportation from their homes to Dawson?\n\n2. The following farm and garden and household equipment is available at Carcross and the Commission desires to know if your Department will meet carrying charges on the same, from Carcross to Dawson:-\n\nFarm & Garden: 1 post drill, 1 vise, 1 seeder, and a few hand tools.\n\nHousehold Equipment: Bedding for 40 children, 20 double deck bunks, school desks, kitchen utensils, spare clothing, a few tables and benches, medical supplies, 2 washing machines, 3 or 4 cases of classroom supplies, 1 typewriter, office desk, 40 files, etc., etc.\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch. - 2.\n\nJune 23, 1943.\n\n3. Furnishings and equipment will be required for at least six staff bedrooms, and our Commission desires to know if your department will provide these. The Rev. Principal Grant, when furnishing our Commission with a list of the requirements for the building at Dawson, stated that \"the members of his staff were now using furniture which belongs to the owners of the buildings being occupied in the town of Carcross, and in the event of the school being moved to Dawson new staffroom equipment would be necessary\".\n\n4. In the event of our Society not being permitted to use the Dawson building for at least a year, will your Department undertake to refund to our Society any expenditure which the Society may have met for structural alterations, etc., in connection with the transfer of the activities of the Carcross School to Dawson?\n\n5. Should your Department agree to meet these expenditures, and should our Commission find it possible to meet the cost of the necessary structural alterations in the building in Dawson, kindly let me know if the present caretaker in the Dawson building will be available to receive any of the equipment mentioned above, and to look after the same until the Principal has been appointed and installed.\n\nMr. Grant, who has so capably filled the position of Principal of the Carcross School for so many years is accepting another position under the Bishop of the Yukon, but the Bishop of the Yukon has intimated to me that he has 2 other men in his Diocese, both of whom have had experience in Indian Residential School work, and that the Principalship of the School at Dawson will be given to either one of these.\n\nA prompt reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTERW:A.\nOttawa, June 25, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 23rd instant, in which you seek information with respect to the costs that might be borne by this Department in the establishment of the residential school, conducted until now at Carcross, at the R.C.M.P. building, Dawson.\n\nI may state that we have, in the 1943-44 estimates, an amount of $10,000.00 for the payment of per capita grants at Carcross. This will enable you to enroll 40 pupils at $250.00 each. This sum will be available for the instruction of pupils, should you decide to establish a residential school at Dawson. Under existing Treasury regulations, it is not possible for us to use per capita grants for any purpose other than the one for which they are voted by Parliament.\n\nIn addition to the per capita grants, there is $500.00 in the estimates for general repairs at Carcross. This sum might be used for repairs and general structural changes at Dawson. There is not in the estimates, however, an amount that might be used for the purchase of furniture and equipment, either for the school itself or for the members of the staff, nor for the transfer of equipment from Carcross to Dawson. There is in the estimates an item of $240.00 covering allowance towards payment of night watchmen's services at Carcross. There is also a small grant to assist residential schools in the transportation of pupils. The demands on this fund have become rather heavy during the last year or two. This condition is, no doubt, due in part to the restrictions on gasoline, auto travel, etc. The grants we are permitted to make from this fund amount to approximately 20% of the cost involved in the transportation of pupils. You will note, therefore, from the foregoing, that it will not be possible for the Department to assist your Commission in this project except to a very limited extent. We have not at our disposal, since the outbreak of the war, a miscellaneous vote to which we might turn for expenditures such as the ones you have in mind.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances and the difficulty we are experiencing in securing funds for the regular services in this critical period, would it be possible for your Commission to find accommodation for the Indian pupils at the St. Paul's Hostel, using the R.C.M.P. building for classroom work only? This suggestion may prove to be wholly impracticable, but I am submitting it for what it is worth.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

H.C.M. Grant, and Constable W.J. MacDonald.\n\nThere does not appear to be any serious sickness among the Natives at this point. I made a trip to the site of the former residential school and was agreeably surprised at its suitable location. When the time comes to spend money on a new Indian residential school, I think a return to this site should be very seriously considered. The stone basement seemed to me to be in a good state of repair. There is a sawmill with local lumber close at hand and it would seem that the construction of a building could be undertaken at less expense there than in most places in the Yukon Territory.\n\nIn conversation with Rev. Mr. Grant, he advised me that all the cattle belonging to the school had been sold, but they still have two horses, four pigs, five piglets, and some twenty-eight chickens.

Gibben, Indian Agent, Dawson, Y.T.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, reporting on your visit to the site of the former Carcross Residential School. The information contained in your letter has been noted.\n\nWe have also received, today, the vouchers covering the June rent of the buildings used by the Carcross Residential School since the fire. I presume that it will not be necessary to pay any further rent for these buildings.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Use of Court House building at Dawson for residential school purposes.\n\nI beg to refer to the letter of April 5th from Dr. McGill, under this heading, also to a letter from Mr. Hoey dated June 25th (ref. 166-1-1).\n\nOur Commission has explored every possibility of effecting the transfer of our residential school work from Carcross to Dawson. We have been in continual correspondence with Bishop Geddes and the Principal of the School, but the many difficulties and uncertainties surrounding the question seemed to make the transfer inadvisable. The matter was thoroughly reviewed at the July meeting of our Commission, and in view of the lateness of the date now reached, it was felt that a definite decision must be arrived at. The following resolution was eventually adopted:\n\n\"that in the face of the impossibility of carrying on a school effectively at Carcross under existing conditions, and in view of the many uncertainties connected with the suggested removal to Dawson, we are regretfully compelled to recommend that the school be closed temporarily. Pending the construction of a new building at Carcross or some other point, we urge the establishment of a Day School to provide for some of the children concerned\".\n\nWe deeply regret that we are forced to recommend the cessation of the work of the Chootla School even for a time, as its reputation in the Yukon for valuable service over a long period of years is something we treasure. We are also convinced of the need of such an institution and it is our hope that arrangements may be made for a number of the children to be provided for in one or more Day Schools until such time as adequate provision can be made for them at Carcross.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nOttawa,\nJuly 30, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of July 27 and it is noted that the M.S.C.C. has decided to temporarily close the Carcross Residential School. In view of all the circumstances, I feel that this decision is in the best interests of all parties concerned.\n\nI have noted your suggestion that one or more day schools be provided for the pupils of the former Carcross School. The Indian Agent is being written for a report in regard to this suggestion.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector.\n\nRev. H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\n38-45 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa,\nAugust 3, 1943.\n\nMr. J.E. Gibben, Indian Agent, Dawson, Y.T.\n\nThe Department recently received a letter from the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada in which they state that it has been definitely decided to temporarily close the Carcross Residential School.\n\nTo replace it the M.S.C.C. suggests the establishment of one or more day schools which would operate until such time as a new residential school might be provided. In view of this request I should appreciate your making immediate inquiries with a view to determining where new day schools could be opened in the Yukon. In the event of your recommending one or more schools, you should state what buildings are available, both for classroom purposes and for living quarters for the teachers. No special funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for erection of day schools and consequently, if any are to be opened, it will be necessary to use rented buildings.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDawson, Y.T.,\nAugust 13th, 1943.\n\nI have your letter of July 29th and would say that I have received no official notification that the premises used by the Residential School at Carcross would be no longer required. Rev. H.C.M. Grant, the school principal, wrote me on July 3rd indicating that the Department had authorized the closing of the school from June 15th, 1943 to August 15th, 1943. I wrote you on July 21st to this effect. I do not know who made the arrangements for renting of the buildings used as school quarters, but it would seem that some official notice to the respective landlords would be required if the Department intends to terminate the tenancy.\n\nJ.E. Gibben,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nAttention Chief Training Division,\nDep't. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 23, 1943.\n\nMr. J. E. Gibben, Indian Agent, Dawson, Yukon.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 13th instant, written in reply to departmental letter of August 3.\n\nIt is our understanding that the temporary buildings at Carcross, which have been used for residential school purposes, were rented for a three year period which ended on June 30 of this year.\n\nIt would be deeply appreciated if we could have from you a definite recommendation with respect to the construction of Indian day schools in the Yukon territory. While no funds have been provided in the estimates of this year for such construction, nevertheless we feel that funds will be forthcoming in the years immediately ahead of us for the extension of our Indian day school facilities.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDawson, Y.T.,\nSeptember 3rd, 1943.\n\nRe: Indian Day Schools, Your File #166-1-1\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's letter of August 3rd which only recently arrived might I suggest that where an early reply is desired letters should be sent by Air Mail as otherwise receipt of the letter is often delayed for a matter of weeks.\n\nYou ask my opinion with regard to the opening of new day schools in the Yukon Territory. I find that I am not in a position to make any recommendation. Aside from a few hours visit to Carcross and a few minutes stopover at various Indian settlements along the river I have had no opportunity of acquainting myself with actual conditions among the Indians, with the exception of those in the immediate vicinity of Dawson, Mayo, and Whitehorse. The only enquiries that I could make would be from the Church and from the Police. No doubt you have suggestions from the former body. I would not place much value on recommendations received from R.C.M. Police Detachment members in outlying districts, who for the most part have not been in the country very long.\n\nMy own limited experience would indicate that Indian Day Schools as presently functioning in the Territory are of doubtful and varying value. For instance the school at Moosehide Indian village has a reasonable average attendance and the missionary in charge according to the curriculum which he has shown me is making a systematic effort to teach. On the other hand he is handicapped by cramped and inadequate quarters and poor lighting.\n\nAt Selkirk settlement the Quarterly Returns indicate a very low average attendance. My own opinion, strengthened by confidential reports which I have received from reliable sources, is that the Government is not receiving value for its monthly outlay at this point.\n\nI discussed this matter with Bishop Geddes the day before he left Dawson presumably to go eventually to Ottawa.\nwhile his views and mine will probably not entirely coincide he has this advantage, that he has personal knowledge of the various Indian settlements in the Territory.\n\nJ.E. Gibben,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, September 20, 1943.\n\nMr. J. E. Gibben, Indian Agent, Dawson, Yukon.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 3, in which you submit information with respect to the establishment of Indian day schools in the Yukon territory.\n\nIn this connection I may state that I had an opportunity of discussing this subject somewhat fully with Bishop Geddes, who visited the Department a few days ago. It is just possible that we may be able to make provision for the establishment of a number of schools and teachers' residences in connection with the Government's building program in the immediate post-war period.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by the Minister of this Department from the Minister of Finance. It would be appreciated if we could have from you, in due course, a summary of a worthwhile works program that might be undertaken in the five-year period immediately following the close of the war. We have in mind, of course, the construction and repair of any agency buildings that might be needed, the construction of schools, particularly Indian day schools, and the construction of teachers' residences. It is not our intention that you should undertake an exhaustive survey of the needs of the reserves at this time. Dr. O'Neill, with whom this matter was discussed at a conference on the 10th ultimo, is anxious to have, at an early date, a rough outline of the program you might have in mind, particularly your building program.\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDawson, Y.T.,\nSeptember 13th, 1943.\n\nRe: Your File 166-1-1\n\nI have only this morning had an opportunity of discussing the question of an Indian Day School at Mayo with Corp'l. G.I. Cameron and Corp'l. B. d'Easum. The last mentioned has been stationed at Mayo for over a year while the former, although stationed at Selkirk, is well acquainted with the Mayo District. I have a good deal of confidence in Corp'l. Cameron particularly.\n\nThese two R.C.M. Police members are of the opinion that a day school on the Mayo Indian Reserve would serve more children and be of more general use than anywhere else in the Yukon Territory. They point out that there is a large band of Indians at Mayo with between 30 and 40 children approximately, and that these for the most part are not given to bush-wandering.\n\nWhen queried with regard to accommodation the only information the Police members could give was that there was a church building on the reserve that could probably be used for school purposes. Apparently there are no houses other than the primitive cabins occupied by the Natives.\n\nJ.E.

T.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 13th instant, in which you suggest that an Indian day school be established on the Mayo Indian Reserve.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would communicate with Bishop Geddes with respect to the establishment of this school and secure from him, if possible, information with respect to the availability of a teacher to take charge of the school at any time in the immediate future.\n\nIt would be appreciated also if we could have from you an expression of opinion with respect to the most economical steps that might be taken for the construction of an Indian day school at this point. I have in mind the availability of lumber or logs for the construction of such a building and the desirability of having this work undertaken by a regular contractor or by day labour. It is exceedingly difficult to reach a rational decision here unless this information can be secured.\n\nR. A.

Only so much of the sentence is approved as provides for confinement at hard labour for a period of four months and forfeiture of $40.00 per month for a like period; and, as thus modified, will be duly executed.

The Bishop and the writer are both of the opinion that frame construction is more suitable in the long run.\n\nI think a one room school with accommodation for thirty pupils together with a small house for the teacher's living quarters would meet the requirements at Mayo for a long time to come. Presumably the Department have on hand plans and specifications adequate for buildings of this type. If a copy of these could be forwarded, I might obtain an estimate of the construction cost through the Territorial Agent at Mayo.

W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Carcross School\n\nI am replying separately to your letter of May 5th but now desire to make a formal application for an increased pupilage in this school.\n\nYou will recall that we have previously made application for a continuance of the rental which was being paid by the Department for the temporary buildings used until June 1943, in the village of Carcross. As our Missionary Society has been faced with the necessity of an expenditure of at least $20,000 in order that the work of this school may be continued, we felt that it was reasonable to expect the Department to continue the assistance they had given by way of rental. I submitted this request to Mr. Clarence Jackson and was advised that it could not be granted in the present instance as so many other religious bodies were concerned in Indian Education, and many similar requests would probably be received if such a precedent was established. Meanwhile, the work of building the school is going forward and there is every prospect that it will shortly be completed.\n\nIn discussing this question with Mr. Jackson when in Ottawa recently, the question of adjustment of per capita grants came up. I pointed out that whereas we receive $250 per pupil at Carcross, which is the largest amount given for any of our schools, we were never able to maintain the work without drawing upon Church funds. This arises, of course, not only from the fact of the very high cost of operating such an isolated school but from the low pupilage authorized. I pointed out the possibility of rendering a better service when the authorized pupilage is larger and the fixed overhead only slightly increased. This seemed to me to be a fair solution of our present Carcross difficulty and I suggested that if the Department could authorize us to admit a larger number of pupils it might enable us to improve our financial position. I, therefore, on behalf of our Commission beg to make formal application for an authorized pupilage of fifty in the new Carcross School. My information is that we can readily secure this number of children and I am confident that the building can be enlarged to take care of this number if we are assured that they will be authorized. In view of the fact that our Church is making this\nheavy capital expenditure, by reason of the fact that the Department is unable to carry out its own plans for a permanent school at the present time, it would seem fair that we should not be asked to continue to operate at a loss but should have the opportunity of receiving a higher annual income.\n\nI shall await with interest the decision of the Department in this matter and shall be grateful for some early reply as the work of construction is now going forward.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\nOttawa, May 22, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by this Branch from Dr. H. A. Alderwood, Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nDr. Alderwood has on more than one occasion discussed with me the proposal he now submits in this communication. He was for a time anxious that the Department should pay rent for the use of the Carcross Residential School. I reminded him that it had not been the policy of the Department to pay rent for residential school buildings except in an emergency and then only for a limited period of time. I expressed the opinion that any departure from this practice would lead to endless confusion and dissatisfaction. Dr. Alderwood then suggested an adjustment, either in the pupilage or in the per capita grant payments. I assured him that any proposal submitted by him for such an adjustment would be carefully and sympathetically considered by the Minister.\n\nThe Carcross Residential school had, at the time of its destruction by fire, April 17, 1939, an enrolment of 40 pupils, for which per capita grant amounting to $250.00 was allowed. Incidentally, this is the highest per capita paid at any residential school in the Dominion. In view of the urgent need for residential school accommodation in the Yukon territory, it would appear to me to be sound, from an educational standpoint, and reasonably equitable and fair to the Anglican Church authorities, who have constructed the school at Carcross without cost to this Department, to allow an additional 10 pupils, or a total authorized pupilage of 50 at this school.\n\nActing Director.\nMemorandum:\n\nOttawa, May 22, 1944.\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by this Branch from Dr. H.

Meek, Indian Agent, Whitehorse, Yukon, dated April 9, 1948.\n\nThe Indians of Whitehorse seem to be very slowly breaking down certain barriers of prejudice which was unfortunately very prevalent in the past. At the ceremony in celebration of Scout Week, Indian boys were invited to participate. Some of these Indian lads were former members of scout troops at Carcross Residential School, and I have endeavoured to establish a troop at the Whitehorse Indian Day School, but the matter requires much more time than I am able to devote at present.\n\nIn the course of a recent meeting of the Whitehorse Athletic Association, a program was outlined to foster and encourage sports in the schools. Our Indian school will be treated on the same basis as the white school. The writer has been appointed a member of the executive of this Association; it will be my object to give our Indian pupils every opportunity to compete with the territorial schools and Carcross Residential School.\nCOPY for information of\n\nVen. Archdeacon H. G. Cook,\nSupt., Indian School Administration, M.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nOttawa, June 2, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nCarcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn April, 1939, the above Residential School, at that time Government-owned, was lost by fire. It had an authorized enrolment at that time of 40 pupils. As the Department, due to war conditions, was unable to replace the structure, the M.S.C.C. erected a temporary building at a cost of $24,000.00. The building was not sufficiently large for permanent use and it was thought that at the conclusion of hostilities the Government would replace the temporary structure, erected by the Church, with a larger building suitable for permanent use.\n\nWe have now received a letter from Canon Cook of the M.S.C.C., reading in part as follows:\n\n\"The present situation at Carcross is most unsatisfactory. The school is authorized to carry sixty pupils but dormitory and other accommodation allows for no more than forty-five. Staff members are inadequately quartered and the principal is finding it necessary to live in a built-over chicken house. All, staff and children alike, suffer from the cold and draughty buildings during the winter time and there is the ever constant fear of fire from the use of many stoves.\n\n\"At the moment, the Administration is in the unhappy position of losing the services of an excellent principal unless better accommodation can be arranged for his family before next winter.\n\n\"Less than one hundred miles from Carcross the Government is constructing a large modern school for the...\"\nRoman Catholic Church. The Administration feels that our needs for more adequate facilities at Carcross ought to have had prior consideration.\n\n\"In the light of the above, I would respectfully submit for your consideration the following:\n\n(a) That a suitable building for the Principal and his family be constructed this summer at the Carcross Residential School.\n\n(b) That the Indian Department have its engineers visit the site of the Chootla School with a view to their making recommendations to enlarge the school to suitable proportions for adequate accommodation of at least eighty pupils and the necessary staff.\n\n(c) That a sufficient sum be included in the 1949-50 appropriation to allow for the renovations or rebuilding recommended by the engineers.\"\n\nIn view of the representations made above by Canon Cook, it is recommended that the following action be taken:\n\n(a) That a Prefabricated Bungalow be ordered from Prefabricated Structures, Limited, of Vancouver, B.C., for shipping to Carcross by July 15. Mr. Indian Agent Meek advises that a prefabricated building of this type would be satisfactory and the Principal of the School will also accept such a building. If you concur in this recommendation, we attach a requisition covering the purchase of this building.\n\n(b) That approval be given to having one of the officials of the Lands and Development Services Branch visit this school with a view to making recommendations concerning the enlargement, as mentioned by Canon Cook.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring our visit among the Southern Yukon Indians this summer, I found there is a desire on the part of some parents to place their children at the Chena Residential School at Carcross. The present accommodation is insufficient, and I have to warn them that it may be a little time before they can be taken; there is a waiting list.\n\nAgain in view of the greater contact which the Indians of the Southern Yukon have with the \"whites,\" through the Alaska Highway and other transport facilities, I venture to submit that they should be encouraged to send their children elsewhere than to the occasional day school, where they seldom reach even beyond Grade 2. They will benefit our Canadian life generally and be benefited...\nif they are given such educational opportunities, as will enable them to become fully serviceable Canadian citizens, able to read and write with ease, and continue through raising their mental and manual development. For those who are likely to spend their lives in remote parts, education is often a wasted asset, but within 150 miles or so of White Horse, the Indian children should be given greater chances than they now enjoy. An average school, enlarged to take 80 children, which I feel is quite a conservative estimate, would help to this end. Except at the Residential School, I doubt whether the majority of children attend even as many as 100 school sessions in the year\u2014that is in Yukon.\n\nOur Anglican Church will cooperate as fully as possible, if we can have increased accommodation.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWalter Hudson (Bishop)\nOttawa, June 24, 1948.\n\nDear Archbishop Adams:\n\nI have received your letter of June 16th with reference to the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nAt the present time we are negotiating with the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada with a view to purchasing this building.

G. Lawrence, R.C.M.P., to Carcross in connection with complaint of theft by M. Watson, trader. Suspected was John Wally, 15, pupil of Carcross Indian Residential School. No information could be obtained that date, but later Const. Lawrence obtained a confession from John Wally that he had broken into M. Watson's store and stolen money and goods.\n\nOn February 8th I appeared with John Wally before J.A. Simmons, J.P., Judge of Juvenile Court, at Carcross. He was charged with theft of money and goods to value of $74.00, on December 17th, 1948. Rev. J.W. Ellis, principal Carcross Residential School, stated he had difficulty with the boy for some months and wished him expelled from the school. After hearing all the evidence Wally was adjudged a juvenile delinquent.\n\nFinal disposition suspended on condition that John Wally be placed on probation in the care and custody of Rev. H.I. Lee, director of Whitehorse Indian Mission School, for an indeterminate period during which time John Wally was to report to R.C.M.P., Whitehorse, daily. Rev. Lee stated he was willing to accept Wally for a probationary period of one month at the rate of $50.00, and if the boy was satisfactory, he will revert to normal charges. There is no R.C.M.P. at Carcross. No Indian foster home could be found for John Wally in Whitehorse. He is an orphan, with only very distant relatives living at Fort Selkirk. Dr. Duncan recommended John Wally not be sent there as the Roberts family is T-B, one child having died recently.\n\nJohn Wally was found as an infant abandoned in an Indian camp. He was brought to Whitehorse Hospital where he lived for a year or so, then he was sent to Carcross Residential School where he has remained since 1938. When case comes up for final disposition, a further report will be submitted.\n\nN.J. Meek\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nCHOUTLA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nGarcross,\nYukon Territory.\n\nThe Rev. Canon H.G. Cook, D.D.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nIn reply to your wire received last night I submit the following information. Before compiling it I spent several hours with Mr. Meek and Mr. Drury Jr. Unfortunately Archbishop Adams was not in Whitehorse so I was not able to consult him. Mr. Drury, by the way, has a store at Carmacks and is well acquainted with the village and the surrounding district.\n\nWhitehorse: As you are aware there is one Protestant School in Whitehorse taking care of about one hundred Indians and half-breeds. At the present time they are having considerable difficulty in maintaining discipline, especially amongst the older girls. This situation is aggravated by the number of troops now stationed in Whitehorse on Exercise \"Sweetbriar\" but such a condition has always existed, and in my opinion will continue.\n\nRelationships with the R.C. Church. To my mind comes the possibility of opposition if two Protestant schools are established in Whitehorse. I feel sure that strong objections would be raised and plans for ourselves might easily be delayed on that account.\n\nGardening Possibilities. The soil in Whitehorse and surrounding district is very poor. It would be necessary to go at least fifty miles in order to find suitable land for gardening on the scale we require.\n\nUtilities, Hospitalization, Freight. One of the great advantages to Whitehorse come under this heading.\n\nCarmacks.\n\nSituation: Carmacks is located on the Yukon River, 120 road miles from Whitehorse. As you advised in your letter an all weather road will be completed this year. It is fairly central to the following points, to the north, Dawson, Stewart and Selkirk. To the south, LeBerge. To the east, Mayo. To the west, Aishihik. The total Indian population of these points being about 650.\n\nGardening, Fuel, Water Supply. The land is good and has been successfully cultivated on quite a large scale. There is an ample wood supply easily available. There is also a coal mine two miles from the village, and the coal is recommended especially for automatic stokers. From information received the water supply is more than adequate. (wells) There is a saw-mill located at Minto, thirty miles north and also one at Mayo, 120 miles away, but both are on the highway.\n\nUtilities, Hospitalization, Freight. Regular weekly plane service is maintained during the winter. During the summer months it is served by boat at least once a week. A government telegraph station is maintained, also a nursing station. A scheduled bus and trucking service is expected to operate this\nsummer. Hospitals with doctors are maintained at Whitehorse and Mayo. Carmacks is midway between these two points. Freight rates from Whitehorse by boat are fairly reasonable. A good deal of the freight is shipped from Vancouver to Haines and then hauled to Carmacks by truck, a distance of about 250 miles. This I believe is the cheapest way as handling is kept to a minimum.\n\nThere is a reserve of 330 acres situated about a mile from the village. The white population of the village together with the mine employees number about 50. In a situation such as this, some changes would be necessary in the Wabasca plan for a school. I would suggest that provision be made for at least a six bed sick bay, and also the refrigerator space be large enough for a six months supply.\n\nPersonally, if we have to move, I am in favor of Carmacks. The children would have much more freedom with less danger of interference. It would take the majority of them closer to their homes, which would enable them to go home for the summer holidays. I do think it a mistake to keep them from their parents and families for a too long period. However, I do not think my own personal opinion should influence the decision too much, so I trust the foregoing information will give you an adequate picture of the situation.\n\nIf a change is made from the present location consideration will have to be given to classrooms, I would suggest three. Provision will also have to be made for garage, workshop, powerhouse and numerous other small buildings. Last, but not least, the principal's residence and greenhouse.\n\nWith best wishes for your success in negotiations with government.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoe W. Ellis,\nPrincipal.\nThe Indian School Administration\n\nFebruary 13, 1950.\n\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Carcross\n\nIn reference to our telephone conversation of 11/2/50.\n\nThe Administration would be well satisfied with a school for Carcross patterned generally after the new building at Wabasca. I would suggest, however, that serious consideration be given the following modifications of the Wabasca plan.\n\nRe: Plan SS4\n\n(a) The playrooms both on the first floor with the necessary baths and washroom facilities.\n\n(b) A partition with lockable door in corridor of first and second floors to separate boys and girls sides.\n\n(c) Both dorms. on second floor with one enclosed toilet in each dorm.\n\n(d) Suitable cupboards or lockers in playrooms and dorms.\n\n(e) Proper shelves in food and clothing storage rooms.\n\n(f) On sheet 4 of prints SS4 - the office moved to right of entrance door and staff living room immediately on left and a staff bedroom at left end of what is now marked \"staff living room\".\n\n(g) Basement plan to be re-arranged to allow for laundry equipment and walk-in refrigerator.\n\n(h) Wood siding or brick-type felt siding as outer covering instead of asphalt shingles (the latter easily broken in extremely cold weather).\n\nCONSIDER\n\n(i) Present school building made over to accommodate classrooms and winter clothes drying room.\n\n(j) D.C. Diesel and battery bank to be retained outside building.\n\nIf proposed water-power developments in the Carcross area are seriously contemplated the Administration would respectfully suggest a new site on the outskirts of Whitehorse so that the school could \"tie-in\" with the utilities this afforded.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.G.

Please let me have your comments on the contents of Mr. Meek's letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nPP/ST\nAttach.\nMarch 22, 1949.\n\nColonel B.F. Neary  \nSupt. of Indian Education  \nDept. Mines & Resources  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nIn answer to your letter of March tenth in relation to John Wally formerly of the Carcross Residential School.\n\nThe Principal was asked for his comments on Superintendent R.J. Meek's report and the following was received in a letter from Mr. Ellis this morning.\n\n\"The report submitted by R.J. Meek to Indian Affairs Branch outlines the situation fairly well, but the following details, very important from my point of view, have been omitted.\n\n(a) From December 28, 1948 when the theft was committed, until the hearing, February 8th John Wally broke into a warehouse at the school and also my house. In both instances food and other articles were stolen and he was assisted by other boys. In both cases when confronted with strong evidence John admitted planning and persuading the other boys to take part in the escapade. Neither of these boys, have in the past, misbehaved in this manner. I reported both these cases to R.J. Meek and after the second offence asked for a discharge for John Wally.\n\n(b) After waiting several weeks without action being taken by the R.C.M.P. I made a special trip to Whitehorse and in consultation with Mr. R.J. Meek and Mr. J.A. Simmons, Judge of Juvenile Court, it was decided that in the interests of the school, John Wally should be moved, and if possible a foster home be found for him amongst his relatives. Failing that he would be sent to the Reform School at Vancouver. However upon the recommendation of Dr. Duncan it was found inadvisable to send him to the only relatives he appears to have. That left no alternative but to hold court and send him outside. Pending further word from the R.C.M.P. Detachment at Fort...\"\nColonel Neary\n\nMarch 22, 1949.\n\nSelkirk it was decided to hold court in the near future.\n\n(c) The report does not mention that all arrangements were made with Mr. Lee to act as probation officer without my knowledge. I was informed about an hour before court was called. This in spite of the fact, that in our consultation, we had decided otherwise and I was under the impression that those arrangements were still good. I was very disappointed with the arrangements made. I fail to see how Mr. Lee, who has about eighty pupils, with a staff no larger than we have, can exercise sufficient supervision in a town such as Whitehorse, with so many temptations to a boy like John Wally, as to warrant his appointment of probation officer.\n\nTrusting these observations will help in your reply to the Indian Affairs Branch.\"\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHGC:MMA Superintendent\n29th March, 1949.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of 10th February, 1949, regarding John Wally, a pupil of the Carcross Residential School, we discussed the contents of your communication with Reverend Canon H.G. Cook, D.D., Superintendent, The Indian School Administration, M.S.C.C. Canon Cook has forwarded to us this morning, a copy of a letter which he has received from the Principal of the Carcross School. A copy of this letter is enclosed for your information.\n\nPlease let me have your comments on Canon Cook's letter.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nPP/ST Enc.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: John Wally\n\nReference above and your letter of 29th ultimo, file 940-1 (E.1), with Canon Cook's letter. My first report of February 10th was meant to be read in conjunction with R.C.M.P. report of Const. G.S. Lawrence, Whitehorse. I am informed by R.C.M.P. that you receive Police Reports direct from their Headquarters at Ottawa. Const. Lawrence covered several of the points which the Rev. J.W. Ellis claims were omitted by me in my report. The very long wait occasioned by the R.C.M.P. after Rev. Ellis first made his complaint aggravated the situation considerably as far as he was concerned.\n\nI interviewed Magistrate Simmons who informed me he had no intention of sending John Wally to an Industrial School in Vancouver. The Magistrate has many years of experience with Indians and has lived almost all his life in the Yukon; he considers it unwise to send Indians of John Wally's type to white institutions. He expressed himself as satisfied with present arrangements.\n\nCorp. R. Kent, N.C.O. 1/c R.C.M.P., Whitehorse, informed me that he was opposed to sending Indian Juvenile Offenders Outside. It is inferred he instructed his constable to make this recommendation to Magistrate Simmons. Corp. Kent stated he was satisfied with conditions under which John Wally is placed.\n\nBefore the case was tried I was instructed by Magistrate Simmons to suggest all arrangements which could be made; Dr. Duncan opposed sending Wally to his distant relatives who were suffering from tuberculosis. The other two alternatives were to send the boy to an Industrial School Outside, or to place him under proper care in the Yukon. No foster home could be found for the boy in this area. Mr. Simmons then suggested the Indian School of Rev. Lee, the latter heard the case before agreeing to take him in charge.\nThe Rev. Ellis knows how difficult Wally is to handle and still maintains that he should be sent to an Industrial School. However, when Magistrate Simmons gave his decision, the matter was considered closed. The statements contained in Rev. Ellis' report are matters of private opinion and he wishes them to remain as such.\n\nFinal report of disposition of this case has now been received from R.C.M.P. Paragraph 3 states:\n\n\"In view of the favourable reports on the boys' behaviour during the probationary period, His Worship deemed that the corrective measures already taken were sufficient and the said Juvenile Delinquent was reprimanded and released. It might be mentioned that he is continuing to attend the Indian School which is supervised by Rev. Lee.\"\n\nThe files have now been closed at the R.C.M.P. Detachment on this case.\n\nPresent arrangements concerning John Wally are satisfactory from the Department's point of view. I have no criticism to make concerning the decisions of J.A. Simmons, Judge of the Juvenile Court.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\n12th April, 1949.\n\nRev. Canon H.G. Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM. S. C.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whom a grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Carcross, Yukon School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 1st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Dawson City this 15th May 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Carcross Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. J.W. Ellis\n\nDated October 6th, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Whitehorse, Oct. 16th, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Carcross Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Carcross Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated October 8th, 1949.\n\nRev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Carcross Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1949.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Roll, as determined by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Carcross Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1950.\n\nPrincipal Rev. J.W.Ellis.\n\nDated March 31st, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Carcross Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nRev. J.W. Ellis\n\nDated June 30th 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Carcross Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1950.\n\nPrincipal Rev. J.W. Ellis\n\nDated October 6th, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Whitehorse, Oct. 11th, 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Carcross Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 1st 1951 Rev. J.W. Ellis\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Whitehorse this January 8th 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403 R. 3668\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Carcross Residential School School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1921 acting Principal J. F. D.\n\nDated April 16/21\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Whitehorse J.

PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CARCROSS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30 1951\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 6 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Whitehorse July 7th 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Cassiar Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1927.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 12, 1927.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1927.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL |

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CARGOOS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended DEG 31st 1953.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 10 1954\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Whitestone January 16 1954\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**YUKON Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the CHOCUTLA RESIDENTIAL School at CANGROSS on Reserve for Quarter ended DECEMBER 31st, 1951**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0132            | Smarch Jane    | 16  | x   |      | 15 4 4 1 5 0 3 0 1 | 14 16         | Home Ec.          | 1012\u00bd                   | 1-9-44                     | 2853 1401 |\n| 0150            | Johnson Kathleen | 14 |     |      |                |               |                   |                          | 3-10-44                    | 92 57     |\n| 0151            | Jackson Mary   | 15  |     |      |                |               |                   |                          | 3-10-44                    | -

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grants allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CARIBOOS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 1952.\n\nPrincipal: C. T. Stanger\n\nDated: October 11, 1952\n\nRev. G. T. Stanger\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Whistler,

made and entered at the foot of column.**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CARCROSS School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Evans,\nAccountant, Church House,\n604 Jarvis St. Toronto 5, Ontario.\n\nDear Miss Evans:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 20th inst. enclosing the June Quarterly payment for the Carcross school.\n\nMr. Phelan's statement places the average pupilage at forty which was the old sanctioned pupilage. You will recollect however that in a letter from Mr. Hoey dated the 29th of May 1944 No - 166-1-1 a pupilage of fifty was sanctioned after the opening of the new school. Archdeacon Grant's return for the June quarter shows that the average attendance of pupils amounts to 48.13 and our checking of his return concurs with this figure so that apparently instead of the earning for the June quarter being $2500.00 it should be $2820.63.\n\nIt is possible there may be some explanation for this discrepancy but I thought it well to draw your attention to the fact that the pupilage had been increased from forty to fifty.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nE.

Mermagen,\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer.\n\nEWM/HMH/\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nChairman \u2014 The Primate\n\nThe Church House\n604 Jarvis Street\nToronto 5, Ont.\n\nAugust 27, 1945.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI enclose copy of letter received from our Indian Schools Commission office in Winnipeg, re payment for the June Quarter per capita grant for the Carcross Indian School, which I think speaks for itself.\n\nI shall appreciate it if you will look into this matter and let us know if we are entitled to the additional amount on per capita grant as indicated in Mr Mermagen's letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEE/EG\n\nEnc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nProvince of YUKON\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPer Capita Allowances\u2014Residential Schools\n\nFor Quarter ended June 30 1945.\n\n| PRINCIPAL | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL PER CAPITA ALLOWANCE | AMOUNT DUE |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|------------|\n|           | Aver.          | 45.18                      |            |\n|           | CARCROSS RES.  | $250.                      |            |\n|           | June Earnings  | $2,820.62                  |            |\n|           |                | $2,969.85                  |            |\n|           | Less Already Paid | $2,650.00               |            |\n|           | Balance due    | $259.85                    |            |\n\nThe Department agreed to allow Special Grant of $15.00 per capita for Calendar Year 1945, based on Average Attendance.

Carcross is a small-pupilage school which has fixed administrative expenses and probably operates at a deficit. I recommend that an assurance go forward that the amount to be paid for the September Quarter will more nearly approximate the amount that has been claimed.\n\nC.A.F.

We must understand that Mr. Grey said that he would charge for his time while absent from Whitehorse that is from Friday Jan. 8th. to Tuesday Jan. 12th. incl.\n\nTherefore the cost of moving the plant was practically nothing.\n\nTrusting these few remarks will help to explain matters.\n\nI am,\n\nyours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. All's well.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the account of the Yukon Electrical Co of Whitehorse for repairs to the electric lighting plant at the Carcross Indian Residential School. Also the report of the Principal on the daily work done by the electrician.\n\nMoving the engine from the furnace room to the print shop is undoubtedly a wise move and, as pointed out by the Principal, it has been done without extra cost to the Department. Trains from Carcross are running on Tuesday and Friday only therefore the electrician was compelled to stay from Friday to Tuesday and would have charged his time if he had not moved the engine. We hope this will meet with the Department's approval.\n\nEnclos.2.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential school reports that x x x x x\n\nHe also reports that there is considerable trouble with the drainage from the baths and washbasins in the bathrooms. The waste water backs up and overflows and seeps through the ceiling of the office and one of the hospital wards. I have authorized him to engage the services of Matthew Watson, who installed the plumbing, to attend to the matter at once. There may be a partial stoppage through corrosion of the pipes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley.\nIndian Superintendent.\nIt is considered advisable, in view of the fact that the Carcross Indian Residential School has not been repainted since 1911 and that the paint is now rapidly wearing off, that the exterior of the buildings should be repainted this summer, thus preserving the wood work.\n\nMay I suggest that this be taken under consideration by the Department. If it is decided to carry out the work it should be completed by the end of August to avoid the action of frost on wet or partially dried paint.\n\nI have no hesitation in recommending that the work be done if funds are available for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 31, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of April 29th, last, in which you recommend that the exterior of the buildings at the Carcross Indian Residential School be repainted during the present summer.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that funds are available for this work and the Department will approve of your making the necessary arrangements to have the painting completed before the end of August, next. If you can have this work done by day labour, under the direction of a competent foreman, the Department will be pleased if you will purchase the paint, oils, etc., required, after obtaining competitive prices. If, however, you consider it would be advisable to have the work done by contract, you should obtain prices from as many painters as possible for its completion. You should then give the work to the person quoting the lowest. When calling for prices, you should furnish the firms asked to quote with a complete specification as to the amount of work that is to be done and specify that a good grade of material is to be used.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands and will expect you to make the arrangement which you consider best to have the painting completed at the lowest possible cost. When the work has been finished to your satisfaction, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. If the painting is done by contract, please attach to your vouchers the quotations which you receive for the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Arthur Bagshaw.\nPrincipal.\nCarcross, Y.T. July 14th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nWhile inspecting the condition of the interior of the Carcross Indian School it was noted that the asbestos covering of the boiler and pipes of the heating plant are badly in need of repair; there are numerous bare places on both boiler and pipes. Also that the planking in the wood shed needs replacing, those now in place are quite worn out and some damage is being done to the stone foundation; the steps leading from the basement to outdoors are also badly worn and need new treads. A new floor is needed in the horse stall of the barn. Three hundred feet of 2x9 rough planking would be required to make these repairs.\n\nIf the Department will authorize the purchase of the planks and asbestos the repairs will be carried out by the school authorities.\n\nRegarding the painting of the exterior of the building, one estimate has been received others are daily expected; the work will be then put in hand if estimates are considered satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

John Hawksley,\nSuperintendent of Indian Work in the Yukon\nDawson, Y.T.\n\nDear Mr. Hawksley:\n\nI regret very much that I am unable to remain over until your arrival, as I should like to have the pleasure of meeting you, in addition to having an opportunity of discussing with you certain matters pertaining to this School. A number of engagements, however, have been booked for me in British Columbia and in order to keep these I must leave Skagway this evening.\n\nSpeaking generally I consider that the School has made a good rally from the disorganizing effects attendant upon the epidemic of influenza, and am of the opinion that you will arrive at the same conclusion. The staff with the exception of the Principal, where a change is under contemplation, appears to me to be fully competent, and I am hopeful of good results in all future work.\n\nI am strongly of the opinion that more accommodation and equipment should be provided not later than next year, and if your Department can provide these I shall be very deeply obliged. Our Society will endeavour to provide the staff rooms with rugs, and certain other furnishings, but the question of providing (1) a boys' recreation room (2) a chapel which could, with the sanctuary shut off by folding doors, be used as an assembly room (3) modern laundry equipment (4) full sized doors and windows and netting for the same (5) a bridge across the creek and a road around it, is one which involves too heavy an expenditure for our Society to undertake. Mr. Barshaw will give you my suggestion with regard to the location of the boys' recreation room and chapel.\n\nI had hoped to talk this matter and many others over with you so that we might reach a definite understanding with regard to them. I commend them, under existing circumstances, to your careful and sympathetic consideration. If you will be so good as to let me have your opinion with regard to the total expenditure the Department could reasonably be asked to undertake in connexion with this School next year, it will be a help to our Society in preparing their list of requisitions for that period. I myself, am of the opinion that $10,000.00 would cover everything but I have been unable to secure sufficient data during my visit on which to work out a close estimate.\n\nWith best wishes, Believe me\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) T.B.R. Westgate\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith copy of letter received from the Rev Dr Westgate in reference to certain improvements and requirements at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the first place I may say that his estimate ($10,000) to cover the cost of the improvements mentioned in his letter would not be sufficient if all the suggestions were undertaken. The cost of labour and material is very high in the Yukon.\n\nBefore undertaking any of the suggested improvements may I be permitted to call attention to some necessary repairs to the interior of the building. There are still a number of rooms and all the corridors with a quantity of loose plaster some of which occasionally falls off. I consider the removal of this and replacing it with beaver board the first and most necessary expense to be undertaken.\n\nNow that the school has electricity it would be a great help and a saving of much time and labour if electric washing machines and wringers were supplied.\n\nA recreation room would be a very useful addition, the boys have to use the laundry as a recreation room which is not very convenient for such a purpose. I do not consider a chapel necessary for such a small institution (36 pupils). There is a good church in Carcross which the pupils attend on Sunday. The walk from the school to the church is good for the pupils and I have every reason to believe that they enjoy it. The schoolroom can be and is used for the daily prayers this, I consider, meets the need.\n\nA bridge across the creek would be a convenience though I would not call it a necessity. From November to April the creek can be safely crossed on the ice.\nNew screens are needed for the windows. I would suggest a supply of sliding screens, such as were supplied some years ago would meet the need. I think the cost was 50\u00a2 per screen.\n\nIn conversation with the Rev Dr Westgate I gathered that it was his desire to make the school a show place because a number of tourists visit the school during two or three months of the summer. I am inclined to think that is not the policy of the Department. I take it that it is to be a practical educational centre for the Indians of the Territory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

Westgate,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nRevd and Dear Sir:\n\nFollowing my telegraphic report of yesterday I beg to make the following supplemental report re the fire which broke out in the hospital ward of the school here on Thursday evening.\n\nI was sitting in the office talking with one of the other members of the staff when we smelt smoke as we arose to investigate we were informed that there was fire. The alarm was immediately turned in and the children and other members of the staff responded in a most splendid manner. There was no panic and everyone went directly to their posts, which fortunately had been allotted to all the day before, we having had fire drill on that day. One cannot speak too highly nor highly enough of the splendid efforts of all.\n\nThe flames apparently started in a trunk which was in the ward, it was near to a hot steam pipe but not in contact with it. The flames apparently originated inside, so perhaps we should be far wrong if we were to suggest that Internal Combustion was the cause. Practically no material damage was done to the school, the board itself was absolutely gutted and of no further use so it was torn out, the flames spread to the bathroom upstairs but were quickly extinguished.\n\nMiss Ridgeway is the chief loser as she lost nearly all her personal effects including a large quantity of brand new clothes, a fur coat as well as a fur lined coat so I should say she has lost several hundred dollars of personal property. I should like to take the liberty of recommending that she receive some compensation.\n\nAs soon as I felt sure that the fire was out, I allowed the children back to their dormitories after hot cocoa was issued and vigil was kept in order to take no chances of it starting while all of the staff were asleep.\n\nI am sure that I am not wrong in saying that a great debt is owed to the General Assistant, Mr. Storey, Miss Cameron and Miss Ridgeway for their splendid efforts in preventing what might have been a very serious disaster at the school over the week end on account of the\naccident and I was very much relieved to have been on the spot at the time. By the time that I return home I shall have been at the school for ten days. Shall be home a week and then return every week so as to keep fully in touch with the work. The present staff are entirely competent and reliable.\n\nMay I also take the liberty of suggesting that you as the head of the Commission write a letter of thanks to the children of the school as the way they acted was simply splendid and I have seen nothing better in that way in any school including white schools.\n\nTrusting that this is a full and satisfactory report.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) W.H.L. West.\nActing Principal.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find copy of a letter from the Rev. W. H. L. West, Acting Principal of our Society's School at Carcross in which he sets forth full particulars in connection with the fire which recently broke out in that institution. Acting on Mr. West's suggestion I have already written to the staff and the school children expressing the appreciation and pride of our Society at the splendid way in which they all conducted themselves in what was really a moment of very great danger. A special effort is now being made by our Society to reimburse Miss Ridgeway for her loss which she states could not be replaced for less than $200.00 and I trust that any expenditure which may be necessary in the way of repairs to the main building as the result of this fire will be undertaken by your Department.

West, acting principal.\n\n\"At eight o'clock last night smoke was discovered issuing from the hospital ward which was at the time unoccupied, it was found that the room was on fire, an immediate alarm was given which was promptly answered, all the staff and pupils having had fire drill only the day before. The pumps were promptly manned and in a very short time the fire was subdued. Some damage was done to the walls of the ward, the prompt and efficient work of the pupils and staff undoubtedly saved the building. I wish to commend one and all in the highest terms for their splendid behaviour.\n\nThe origin of the fire is somewhat of a mystery it apparently having commenced in a trunk packed with the personal property of Miss Ridgeway. There was apparently nothing of an inflammable nature and the only conclusion I can reach is that it was started internal combustion probably helped by the fact that a hot steam pipe runs through the cupboard in which the trunk was stored although the trunk was not touching the pipe as far as I can ascertain. I am of the opinion that no blame can be attached to any one.\n\nI believe that I have given you all the information available regarding what might have been a disastrous fire. I shall be glad to answer any further questions you may see fit to ask.\"\n\nNo particulars were given regarding the nature or the amount of damage done to the walls of the room. I have written to the Principal for a report on this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Dr. Westgate, a similar report which he forwarded from the acting principal. We note that only slight damage was incurred.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 5th instant, approval has been granted for the expenditure required in the way of repairs to the building as a result of this fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The estimated cost is from ten to fifteen dollars. I have authorized the work to be done at once. The other repairs are to be held over until I can visit the school on the opening of navigation in the spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

W.H.L. West, reported that there is no immediate necessity for the work to be done at once and in view of the probability of the plaster being removed from all the walls in the interior of the school and replaced with beaver board as recommended by my letter of September 28th, 1926, (the damaged room is included in this plan) it was decided to hold over the repairs until I could visit the school on the opening of navigation.\n\nNo definite report has come to hand up to date from the Acting Principal regarding the extent of the damage done, apparently it is causing no inconvenience to the working of the school.\n\nIf the repairs are to be put in hand at once I would recommend that all the plaster be removed from the walls of the room in question and be replaced with beaver board. Repairs to the electric wires has been authorized, estimated cost $10.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

You were good enough to send me some fruit trees\u2014plums, pears, and cherries\u2014which have been especially successful. I was sent here last July and would like to try growing some fruit. I have noticed in the \"Montreal Star\" that some American apples and plums are grown in the province. Would you be able to assist your department help the school to the extent of sending\u2014say half a dozen of these trees. Last summer there was a very successful crop of potatoes, carrots, and mangolds.\n\nI am asking Alert Bay gardeners to help.\nTo send me some strawberries plants?

She states that last summer she had much success with the growing of small fruits and is anxious to try out the growing of larger fruits, such as those mentioned.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your opinion as to whether you consider that fruit trees of the type asked for would prove satisfactory in that locality, and, if so, if you could supply 6 Russian apple trees and 6 plum trees - the latter of a variety considered suitable - from one of the experimental farms. We will be pleased to pay any cost involved upon receipt of certified vouchers covering the charge therefor. If you can supply these trees, will you please arrange to have them shipped to Miss Neville, Indian Residential School, Carcross, Yukon.

This covers 4 days our electrician was away at the Choutla Indian School. At this time of year there are only two trains a week between Whitehorse and Carcross, and as the repairs could not be finished in time to catch the return train on Tuesday he was obliged to wait for the next train on the following Friday P.M.\n\nHe had to take the plant apart and found that the shunt field leads were interrupted, the wire had dropped down between the armature and field coils, and might have resulted in very serious damage to the plant. There was a report there that the late Principal had taken the machine apart, and in replacing it, it is presumed that this wire was not securely fastened.\n\nIt would be advisable to order and have on hand a resistance unit and some extra points; these would cost about two or three dollars.\n\nYours truly,\n\nYUKON ELECTRICAL CO.

Will the Department sanction the purchase of these articles?\n\nYour telegram ordering the repairs to be made stated that on receipt of the electricians report it would be determined who should pay the costs of the repairs.

Our Society purchased a horse last year to take the place of the one which died but the school management have informed our Commission that one horse cannot handle all the work at this institution and have pressed for a good heavy team and heavy harness to be supplied. The team and harness delivered at this school would probably cost, including freight about $350.00. The probable cost of a suitable boat or freighter canoe would not be less than $250.00 and it will be a very great help to our Society if your Department will undertake to furnish these two important items of equipment.

As I have not received any written communication from your Department authorizing an expenditure of money in connexion with these improvements, or setting forth the action you have taken towards having these supplied, I shall be obliged if you will kindly advise me of your wishes in this connexion.\n\nBelieve me Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nChocoutla Indian School,\nCarcross,Y.T.\nJune 22/37.\n\nRev. J. Hawksley,\nSup' of Indian Affairs,\nDawson,Y.T.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to draw your attention to a phase of the education given to the children of this school which used to be emphasized here but which of late years appears to have been more or less abandoned. I refer to the carpentry.\n\nMy special subject when teaching in white schools was manual training and I hold a certificate qualifying me to teach the same. In my opinion carpentry and forge work is a most valuable training for the Indian children and I am anxious to re-establish the work here.\n\nWe have a good shop with a number of tools for both branches of the work and we have been making use of them by starting a class on Friday afternoons. Not having any proper material we used gasoline cases and made some lockers for the use of the children in their dormitories. We are building a root cellar for storing our surplus of vegetables, and we have in view the building of an ice house and an addition to the chicken house, both to be built of logs, as a part of the training.\n\nWe are lacking a few tools and some material for small models and I should like you to give the matter consideration and if the department approve help us to re-establish this important aspect of our work. I am attaching a list of the requirements, and I sincerely hope the matter will meet with your approval and assistance.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nYUKON AGENCY\nJUL 8 1927\nDAWSON, - Y.T.\nSir:\n\nThe enclosed letter and requisition for tools and lumber from the principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School is forwarded for your consideration.\n\nI may add that during my recent visit to the school I saw six lockers made from gasoline cases by the pupils under the direction of the principal and was agreeably surprised at the neatness of the work.\n\nIt is proposed to make a locker for each pupil which will materially add to the neatness of the dormitories.\n\nThe Principal desires to have the pupils do some fret work during the winter months to fill up recreation hours to teach them the use of tools and neatness in their work.\n\nThe ideas of the principal are excellent, I have no hesitation in recommending his application to the Department.\n\nEnclos.2.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJohn Hawksley.\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

I regret that funds are not available for these improvements this year; but a note has been made for future estimates.\n\nI have also your letter of the 19th instant and, in reply, I beg to state that Mr. Indian Superintendent Hawksley has been authorized to paint the work shop and repair the root cellar underneath. He has been instructed, also, to carry out the repairs required at the septic tank. He is to forward a recommendation regarding the supplying of better board for all the rooms in the main building that are not finished with the materials. He is also indicating the exact size of the beds in use at the school, so that suitable pallasses can be purchased. Some time ago he was authorized to purchase the materials required to make up the screens that are to be placed on the building.\n\nI may say that I have received a letter from Mr. Hawksley today, asking that certain tools and dressed lumber be provided for the use of the manual training classes at the Carcross Indian Residential School. He is being authorized to supply these.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C.

Since writing to you on the 18th instant Bishop Stringer of the Yukon Diocese has informed me that he purchased a launch which is about 22 ft. long for the use of his missionary at Carmacks and Little Salmon and brought it as far as the Carcross School. He states that it is a good ocean and lake launch with awnings and everything complete. The hull was declared by an expert to be perfectly sound. It is four horse power, four cycle engine Bosthope and seems very suitable for the use of the Carcross School. As the Bishop has decided not to carry out his original intention of taking the launch through Carmacks he states that it is being offered for sale at $550 but that he will sell it to the school at a reduction of 10 per cent or for the sum of $495.\n\nI noted from your letter of July 26 as stated above that the canoe which I estimated in my letter of July 18th would cost about $250 cannot be granted this year, and I write to ascertain if your Department would authorize our Society to purchase this launch at the present time on the understanding that if you were unable to meet the cost this year out of your appropriation for this institution, that provision would be made in the estimates of next year to reimburse our Society by this amount namely $495. I am directing your attention to this matter as I am of the opinion that...\nwhat Bishop Stringer has written that it will not be possible to secure a more suitable and serviceable launch for this school at so moderate an outlay.\n\nBelieve me,\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo regarding the advisability of providing a launch for the use of the Carcross Indian Residential School. I have struck out the item in connection with the freight canoe and have noted the launch for next year's estimates. If you consider it necessary, the purchase should be made, and when you are presenting your requests for the coming year the receipt for your expenditure of $495 should be forwarded to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated July 5th, file No 166-1-5 in which you inform me that funds are available for certain repairs at the Carcross Indian Residential School and authorizing the necessary arrangements to be made for the painting the exterior of the workshop, repairing the root cellar underneath the shop and repairs to the septic tank.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that steps have been taken towards carrying out the above mentioned repairs.\n\nRegarding the supplying of beaver board for all the rooms in the main building that are not finished in this manner, I have arranged for measurements to be taken of all the walls that need to be treated and am making enquiries of local dealers whether they are prepared to supply the quantity required and the price per foot both of beaver board and the strapping for finishing purposes. This information will be forwarded to you as soon as it comes to hand.\n\nThe removal of the plaster from the walls of the rooms and corridors not finished with beaver board and replacing it with beaver board is, in my opinion, one of the most urgent repairs needed.\n\nReplying to your question regarding the size of the beds now in use in the dormitories they are 6 feet 6 inches long by 3 feet wide.\n\nDuring my recent visit to the school the Rev principal showed me a new root cellar that is being constructed. A tunnel is being made into the bank at the back of the workshop and lined with logs, a square room is to be made at the end of the tunnel also to be lined with logs in which the roots are to be stored. He thinks that the roots will keep better in such a place rather than in the cellar under the workshop. The work on the new root house was well advanced and is being carried out by the Principal and his assistant with the help of some of the elder boy pupils.\n\nSince they now have electrical power at the school may I suggest that, if it is possible, an electrical washing machine\nwringer attached, be supplied. An ordinary domestic sized washer would not be large enough. The kind of machine required would be what is known as \"Hotel size\", the cost would be between $350.00 and $400.00.\n\nThe installation of an electric pump at an approximate cost of $125.00, is badly needed. The labour of pumping all the water required for the institution by hand is heavy and takes up considerable time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 12, 1927.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI should be grateful if you would ship to the Indian Residential School, Carcross, Yukon, freight prepaid, 40 mattress casings, made up in your Grade S.M. ticking, blue and white stripes, sized suitable for beds 6'6\" x 3'. Your account, in triplicate, with freight receipt attached, should be forwarded to John Hawksley, Esq., Indian Superintendent, Dawson, Yukon, who, when the goods have been received at the school, will certify to the account and forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nSimmons Ltd.\n400 St. Ambroise St.,\nMontreal, P.Q.\nOttawa, August 12, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 2335-5 of the 22nd ultimo, reporting on the improvements at the Carcross Indian Residential School. I note that at a later date you will let me have information regarding the beaver board required.\n\nI am today placing an order with Simmons, Ltd., Montreal, for 40 mattress casings, which will be suitable for the beds at the school. These are being shipped freight prepaid to the school, and the account, in triplicate, will be forwarded to you, together with freight receipt attached.\n\nYou speak of electrical power at the school and the possible use of an electric washer and pump. If you are referring to the Delco lighting plant which generates electricity for lighting the institution, I have to request that you will see that no machinery is run by it. Our experience at Indian residential schools, where they generate their own light, has made it necessary for us to forbid the attachment of any electrical appliances whatsoever.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Yukon.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of July 5th, file No 166-1-5, regarding certain repairs at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to submit the following information. The painting of the workshop and the outside toilets with two coats of paint and staining the shingle roofs of the same will cost $200.00. This work has been put in hand.\n\nRegarding the beaver board, which the carpenter is willing to supply, 16,500 square feet of beaver board and 14,000 feet of strapping is required for all the rooms in the main building that are not finished in this manner. The cost would be $8 and 4/5 cents per square foot for the beaver board and 3\u00bd cents per foot for the strapping, and the estimated cost of removing the plaster and putting on the beaver board would be about $100.00 per thousand feet, this does not include painting, staining or calomining.\n\nIf the Department decide to carry out this work will you please be good enough to notify me by wire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 22, 1927.\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Yukon.\n\nReference your letter sixth instant I regret there are no funds for beaver board improvement Carcross Indian residential School.\n\nJ.

The Principal has been notified of the Department's policy in this matter.\n\nRegarding the 40 mattress cases which were ordered to be shipped to the school and the invoices sent to Dawson, the invoices and the Bill of Lading have come to hand; it is evident from the latter that the goods have been shipped to Dawson they will have to be reshipped from there to the school, apparently the shippers have misunderstood their instructions.

CARGO33\n\n(a) Two storey annex to rear side of main building, the upper storey to be used as chapel and assembly room, and the lower storey as a laundry. At present this school has no chapel, no special laundry room or modern laundry equipment, and no recreation rooms. Where the winters are so long all of these are very necessary. A room in the basement has to serve as laundry and Boys' recreation room. The girls use the sewing room as a recreation room. Estimated cost $10,000.\n\n(b) Battleship linoleum for corridors. (This will save a bigger expense for wood floors later on). Est cost $350.\n\n(c) Beaver board for all rooms in main school building not yet completed in this way. Estimated cost $500.\n\n(d) A motor launch (see Departmental letter Aug. 3rd, 1927, 165-1-5). Estimated cost $500.\n\n(e) Change in water pumping system. The Principal states in this connection that the hand pump is extremely hard work and much too heavy for any of the boys at the school, with a result that the Principal himself and the General Assistant have to help with the pumping. The capacity of the tank is also inadequate and should be enlarged. Estimated cost $800.\n\n(f) A cold storage room for meat and fish in summer. Estimated cost $500.\n\n(g) One strong team of horses $300.\n\nTotal estimated cost $12,950.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nTAGISH FUR RANCH\n\nCarcross, Yukon, Ty.\n\nCanada, Nov. 14th 1927\n\nMr. Tinney,\nPrincipal,\nChocoutas Indian School,\nCarcross, N.W.T.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn regard to that Kermath engine and Turner boat we were speaking of, exactly the same as mine the one you were looking at, I can deliver same to you for $485.00 installed and fully equipped for running. This is about as near as I can figure toward the actual cost and will include 18 ft. Turner boat 6 foot beam 10 gallon tank, 3 H.P. Kermath engine equipped with Jose reverse gear.\n\nIf you are satisfied to have this boat and engine kindly let me hear from you and I will order immediately as both the Turner people and the Kermath Company are rushed towards spring and if you order early there will be no delay and you will have your boat in running order as soon as there is open water.\n\nI expected to get in to see you but this sudden cold spell has tied us in here for the winter as far as boating is concerned.\n\nThanking you for an early reply, I am,\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) Alfred Dickson.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: FREIGHT CANOE FOR THE CARCROSS SCHOOL\n\nWith further reference to your letter of August 3rd 1927, No. 166-1-5 relative to the purchase of a freight canoe for the Carcross Indian Residential School, I beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter embodying a quotation in this connection recently received through the Rev. W. Tinney, Acting Principal of this institution, and will be glad to have your decision in connection with the same.\n\nIn his covering letter, Mr. Tinney writes in part, as follows:\n\n\"The three horse power engine and eighteen foot boat will suit us. I am of the opinion, however, that you might get a special rate from the Kermath Co. who have an agency in Winnipeg and Turner of Vancouver would probably instal the engine and supply the boat with a reduction in our case. Should you be able to get that advantage I would suggest that you supply a 4-5 H.P. engine in the place of the 3 H.P. The same boat carries it quite easily.\n\nIt is advisable to have Turner instal the engine in Vancouver, although there is a much lower freight rate on the boat and engine shipped separately. It would cost more than the saving in freight expenses for installation charges here.\"\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 4)\nI commend the question of the purchase of this boat and the four or five H.P. engine, to your earliest and sympathetic consideration and, remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTBRW/EM\n\nFIELD SECRETARY, M.S.C.C.\n\nENCLOSURE 1\nJanuary 18, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nFor some time the church authorities have been requesting a freight canoe or small launch for the use of the Carcross Indian Residential School. There is an item of $500 in this connection in the Main Estimates for the coming fiscal year. Dr. Westgate has now written, urging that steps to supply this equipment be taken without delay, so that the boat will be ready as soon as the water is open. There is a definite offer on a boat, of $488, delivered to the school. Dr. Westgate thinks a larger engine than the one quoted on would be advisable.\n\nI wish to recommend that Dr. Westgate be authorized to make whatever arrangements he considers wise and to forward his receipt in duplicate, when the Department will make reimbursement to the extent of $500. By the time the receipts are to hand, the new Vote will probably be available.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDpt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, January 19, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to a small launch for the Carcross Indian Residential School.

The bearing came off while the engine was running during prayers one evening and of course the weight of the main shaft smashed the connecting rod and piston through the crank case and scored the shaft rendering it useless for further service.\n\nWe have an overdraft at the bank to cover the bill in the meantime so shall be glad if you can refund the amount as soon as possible.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nYUKON AGENCY\nJAN 11 1923\nDAWSON, - Y.T.\nDawson,Y.T.January 11th,1928.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith vouchers forwarded by the Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School, for spare parts with which to repair the damage to the lighting plant at the school and a copy of his letter.\n\nThe purchase of this material was authorized by telegram from the Department dated October 14th,1927, which also stated that when the accounts were received payment would receive consideration.\n\nIt has been suggested to the Principal that a careful examination of the engine be made from time to time for the purpose of detecting any parts that may be showing signs of wear and thus possibly avoid any serious damage.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley.\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.McLean,Esq.\nAsst Deputy and Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.Ont.\nThe Chooutla Indian Residential School,\nCarcross,Y.T.\nDecember 27/27.\n\nThe Rev.J.Hawksley,\nSupt.of Indian Affairs,\nDawson,Y.T.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report that the water pump for the main building is in such a state of repair that it can no longer be depended upon for any length of time. As you are aware it has been a constant source of trouble and expense since its installation. Since my appointment I have done all that is in my power to keep it together. We have employed whatever local help is available at no little expense to the school. The washers have been renewed, the stuffing box repacked time and time again, not only by ourselves but by those employed recently by you to overhaul the plumbing. In spite of all efforts the basement is continually flooded and the pump seldom in use for twenty-four hours continuously without giving trouble.\n\nThe worst feature of the difficulty is the labor required to fill the tank with water. It is exhausting work for all the bigger boys, the general assistant and myself, three or four times a day to keep just sufficient water in the tank to keep the building going. At times we are compelled to raise water from the well by hand to fill the boiler. There is no little risk incurred as the sanitation, heating and fire equipment depend upon the water supply.\n\nIn putting in new equipment I beg to suggest once more that there appears to me to be only one solution of the difficulty that is, to enlarge the present well-house and install a gas engine, pump jack and compression tank.\n\nI would earnestly suggest that you give the matter your immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nYUKON AGENCY\nJAN 11 1928\nDAWSON, Y.T.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDawson, Y.T. January 12th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nThe enclosed report from the Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School on the pumping plant at the school came to hand yesterday. It contains an accurate description of the trouble and expense this part of the equipment has constantly been.\n\nIt is earnestly hoped the Department will give early consideration to the contents of the report and, if at all possible, authorize some action to be taken to remedy this trouble. It may not be necessary to enlarge the well house but it does appear absolutely necessary that some better equipment be provided for supplying the institution with water. The well always contains a good supply, it is the distribution of it through the school that calls for improvement, at present this is done by one small hand pump.\n\nYours,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 9th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School on the pumping plant, and stating the new equipment required to give satisfactory service.\n\nBefore the Department can consider this matter, it will be necessary for the Principal to furnish full particulars regarding the horse power and type of gas engine required, also particulars regarding the pump jack and the size of the compression tank. He should also state the approximate cost of having this equipment delivered at the school and the approximate cost of having the work of installing same carried out. When we have this information, consideration will then be given as to whether or not we can provide the funds required for the purpose. We note that you do not consider it necessary to enlarge the present well house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

E. French, Whitehorse, for the painting of the workshop and staining of the roofs at the Carcross Indian Residential School, to the amount of $200, also an account covering the labour and materials in repairing the foundation of the workshop, root house, etc., to the amount of $189.55. A cheque in payment of these accounts is being sent to J. E. French. It will be necessary, however, for you to obtain from the Principal the original copy of the contract made with J. E. French for the painting of the workshop and the staining of the roofs, etc., as the auditor general will require this in connection with the payment of the accounts. I shall be pleased if you will give this matter your prompt attention and forward the contract which the Principal received from Mr. French for carrying out the work mentioned above.\n\nI may also add for your information that the accounts which you forwarded covering the cost of the material and the freight charges thereon for the repairs to the Delco light plant have been received, and a cheque in payment is being sent to the Principal. The explanation of the Principal as to how the damage occurred to the lighting plant is noted. It is thought, however, that if proper attention had been given on the part of the staff, and a careful examination made of the engine from time to time, they would have detected the wearing of the cotter pin on the main bearing and thereby prevented the damage that occurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have sent copies of account to Mr. Tinney for his o.k but as the stage leaves in the morning and you may want the claim as soon as possible am also forwarding to you direct.\n\nMr. Gray had to take the Delco plant apart and thoroughly overhaul it; he found the main trouble in a soft roller bearing, which had been made in Skagway. It is now in first class running order again and he says as good as new.\n\nI understand that some one had been working on it last summer, and shortly after the crank case, main shaft and piston head were broken and repair parts to these had to be sent in from the factory. It is unfortunate that the breakdown always occurs in the winter when there are only two trains a week between here and Carcross, but as Mr. Tinney, who is capable, will look after the plant in the future, there should be little further trouble.\n\nThe batteries should be refilled, requiring about 16 quarts of sulphuric acid and the following repair parts should be kept on hand - 1 roller bearing, contact points for starter switch and parts for distributor.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 4)\nDawson, Y.T., January 24th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith an account from the Yukon Electrical Co of Whitehorse, with a copy of letter from the Manager, for repairs to the Delco lighting plant at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nSpare parts were purchased from Vancouver for the engine and the repairs were made by the principal to the best of his ability but they could not get any light. On receipt of a wire from the principal, which stated that they had been without light for a month, authority was given to have an electrician examine the plant; the result is contained in the accompanying letter.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 4)\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of 14th inst. as to general welfare.\n\nYou will have received a medical report on the last inspection of Dr Elvin. We are very pleased to be able to say that the general health of the pupils is very satisfactory. With the exception of Walter and Anna we have practically a clean bill of health. In connection with the last two named we are grateful to be able to say that there is a decided improvement. There is every prospect at the present time that they will both outgrow the chronic gland condition. Both are happy and in a good state of nutrition.\n\nWith reference to the staff we are sorry to report that Miss Winterburn's health necessitated her immediate return to her home and her brother took care of her on the journey. We are therefore a little handicapped at present but we are expecting their places to be filled very soon.\n\nIn regard to the condition to the school plant there is a great deal of improvement required. We have nearly completed the repairs to the storm sashes. Materials have cost in the neighbourhood of one hundred dollars. Many of the sashes were completely smashed, a number of them were being used at the cottage. I have had them all replaced which leaves the cottage without sashes. The materials for the screens are on hand and we have made enough screens for the ground floor in two carpentry classes.\n\nThese ground floor screens are whole screens of $2\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1$ in fir with lath over the wire and brazed at the corners with triangles of tin over the half lap joints.\n\nThe pump has been out of condition for some time; it has become necessary to have all the holes re-tapped and new pins made. Matthew Watson has sent the whole thing to Whitehorse to get it fixed and the cost will be included in his account for repairs to the plumbing. We have worked at it constantly in the nine months I have been here and I feel that no further time can be wasted upon it.\n\nWe have been expecting the electrician from Whitehorse to inspect the Delco Engine. He will probably be here shortly.\nJ.E. French has not yet made the repairs to the hospital ward but we expect him very soon.\n\nThe repairs to the root cellar are very satisfactory. It is not necessary to keep a fire in the shop in fact we have had no fire there this winter so far except for the carpentry classes. A coal oil lantern is all that is necessary in the cellar to keep the temperature around 35 degrees. I am now assured of our experiment with the proposed new root pit.\n\nYou will be interested to know that we have five fine dogs which we expect to break to harness this winter.\n\nOur Christmas time was a very happy one for all. The pupils put on an excellent programme and carried it through in a very remarkable way. Nearly all the people from Carcross were at the school and expressed their surprise at the performance and the talent and delivery of the children. On Christmas Eve the school went in a body to the Indian village and sang Christmas Hymns and Carols. The surprise and pleasure of the Indians was very evident.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n(Signed) W. Tinney.\n\nprincipal.\nDawson, Y.T.

It is located outside of the school grounds.\n\nIt would appear evident, judging from what is said of the storm sashes that due care has not been exercised in stowing these away when taken off in spring.\n\nTaking the report as a whole it may be said that it is satisfactory.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

At the time it was decided to postpone the work until I visited the school the following June. The work was then placed in the hands of J.E.French.\n\nOwing to the beaver board not being standard size, that was required, it had to be specially made, hence the delay in carrying out the repairs.

Self Oiling Typhon Pump mounted on cast iron bed plate and geared to a 2 H.P. type \"Z\" magneto engine, the pump and engine being mounted side by side.

Water is supplied through the institution from a lead lined gravity tank, capacity 400 gallons, located in the attic. The need is a power pump to keep this tank full, the style and size of pump herewith submitted would fully meet the need.\n\nThe description of the suggested pump is taken from Bulletin H-400-A of the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Co., a copy of which may be obtained from their Ottawa Branch.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

Tinney, Acting Principal of our Society's School in the Yukon, has forwarded to me copies of the correspondence which has taken place between himself and your representative Mr. Hawksley at Dawson City, relative to the installation of a pump and water tank at this institution. I note from this correspondence that Mr. Hawksley has suggested to your Department the installation of a Fairbanks-Morse pump and engine, but no mention is made of the tank which the Acting Principal considers absolutely necessary. The existing tank has a capacity of only 350 gallons, and this is utterly inadequate either to meet the School's daily need, or as a protection against fire. The Acting Principal suggests that a tank with a capacity of not less than 1000 gallons should be installed, with a pump and engine to fill it, and I wish very strongly to commend this important matter to your prompt and sympathetic consideration.\n\nIn the list of requirements submitted by our Society to your Department for inclusion in the Departmental estimates for the current year, these items were mentioned in connection with the Carcross School on page 4, sub-section (6), and in view of the vital necessity of eliminating, so far as possible, every danger from fire, I greatly hope that a sufficient appropriation is available to provide these three very necessary items of equipment.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 4)\nOttawa, May 10, 1928.\n\nRev.

In this connection I would refer you to your letter of March 15th, last, relative to the supplying of a self-oiling typhon pump, in which you stated that a compression tank is not required, as the water is supplied through the institution from a lead lined gravity tank located in the attic, and that all that is required is a power pump to keep this tank full.\n\nI shall be pleased to have an early report from you as to the necessity for the installing of a tank of a larger capacity as requested by the Acting Principal in his letter to Dr. Westgate.

W. Tinney, Acting Principal of our Society's Indian Residential School at Carcross, has directed the attention of our Commission to the necessity of repairs to the interior walls of this institution, and I beg to submit the same to your Department for your sympathetic consideration. Mr. Tinney's letter reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The building is seventeen years old, and in need of repairs to the interior finishing. The plaster is coming off throughout the building. We have attempted to repair the broken places with new plaster but it is beyond patching. In some cases a whole wall is loose, in others there are holes two or three feet in length. The staff sitting room has been patched, but does not hold. The halls have large places where the lath is bare. The basement is perhaps the worst. The laundry and furnace room are in very bad condition and is a very depressing place.\n\nI believe it is the intention of Mr. Hawksley to have the plaster taken off and beaver board put in its place. That has been done in the large dormitories and the hospital room.\n\nWe should like to request that application be made for a special grant for this purpose. We consider that at least the halls, sitting rooms and office, those places that are most public ought to be done at once. There are four or five rooms which could stand over another year if sufficient funds are not available for the whole thing.\"\nIn the light of the above information it is obvious that an effort should be put forth immediately to effect the improvements suggested.\n\nIn the list of requirements submitted by our Society to your Department last autumn, beaver board for all rooms in the main school building which had not yet been repaired in this way, was included, and it would be a great comfort and encouragement to the Principal and his staff, as well as to the children in the school, to have the loose plaster removed and the beaver board installed instead.\n\nIn the same list of requirements, a two storey annex to the rear side of the main building was also included, and steps should be taken to have this provided at the earliest date possible, as the building as it stands at present has no chapel, no special laundry-room or modern laundry equipment, and no recreation rooms.\n\nI commend these requirements to your sympathetic consideration and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, May 25, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 2335-5's of August 6th last and February 29th of this year, which have reference to replacing the loose plaster with beaver board at the Carcross Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that $600 is available to continue this improvement. You may make the most economical arrangements you can to have those portions of the building in most urgent need of improvements properly finished with beaver board. When the work has been satisfactorily completed, you should forward a certified account, in duplicate, to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y. T.\nOttawa, May 25, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to replacements to the interior finish of the Carcross Indian Residential School.

The screens have been made by the carpentry class during the winter and are now ready for use.\n\nReferring to the account for piping and other fittings for the bath rooms. When I was at the school last September it was noted that the waste water from the bath rooms was running down the walls of the office and the hospital ward, the latter was on the point of being beaver boarded to repair the damage caused by the fire, before putting on the beaver board it was imperative that the leakage in the bath rooms should be stopped. An effort was made to clear the waste pipes but they were difficult to get at being embedded in the walls. It was decided that the only sure remedy was to put in new piping with the plumbing exposed and easy of access in case of future stoppage and thus prevent damage to the walls of the lower rooms.\n\nIt was necessary to put the work in hand at once therefore I ordered the work to be done which I hope will meet with the approval of the Department. Watson has been very dilatory about sending his account, it should have been here long before.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

He also refers to the ample supply of water in the well. The ample supply of water, however, and the direct hose connection will avail but little in time of an emergency without a sufficiently powerful engine to apply them. With a sufficiently powerful engine, and a sufficiently large water tank, however, the School Management and the pupils will feel a sense of security which they do not at present enjoy, and our Commission hope that your Department may be able to supply these this summer.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\nDawson,Y.T.July 13th,1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of letter dated June 13th, file No 166-1-5, authorizing the purchase of three new flushing tanks for the toilets in the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in accordance with your instructions the order has been placed with the Dawson Hardware Co for the delivery of three copper lined tanks, oak finished, freight prepaid to Carcross railway station at $20.00 each, total $60.00.\n\nUpon arrival of the tanks steps will be taken at once to have them properly installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

May I therefore suggest that a new floor be laid on the top of the old one, the material used to consist of 1 x 4 B.C red fir, grooved and tongued. The estimated cost for material and labor would not exceed $115.00 complete.\n\nIf the Department decide to have this work done an early reply to this letter would enable us to arrange for it being carried out while the carpenter is at the school doing the beaver board repairs already authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.D.

You may arrange for the purchase of the quantity of flooring required, and the total cost of the material and labour should not exceed your estimate of $115.00 complete.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and for any labour required in laying the floor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

Sec.-Treas. of our Commission, has recently visited our Society's Indian Residential School at Carcross, and reports that the Principal's residence, which stands about 100 yards away from the main school building, is greatly in need of storm windows. When passing through Vancouver on the return journey he secured a quotation for the windows required, from Messrs. Dixon and Murray, Ltd. of that city, and a copy of this you will please find enclosed herewith, amounting to $40.70 not including freight. It will be a help to our Society, and a great comfort to the Principal and his family if your Department will authorize the provision of these windows, and I shall be obliged if you will kindly notify me to that effect. I am unable to give you an estimate of the cost of the freight, as this is charged, I believe, according to bulk instead of according weight, but it should not exceed $25.00 if it amounts to so much.\n\nThanking you in advance for your sympathetic consideration of this request,\n\nI remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of our Society's Indian Residential School at Carcross, has made known to our Commission his urgent need of a light wagon, and I regret to have to state that owing to the heavy operating costs of this institution, our Commission are unable to provide it. The per capita earnings for last year at the $250. rate amounted to $8,131.87, while the expenditure amounted to $9,415.80 or an average cost of $289. per pupil.\n\nIn carrying out the instructions of our Commission, I directed the attention of the Superintendent of Indian Education to their need during his recent visit to Winnipeg, and was advised by him to submit a statement of this need to your Department.\n\nI may also state that a wagon of the type required can be purchased in Winnipeg for $65. To this must be added the freighting charges to Carcross which it is estimated would amount to approximately $50.\n\nIf your Department can come to the assistance of our Society in meeting this need, I shall be deeply obliged.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.\nOttawa, August 18th, 1926.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the providing of storm windows for the Principal's residence, and enclosing copy of a quotation received for supplying same.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure of approximately $40.70 in the purchase of the windows required, and also for the cost of freighting them to the school, viz. $25. An account covering the cost of the windows and a receipt for the freight charges should be forwarded, in duplicate, properly certified by you.\n\nI have also your letter of the same date which has reference to a light wagon for this school. I may say that the appropriation for improvements at Carcross is now entirely assigned. If it is your intention to purchase the launch - authority for the Department's share of which was directed to you under cover of January 19th - there will be no further funds for improvements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He states that the present roof is patched in places, and in other places the rubberoid is completely worn off. The whole roof is in a bad state of repair.\n\n(b) an airtight heater for the Principal's residence. He states that there is only one in use at present and this is altogether inadequate to heat the entire building.\n\n(c) beaver or wall board for two of the rooms at the Principal's residence, and V-joint lumber for the ceilings. He states that if the material is supplied the School Management will do the work.\n\n(d) In addition to the above he recommends that more land be broken to enable the School Management to reduce the cost of operating this School by growing more vegetables, green feed, etc. Hay, at present, costs $50.00 a ton if bought, and the nearest hay land is 15 miles away. Major Mermagen estimates that a grant of $200.00 for breaking would be sufficient, and that a grant of $400.00 would provide the improvements mentioned above in Sections a, b, &c.\nand I shall be very glad if your Department can authorize this expenditure.\n\nAs the sum of $2000.00 was set apart for improvements at the Hay River School this year, and as the whole of this amount will not be used, seeing that the Hospital so urgently needed cannot now be sent, it seems to me that sufficient money could be made available from this source to provide the improvements so urgently needed at the Carcross School.\n\nI commend this request to your sympathetic consideration, and beg to add that I discussed the need in question with the Deputy Superintendent General during his recent visit to Winnipeg, and am presenting this statement in fulfilment of a promise made to him at that time.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, September 5, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to enclose, for your information, copy of my letter of today's date to Dr. Westgate, which has reference to improvements at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In view of the fact that the sum available for the infirmary wing at the Hay River institution will not be expended this year, I am pleased to authorize you to arrange for a new rubberoid roof for the principal's residence, a new heater, wall board and V-joint lumber for two rooms in the same building. Your estimate of $400 in this connection should not be exceeded. You may also expend the sum of $200 for breaking more land at the school.

The furnace room has a dry floor for the first time since my arrival. The old pump has been removed, the old well filled and the ceiling in the furnace room kalsomined, making the place much lighter and cleaner.\n\nWe had a hydrant valve put in the boiler room and hose attached in place of the cap on the discharge pipe of the old pump.\n\nThe new pump fills the tank in about 10 minutes and I assure you the boys are relieved of a great burden.\n\nThe item labor appears large but you will realize that a new overflow had to be put in, returning to the well, so that we dispense with the old \"Tally\". No new two inch pipe was required and a good many fittings were provided from the school stock. The cement base was made by myself and a supply of water to the hopper provided by a quarter inch pipe and valve from the cylinder head of the pump.\n\nThe old printing gear has been removed to Whitehorse so that we shall now have an engine room free from useless obstructions.\n\nI should be glad if you would sanction the purchase of cement and traps for the sewers as soon as you can. The work will be done by the school and the expense small.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) W. Tinney,\nPrincipal.\nDawson, Y.T., December 12th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith an account from Matthew Watson of Carcross for material and labor in connection with the installation of the new pump at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nAttached to the account is a copy of the letter from the principal detailing the circumstances, the work cost more than was expected.\n\nReferring to the room spoken of as the engine room, it was used as the printing shop; the printing plant has been moved to Whitehorse, the engine and batteries of the electric lighting plant is installed there and it was decided to put the pumping plant in the same place; the door is kept locked to prevent the pupils from interfering with the engines. The old well mentioned has been dry for some time and is quite useless.\n\nThe account is receipted by Matthew Watson but no payment has been made to him.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

CARCROSS\n\n(a) Two storey annex to rear side of main building, the upper storey to be used as chapel and assembly room, and the lower storey as a laundry. At present this school has no chapel, no special laundry room or modern laundry equipment, and no recreation rooms. Where the winters are so long all of these are very necessary. A room in the basement has to serve as laundry and Boys' recreation room. The girls use the sewing room as a recreation room. Estimated cost $10,000.\n\n(b) A cold storage room for meat and fish in summer. Estimated cost $500.\n\n(c) Chicken house. Estimated cost $300.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to direct your attention to the condition of the lighting system at our Carcross School. In a letter just received from the Acting Principal, the Rev. W. Tinney, he writes, in part, in this connection, as follows:-\n\n\"The plant was installed early in 1924 in the boiler room next to the old pump. A local firm had the contract. I am of the opinion that the battery would not have stood inspection at the time of installation. The Bruce Robinson Co., Vancouver, informed me that they supplied the engine but not the battery. The plant was moved to the print shop where greater care could be given. The anchor bolts were placed in the thin shell of cement of which the floor is made instead of in a substantial concrete block some inches above the level of the floor. In March 1927 the engine was in a bad state of repair partly as a result of vibration, and the battery seriously depleted as a result of irregular and improper charging.\n\nSince that time the engine has been put on a new base and all the damaged parts replaced with the exception of the cylinder block. We have oversized rings on hand to put in but a new block will have to be got sometime. The engine however is now in pretty good repair and has been running without trouble all the winter except for fouling caused by worn cylinder oil pumping. The Indian Dept. has supplied the major repairs, crank-case, piston crank-shaft etc. amounting to approximately $200.00.\n\nThe battery on the other hand is beyond repair. It is composed of 56 thirteen plate cells. The positive element is disintegrated, completely filling the sediment spaces thereby...\"\nshort circuiting the plates. Such condition means a complete new set of plates and refill of electrolyte. In most cases the plates are fallen apart. There is only one cell of the required specific gravity, the others will no longer respond to charging.\n\nWe require a new set of 56 K.X.G. 13 plate cells, 160 ampere hour, and a refill of electrolyte. The cells should be assembled with posts and straps and the electrolyte to the required specific gravity of 1280. The work can be done by the staff. I have no price list on hand but it will probably cost $500.00. The glass jars are in good repair. The Bruce Robinson Electric Co., Vancouver, are the nearest agents.\"\n\nAs it is obvious from the above that batteries are required, I shall be obliged if you will either place an order for the same, or authorize me to do so.\n\nYour prompt attention to this important matter will be deeply appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nDICATED BUT NOT PERSONALLY SIGNED BECAUSE OF ABSENCE FROM THE OFFICE\nOTTAWA.\nFeb. 28, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th ultimo regarding the lighting system at the Carcross School, I beg to say that the Department approves of the purchase of new plates for the battery at this School. You may place the order and arrange for immediate delivery.\n\nThe accounts should be forwarded to the Department in duplicate after they are certified to by the Principal of the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

May 11, 1929\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 28th last, #166-1-5, and your telegram of March 13th authorizing the purchase of new batteries for the lighting plant of our Society's School at Carcross, I beg to submit herewith the following bills from the Bruce-Robinson Electric Ltd., Vancouver, B.C., in connection with the same:\n\n(1) Invoice #7196 for $962.50\n(2) Invoice #7308 for $111.78\n(3) Freight bill of prepaid charges in connection with item (2) above.\n\nWhen placing the order for the batteries, I instructed the Bruce Robinson Electric Ltd. to furnish the Principal with their bill in triplicate, in order that he might certify the same, and return to me for presentation to your Department for payment. I have received, however, only one certified copy of each bill from the Principal, and to these I have attached two copies which I myself have certified and trust that this action may meet the requirements of your Department. Should such not be the case, I shall be obliged if you will take the matter up with the Bruce Robinson Electric Ltd. direct.\n\nThanking you on behalf of our Commission for the provision of this very necessary item of equipment.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn a letter dated April 30th, the Principal of our Society's Indian Residential School at Carcross, Yukon, directs my attention to the very urgent need of \"a laundry and equipment and of a bath and bathroom for the use of the staff\". For the year 1927, 1928 and 1929, a two storey annex to the main building to serve as chapel and assembly room and laundry has been included in the list of requirements which your Department was asked to furnish, but up to date this very necessary accommodation has not been provided.\n\nDuring the recent visit of the Supt. of Indian Education to Winnipeg, I discussed this matter with him, and he agreed that careful consideration would be given to this matter in the preparation of the estimates for 1930. The situation, however, at present is so unsatisfactory that the Principal has informed our Commission that if they are to retain the services of the splendid staff agents they have at present, some immediate remedial action must be taken, and I was instructed to lay the situation before you, and ask if you would authorize our Commission to provide a bathroom and bath for the staff and some light laundry equipment such as hand-worked washing machines and wringers, or if you would arrange to have this equipment provided through your representative at Dawson. I may state for your information that during the interview referred to above, the Supt. of Indian Education expressed the opinion that some light laundry equipment might be provided to help the staff in the management of the School until the permanent improvement which the annex would furnish had been supplied. I shall be glad to know, therefore, what help you may be able to render in this important matter. The need, which has been very urgent for some time, has recently been intensified through the outbreak of illness at the School when three pupils fell seriously ill with what the Doctor at White Horse has diagnosed as septic pneumonia. All three pupils were taken to the hospital at White Horse.\nwhere one of them - Martha McLeod, has since passed away. At the time of writing the Principal states that small hope was entertained for the recovery of the two others.\n\nIn addition to this very sad and very serious matter, the Principal states that there were 62 cases of measles in White Horse, and although the town was under quarantine, the disease was spreading, and they feared it might reach the School at Carcross. For these reasons you will see the urgent necessity of giving our School management at this centre the best accommodation and facilities possible under the circumstances, and I beg to strongly recommend that action be taken with the least possible delay to provide the bathroom and bath for the staff and such laundry equipment as will enable the School management to carry on their work until permanent and fully modern laundry equipment can be supplied.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nAllow $1.00 for Bathroom bath\n& $.75 for hand washing machine\n\nLet church buy.\n\nB.P.O.\nOttawa, June 1st, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, relative to the need of laundry equipment, also a bathroom and bath for the use of the staff, at the Carcross Indian Residential School. In this connection I beg to say that the Department will allow an amount not exceeding $100.00 towards the cost of providing a bathroom and bath for the staff and $75.00 for hand washing machines. You should arrange for the purchase of this equipment and forward accounts in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure.\n\nThe Department has noted with regret the outbreak of illness at this school and the death of one of the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Department have already authorized the installation of a bath for the use of the staff agents, and I will place an order for this, along with the necessary connexion pipes, when I reach Vancouver about the beginning of December.\n\nI find also that the taps in the pupils' wash-rooms, also a few others, are worn out and must be replaced at once to prevent the heavy leakage, and so reduce the consumption of gasoline for pumping. New washers alone will not meet the case. I am undertaking to order these also in Vancouver, as they are not obtainable in Whitehorse, and I trust you may see your way clear to support my request that the Department meet the cost of the same.\n\nI understand from the Principal that you undertook to send new radiator valves. These have not yet come to hand, and as they are much needed I hope you may be able to send them at an early date.\n\nSeveral T joints are required for the radiators which have corroded right through the metal in different places, and are leaking badly. I will order these in Vancouver and ask the Department to meet the cost of the same. The corrosion is undoubtedly due to the action of the well water. To prevent a recurrence of this difficulty I am asking the Department to arrange for the water from the mountain-stream near by to be piped to the school, and also to the Principal's residence. Should they agree to this, the radiators in the school may last for a few years longer. Failing this, it seems to me that it will not be long before complete new heating and water systems will be required.\n\nThe chief need of this school is, I consider, modern laundry facilities, and our Commission have included in their list of quitements, to be included in the Departmental estimates for next year, an annex to the main school building which will provide a laundry in the basement, and a chapel or assembly room above it. The lack of a recreation room for the boys is a serious handicap to the school management in many ways, and the provision of the additional space suggested and requested would overcome this. I trust this matter may have your hearty support.\n\nA boat-house, an ice-house, and an implement shed, are also required. I am securing an estimate of the cost of these from a local contractor, and will submit the same to the Department for their consideration.\nThe question of shortening the road from the school to the town of Carcross, has also been receiving my attention, and I am submitting to the Department estimates for providing a bridge across the arm of the lake in front of the school, or, as an alternative, the cutting of a road around the foot of the hill which encircles this arm. Either improvement would shorten the distance by approximately three-quarters of a mile.\n\nI am submitting to the Department certain recommendations with regard to the lighting system, the drainage system, and the system of irrigation. The difficulty in securing hay and green feed for the stock is quite a serious one, and I am asking the Department to allow a grant of about $500. -- to clear some more ground, and to lay on an irrigation ditch. I am hoping you may, from your expert knowledge of the conditions here, be able to support the applications which are being made for these improvements. I should have liked to have been able to consult you in person with regard to all of the above, but this has been impossible, and I did not feel justified in going to the expense of telegraphing.\n\nI trust that you keep well, and with very kind regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nWinnipeg, Man. December 16, 1929\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit to our Society's Indian Residential School at Carcross in the Yukon (Nov. 12th to 23rd), I made a careful examination of all the buildings and equipment, and made a note of some of the most urgent requirements. As your representative, Mr. Hawksley, was in Dawson over 500 miles away, I was unable to confer with him personally with regard to these requirements, but I wrote him a letter in this connection and enclosed herewith you will find a copy of the same for your information. The heating, lighting and water systems, for instance, demanded in many particulars, immediate attention, and I placed an order with the Hudson's Bay Co. in Vancouver, immediately after my return to that city for the following items:\n\n- 3 plugs or caps \u00bd inch\n- 2 plugs or caps 1\u00bc inch\n- 16 spring taps for wash bowls\n- 8 turn taps for wash bowls\n- 1 inner section of a 15 coil radiator 3'6\" x 2'3\".\n  (If the section cannot be secured separately, then send the radiator complete with \"T\" joint attached.)\n- 1 radiator \"T\" valve 1 inch\n- 1 radiator \"T\" valve handle\n- 1 Union, \u00bd inch -\n  - 30 feet \u00bd inch metal piping\n  - 10 elbows \u00bd inch\n  - 1 \"T\" \u00bd inch\n- All galvanized.\n- 50 feet metal piping \u00bd inch\n- 6 caps or plugs \u00bd inch\n- 24 tap washers \u00bd inch for above taps\n- 30 feet (10 ft. lengths) 1\u00bd pipe, 2 Ts.plugs, 3 Elbows\n\nI asked the Hudson's Bay Co. to furnish me with an estimate of the cost of the above items, and they promised to do this immediately, but so far, their estimate has not come to hand.\nI was given to understand, however, that as none of the items were very expensive, the total, apart from the freight, would probably not exceed $50.00, and I shall be obliged if, under the circumstances, your Department will pay the bill, including the freight, when it has come to hand. You will note from my letter to Mr. Hawksley that I was informed he had undertaken to send some new radiator valves, but these had not come to hand at the time of my visit. Moreover, when the heating system was put in operation in the late autumn, other serious defects were noted, such as leaking radiators, defective taps, etc., and it was absolutely necessary to have the repairs effected at the earliest moment possible. In your letter of June 1st last #156-1-5, you authorized the expenditure of $100.00 towards the cost of providing a bath room and bath for the staff, and $75.00 for hand washing machines. On my return to Vancouver from the Carcross School, I placed an order for the bath with fixtures, and was informed that the total cost apart from the freight, will not exceed $50.00. As the staff agreed to carry on with the hand washing machines they have at present, in the expectation that a modern laundry and laundry equipment would be provided next year, the expenditure authorized for hand washing machines will not be incurred, and this amount could be applied towards meeting the cost of the items enumerated above.\n\nThe freight on the Steamship is not very heavy, even as far as Skagway, but it amounts to a good deal over the 68 miles of the White Pass and Yukon Railway from Skagway to Carcross. I shall be obliged, therefore, if you will authorize me to forward to you the bill from the Hudson's Bay Co. for payment when it comes to hand.\n\nAs there were only 26 pupils in residence at the time of my visit, instead of a capacity enrolment of 40 as allowed by your Department, you will readily understand our Society's difficulty in meeting unexpected expenditures of this sort. Immediately after my arrival at Carcross, I wired to Bishop Stringer at Dawson, to ascertain if either he or Mr. Hawksley could undertake to provide more pupils immediately. In his reply which was despatched after he had consulted Mr. Hawkley, the Bishop stated that Mr. Hawksley had authorized the Agent in charge of the Telegraph Creek Agency to recruit 12 pupils for this school, and advised me to get in touch with the Indian Agent at that centre. I immediately wired to Mr. Reed, the Indian Agent there, and in his reply he stated as follows:-\nTelegraph Creek B.C. Nov. 16th. 1928\n\nT.W.R. Westgate,\nCarcross YT\n\nYour wire first intimation received here too late, transportation impossible, everybody trapping Frank Williams children Jessie and Billy Atlin maybe have wired them letter follows and will send more children later.\n\nHarper Reed, Indian Agent.\n\nIt would appear from this telegram that some slight misunderstanding occurred somewhere, and even if the pupils are admitted in the spring, our Society will sustain a very considerable loss in revenue between now and then owing to the comparatively small enrolment. I am furnishing you with this information in the hope that your Department may find it possible to meet the small expenditure which I consider it so necessary to incur before receiving a specific authorization from you direct.\n\nAt the time of my visit to this institution, I noted the improvements which had been effected since my last visit, namely, in August, 1926. These included the replacement of the plaster walls of some of the rooms by beaver board, the conversion of the pantry into a staff dining-room and the laying down of a board floor in this room as well as the kitchen. While these improvements add greatly to the staff and pupils, there are still about a dozen rooms with plaster walls and I beg to recommend that these be equipped with beaver board at the earliest date possible. I also beg to recommend that a board floor be placed in the children's dining-room. If the material is provided, the school management can lay the floor in this room.\n\nAs the board floor in the girls' recreation room is badly worn, I beg to recommend that a new floor be laid on top of the old one, and the whole covered with linoleum. The linoleum by itself would not be sufficient as the floor is so worn that it would soon wear out.\n\nThe chief requirement, however, of this school, in my opinion, is the provision of recreation rooms for both boys and girls and of a fully equipped laundry. As a special note has been made of this in the list of requirements already sent forward to you, for incorporation in your estimates for next year, I do not consider it necessary to make further reference.\nto the same in this letter. I beg, however, to direct your attention to the urgent need of an implement shed, a boat house, and also of a house for storing ice. So far as I am aware, none of these buildings have ever been provided for this school, and the school management have been inconvenienced accordingly.\n\nA further need, and one to which I directed the attention of your Department after I visited this school in 1922, was the building of a bridge across the arm of the lake which lies between the school and the town of Carcross. The provision of this bridge would shorten the journey between the school and the town by at least three quarters of a mile, and would eliminate the dangers and fatigue which have now to be encountered in travelling over some steep and difficult hills. Enclosed herewith you will find the original of an estimate which I secured for the construction of this bridge from a local contractor. It is possible, I think, to have a roadway cut around the base of the hill which surrounds this arm of the lake, and although it would not shorten the journey so much between the school and the town, the cost would probably be a little less than the cost of the bridge.\n\nIn view of the large number of tourists, many of whom are from the United States, and who visit this school each year during the summer season and make comparisons between our schools and those in their own country, frequently to our discredit, I trust that your Department may find it possible to improve the approach to the school for this reason, as well as for the relief of the school management. Other requirements which were noted and which should receive immediate attention are as follows:\n\n(1) To have all the exposed wires in connection with the lighting system enclosed in metal tubes. It is estimated that approximately 75 yards of tubing will be required for this purpose, as the lighting system has been extended to the barn, the workshop, the Principal's residence, etc., and all should be protected as much as possible against danger from fire.\n\n(2) To have wall switches installed and enclosed in metal cases. At present, there are but a very few of such switches, and in many cases the lights have been placed so high that they cannot be reached without standing on a stool or chair.\n\n(3) To have lights with double sockets and 60 watt bulbs installed as follows, instead of the plain lights which are very hard on the eyes, and are injurious to staff and pupils when the nights are so long during the winter months;\u2014class-room 4; main corridor 1; basement corridor 1; staff dining-room 1; staff sitting-room 1; infirmary 1; office 1; kitchen 2; pupils' dining-room 2.\n(4) To have two tables with linoleum tops, each table to be 14' x 3'6\", and also eight benches for the same, provided for the pupils' dining-room.\n\n(5) To have a cement floor placed in the furnace room (24' x 16'), also in the room used as a laundry (21'x 16') and in the basement corridor (7'x 55'). Cement can be procured locally and the school management, with a little help, could do the work, if the cement is provided.\n\n(6) To have an asbestos-lined, tin or zinc fire pad (4'x 9') provided to protect the walls in the furnace room nearest the chimney.\n\n(7) To have a new door provided for the furnace (Gurney's #935) with automatic connection with a pressure valve, also an assortment of 1/2\" and 3/4\" nipples for the furnace boiler.\n\n(8) To have new treads placed on the stairs leading to the basement.\n\n(9) To have battleship linoleum placed on the main corridor and halls leading thereto. The measurements are as follows:- (7'x 43' also 4'x 12'), and (5'x 16') and (4'x 4').\n\n(10) To have a larger water tank installed in the attic. The present tank is only 3' deep by 5' wide and 7' long, and is quite insufficient for storing the school's daily supply of water, or for providing sufficient protection against fire.\n\n(11) To have strong wire protection screens provided for all basement windows (16 size 3'6\" x 4') and \u00bd size for those in the girls' recreation room (4 size 5'x 4'). All these screens should be placed on hinges.\n\n(12) To have a refrigerator provided for the main school building. There is none there at present and so far as I know there never has been one.\n\n(13) To have paint provided for the Principal's residence and the workshop, and creosote for the roof and walls of the stock barn.\n\n(14) To have 2 Fahrenheit thermometers provided, also 2 wall clocks for use in the main school building.\n\n(15) To have the drainage system thoroughly overhauled and placed for all time on a satisfactory basis. I was informed that only 3\" piping was laid down between the school and the septic tank. This should be replaced by 5\" or 6\" piping, as the\npresent system is frequently blocked and gives the school management unnecessary labour and annoyance.\n\n(16) To have the fire hose installed in the girls clothes-room brought out to the two end corridors, as the clothes-room must be kept locked and any delay in opening it in an emergency might have serious consequences. Some piping with the necessary connection and an additional hose would be required to do this.\n\n(17) To have a filing cabinet provided for the Principal's office.\n\n(18) To have a railing placed on both ends of the front door steps which are frequently so icy in winter that they cannot be used with any degree of safety.\n\n(19) To have 15 mattresses supplied for the beds in the boys' dormitory to take the place of the palliasses now in use, also 2 dozen pillows. Where hay is so difficult to obtain, it is impossible for the school management to keep the palliasses properly filled, and I am convinced that the mattresses are an absolute necessity.\n\n(20) To have approximately five acres of land cleared along the arm of the lake in front of the school for farm and garden purposes. This land could be cleared, and made ready for cultivation for a sum of about $500.00. As it could easily be irrigated if piping were provided, it would be a great help to the school management in solving the difficult problem of securing the necessary vegetables for the school and the green feed and fodder for the stock.\n\nThe above items may appear to your Department to be very numerous, but I trust that you may also see that they are very necessary, and take immediate steps to provide them. On my recommendation, our Commission and the Dorcas Sec.-Treas. of our W.A. have already undertaken to supply various other needs amounting to a very considerable sum of money. They have not found it easy to do this but they have made a special effort to meet every essential requirement, and are doing this to the full limit of their power. I trust, therefore, that your Department may be able to provide the various items I have mentioned.\n\nWhile dealing with the needs of this institution, I further beg to recommend that careful consideration be given by your Department to the possibility of making greater use of the water power which is available. Summer and winter there is a stream of water flowing through the school grounds, capable of developing at all seasons of the year not less than 75 H.P. and in the summer season double that amount. If a dam, approximately 100' long,\n35' deep were thrown across this stream at a place where it enters the gorge, and only about 300' from the school, a small turbine could be operated which would furnish all the power required to light the school, and even the neighbouring town of Carcross, if necessary. It would also afford all the fire protection necessary, and provide an abundance of water for the school's daily use, as well as irrigating the farm and garden. The cost would not be prohibitive, and the benefits to be derived would abundantly justify the same. I learned from missionaries of the American Church in Alaska that they have made use of Hydro-Electric power in connection with a number of their Indian Schools in that country. I also examined the Hydro-Electric system installed at Skagway in Alaska, and am convinced that the same could be done at our Carcross School. I commend this important matter, therefore, to your careful consideration, and would recommend that provision be made in your estimates for next year to meet this undertaking. But whether the suggestion I have made be vigorously taken up and put through, as I earnestly hope it may, I desire to make it quite clear that the school's supply of water, for daily consumption, should be drawn from the stream instead of from the well as at present. The corrosion which is taking place in the boiler and radiators and heating system, will soon necessitate complete new heating plant.\n\nIf the Hydro-Electric power which is now going to waste is not utilized, then, I see no reason, why a large reservoir made of cement should not be constructed close to the main school building, and water laid on to the same from the stream close by by gravitation. This, of course, would not eliminate the daily process of pumping from that reservoir to the tank in the attic of the school, a process which would not be necessary if the dam were constructed. I see no reason, either, why the water from the stream should not be conducted by pipes to all the land between the main school building and the arm of the lake in front, as well as to the Principal's residence. The cost would not be very much as only about 400 yards of 2\" piping would be sufficient for the whole system, and I shall be glad to know if your Department will come to the assistance of the Society by helping to solve the numerous problems with which they are confronted in the administration of this school, by supplying all the improvements I have enumerated above and thus help to make the work which we are both so deeply interested at this important centre, a credit to all the parties concerned.\n\nWith the compliments of the season, I remain, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.O.\n\nTBRW/W\nSheldon Jackson School  \nSitka, Alaska.  \nConducted by  \nThe Board of National Missions  \nof the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.  \nJames H.

It is possible that you would like to consider some used equipment, which we have for sale. This past summer we have erected a new shop building for our School. This necessitated wrecking our old Hydro-Electric Plant and installing in the new building new machinery. Our old plant did not have the capacity for our needs and was of horizontal type, too costly to consider housing in our new structure; which is of reinforced concrete.\n\nOur old plant had been in operation for fifteen years and the water wheel is good for at least that many more, although the electrical apparatus could not be expected to last that long.\n\nAttached is a list of the used equipment which we have for sale. Prices are f.o.b. Sitka Dock. Should you be interested in any of this equipment we will be glad to hear from you and to write more fully concerning it.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nSHELDON JACKSON SCHOOL,\n\nBy (sgd) James H.

The initial cost of the plant appears to be reasonable, but I am unable to give you an estimate of the freighting charges which would no doubt be considerable, especially over the White Pass and Yukon Railway. The installation of second hand equipment has not been found by our Society to give satisfactory results in the past, but I have felt that the information contained in the enclosed letter might be a help to your Department in reaching a decision with regard to this important matter, and consequently have decided to submit it for your consideration.\n\nWith the Compliments of the Season,\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, January 2, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nDr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., has written the Department a lengthy communication concerning the needs at the Carcross Indian Residential School. I am enclosing, for your information, a copy of my answering letter to him. Will you please report on the advisability of the following improvements and give a rough estimate of the cost in each case:\n\n1. Beaver boarding these rooms now plastered.\n2. Conversion of the pantry into a staff dining room.\n3. New flooring for the above-mentioned room and in the kitchen.\n4. Flooring for children's dining room.\n5. Flooring for sewing room and a linoleum covering.\n6. An implement shed.\n7. A beat house.\n8. An ice house.\n9. Enclosing all exposed electric wires in metal tube.\n10.

Overhauling drainage system and enlarging pipe between school and septic tank.\n24. Filing cabinet for Principal's office.\n25. Railing for front door steps.\n26. 15 mattresses and 24 pillows for boys' dormitory.\n\nDr. Westgate recommends that the fire hose installed in the girls' clothes room be brought out to the two end corridors. If you believe this necessary, you may purchase whatever additional hose and piping is required and have the improvement effected.\n\nDr. Westgate urges the Department to take advantage of the water power that is available at the school. He believes a dam, approximately 100 ft. long and 35 ft. deep at the gorge, which is only 300 yards from the school, will enable sufficient power to be supplied for school purposes.\n\nYou will receive other communications concerning Dr. Westgate's enquiries regarding more pupils and with reference to a road to Carcross town and the clearing of additional land at the school.\n\nI wish to add, for your information, that the Department intends to ask Parliament, at the coming session, for $10,000 for an addition to the Carcross Indian Residential School. It is proposed to include in this addition a chapel, laundry and playrooms for both boys and girls.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nOttawa, January 2, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th ultimo, with enclosures, relative to the needs at the Carcross Indian Residential School. I note that hand washing machines are not being ordered but that you have purchased approximately $50 worth of plumbing materials. You may forward a properly certified account, in duplicate.\n\nI am asking Superintendent Hawkeye for a recommendation concerning beaver board for the remaining rooms, flooring material for the children's dining room and a new floor with linoleum for the girls' sewing room. I am also asking for his report and recommendation regarding items 1 to 19 on pages 4, 5 and 6 of your letter.\n\nThe Department understands that the addition proposed for next year should include a laundry, a chapel and playrooms for both boys and girls. I also note your request that an implement shed, a boat house and an ice house be supplied.\n\nYour recommendation, that use be made of the water power that is available, is being considered. Further communications will be directed to you concerning the enrolment of pupils, a road to the town of Carcross and clearing land.\n\nI have also your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to Hydro power at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Kindly obtain the receipt and transmit to the Department. When it is received a cheque will issue for the amount of the voucher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget,\nChief Accountant.\n\nThe Asst. Secretary/Treasurer,\nIndian Residential School Commission,\n125 Alexander Ave., East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDawson, Y.T. December 18th, 1929.\n\nRev & Dear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of yours of 21st ultimo, dealing with what you consider the requirements of the Carcross Indian Residential School and stating that you propose submitting the same to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nIn reply I beg to say in reference to the new taps needed in the various rooms, the principal had already sent in a requisition for these steps being taken to secure these as I consider that they are badly needed. As you are ordering the taps in Vancouver I am taking no further steps in the matter. Will recommend payment if called upon to do so.\n\nNew valves for the radiators were ordered by me from M. Watson of Carcross; the Principal was asked to get these and install them where required.\n\nAfter my visit to the school last June in my report to the Department written on July 7th, I called attention to the need of modern laundry equipment and a recreation for the boys. It is hoped that these items may be included in the estimates for the coming year. I have the figures on a suitable equipment also the shipping weight.\n\nReferring to the implement shed, I consider there is room in the barn for all the implements owned by the school. I sometimes wonder why it is not used for this purpose. I have seldom seen them housed there.\n\nThe question of shortening the road from the school to the town of Carcross was taken up some years ago. A bridge across the lagoon was proposed and an estimate of the cost of lumber and construction was obtained ($4200.00) being the lowest estimate submitted. It was considered that the limited amount of traffic between the school and the town did not warrant such a large outlay. A road round the foot of the bluff was then suggested. I sent in a tentative plan of the road but when a personal inspection was made of the location it was found to be impracticable except at a heavy cost. You may have noticed that for quite a distance the bluff is almost perpendicular which would entail the removal of an enormous amount of earth before a satisfactory\nroad could be made. Both these plans were dropped. It was felt that there was no urgent need for these costly undertakings the amount of traffic being so slight. The conditions are about the same now. Some grading done on the trail that goes up the hill just beyond the barn would be a material help to make the road easier for anyone walking over it. There is usually a bridge of ice across the lagoon from November to April.\n\nAs to piping the water from the creek nearby to the school and the Principal's residence, what do you propose to do in the winter when the creek is frozen to its bed and should there be a supply of running water in the creek what plan have you for keeping the water from freezing in the pipes. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that I consider this neither feasible or practical.\n\nWith reference to the grant of $500.00 that you propose asking the Department to make for clearing more land, I am wondering where you propose clearing. My knowledge of the place, having lived there for three years, and frequently visited it since, leads me to the conclusion that it is not worth while clearing any more of the land surrounding the school, it is valueless for the purpose of cultivation. The Anderson field, which adjoins the school land, was properly cleared and fenced in and a great deal of time and labour spent to make it productive but proved a total failure it produced practically nothing. The field now used as a golf links and the plot of land on the opposite side of the school to the Anderson field were cleared by Mr Simmons, a windmill was erected upon it for the purpose of pumping water for irrigation, these two plots did not produce enough to feed his family. All three of the above mentioned fields have long since been abandoned. The land that was cleared last year for which the Department paid $200.00 did not produce anything although much time and labour was spent upon it. For two years an effort was made to grow green feed at the school the result was almost nil. I believe that more intensive cultivation of the land that is now cleared would be more beneficial than getting larger spaces that with your limited staff cannot receive the attention needed. Three hundred bushels of potatoes have been produced from a smaller plot of ground than was planted last season which produced only 23 bushels. I do not think it worth while to clear more of the land round the school as I fell convinced that it is unproductive.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the difficulty of getting hay and green feed, it would appear that there are too many animals to care for, 4 cows, 2 calves, 1 bull and a horse. Two cows would, I think, be sufficient to supply all the milk required. If your idea is to carry on productive farming with a view to producing revenue I fear you will be disappointed. There is no market for\nthe produce in the vicinity.\n\nMay I suggest that it might be a wise plan to either lease or buy some of the hay land at Ten Mile Point, this is about the only place in the vicinity of the school where hay is obtainable.\n\nThe need of a chapel at an institution the size of Carcross school, in my opinion, is neither urgent or necessary.\n\nYou do not state the nature of the recommendations you are submitting to the Department regarding the lighting system, the drainage system and the plan for irrigation. It is noted that you express a hope that I will support these schemes. It is only fair to say that I cannot very well pledge myself to support any scheme the details of which I know nothing at all.\n\nA new floor is badly needed in the pupils dining room, and a further grant for continuing the work of removing the plaster and replacing it with beaver board in the rooms upstairs, lumber for making necessary repairs and a supply of paint for painting the beaver board are all urgently needed and for which I am on the point of sending a requisition to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley.\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Rev T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:-\n\nA letter from Dr. T.F.R. Westgate recently received contains rather a long list of what he deems the needs of the Carcross Indian Residential School, asking me to support his appeal to the Department.\n\nThe need of modern laundry equipment and a recreation room for the boys was brought to the notice of the Department in my latter of July 7th. A new floor is required for the pupils dining room, a further sum of money for completing the work of removing the plaster and replacing it with beaver board on the walls of the upstairs rooms, and a supply of paint or calcomine for the walls that have already been done.\n\nThe plan of piping the water from the creek to the school is not worth considering; it would be expensive and would be useful during our short summer. The creek usually freezes solid in the winter. The reason stated that the well water is responsible for the corrosion of the radiator pipes is a fallacy. It is common knowledge in the engineering trade that distilled water is destructive to metal, about seven years is considered the average length of time a metal pipe will last that is used for conveying water that has been through the boiler. The water from the creek would have to pass through the boiler before it could be used for heating purposes therefore the conditions would be the same as the use of water from the well.\n\nA copy of my reply to Dr. Westgate is enclosed herewith which will give the Department my views on what he considers the needs of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Feb. 6th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 1st, 1929, 116-1-5, authorizing an expenditure of $100.00 towards the cost of providing a bath room and bath for the staff at our Carcross School, and approximately $50.00 for plumbing materials for the same institution. I now beg to enclose herewith bills in duplicate from the Hudson's Bay Co., setting forth the expenditure which has been incurred in this connection. In my letter to you dated Dec. 16th, 1929, I stated that I was given to understand the cost of the plumbing fixtures would not exceed $50.00, and I am surprised to find from the enclosed bill that they amount to $93.50. However, as the total amount sanctioned in your letter of June 1st 1929, was $175.00, and as the total of these two bills only amounts to $175.69, I trust that your Department may agree to meet the same, and issue your cheque in favour of the District Manager, Hudson's Bay Co., at 321 Water St., Vancouver. The Company have already paid for the plumbing fixtures and bath to a large firm of plumbers in Vancouver, and it is only fair that they should be reimbursed with the minimum of delay.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nP.S. I have asked the Hudson's Bay Co., to forward me the receipts for freight prepaid and when these come to hand I will forward them to your Department if necessary. T.B.R.W.\nOttawa, February 12, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 6th February, with inclosures, regarding expenditure incurred in providing a bathroom and bath for the staff at the Carcross School, I return herewith the accounts which you submitted from Messrs. Alcock, Downing & Wright, Limited, in order that they may be receipted so as to show payment made to them by the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nWhen re-inclosing the accounts for payment, kindly forward with them receipts for prepaid freight charges on the shipments made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

Your action in authorizing the Principal to wire to Vancouver for the spare parts necessary to make the repairs is approved.\n\nYou might make enquiry as to whether there was any neglect on the part of the staff in the operation of the plant and whether the person who operates the plant is fully competent to do so.\n\nCertified accounts covering the cost of the spare parts required should be forwarded by you in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Jones writes from Vancouver stating that in the order as taken by him from you the extra refills for extinguishers were not included.\n\nBut in preparing the shipment he was advised that the refills should be sent then, so that in event of use for the equipment it would still be complete.\n\nDawson Hardware Co.,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith vouchers from the Dawson Hardware Company of Dawson,Y.T. for fire protection materials supplied to the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nThese goods were ordered on authority of telegram dated November 21st, 1929, instructing me to arrange for the purchase immediately.\n\nThe installation of the electric fire gong is not yet completed by the Yukon Electrical Company; vouchers for this work will be forwarded later.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDawson,Y.T.January 31st,1930.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of January 2nd, file No 166-1-5, in reference to Dr Westgate's letter concerning the needs of the Carcross Indian Residential School with a copy of your reply to him enclosed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I am enclosing a report on the items enumerated in your letter, I am not able to roughly estimate the cost of each item. It would take some time to get in touch with various firms to obtain prices, to avoid delay I am sending a fairly conservative estimate of the cost of the whole of the proposed work.\n\nIn view of the fact that there are no skilled workmen in the small town of Carcross men would have to be brought from Whitehorse, and that all the required material would have to be brought from Vancouver, that freight charges and wages are high, my own estimate for carrying out all the items mentioned is from $15,000 to $20,000 inclusive.\n\nReferring to the suggestion of the Department taking advantage of the water power available near the school. Some years ago I discussed this matter with a practical engineer who definitely said the scheme was not practical. The creek freezes almost solid to its bed during the winter, it is only a shallow stream. If the school was dependent upon the water power to supply its needs they would be without power or at least water from November until April. Dr Westgate has not seen this creek in midwinter.\n\nYou may have received a copy of my reply to a letter sent here by Dr Westgate, which was forwarded to the Department. From that you will gather my views on the question of clearing more land and the construction of a road between the school and the town of Carcross.\n\nMay I suggest that instead of supplying paint for the Principal's residence, that a supply be provided for painting the beaver board already in place on the interior walls of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.Mackenzie, Esq.\nActing Asst Deputy\nand Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Indian Superintendent.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 4)\nReport and Recommendations on the Items Enumerated in Letter.\n\nNo.1. Beaver boarding those rooms now plastered.\nThis is a very necessary improvement, the cost of doing all the rooms and the corridor would be from $1000.00 to $1500.00, as near as I can estimate without getting prices from contractors.\n\nNo.2. Conversion of pantry into staff dining room.\nThis work was carried out last year.\n\nNo.3. New flooring for the above mentioned room and in the kitchen.\nNew floors were put in both these rooms last year.\n\nNo.4. New flooring for children's dining room.\nThis is really needed, the cost would be about $250.00 for the material and labor.\n\nNo.5. Flooring for sewing room and a linoleum covering.\nThis floor needs renewing and would cost say $150.00. Varnishing the new floor would be more sanitary than linoleum, dust and germs are likely to accumulate under linoleum, the cost would be from $2.50 to $3.00 per square yard. I do not know the size of the room.\n\nNo.6. An implement shed.\nI do not consider that this is needed, there is room in the barn for the few implements owned by the school.\n\nNo.7. A boat house.\nThere is only one boat. I would suggest that if a house is desired, the staff at the school should, with the help of the boys, build this. It would be good training in manual work for the boys.\n\nNo.8. An ice house.\nThere is, or was, an ice house at the back of the school. If still in existence it may probably need some repairs.\n\nNo.9. Enclosing all exposed electric wires in metal tubes.\nI do not consider this essential, it would be rather expensive.\n\nNo.10. To install wall switches and enclose in metal cases.\nUndoubtedly this would be very convenient but by no means essential. An electrician would have to be brought from Whitehorse and in addition to the material used his charges for labor would be $10.00 per day from the time he left Whitehorse until the day he returned.\n\nNo.11. Drop lights with better bulbs in main rooms and the corridors.\nI would suggest that 100 watt frosted bulbs and 60 watt bulbs\nthe latter for use in rooms and corridors and the former in\nthe schoolroom and office. Drop lights with the size of bulbs\nthat these would entail would possibly put too great a strain\non the electric plant.\n\nNO.12. Two new tables and 8 benches for the pupils dining\nroom.\nThis is a much needed requirement.\n\nNO.13. Cement floor in furnace room, present laundry and\nbasement corridor.\nThe concrete floor in the above mentioned places is much worn,\na good coating of cement over them would meet the needs.\n\nNO.14. Asbestos lined zinc pad to protect the walls in the\nfurnace room nearest the chimney.\nThis is not necessary. If the plaster is taken off the wall\n\"Gyproc\" instead of beaver board could be put on this wall\ninstead of beaver board. It is non-inflammable and costs about\nthe same as beaver board.\n\nNO.15. New door for furnace with automatic connection with\na pressure valve and nipples for furnace boiler.\nIt is presumed that the door that closes the draught is what\nis meant in this case, probably this is broken and needs a new\none. There is a pressure valve on top of the boiler, I suppose\nthat a chain and weight to connect the door with the valve.\nThis valve blows off at a pressure of 3 lbs of steam, the usual\npressure required to heat the school in cold weather. When I was\nat the school last fall there was a chain and weight attached\nto the valve and the door. If this is broken then a\nrenewal is essential. The old chain and weight might be used\nif it can be found. I do not understand what the nipples are\nthat are said to be required for the boiler.\n\nNO.16. New treads on basement stairs.\nThese do require renewing, they should be of B.C. red fir, native\nlumber is not sufficiently hard for this purpose.\n\nNO.17. Linoleum for main corridor and halls leading thereto.\nThis is quite unnecessary. All that is needed is the floors\nrevarnishing.\n\nNO.18. Larger water tank in the attic.\nThe present tank holds 400 gallons when full which means a net\nweight of two tons in addition to the lead lined tank. A larger\ntank would mean extra weight. I do not consider it advisable to\nincrease the weight, it might have some effect on the building. The tank can be filled in less than 10 minutes with the power pump they now have at the school. It would be an expensive item to put in a larger tank and I do not think it is really needed.\n\nNo. 19. Wire screens on hinges for the basement windows. Material was supplied last year by the Department for the purpose of making screens for all the windows in the building and the doors. These were made at the school. It would not be difficult for them to put hinges on these screens if required. I do not see why they need hinges as the basement windows all open inwards.\n\nNo. 20. Refrigerator. This is not a necessity. The well house is a cool place and has been used as a refrigerator in the past. For about seven months out of the twelve our difficulty is to keep things from freezing. We have a natural refrigerator in the north.\n\nNo. 21. Paint for the Principal's residence. This building is not the property of the Indian Department. It was purchased from the Diocese of Yukon by Dr Westgate. My idea is that it is up to the Indian and Eskimo School Commission to take care of their own property. The workshop was painted two years ago; it does not require repainting.\n\nNo. 22. Cresote for the exterior walls and roof of stock barn. Cresote for the exterior walls of the barn is needed, the roof is corrugated iron and does not need anything.\n\nNo. 23. Overhauling drainage system and enlarging pipe between school and septic tank. There appears to be no need to overhaul the drainage system; it was working satisfactorily when I was at the school. The pipe leading from the school to the septic tank is earthenware 6 inch pipes, quite large enough to carry off the drainage. Four inch pipes are in use in all the large buildings in Dawson including the school with some 100 pupils and the Hostel with with as many pupils as the Carcross school these pipes have and are giving satisfaction. The danger of larger pipes lies in this, the fall or grade from the school to the tank is not deep. If a larger pipe is put in the drainage from the school, which is not very great in volume, would spread out and become shallower in the pipe and the flow move slowly thus allowing the solid matter to settle in the bottom of the pipe and choke up the drain. I do consider it advisable to change the size of the pipe.\n\nNo. 24. Filing cabinet for Principal's office. This would be useful but is not necessary.\n\nNo. 25. Railing for front door steps.\nThis seems to be unnecessary, the steps are wide with plenty of room, the pupils do not use this entrance, the staff use the side entrances much more than the front it is not worth while to incur this expenditure.\n\nNo.26. 15 mattresses and 24 pillows for boys dormitory. Until some account is given of the use made of the 40 mattress cases shipped to the school by the Department some two or three years ago I would hesitate to give a further supply. These cases or bed ticks were made of good strong ticking in suitable size for single cots, they were to be filled with hay at the school. The idea in following this plan was because some of the pupils are troubled with incontinence especially when asleep, the hay could easily be removed when soiled and the ticking washed and refilled. Unless there is some improvement in the pupils in this particular the mattresses would soon be ruined. Pillows are needed.\n\nRegarding the fire hose in the girl's clothes room I would rather defer any action until I visit the school in spring. I do not feel quite sure that this can be done and get efficient service from the hose.\n\nDawson.Y.T.\nJanuary 31st, 1930.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, March 8, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 2355-5 of January 31st, with reference to improvements at the Carcross Indian Residential School. I note you state that a rough estimate of all improvements mentioned is at least $15,000. I presume you include the addition and laundry machinery when you mention this figure.\n\nI may say that $10,500 will be available for improvements at this school during this year, and it is now necessary to decide, not only what improvements should be effected with this sum, but also if it can be done by day labour, under the supervision of a competent carpenter-foreman. The Department believes the addition should be erected and the most urgent of the other improvements carried out. If you have any further comment to make before authority is directed to you in this connection, you might write without delay. The Department has not as yet had a rough sketch, showing the dimensions, etc., of the proposed addition. You might have the Principal prepare this and forward it to Ottawa with your comments. I understand that it is proposed to include in the addition a laundry and a playroom. I note that you believe a chapel is hardly necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

In a letter he states that he paid $2.50 freight charges for sending the parts to Vancouver for repairs but did not take a receipt for it, being a new arrival at the school he says that he was not aware that it was necessary to do this.\n\nThe amount due to Rev J.H.Bryne is $5.20, he expresses a hope that the Department will refund these charges.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F.Mackenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 24th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 29th ultimo respecting amounts paid by Rev. J. H. Byrne amounting to $5.20, I beg to say that if you will forward a certified voucher covering these charges, and explain thereon why he did not obtain a receipt for charges amounting to $2.50, it will be paid.\n\nI am returning herewith receipt for $2.70 which please attach to voucher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H. Paget\nChief Accountant.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDAWSON,\nY. T.\nDawson,Y.T.April 5th,1930.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated March 8th, file No 166-1-5, in reference to the proposed improvements at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the following items are considered to be the most urgent requirements. Laundry equipment consisting of Washing Machine, Extractor, the necessary pulleys shafting and belts and a gasoline engine to operate these. There is a fine washing plant at the Hostel here, a similar plant would fully meet the needs of the Carcross school. I would suggest that the machinery be installed in the room in the basement now used as a laundry and play room for the boys. Enamel wash tubs are fixed to the walls connected with the drain, hot and cold water taps are over each tub. The cost of the plant would be approximately $2500.00.\n\nA Recreation Room for the boys, to be erected at the back of the school. A one story building would affect only one window of the first floor, if a two storey structure is erected it will affect the dormitory windows unless built as a separate unit which would mean a separate heating plant.\n\nThe plaster remaining on the walls of one of the hospital wards, the basement corridor and several rooms on the upper floor, be removed and replaced with beaver board and all the beaver boarding that has been done be either painted or calcomined.\n\nA new boarded floor in the pupils dining room. The concrete floors in the basement to be faced with a layer of cement. New treads on the stairs leading from the basement to the first floor. The wood shed lined with two inch rough planking and new treads on the stairs leading to the yard. New flooring in the stalls of the barn. All these should be done with imported lumber, preferably B.C. red fir, native lumber is too soft and wears out quickly.\nHave written to the principal asking that he be good enough to send a sketch of what he would suggest for the proposed improvements, and to give dimensions of the rooms and height of the building that he may think is needed, also to what part of the present building he would suggest the addition to be made. I do not know what plans he has in mind.\n\nThe work could be done by day work under the supervision of a competent carpenter. May I suggest that I believe the better plan would be to give the work to one of the firms in Whitehorse. There are no skilled carpenters in Carcross. Either one of the firms in Whitehorse would supply the materials and the labour and would work by the day.\n\nIt will be quite three weeks before I hear from the Principal, his plans and suggestions will be forwarded promptly upon receipt.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated February 21st, file No 166-1-5, approving of the action taken regarding spare parts for the Delco lighting plant at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as far as I can ascertain, there was no wilful neglect on the part of the staff in operating the plant, but none of them are really competent in the handling of gasoline engines of which there are four at the school.\n\nMay I be permitted to say that it might be advisable to suggest to the Rev Dr Westgate that when he is engaging someone to fill the position of General Assistant at the school, the person selected should have some practical knowledge of gasoline engines.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent,\nActing Asst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of our Carcross School in the Yukon has forwarded to me for any further action necessary, the following request which he had received from Mr. Indian Supt. Hawkesley of Dawson:\n\n\"Will you please be good enough to send a rough plan giving your ideas on the proposed addition to the school, giving length, width and height of rooms desired. The matter is urgent, please send the plan as soon as possible upon receipt of this letter.\"\n\nOn page 3 of my letter addressed to you on Dec. 16 last, you will note that after my visit to this school last autumn, I pointed out that its chief requirement, in my opinion, was the provision of recreation rooms for both boys and girls and of a fully equipped laundry. I assume, therefore, that Mr. Hawkesley's request is in connection with this requirement.\n\nAt the present time, the school is without a recreation room for either the boys or the girls. The boys make use of the place in the basement where the laundry work is done, and the girls make use of the room on the first floor which is intended for a sewing room. Where the winters are so long this arrangement is very trying for both staff and pupils. Further, there is no chapel or assembly room, and up to the present, either the class-room or the children's refectory have to be used for this purpose. This again, is not at all satisfactory.\nOn each occasion when I have visited this school, I have looked carefully into the matter, and reached the conclusion that the only satisfactory way to meet the need I have indicated, would be to either (1) add to the length of the main school building on the end shown in the enclosed photograph, by approximately 20', or (2) to build a semi-detached room approximately 50' x 30' at the corner I have indicated in rough tracing. The objection to the first method is the difficulty which presents through the exclusion of light from the rooms inside the windows shown. This appears to be insuperable. By adopting the second method, the window marked (1) could be converted into a doorway into the basement of the proposed addition which would serve as a laundry, and the window marked (2) on the first floor could also be converted into a doorway into the chapel or assembly room. If the added building were given another storey, this storey could be used as a sewing room, and in this way all the accommodation required would be provided. I was informed that the present heating plant would be sufficient to heat the extension, but I myself have some doubt in this connection. I am of the opinion, that the added building should be in line with the main school building, and not at right angles to it running out towards the rear. From the photograph you will observe that there is an embankment about 30 ft. from the rear side of the main school building, and if the extension were built in that direction it might inconvenience the school management in the matter of conveying the wood to the furnace room. The cost in each case would be about the same.\n\nThe depth of the basement below the bottom of the windows shown on the ground level in the photo is approximately 6'. There is sufficient field for good drainage down to the lake in front of the school.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Indian Supt. Hawkesley and another copy to the Principal of the School, but if there is any further information which I may be able to give you in this connection, I shall gladly furnish the same on receipt of your request.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a telegram just received from the Principal of our Carcross School in the Yukon he directs attention to the immediate need of a pole saw machine in order that the wood supply for next winter may be cut at once and piled up to dry. He states that the balance wheel of the old machine is badly cracked, the mandrel worn out, and thirty teeth missing from the saw itself. He suggests that a machine with a 36\" blade as advertised by the T. Eaton Co. would be the most suitable for the purpose. I have consulted this Company with regard to the cost of a good pole saw machine complete, delivered f.o.b. Carcross and their estimate is \u00a375.00. As this item of equipment is urgently required, and is inexpensive, I shall be deeply obliged if your Department will kindly undertake to meet this expenditure, and authorize me to arrange for the purchase and forwarding of the machine in question.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 4)\nOttawa, May 19, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to a pole saw machine for the Carcross Indian Residential School.

The original estimate was $75.00, but as the pole saw is classed as saw mill machinery, it was shipped at a lower rate, and consequently the actual cost is lower than the estimate.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\nWinnipeg, Man. June 12th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will recall that on page 6 of my letter of December 16th last, I recommended that careful consideration be given by your Department to the possibility of making greater use of the water power which is available within 300 yds. of our Carcross School. In your reply to my letter of January 11th, 1929, 116-1-5, you stated that Mr. Hawksley was being requested to furnish a report on the water power, but so far as I am aware, no further action has been taken in the matter by your Department.\n\nYou will be interested to know that the Principal of this School, the Rev. J. H. Byrne, succeeded in building a dam which, for a short time, withstood the heavy pressure of the immense quantity of water collected in the reservoir thus created, but it finally gave way, and another dam was thrown across the channel of the stream, and from a telegram received from Mr. Byrne this morning it is quite clear that this dam is still standing, and a laudable effort is being made to utilize the water power which for many years has been allowed to go to waste. The Principal secured a water wheel and has installed the same at the dam, and this is now being used to pump water across the garden near the School. In his telegram dated June 12th, he requests that the following equipment be supplied immediately:\n\n3 whirling sprays at $2.00 each.\n3, 50' lengths of garden hose.\n400', 1\u00bd\" pipe.\n\nThe Principal states that if he is supplied with this equipment a continuous stream of water could be pumped to the tank in the school attic, in addition to the watering of the garden. I am unable to give you the exact cost of this equipment f.o.b. Carcross, but feel assured that it would not exceed $200.00. The whirling sprays\nlisted at $2.00 each. The hose lengths of 50' are listed in Eaton's catalogue at $4.15 each, or $12.45 for the 3. The piping is listed in Eaton's catalogue at 26\u00a2 a ft. or $104.00 for the 400'. This would make a total of $122.00. To this must be added the shipping charges which I am unable to give, but feel assured that it would not exceed $200.00.\n\nI shall be obliged if you will inform me by wire if your Department will authorize this expenditure.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nOttawa, June 18, 1930.\n\nDR. T. B. R. WESTGATE,\n39 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nYou may expend two hundred dollars Carcross school as recommended your letter twelfth instant.\n\nA. F. MacKENZIE.\n\nChg. Dept. I. A.\nOttawa, June 18, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letters, No. 2335-5 of April 5th and January 31st, last, concerning improvements at the Carcross Indian Residential School. In view of the various minor improvements, some of which are quite costly, the Department has been forced to postpone the erection of the proposed addition. In any case, the correspondence with your office and with the church authorities leaves the Department somewhat in doubt as to what rooms should be provided in the new addition. You recommend that the laundry be continued in the basement of the present building. Dr. Westgate is of the opinion that it might be well to include the laundry in the new building. It is agreed that recreation rooms for both boys and girls are needed in the new building. The church officers are asking that a chapel or assembly room be provided. During the next few months, it is desired that the Rev. Principal and yourself, representing the Church and the Department, prepare a joint recommendation concerning the uses to which the new building should be put and prepare a rough sketch, indicating the best position for it. Your joint recommendation and report could then be reviewed by the Department Architect. I shall take steps to see that Parliament is asked to provide funds for the addition next year.\n\nAt the present time, funds can be found for the other improvements, and I have to authorize you to make arrangements to supply and install laundry machinery, recommended in your letter of April 5th, last, at an approximate cost of $2,500. The plaster remaining on the main building should be removed and replaced with beaver board and all the beaver board painted or calcimined. A new floor may be laid in the children's dining room and in the sewing room. The new floor in the sewing room should be varnished. The Department does not consider linoleum necessary. Two new tables and benches may be built for the pupils' dining room. You may arrange for resurfacing the concrete floor in the furnace room, laundry and basement corridors.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Yukon.\n\nThe walls in\nThe walls in the furnace room nearest the chimney should be protected, as you have recommended in Item No. 14 of your letter of January 31st. A new door may be purchased for the furnace and new treads placed on the basement stairs. Please arrange to creosote the exterior walls of the stock barn. You may also supply whatever paint materials are required for the new floors and the main corridor and halls. You may have the woodshed lined with two inch rough planking and place new treads on the stairs leading to the yard. New flooring may be placed in the stalls of the barn. You may examine the condition of the old ice house and, if you find that a new one is required, you may make the necessary arrangements.\n\nYou may arrange for these improvements on a day labour basis, under the supervision of a competent foreman. You should purchase the machinery and materials to the best advantage, after securing competitive prices where possible.\n\nI add, for your information, that the Department is today authorizing Dr. Westgate, by telegram, to expend the sum of $200 in water connections from a new water wheel, which the Principal has been successful in installing at a dam in the nearby stream. The Principal believes that, with this equipment, he can have a continuous stream of water to the tank in the school attic. In addition to watering the garden. I will have these accounts forwarded from the church offices, but I write to let you know that the Department is allowing this improvement also.\n\nIn connection with the sketch for the proposed addition and the uses to which the new space should be put, the Rev. Principal should cooperate with Dr. Westgate's office before concurring in the joint recommendation with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nOttawa, June 18, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of the 13th ultimo, with reference to the proposed addition and the other improvements at the Carcross Indian Residential School. Mr. Hawksley's recommendations regarding improvements other than the addition are so extensive and in some cases so costly, that the Department is forced, because of lack of funds, to postpone the addition until Parliament provides additional funds.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of my letter of today's date to Mr. Hawksley, authorizing improvements and expenditure of over $6,000. If any improvements, which you believe are really urgent, are not included in this authority, you should write to the Department without delay. I may say that your letter of December 16th, last, was recapitulated for Mr. Hawksley's attention and recommendations and his answer is the basis for the various improvements mentioned in today's letter to him.\n\nThe Department regrets that the addition cannot be proceeded with this year, but our funds are so low that no item may be overexpended.\n\nI wish to confirm my telegram of today's date, with reference to 400 ft. of pipe, garden hose, etc., as follows:-\n\n\"You may expend two hundred dollars Carcross School, as recommended your letter twelfth instant.\"\n\nActing Asst.

The following is an extract from her letter addressed to our Commission on Sept. 3rd last:\n\n\"Needs of building. The carpenters arrived today and started on repairs, beaver-boarding etc. Among the things I note, is need of locks and keys for all outside doors. I do not feel safe without some way of locking up nights. A great deal of glass is needed. About 60 panes of different sizes; may have to order some before hearing from you, as weather is turning very cold now. No clock in the building is going, can we have one or two? If we could have a linoleum rug for dining room (staff) and some paint, it would save that floor. Also kitchen needs linoleum in centre. If we had some paint and varnish believe Mr. Ginn and the boys could help fix up staff rooms unless the department are doing it in their contract. We need for staff rooms, blinds, rugs, at least one comfortable chair, some white enamel paint for beds. The children's beds need painting, but so many springs are broken, no good, seems a waste of paint to touch them. Need some new furniture for...\"\ninfirmary, room is empty at present, and if illness came have no place to isolate a child. A rummer on main hall, would save both floor and labor, if one to wax. Staff need some new furniture for sitting room especially chairs.\"\n\nIt has occurred to me that Mr. Hawksley might find it possible to provide many of the requirements mentioned by the Deaconess out of the grant you have already sanctioned. He would not, of course, feel free to take such action without an authorization from you, and I shall be obliged if you will furnish him with this at your earliest convenience.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, October 9, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to added improvements at the Carcross Indian Residential School. Replacements to furnishings should really be made from the per capita or other earnings; but, in view of the need, I am authorizing Mr. Hawksley to expend $300 for this purpose. He is also receiving authority for locks and keys for the outside doors, 80 panes of glass and paint and varnish for the staff rooms - the school to do the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C.

As the Department wishes to put this building in good condition this year, I am, at the request of the church authorities, instructing you to make certain additional minor improvements. You may secure 80 panes of glass, locks and keys for the outside doors and paint and varnish for the staff rooms. The painting labour will be provided by the school management. It is also represented that furnishings, of one kind or another, need replacement.

I note that you authorize the purchase of 80 panes of glass. Am I to understand that these 80 panes are to be purchased over and above the glass that the Church authorities were sending to the school?\n\nAll the doors and locks were examined by me, after noting the condition of them instructions were given to the foreman carpenter to make the necessary repairs, and where necessary, to put in new locks and keys and handles. You will find an account for these along with other accounts that I am forwarding to the Department.\n\nAs already reported, paints, etc., have already been purchased and the account forwarded. In view of the large amount of painting to be done and the school understaffed, it was considered advisable to engage the services of a painter to do the work before the new wood and beaver board became soiled. The greater part of the interior of the institution had to be done and only one man on the staff, with his other duties it would have taken a very long time to do the painting and floor varnishing. I am hoping the Department will approve the action taken.\n\nRegarding the furnishings I am asking the Acting Principal what is most urgently needed, the size and number of cots required and the size of the blinds and number wanted. These things will be ordered as soon as I hear from the school, keeping in view the amount appropriated for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley.\n\nA.F.

CARCROSS\n\n(a) Two storey annex to rear side of main building, the upper storey to be used as chapel and assembly room, and the lower storey as a laundry. At present this school has no chapel, no special laundry room or modern laundry equipment, and no recreation rooms. Where the winters are so long all of these are very necessary. A room in the basement has to serve as laundry and Boys' recreation room. The girls use the sewing room as a recreation room.\n\nEstimated cost $10,000.00\n\nN.B. (In connection with this requirement the Society's Field Secretary desires to direct the attention of the Department to the interview which he had with the Supt. of Indian Education on May 15th, 1929, and on Sept. 17th, 1930, when the same was considered, and the Supt. requested that a special note be made in this list of requirements of the urgency of this particular need. See letter June 18th, 1930, #166-1-5, addressed to Mr. Indian Supt. Hawkesley by the Acting Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\n(b) A cold storage room for meat and fish in summer.\n\nEstimated cost $500.00.\n\n(c) Chicken house.\n\nEstimated cost $200.00\n\n(d) New forge.\n\nEstimated cost $40.00.\n\n(e) The improvements in my letter of December 16th, 1929, which have not as yet been provided, with special attention to (a) a better roadway from the school to the town (see your letter Jan. 27th, 1930, #166-1-9 (b) a bridge across the arm of the lake between the school and the town (c) provision to make greater use of the water power available.\nSir:-\n\nThe Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School is asking for 22 Mattresses and 7 pillows for use in the dormitories and for the installation of another hot water tank. With the new laundry equipment a greater supply of hot water is needed which the existing tank is not capable of supplying. A local engineer offers to install an addition to the present system which supply all the hot water needed at a cost of $50.00 including material and labor. If this latter expenditure is authorized by the Department will you please be good enough to advise me by wire, the matter is urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F.

A.\nOttawa, February 10, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd ultimo, relative to the request of the Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School to be supplied with 22 mattresses and 7 pillows and for the installation of another hot water tank for the laundry. In reply I have to confirm the following night lettergram to you of today's date:\n\n\"Reference your letter third ultimo, provided payment can be deferred until April next, you may incur expenditure approximately fifty dollars installing extra hot water tank for laundry, Carcross school. No funds for mattresses and pillows.\"\n\nOur funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are entirely assigned, and the accounts covering the expenditure incurred in installing the hot water tank should not be rendered until April, next, when a new appropriation will be available. The Principal or yourself should see that satisfactory job is completed in the installation of the tank, and, when forwarding the account covering the expenditure, it should be in duplicate and properly certified by yourself.\n\nRegarding the mattresses and pillows, I would refer you to the second last paragraph of your letter dated January 31, 1930, with reference to a request of the church authorities to be supplied at that time with mattresses and pillows for the boys' dormitory. It is thought that the reason stated by you for not recommending the supplying of the mattresses at that time would apply in the case of the present request. Besides, as stated in telegram above referred to, the Department has no funds available to supply this equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I regret that it is necessary to return these accounts for further information.\n\nA receipt for the wages paid Dan Gillis, to the amount of $30, should accompany the account of W. H. Simpson for the labour. The account should also be rendered in duplicate, if possible. An itemized, receipted account covering the hardware purchased from W. A.

When I left, however, the repairs had not yet been completed, and having this also matter not yet straightened, I intended sending them in together.\n\n3. Bruce Robinson Electric.\n\nYour file will no doubt show that permission was given me to wire for the repairs mentioned, early in April.\n\nDeparts were sent C.O.D. Consequently payment had to be made immediately. I wrote, asking for receipt and received the enclosed. The difficulty is obvious. My telegram, coinciding with the date of permission, is dated Apr. 17. The date of shipment is given as Jan. 21. Of course that should read April 21st. Doubting the possibility of being able to get by, I wrote, asking for other receipt but received no reply. I have since written three times with the same result, and so concluded the\nonly thing to do was turn the matter over to you with explanations.\n\nOf course when leaving the school I had to accept the responsibility for these accounts. They will be payable, therefore, to me personally.\n\nI am sorry I could not get the affair turned over to you earlier, and that it is still not as perfect as it might be.\n\nI have recently received a request from the commission asking for more details regarding the overdraft on the school account. In view of the letter I dispatched you without delay, explaining the difficulties involved in my action - an action taken purely to expedite the repair - I could not but regret that you allowed the matter to run on. Needless to say, it not only has left matters in an unsatisfactory condition at the bank, but has hindered a complete settlement between the commission and myself.\nHowever, it is straight at last.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJ.H.

Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWINNIPEG, MAN., March 11th, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe - Addition to Carcross School.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of May 13th, 1930, and your reply to the same on June 18th, 1930, relative to an addition to our Carcross school, I beg to state that in a letter just received from the Principal he informs me that Mr. Simpson, a contractor at Whitehorse, was instructed by Mr. Indian Superintendent Hawksley to visit the school and to submit two plans - one for an annex to the main school building, and the other for a detached building to be used solely for a recreation room for the boys and girls. The Principal states that a detached building to serve merely as a combined recreation room for boys and girls would not meet the needs of the case, and I fully agree with him.\n\nThe Principal also states that Mr. Simpson favours the building of a three story annex to the main school building at the rear corner of the building, and extending in the direction of the work-shop. The annex will be 23' wide, and at least 24' long, (I think it should be at least 30' long). This building could be heated from the central heating plant, by adding one or more units to that plant. The plant is such that this can easily be done. The full sized basement of the annex could be used as a boys recreation room with an outside entrance, as well as with an inside entrance through the laundry. The window in the basement of the room used as a laundry at present, could easily be converted into a doorway.\n\nThe first floor above the basement could be used as a chapel and auditorium, entrance to the same being through a small room used as a mending room.\n\nThe third story could be used as a dormitory for the younger children.\nMr. Simpson is of the opinion that the only alternative to this plan of providing the additional space required would be to extend the whole of one end of the main school building. To do this one end of the building would have to be taken out completely, and the cost would be a great deal more than if the annex were built as suggested above. It would also spoil the symmetry of the building, unless an extension were made at the other end as well. If an appropriation is available to extend the building at both ends the plan is worthy of careful consideration. If funds are not available I would strongly recommend that the three story annex at the corner be built. A detached building, without a basement, to be heated by stoves and to serve as a combined recreation room for both boys and girls as suggested by Mr. Indian Superintendent Hawksley will not, I trust, be seriously considered by your Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, March 16, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the erection of an addition to the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will have no funds for major improvements this next fiscal year and will, therefore, be unable to authorize the erection of the new addition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian Affairs\nDawson Y.T.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was over to Carcross, and talked to Mr Grant about the additions to be made to the school, and I am sending you a rough drawing of what we agreed to be the most suitable. By placing the playrooms where I have we do not shut out any light from the rooms, and can be heated from the same boiler and easy supervised by the staff. The boys play room will be in the basement, and the girls on the next floor, the top floor can be used as a boys dormitory if necessary. I show an addition on the north end of 26 ft, but can be made any size you think needed. The elevation to conform to the old building. I could not find any plans of the building at the school you may have them at Dawson, if not they will have a copy in Ottawa. Matthew Watson had a blue print of the steam pipes, so I borrowed that to work from. If you go ahead with the play room I would advise the use of 4 in second grade maple.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nReferring to the suggested addition to the Carcross Indian Residential School, in accordance with your instructions, under another cover, I am forwarding a rough sketch plan of the addition. I am also sending a copy of the letter of W.H. Simpson, Contractor of Whitehorse, in explanation of the plan.\n\nThese plans were suggested and agreed to by the Principal of the school. May I say that the plan submitted conforms with my idea of a practical and useful addition. Playrooms are badly needed at this institution.\n\nAn alternative plan would be a one story recreation room attached to the ground floor where the girl's playroom is shown on the plan. This would be less expensive than the three story addition.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F.

J. Hawksley,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nDAWSON, Y.T.\n\nRev. and Dear Sir:-\n\nActing on instructions received in your letter dated Dec. 19th. 1930 Mr. Rose, Machinist, of this town was urged to get to work and instal the new laundry equipment. This has been done and it is now in operation. Statements in triplicate showing the cost are enclosed. In order to connect up the washer with the hot and cold water system in the school certain pipe fittings were necessary; others were needed in order to connect up the overflow from the washer and extractor with the sewerage system and pipe fittings were also needed for the exhaust on the engine. I may say that no pipe fittings were sent in with the machinery and it was necessary for Mr. Rose to obtain them locally. In many cases they were hard to get and it was necessary for him to spend a certain amount of time locating what was needed. I feel sure that when you see the work you will, like myself be very satisfied with what has been done. Mr. Rose was instructed to put a pipe railing up in order to keep the children away from the moving belts. The pipe for this purpose was found at the school with the exception of a 12' length and 4 - 1\" flanges. I trust that the putting up of this safeguard will meet with your approval.\n\nThe enclosed letter indicates that the Teacher here is sending out report cards to the parents on the children's progress in school. It also shows that the parents appreciate hearing regularly from their children whilst at school. As stated in a previous letter the evening of the 2nd. Tuesday in each month is set apart for letter writing.\nWe were pleased to have a visit from Bishop Stringer. He arrived here on Jan. 28th, 1931 and stayed until Feb 2nd, 1931. Whilst he was here we conducted our February Fire Drill. The children were in bed when the bell rang and the time it took them to get out of the building was as follows:\n\nBoys, 3 minutes\nGirls, 4 minutes.\n\nPhysical Drill Classes for the boys and girls are in full swing. We are however, somewhat restricted in what we can do through lack of equipment such as boxing gloves, dumb-bells, Indian Clubs etc. It would be much appreciated if your Department could do something to supply this need. Personally I am a great advocate for Physical Drill for Indian children and I feel that anything done along that line is of great benefit to the scholars.\n\nTrusting that you will give the matters in this letter your usual considerate attention,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nA.C. Grant\nPrincipal.\n## Statement\n\n**January 31st, 1931**\n\nMr. G.

Sir:-\n\nOwing to the fact that we are so far away from a firm which supplies parts for a Delco Plant, that winter is approaching and that we have no spare parts on hand in case of a breakdown, I respectfully request that your Department authorize an expenditure in this connection which will cover the following items:\n\n1 only Ignition Coil\n1 Set of Commutator Brushes for Generator\n1 Starting Switch\n1 Contact Arm with Breaker points.\n\nThe type of plant installed in this school is known as \"3 K.W. 110 Volt Plant with 160 Ampere Hour Battery\".\n\nI do not think that the cost of the above parts will exceed $30.00. The same can be procured from John Redden Co. Ltd., 1294 Granville Street, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH. C. Grant\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith copy of letter from the Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School asking for a small supply of spare parts for the lighting plant at the school.\n\nAt present the plant is working well and is in a satisfactory condition.

The two accounts in question are as follows:\n\nOctober 1930. Window Glass Supplied to School.............$4.71.\nDecember 1930. Installing a Kitchen Range Supplied by the Department of Indian Affairs.......$30.00\n\nThe Rev. J. Hawksley, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Yukon who is now visiting the school remembers the first account going through his office but not the second.\n\nIt is more than possible that these accounts have been paid and that Mr. Watson has failed to credit his account with the amount but just the same a word from you to the effect that the cheques have been issued would be appreciated.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa 2nd October, 1931.\n\nRevd.

Topping, who, at the time was acting principal. Upon her arrival at the institution she found so many windows broken that she ordered the glass from Matthew Watson without knowing that it was necessary to obtain the authority of the Department to make the purchase.\n\nRegarding the installation of the range, I may say that the range was purchased by authority of the Department. The principal was instructed to get M. Watson to install it.\n\nLast September, when I was at Carcross, Matthew Watson said he was not sure whether he had received payment for either the glass or the installation of the range. I had no recollection of the vouchers having passed through my office and suggested that it was very possible that he had not sent them in. Apparently he sent them to the principal who forwarded them to the Department instead of to this office.\n\nThe glass was received and all the windows have been repaired. The kitchen range was properly installed and is now working very satisfactorily.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F.

As this glass was ordered for replacements by the Acting Principal without the authority of the Department and as our funds are extremely limited, the Department will be unable to make payment of this account. It should be paid by the school authorities from their per capita earnings or other receipts. The account submitted is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

For a time it looked as though a very serious fire would result. Fortunately the fire started in the afternoon, it only took one and a half minutes to get all the children out of the school. After all were removed to a place of safety attention was given to fighting the fire which was then burning fiercely, it looked as though the gasoline tank would explode any minute. However, by means of one of our Gardene fire extinguishers, the fire was got under control with practically no damage done to either the engine or the building.\n\nThe next morning the Principal and the Farm Instructor made some alterations on the gasoline tank which will prevent a similar occurrence in the future. These alterations consisted in placing the opening through which the gasoline tank is filled in a more accessible place and fitting this opening with a suitable plug. In the past we had some difficulty in filling the tank and, no matter how careful one was, a certain amount of gas would run over and the danger of it igniting from a backfire was considerable as we now realize.\n\nIt is gratifying to us as I know it will be to you to know that the damage caused is negligible and that the pumping plant is working very satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDawson,Y.T.December 31st,1931.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated November 27th, file No 166-1-5, with vouchers from Matthew Watson enclosed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I have returned the vouchers to Matthew Watson advising him that he will have to look to the school authorities for the payment for the window glass as it was purchased without the authority of the Department. He has also been informed that the account for the installation of the kitchen range at the school has been paid by Department cheque No 573, amount $30.00, and that the account was sent to the Department under cover of letter dated January 30th, 1931.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nChootla Indian Residential School,\nCarcross, Yukon, Canada.\nDec. 30th. 1931.\n\nThe Rev. J. Hawksley,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nDAWSON, Y.T.\n\nRev. Sir:-\n\nEnclosed you will find our Quarterly Return for the last Quarter in 1931. We trust that you will find it in order.\n\nDuring your visit to the school last fall certain items of equipment were discussed as being essential to our work here and it was decided that such were to be applied for to the Department through you early in 1932. We do trust that you will do all in your power to urge the Department to supply our needs and that allowance will be made for them when the estimates go before Parliament. They are as follows:-\n\nOne 14X15 Horse Power Hay Press. In a letter recently received from the McCormick Deering Farm Implement Co., 1905 Main St., Vancouver B.C. we are informed that this hay press would cost $626.00 F.O.B. Carcross. If this press is equipped with a self feed attachment $60.00 must be added to the above price. Whilst such a self feed would be useful yet it is not essential. The main thing is the hay press. If we had one of these items of equipment I feel sure that we would have no trouble in obtaining sufficient hay for our needs each year. As you know there is very little hay close to the school and to endeavour to bring loose hay any distance takes a great deal of time and is very wasteful. We do trust that you will regard this hay press as one of our prior needs.\n\nDental Work on the Children's Teeth. Last year a grant of $100.00 was made in this connection. We trust that a similar grant can be made for 1932 or even better for the Department to enter into a contract with Dr. Williams for a period of three years at $150.00 a year. Under such a contract Dr. Williams would visit the school twice each year and do all necessary dental work. The $100.00 grant made last year was not sufficient to permit the dentist to do all\nthe work that should have been done.\n\nA Ram to be installed in the Creek. I cannot give you much information concerning this but I believe that Mr. C.F. Johnson of Dawson in the past went into the matter carefully and can supply all the necessary particulars.\n\nOf the above three requirements we would ask you to give the purchase of a hay press priority. As you know the Commission are supplying us with another horse and consequently more hay will be needed next winter than this. The problem of getting hay home, which has to be cut some distance from the school, will be solved if we are fortunate enough to obtain a hay press.\n\nFeeling sure that you will do all you can for us regarding the above,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.C.M. Grant.\nPrincipal.\nDawson,Y.T. January 14th,1932.\n\nSir:-\n\nThe enclosed letter from the principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School came to hand by last mail.

H. C. M. Grant, Principal of this school, he informed me that this account was returned to Mr. Watson by Mr. Indian Supt. Hawksley with a covering letter in which he stated, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The account $84.71, the cost of the window glass supplied has been returned here by the Department with covering letter in which it is stated that as this glass was ordered without the authority of the Department by the Acting Principal of the school and funds being extremely limited, the Department will be unable to pay this account. It should be paid by the school authorities from their per capita grant or other receipts.\"\n\nFrom our records I find that I wrote to you on October 3rd., 1930, setting forth the need of the glass, paint, etc., and in your reply to my letter on October 9th. 1930, #166-1-5, you informed me that Mr. Hawksley was receiving authority from your Department to provide the same.\nI shall be obliged, therefore, if you will reconsider the matter and kindly furnish Mr. Matthew Watson with your cheque to cover the enclosed bill.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/W\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, February 12, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School in which he requests that a hay press be supplied, also that a ram be installed in the creek to provide a water supply, and that arrangements be made with a dentist to carry out the dental work required by the pupils.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department has no funds to provide the cost of supplying a hay press or installing a ram in the creek. Regarding dental services, I have to say that you will be further advised in a separate communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I am enclosing herewith the latest report from the principal of the Carcross school. He sends a report to this office each time a fire drill is carried out.\n\nBoth dormitories are equipped with fire escapes and there is a good supply of fire extinguishers and fire hose, the pupils are drilled in the use of these, the hose is kept constantly attached to the water pipes and can be brought into use at a moment's notice. A gasoline driven pump is in use at Carcross.\n\nSt Paul's Hostel is only three minutes from the Dawson Fire Hall from where prompt assistance would be rendered in case of fire.

Realizing that these repairs were urgent and very necessary an order was sent at once to Marshall-Wells, Vancouver for the replacements required, this was done without first obtaining authority from the Department to make the purchase. It is hoped that my action will be approved.\n\nEnclosed herewith I am forwarding vouchers for the material supplied by the above mentioned firm, also vouchers from the Principal for a refund of the amount of the freight charges paid by him on the new castings. Included in the vouchers from the school are charges for the transportation of Jesse Williams from Carcross and return for treatment in hospital for pneumonia, a telegram to Mrs Williams of Atlin informing her of the nature of her daughter's illness, and a phone call to Dr Wride from Carcross to Whitehorse.\n\nEnclosures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 5)\nOttawa, September 10, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 2335-5 of the 18th ultimo, with reference to certain repairs required at the Carcross Indian Residential School. In reply I have to say that the account which you forwarded will be paid.\n\nFrom your letter, it is inferred that the staff did not take proper care of the kitchen range and the furnace, and, under the circumstances, as the Department is paying for the repairs, it is considered that the school management should bear the cost of the transportation of these repairs from Vancouver to the school. The cost of this, viz.: $2.65, is not being paid.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

Will you please be good enough to advise me whether the department will authorize this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, September 23, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 27th ultimo, regarding the overhauling of the Delco lighting plant at the Carcross Indian Residential School, I have to say that, as no estimate of the expenditure required for the purpose was given, the Department is not aware as to the cost that would be involved. Our funds this year are so limited that it is necessary to make careful investigation before authorizing any expenditure. It may be that new batteries or other expensive equipment are required to place the lighting plant in good, serviceable condition. If only a small expenditure is necessary in repairing this plant, the Department will approve of the work being carried out, and you may arrange to have the work completed. If, however, it is necessary that any extensive repairs be made, full particulars should be forwarded, together with an estimate of the cost, before the work is undertaken.\n\nYou might advise the Department if there is a member on the staff who is competent to handle the lighting and other equipment at this school.\n\nShould any minor repairs be carried out to the lighting plant, you should forward a voucher, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Whilst not exactly the same as the original yet it will answer the purpose. It appears that the one which was worn out is an obsolete type and no longer on the market.\n\nWhen this hinge was ordered I had no intention of paying for the same at this end but today Mr. Puckett sent me the invoices already receipted so feel that the best thing to do is to send him a cheque for the amount and apply for a refund from your Department. You will find all necessary papers enclosed. I trust that this procedure will meet with your approval. We have an arrangement with Mr. Puckett whereby he always receipt our school accounts when they are rendered and the cheque sent later, and it is evident that he has done the same with the accounts for the floor hinge.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.U.M.

September 6th,1932.\n\nSir:-\n\nEnclosed herewith are vouchers for the sum of $11.00 in payment of spring floor hinge for the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Principal has paid W.A.Puckett for the hinge and is now seeking a refund from the Department. I may say that the hinge was required to replace one on the swing door leading from the kitchen to the dining room. During my visit to the school this door fell down, upon examination we found that the spring hinge was completely worn out. The principal was authorized to get a new spring to replace the broken one, this was considered both urgent and necessary.

The burning out of firebacks is just an ordinary circumstance especially when wood is the only fuel used.

He is of the opinion that this new automatic draft regulator may come under urgent and necessary repairs.\n\nThe school staff had removed the old and useless regulator and installed the new one consequently there is no charge for labor.\n\nI may add that owing to the worn out and useless condition of the old regulator a new one was badly needed. The purchase was not authorized by the Department.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F.

The plan in mind is to have a competent workman take the engine apart and give it a general overhaul. When I was at the school in September the plant was running smoothly; the storage batteries were in good order but it was felt that it would be wise to have the engine taken apart and thoroughly examined and put in good order before the extra strain of the winter when the engine has many hours of extra running. The cost should not be heavy possibly about $25.00.

Fortunately this crack has not become serious enough to put the engine out of commission. It is only a matter of time before this crack will penetrate and cause an opening in the cylinder wall. It was also noted that the wall of the cylinder was badly scored which causes a low compression.\n\nThe principal goes on to say that acting on the advice of the engineer, Mr Rose, he has ordered a new cylinder from Vancouver. Mr Rose will put the new cylinder in without further charge.\n\nThese repairs were both urgent and necessary and he expresses the hope that the Department will approve of what has been done.\n\nEnclosures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F.

Grant,\nChootla Indian Residential School,\nCarcross, Yukon.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of December 5th received regarding the cracked and scored cylinder on your 3 K.W. Delco plant. The piston pin is of the full floating type and should have aluminum buttons on each end to eliminate the condition you mention.\n\nRegarding the installation of a new cylinder, we do not believe that this would be very satisfactory without the installation of a new wrist pin and piston, as there is bound to be considerable wear. Your present piston would make a poor fit in your cylinder and cause you considerable difficulty with oil pumping etc.\n\nWe are therefore taking the liberty of shipping you a rebored cylinder, new piston and rings, cylinder head and cylinder base gaskets.\n\nThese parts are all fitted and we are supplying them to you for $39.50 f.o.b. Vancouver. We believe you will find this a very satisfactory and reasonable replacement, as a new cylinder lists $37.50, piston $15.00, 3 rings - $1.00, Piston pin - $3.25 head gasket - 25\u00a2 and base gasket 15\u00a2, making a total of $57.10 f.o.b. Vancouver.\n\nYou will, therefore, note that we are making the entire replacement for only $2.00 more than the cost of a new cylinder. To make this replacement it is necessary for us to ask you to return your used cylinder as it would be necessary for us to have this re-operated to make us another replacement assembly.\n\nThe return of this cylinder, of course, depends on whether the crack you mentioned is on the surface only or into the cylinder walls. Should this crack be in the cylinder wall itself the cylinder will be of no further value, and we would ask you to scrap it.\n\n(Signed) G.W. Hambling - Sales Manager.\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION          | UNIT PRICE | AMOUNT |\n|----------|----------------------|------------|--------|\n| Ordered  | Shipped              |            |        |\n| 1        | 1                    | Restored Cylinder |        |\n| 1        | 1                    | Piston     |        |\n| 3        | 3                    | Rings      |        |\n| 1        | 1                    | Pin        |        |\n| 1        | 1                    | Cyl.

These expenditures were incurred by authority of E.R.$00.\n\nIt will be noted that W.A. Puckett has receipted his voucher for the batteries supplied, I beg to say that no payment has been made to him. In receipting his voucher he was following a practice that formerly prevailed in the Yukon Territory when vouchers connected with Government expenditures were rendered.\n\nThe estimated cost of the repairs was $35.00; later it was found that 8 batteries instead of 12 were required for the fire alarm system. The low pressure steam gauge and syphon cost less than the prices shown in the catalogue and the work was done in less time than calculated. The entire cost of the repairs, which have been efficiently carried out, is $21.78 being $13.22 less than the estimated cost.\n\nEnclosures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley.\n\nA.F.

The batteries in use are so run down that it is not now possible to charge them, and the new ones are therefore urgently required.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, November 24th., 1935.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nBatteries for Lighting Plant at Carcross School.\n\nWriting on the 10th instant, the Rev. Principal Grant of our Carcross School in the Yukon, directs the attention of our Commission to the need of new batteries for the lighting plant at this institution, and I have been instructed to refer this urgent need to your Department for consideration and the necessary action. In his letter the Principal states that the school records show the present batteries were installed in the Spring of 1929. As batteries do not usually last beyond four years, it seems to our Commission that the time has fully come when a new set is required, and they sincerely hope you may be able to provide them. The Principal's requisition for gasoline for the current quarter is 10 cases above the average, and he states that at the present rate of consumption (Nov. 10th) an extra 20 cases will be required \"to see us through to the end of the year\". As \"the ammeter shows that the generator is generating at its usual rate\", he is convinced that the batteries are nearly worn out, and should be replaced. He is being instructed by our Commission to reduce the load as much as possible, but our Commission greatly hope you may be able to supply new batteries at an early date, as they consider it would be a serious matter for a school so remotely situated to be left without light during the long, dark nights of winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDecember 2, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd with reference to the need of new storage batteries for the electric lighting plant at the Carcross School, I beg to say that the Department is now obtaining prices for a new set of batteries and it is expected that an order will be placed in the very near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Before this wire was sent we had Mr. Fred Gray from Whitehorse examine the plant so that we and your Department could have the opinion of an expert. Apart from what was said in the wire we may add that this electrician stated during his visit that the breakdown was in no way the fault of those operating same. He has had the same experience in connection with his lighting equipment in Whitehorse. Our breakdown was simply caused by a complete breakdown in the commutator with of course resulting short circuit. As we have had to resort to coal oil lamps as a means of illumination we trust that your Department will speedily sanction the necessary repairs.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH. C. M.

If your Department raise any question we would beg to state for your information that the estimate we gave of $150.00 was given to us by Mr. Fred Gray of Whitehorse who is supposed to be a qualified electrician. Furthermore it is evident from the attached accounts that Boulbee Ltd. only did work that was absolutely necessary. Our Delco Plant is now running satisfactorily.\n\n2.

In his report he embodied a list of urgent requirements, and our Commission at a meeting held on the 18th instant authorized a very considerable expenditure on behalf of the Principal's residence for such items as linoleum with under-felt; steel bath tub; stove, etc. They also authorized an expenditure of $125.00 for heavy bob sleighs for use next winter. The equipment which our Commission felt your Department should supply is as follows:\n\n- 2 new beds; 21 new bed springs; 45 mattresses;\n- 2 Singer sewing machines, and 1 hay press.\n\nWhile writing about the requirements of the Carcross School, I may say that there are many similar requirements at all our schools, most of which have been embodied in the comprehensive list sent to your Department last October, and our Commission thought it would save a great deal of correspondence and enable them to carry out improvements during the summer months if they were informed of the amount of the grant which would be available for each school, and they were authorized to incur the necessary expenditure up to the amount authorized on the most urgent improvements and items of equipment.\n\nTrusting both these matters may receive your early and sympathetic consideration, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 5)\nOttawa, June 29, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to certain equipment that you recommend be supplied to the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nSince the first of this year, the Department has expended approximately $1,000 at the Carcross School, in repairs to the Delco lighting plant and the purchase of a new set of batteries. In view of this, the Department is not in a position to provide much additional expenditure at the Carcross School.

I have the honour to report that on August 7th, 1934, I inspected the above mentioned School and found everything in order, and every evidence to indicate affairs were being conducted in accordance with the Department's wishes.\n\n2. The School is now full, 40 pupils, the number the Department is willing to allow the per capita grant, and during my visit I found that every precaution was being taken for their safety and to guard against epidemics. Those present appeared to be well nourished, well clothed, and in every way happy and contented.\n\n3. Upon examining the main building I found most of the woodwork of the exterior badly in need of paint, particularly the shingles of the roof and at the gables and base, they are commencing to warp and unless some action is taken next year to repaint these I am afraid they will have to be replaced later on.\n\n4. Several small outbuildings are in need of a coat of paint to preserve the woodwork; the icehouse is of new lumber and has not received a coat of paint since it was erected.\n\n5. Upon inspecting the dormitories I found them clean and well ventilated, the bed linen was in good condition and properly laundered, but I found the steeds sadly in need of paint; they are badly chipped and look very unpresentable, and a primary coat of white paint with enamel finish would vastly improve them.\n\n6. Upon inspecting the wash rooms in both the boys and girls dormitories, I found the two baths in each compartment in need of replacement, the linings are of zinc, they are old and appear to me to be very unsanitary. My recommendation is that white enamel linings should be installed, or at least new zinc ones.\n\n7. To place this Institution in a good state of repair I attach hereto a list of requirements, quoting approximate cost of material and labour, which I respectfully recommend for consideration, and if approved that the work be done next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[T.B. Caulkin] A/Supt.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\n/M.\nEncs.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, Sept. 25, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 1450-9 of the 36th ultimo, reporting on your inspection of the Carcross Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased to note that you found everything in order; that the children are well nourished and clothed and that every precaution is being taken for their safety and to guard against epidemics.\n\nRegarding the painting required to the exterior of the main school building and the several small outbuildings and also the installing of two new bath-tubs, I have to say that, when our Estimates are being prepared for the next fiscal year, consideration will be given to including funds for the purpose of carrying out the requirements as mentioned by you. The Department will have no funds during the present fiscal year to provide the cost of supplying the paint and other materials, as enumerated in the list of requirements enclosed in your letter above mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Winter is here and whilst we have had no cold weather yet such may be expected any day.\n\n2. If new sections were ordered and they would have to come from Toronto they would not likely reach us until after December 18th which would be leaving things rather late.\n\n3. If when taking the old boiler apart to install the new sections when received in the latter part of December, it was found other parts would be necessary it is almost certain that these also would have to be obtained from Toronto which would mean a further delay of over a month. The risk of having such a delay at such a time was felt could not be taken.\n\n4. It will be noted from one of the telegrams enclosed that the cost of four new sections is almost $400.00 F. O. B. Vancouver. Comparing this with the price of a new boiler $655.20 F. O. B. Vancouver it seems more economical to invest in a new boiler rather than to patch one up that has been in service twenty-three years.\n\n5. The engineer of the White Pass and Yukon Railway who examined the boiler felt that the interior was badly incrusted with scale so that it was this scale that was responsible for the sections cracking and leaking. Of course the real state of the boiler cannot be ascertained until the boiler is taken down and this cannot be done until we have the wherewithal on hand to carry out the repairs necessary or a new boiler on hand ready to be installed. The furnace is going too hot but only a slow fire can be kept which is just sufficient to keep a certain degree of warmth throughout the building at this time of the year. Of one thing the examining engineer was convinced and that was that it would not be safe to carry on through the winter with the boiler in the condition it is. It might give way during the cold weather when more or less heavy firing is imperative.\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted for your information and it is hoped that the action taken in ordering a new boiler will meet with the approval of the Department of Indian Affairs which you represent.\n\nI am enclosing herewith application for a refund of $9.50 this being the amount expended to date on telegrams to Vancouver concerning the breakdown in our heating system.\n\nThanking you for the promptitude in which you have dealt with this situation,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(signed)\n\nH. C. M. Grant,\nPrincipal\n\nENCS.\nThe Principal,\nIndian Residential School,\nCARCROSS, Y. T.\n\nDear Sir:\n\n1. I acknowledge herewith your letter and enclosures of the 30th ultimo in connection with the recent trouble experienced with the school heating plant, and the apparent advisability of installing a new boiler, rather than attempt to patch one up that has seen twenty-three years service, and under such circumstances it will appear evident that a new boiler is the only logical solution. This I shall be my recommendation accordingly to the Department. In the meantime I hope the weather will continue mild until the repairs are completed.\n\n2. Your voucher for the amount expended on telegrams in this connection has been forwarded the Department at Ottawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(T. B. Caulkin) Supt.,\nCommanding \"B\" Division\nR. C. M. Police\n\n/M.\nActing Superintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nForwarded.

In view of the circumstances reported by the Principal in his letter it appears that the installation of a new boiler is the most logical procedure to adopt, and I trust same will meet with the Department's approval. This is further to my radiogram of the 23rd ult. on this subject.\n\n(T. B. Caulkin) A/Supt.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nEncs.\nDawson, Y.

Regular fire drills are maintained and a very competent staff is in charge of the pupils, who appeared to be well nourished and clothed, and everything possible done for their welfare. In regard to this School I would refer to my Inspection Report of August 30th, 1934, wherein I recommended that certain repairs were considered necessary for the proper maintenance of the buildings, which I hope the Department will be able to approve this coming summer.\n\nThe pupils attending this school are gathered from all points in the Agency, the girls being trained domestically, and the boys in farming and other useful occupations and the progress made amply justifies its existence.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF REV.

I am in receipt of the following communication from the Principal of the Residential School at Carcross Y.T.\n\n\"One of the most pressing needs at this school now, and it has been so for many years, is the need of a Horse Power Hay Press. It would be appreciated if you would bring the need of this item of equipment to the attention of the Department of Indian Affairs and urge them to sanction the purchase of one before this year's hay cutting season commences. Most of our hay has to be cut at a considerable distance from the school and brought from that point to the school by water. Such a means of transportation certainly indicates strongly that the hay must be put up in bales. For the last few years we have managed to get the loan of a home made hay press the property of the man upon whose meadows we are permitted to cut hay. The fact that this hay press does not work at all satisfactorily and is often needed by the owner at the time we need it, makes such an arrangement decidedly inconvenient especially seeing that the time, when navigation is open, is very short. Such a Horse Power Hay Press as is urgently needed would cost approximately $600.00 F.O.B. Carcross.\"\n\n2. I expect to be in Carcross in the very near future and will take this matter up with the Principal, but am forwarding this request for your consideration and would recommend that if at all possible, a Hay Press as asked for should be supplied to this School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. Binning, A/Supt.\nDept Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nThe sum of $650 is provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year to supply paint, oil, turpentine, etc., and for labour in painting the buildings at the Indian Residential School, Carcross, Yukon Territory (Electoral District of Yukon). Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D., Field Secretary, M. S. C. C., has requested that the following work be carried out:\n\nPainting ceilings, main school building; shingle stain roofs, school and outbuildings; certain painting, interior of school building.\n\nHe estimated the cost of the paint, oil, turpentine, etc., to be $375, and the outside labour required, approximately $250.\n\nI beg to recommend, owing to the isolated location of the school, that the Principal be authorized to arrange for the purchase of the paint and materials required and for the labour and that he certify all accounts and forward them to the Department for payment.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the sum of $650 is provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year to supply paint, oil, turpentine, etc., and for labour in painting the buildings at the Carcross Indian Residential School. Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D., Field Secretary, M.S.C.C., informed the Department of the following requirements:\n\n1. Painting all ceilings in the main building.\n2. Painting ice-house.\n3. Supplying 2 gallons white paint.\n   and 2 \" enamel, to paint beds.\n4. Supplying 2 gallons copper paint for doors.\n5. \" 25 \" red shingle stain ) for school and\n   and 20 \" green \" outbuildings.\n   and also paint brushes, at an estimated cost of $14.\n\nDr. Westgate estimates the cost of the labour in carrying out the above painting at $250.\n\nI would request that you authorize the Principal to arrange for the purchase of the paint and materials required, to the best advantage possible and for the labour. The school staff should perform as much of the labour as possible. The Principal should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the paint, oil, turpentine and other materials and he should certify same in the usual manner. He should also keep accurate returns of the labour, giving full particulars as to days or hours employed and rate paid. All accounts should be forwarded through your office, and I would request that you attach them to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, regarding the request of the Principal, that a horse power hay press be supplied, at an approximate cost of $600. I regret that the Department will have no funds to pay the cost of this equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG.

Binning, A/Supt.\nDept Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nDawson Y.T.\n\nJuly 17th\n\nre:- Carcross Indian Residential School\n\nI beg to report that I visited the Indian Residential School at Carcross Y.T. on June 30th, and the following is a report of conditions found.\n\nBuildings.\nThese consist of the main school, workshops, and barns and are all the property of the Department. The Principal's residence which is just outside the fence surrounding the school property belongs to the Church authorities. All buildings were found in a good state of repair, except that the roofs and doors require painting, authority has now been obtained for these to be done.\n\nMEALS.\nThe meals served appear to be wholesome, varied and well cooked. I was present when meals were being served and all the pupils appeared to enjoy their meals. Excellent bread, both white and whole meal, is made at the school under the supervision of the kitchen matron. The store room and kitchen were found in very clean condition, as also was the pupils dining room. The store room was well stocked with provisions, an ample supply of fresh vegetables is produced generally sufficient to carry them through the winter. Milk and fresh eggs are obtained from the stock kept at the school.\n\nCLOTHING.\nThe pupils are well and warmly clothed and very neat in appearance. There was a good supply of clothing in the store room, both for boys and girls.\n\nTRAINING.\nThe pupils receive good training in manual work. The girls are taught cooking, laundry work, knitting and to make and repair their clothing, also personal cleanliness and in their surroundings. The boys are taught the first principles of farming, care of the stock, carpentry, shoe repairing and some sewing to enable them to repair their own clothing if necessary.\n\nCLEANLINESS.\nEvery room and dormitory in the building was closely inspected and all found to be spotlessly clean and everything neatly in its place. Each pupil has a small rack in the washroom for the tooth brush, soap and tooth brush, and all pupils clean their teeth at least twice each day under the supervision of the matron. The grounds surrounding the school are kept free from litter of all kinds, the pupils being taught to bring in all their sports equipment and put them in the places reserved for it, so the grounds are always tidy.\nHEALTH.\n\nThe general health of the pupils has been good during the past year, with the exception of a mild epidemic of influenza in the spring; every pupil suffered from this and it was necessary to close the school for a short time. Several minor accidents happened to the pupils during the year, but all made good recovery. Every care is taken by the staff to ensure as far as possible the health of the children under their care, close attention being paid to proper ventilation and other hygienic matters.\n\nTraining in School.\n\nIt was reported to me that the pupils are very attentive in the school room, a good average of marks being obtained in the various subjects. I was shown samples of writing and other work and it was very creditable.\n\nDISCIPLINE.\n\nThe discipline of the pupils is excellent, they are orderly, obedient and attentive and their deportment is very good; this is very evident in the fire drill, they are quick and respond to the alarm in an orderly manner. The staff and pupils appear to be familiar with what each should do in case of fire.\n\nREQUIREMENTS.\n\nI went into the matter of requirements very closely with the Principal, these were kept as low as possible but the following are considered essential.\n\n1 Singer Sewing Machine, to replace one badly worn out and which is causing lots of trouble in doing necessary work.\n\n4 White Enamel Bath Tubs, to replace 4 old tin bath tubs at present in use, these are unsanitary and unsightly, and nothing can be done to them to improve them, these bath tubs are urgently required.\n\n1 Team Hay Mower is required, this would cost approximately $100.00 and would be very useful.\n\nIron fire escape stairs should be installed instead of the present perpendicular iron ladders now in use. These ladders are in my opinion unsuitable for use with so many young children and consideration should be given to installing proper fire escape stairs. I am unable to estimate what the cost of alteration would be.\n\nRepairs to leaking steam pipes, would cost approximately $20.00.\n\nSet of Fire Backs for McClary Hotel Range No 29-41.\n\n20 yards Light Brown Battleship Linoleum for table tops in the dining rooms.\n\nRepairs to piping in Laundry, approximately $15.00.\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nI am satisfied that the Principal and staff are doing all in their power to make the life of the pupils comfortable and instill into them the necessary training for their future. Some of the girls appeared exceptionally smart at their work in the kitchen. The number of pupils has been well maintained, and it may safely be said that the school has had a successful year and is doing splendid work. There appears to be a growing appreciation of the school among the Indians generally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

You will recall that for some years past our Commission have referred to this need in the comprehensive list of requirements submitted to your Department towards the close of each year in the following terms:\n\n\"Two storey annex to the rear side of main building, the upper storey to be used as a chapel and assembly room, and the lower storey as a laundry. At present this school has no chapel, no special laundry room or modern laundry equipment, and no recreation room. Where the winters are so long all of these are very necessary. A room in the basement has to serve as laundry and boys' recreation room. The girls use the sewing room as a recreation room.\n\nEstimated cost $10,000.00.\n\nN.B. (In connection with this requirement the Society's Field Secretary desires to direct the attention of the Department to the interview which he had with the Supt. of Indian Education on May 15th, 1929, and on Sept. 17th, 1930, when the same was considered, and the Supt. requested that a special note be made in our list of requirements of the urgency of this particular need. See letter June 18th, 1930, #166-1-5, addressed to Mr. Indian Agent Supt. Hawksley by the Acting Asst. Deputy and Secretary.)\nIn a letter recently received from the Rev. H. C. M. Grant, Principal of this school, and dated Carcross, July 24, 1934, he writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I would like to draw the attention of the Commission to the fact that the accommodation at this school is not adequate for the number of children seeking admission nor for the number that could be obtained. Bishop Geddes informed me yesterday that he could have obtained 25 new children for the school during his travels this summer but that nothing could be done for them seeing that our accommodation is taxed to the uttermost. Three children were brought down from Ross River to Fort Selkirk, a distance of 250 miles, in the hope that they would be taken in here but when the Agent (Captain G. Binning, R.C.M.P. of Dawson) was wired he had to reply to the effect that the school was full. At the present time there are 40 children in residence allowing for those who have been and will be discharged this year. As there are several children whose applications for admission have already gone in it is likely that the school will have an enrolment of 45 during the next academic year.................. A month or so ago this school was inspected by Colonel Pragnell who is Inspector of Indian Agencies for B.C. He felt that this school was by no means large enough for the area it has to serve. I believe that he intends to embody this view in his report to the Department. Bishop Geddes also feels that the accommodation of this school should be increased. In view of the situation that has arisen it is to be sincerely hoped that something may be done in this connection soon.\"\n\nIf the enlargement of the existing school building cannot be undertaken this year, owing to lack of funds, or for any other reason whatever, our Commission would very earnestly request that the official capacity of the school be increased from 40 to 45 pupils, in order that we may be able to provide help for some of those Indians who desire their children to be admitted to this institution.\n\nYour careful and sympathetic consideration of this important matter will be duly appreciated by me and by our Commission, as well as by all others directly concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, August 21, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nNo provision has been made in the current year's Estimates for the building of an addition to this school, and, under these circumstances, your request cannot receive favourable consideration. Our funds will not permit increasing the pupilage.\n\nBoth your requests will receive further consideration when the Estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave. E.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter, dated Carcross, Yukon, August 29th, the Rev. Principal H. C. M. Grant, directs the attention of our Commission to the difficulty he is having in securing sufficient moose meat for his school. It would appear from the Principal's letter that the chief difficulty arises from the fact that an Indian in the Yukon is not allowed to sell meat unless he has a Commercial License which costs $25.00 a year, and as scarcely any of the Indians can afford to pay this amount they have no market for their meat.\n\nThe Principal states that he had learned from the Rev. J. Hawksley for some time Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Yukon, that during his ten years of office a special permit was granted the Carcross School to buy meat for its own use from any Indian whether he had a commercial license or not, and he suggests that a similar permit might now be secured for the same purpose by your Department from the Department of Justice.\n\nAs the school has no cold storage facilities, there is a possibility the school might be offered more meat at a time than it required, and the Rev. Principal Grant suggests, as an alternative to the arrangement mentioned above that it would be better to have the permit issued to Mr. Watson, a local merchant in the town of Carcross, as he has cold storage facilities, and the school could secure moose meat from him as required.\n\nOur Commission will be obliged if you will give this important matter your careful consideration, and take whatever steps may lie within your power to help the management of our Carcross School in securing a regular and adequate supply of the meat so much needed for the Indian children in residence.\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.B.R.W./W\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C\n\nP.S. As an alternative to the suggestion made above may I refer you to your letter to me on June 24th, 1930, No. 600245; re a somewhat similar situation at our Moose Factory School. T.B.R.W.\nOttawa, October 12, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed is a copy of letter received from the Field Secretary, M.S.C.C., with reference to the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease let me know if it would be possible to meet their wishes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nThe Director,\nNorth West Territories & Yukon Branch,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, file 166-1-5, with which you enclosed a copy of one received from the Field Secretary, M.S.C.C., who complains of their inability to secure sufficient fresh meat for the Carcross school, Yukon Territory.\n\nThis appears to be a matter involving the application and interpretation of the Yukon Game Regulations and I am, therefore, referring it to Mr. G. A. Jeckell, Comptroller, Dawson, Y.T. As soon as his reply is received we will again communicate with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nT. R. L.

Binning, A/Supt.\nDept Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th ultimo, File 3029, enclosing correspondence relative to a request from the Principal of the Carcross Indian School, to secure fresh moose meat under certain conditions.\n\nIt is noted that in the copy of the letter from the Field Secretary, M.S.C.C., to the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs, it is stated:\n\n1st. That the chief difficulty in securing a sufficient supply of moose meat for the residential Indian School at Carcross arises from the fact that an Indian in the Yukon is not allowed to sell meat unless he has a hunter's license which costs $25.00.\n\n2nd. That the Principal of the School has stated that he has been informed that during the period of ten years when Reverend John Hawskley was Indian Agent for the Yukon, a special permit was granted the Carcross School to buy meat for its own use from any Indian, whether he had a hunting license or not.\n\n3rd. That owing to the fact that the school has no cold storage facilities, and since Mr. Watson, a local merchant in Carcross, has such, that the latter be issued some kind of special permit allowing him to handle the game for the school.\n\nIt has always appeared to me that the Yukon Game Ordinance is very liberal in its application to the Indian population of the Territory, and that a sufficient provision is made to enable them to obtain game for food at all times of the year; and further, that the restrictions preventing them from killing moose and caribou for sale during the closed season are necessary.\n\nThe Game Ordinance does not vest any authority in the Commissioner to issue any kind of special permit, without fee, to Indians or white people, to kill moose or caribou at all times of the year and sell the same to any institution or class of people. And, although it is intimated that such a permit was issued at some time in the past, I have no knowledge of the same having been done, and I can find no record of such a permit having been issued.\n\nIt is quite possible for the institution which I believe receives a liberal per capita grant for the maintenance of the Indian children to obtain a supply of moose meat under the provisions of the Game Ordinance. The merchant referred to has no cold storage, and it would be contrary to the provisions of the Game Ordinance to permit this merchant, as has been suggested, to have moose meat in his possession during the closed season, buying the same from any and all Indians. Even if it were permissible under the Ordinance, I would consider such a proceeding dangerous and likely to lead to all kinds of difficulties.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. G.A.

A. Jeckell, who appears to have carefully reviewed the situation. You will observe Mr. Jeckell, who administers the Yukon Game Ordinance, is of the opinion that a very liberal interpretation is placed upon the provisions of that ordinance for the benefit of the residents of the Territories and any extension of the same in favour of the local merchant mentioned in this correspondence would not be advisable having regard to all the circumstances of the case.\n\nI think you will agree that it would be preferable if the representative of the M.S.C.C. at Carcross, Y.T., were to call upon Mr. Jeckell when convenient and discuss the situation with him.

January 25, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nre: enlargement of the Carcross School.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of August 17th, 1935, and your reply to the same on August 21st, 1935, No. 166-1-5 re. the building of an addition to our Carcross School, I beg to state that our Commission requested the Principal to secure from a local builder and contractor plans and specifications for the addition in question, and enclosed herewith you will find the original of those prepared and submitted by Mr. J.E. French, of White Horse, Yukon. You will note that the estimated cost of the addition to the main school building is $8,000.00.\n\nAs the report of Col. J.S. Pragnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies, dated July 31st, 1935, and made after he visited this school, stated that he understood there were \"probably over 1500 Indians in the Yukon and several hundreds in adjoining British Columbia territory, with over 300 of School age,\" there can be no doubt about the need of the addition requested above, and our Commission sincerely trust that it may be provided during the current calendar year 1936.\n\nFurther, as the Inspector of Indian Agencies, in the report mentioned above, recommended the provision of a small out-building for the home-curing of bacon, the Principal of our Carcross School was requested to secure an estimate of the cost of this, and you will note that the estimate given by Mr. French is $300.00.\n\nOur Commission recommend both of these urgent needs to the sympathetic consideration of your Department, and trust that funds may be made available to provide them this year.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTERW/KH\nEnc.\nOttawa, February 3, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, urging that an addition be made to the present Carcross Indian Residential School building, at a cost which a local builder and contractor estimates to be $8,000, and also that provision be made for the erection of a small outbuilding for the home curing of bacon, at a cost of $300.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will have no funds to carry out the above work during the coming fiscal year. Our Estimates have been considerably reduced, and it will not be possible to arrange for any enlargements or extensive repairs to existing school buildings.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

H.C.M. Grant, Principal.\nOttawa, May 4, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year provides for the following items at the Carcross Indian Residential School:\n\n- To erect iron fire escape - $500.00\n- Miscellaneous repairs - $300.00\n- Enamel bath tubs - $150.00\n- Hay mower - $150.00\n\nRegarding the fire escape, I would refer to your letter of July 17, 1935, reporting on the requirements at this school. You recommended that iron fire escape stairs be installed, to replace the perpendicular iron ladders at present in use, which you consider to be unsuitable for the young children. I would request that you discuss this matter with the Principal and report concerning the type of fire escape recommended, where the material could be obtained, what labour would be required and the approximate cost. As full information as possible should be given.\n\nWith reference to the item for miscellaneous repairs, the Principal should advise you what repairs, etc., he would recommend be carried out, to the amount provided, as mentioned above.\n\nPlease consult the Principal regarding the type of bath tubs and the size and type of the hay mower. You should then forward this information to the Department and give full shipping directions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. Binning, Esq.,\nIn charge, Indian Agency,\nDawson, Yukon.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a request from the Principal of the Indian Residential School, Carcross, that he be supplied with ONE HAY PRESS at an estimated cost of four hundred dollars, f.o.b. Carcross, for use at that institution.\n\nI would point out that the hay meadow is several miles from the school and so far it has been possible to borrow a homemade hay press from a nearby farmer, but this press is now in such condition that it is useless. I would also point out that the hay has to be brought to the school by boat, so that it is necessary that it be baled to facilitate easy handling.\n\nI would respectfully request that consideration be given to this request and that if at all possible authority may be granted for the purchase of this necessary implement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. Binning\nA/Supt.\nDept Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 5th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo, with reference to the request of the Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School for a hay press.\n\nIn our letter of yesterday's date, you were informed regarding the amount available for the Carcross Residential School in the current year's appropriation.\n\nThese amounts are all that can be allowed at the Carcross School this year but, if the Principal prefers to have the money expended for a hay press rather than for some of the last three items mentioned in our letter of yesterday's date, the Department has no objection. In this event, you should give full particulars regarding the hay press and where it can be obtained so that the order can be placed from here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nG. Binning, Esq.,\nIn charge - Indian Office,\nDawson, Yukon.\n\nPP/O'M.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou are aware from previous correspondence of the very urgent need of a hay baler for our Carcross School in Yukon, where the chief hay supply is located about ten or twelve miles from the school and the hay has to be brought in by scow. Our Commission has received what is considered an exceptionally good offer from the International Harvester Co. in Winnipeg, namely, a one horse hay-baler which was sold to a farmer in 1934, but who could not pay for the same. As he used it during one season only when he baled 30 tons, it is guaranteed to be almost as good as new. This baler is offered to us for $189.00. As it weighs approximately 2000 lbs., the freight charges from Winnipeg to Carcross will be approximately $111.00 making the total cost of the baler f.o.b. Carcross approximately $300.00. As the baler if new would sell in Winnipeg for $292.50, we consider it should be purchased, and our Commission would like to know if your Department will authorize this expenditure. The members feel strongly that on account of the exceptional circumstances created through the remote location of the only hay lands available for the use of this school, your Department should assist them by meeting this expenditure. As the baler should be furnished at once, a prompt reply will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nCarcross, Yukon,\nJuly 20th. 1931.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nDr. to Chooutla School.\n\nJuly 10th. 1931.

He was requested, also, to state what repairs and equipment he would recommend be provided for the amount mentioned above.\n\nShould the school authorities prefer that the hay baler be supplied, at an approximate cost of $300.00, rather than that the amount be expended for the various purposes as stated, the Department will approve of the purchase of the hay baler. It should be understood, however, that the amount mentioned is all that is available this year, and the expenditure at the school should not exceed that figure. Should you purchase the hay baler mentioned in your letter, at a cost of approximately $300, including freight, this would leave the sum of about $800. to cover the cost of the work and equipment mentioned above. If the purchase is made, please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the baler, and a receipt for the freight charges to the school. These accounts you should certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. I would request that you advise the Principal as soon as possible if you decide to purchase the baler.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.

Some of the particulars required are as follows:\n\n1. No 33, 20-section Oil Bath Mower, F.O.B. Vancouver $127.00, less 10%..........................$114.30\n   Freight from Vancouver to Carcross, Yukon........$32.40\n   Total Cost....................................$146.70\n\nThe above mower can be obtained at the price quoted from Massey Harris Company Ltd Vancouver.\n\nE. 4, F.T.I. 5ft enamel bath tubs on feet, less all fittings at $38.90 F.O.B. Carcross $155.60\n   4 sets N.P. fittings for above tubs at $7.70 F.O.B. Carcross $30.80.\n   Total Cost F.O.B. Carcross......................$186.40.\n\nThe above quotations on the bath tubs and necessary fittings was given by Alocock Downing and Wright 996 Cambie Street Vancouver B.C. for prompt acceptance.\n\nIn connection with the fire escape stairways no information can be given just now save that Mr J.E. French, Builder and Contractor at Whitehorse states that the estimated cost of installing such escapes will be approximately $200.00. Recently a letter was addressed to the Pearson Wire and Iron Works Ltd. Vancouver concerning the cost F.O.B. Carcross of the fire escape desired and they replied to the effect that they could not give a quotation until they had a diagram of the end of the building, measurements etc. Such information has been supplied this firm and a reply is expected in the near future.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) H.C.M. Grant, Principal.\nSir:\n\nAttached hereto please find a letter received by me from the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Carcross Y.T. relative to the appropriation granted that school for the year 1936.\n\nIt will be noted that nothing definite has been received yet in regard to the cost of the Fire Escape, but a report on this matter will be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nIt will also be noted that the estimate for the Bath tubs is slightly more than the appropriation, and I would suggest for your consideration that the necessary amount additional be taken from the miscellaneous grant, as I am of the opinion that there will be very little small repairs required this year.\n\nI regret that this report has been delayed, but the original report was on the steamer \"Casco\" when she was wrecked in the Yukon early in July, and it was unreadable when received here so that it was necessary to ask for another report from the Principal of the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

Carcross. The firms on the list, from whom prices should be obtained are as follows:\n\nBarr and Anderson, Vancouver, B. C.\nCrane Limited,\nEmpire Brass Company,\nR. E. Johnston & Co.,\nFred Welsh & Sons,\n\nAccounts, in triplicate, should be obtained, covering the cost of the mower and the bath tubs, and receipts should be attached for the freight charges. These accounts you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nIt is noted prices are being obtained for the installing of fire escape stairways. It is hoped that the cost will not exceed the amount available, viz.: $500.00, and, if possible, the work should be done at less cost. It is noted that Pearson Wire and Iron Works, Limited, Vancouver, have been requested to furnish a quotation and that they have been supplied with the necessary information. This firm is on the list, and it would be satisfactory, if they supply the lowest quotation, to have them do the work, provided the cost does not exceed the amount available, as stated above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Binning, R.C.M.P.\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nDawson Y.T.\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find plans received from the Pearson Wire and Iron Works Ltd., of the proposed fire escapes to be erected here. The large sketch shows alternate methods of placing the fire escape on the building. In connection with these methods the Pearson Wire and Iron Works Ltd state as follows:\n\n\"The fire escape \"A\" is more compact and would look better on the building, while the fire escape \"B\", the direction of which is shown by dotted lines, is heavier, is a more direct way to the ground (no turns) and the weight would be spread over a larger area. Both of these methods are correct.\"\n\n\"We quote you the sum of six hundred and ninety seven dollars ($697.00) for two fire escapes as shown at \"A\" one at the east and one at the west end of the building\"\n\n\"We quote you the sum of seven hundred and eighty two dollars ($782.00) for the two fire escapes shown at \"B\". These prices include sales tax, f.o.b. Carcross, painted one coat of black graphite, or red lead paint, complete with all bolts, washers etc.\"\n\nTo give you my own personal opinion of the two methods I am decidedly in favour of \"A\" for the following reasons:\n\n1. As the Pearson Wire and Iron Works Ltd state method \"A\" is more compact and would look better on the building.\n2. The cost of fire escape \"A\" is considerably cheaper than that shown at \"B\".\n3. It is felt that fire escape \"B\" would be more likely to permit snow to accumulate than fire escape \"A\".\n\nYou will also find enclosed a small sketch showing how wooden hand rails would be placed on the proposed fire escapes. The installation of wooden hand rails is regarded as necessary so that the hands of the children will not come into contact with the bare metal during sub-zero weather.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) H.C.M. Grant, Principal.\nSir:\n\nFurther to my report dated July 31st 1936, in regard to the installation of fire escapes at the Indian Residential School, Carcross Y.T.\n\nAttached hereto please find a copy of a letter received by me from the Principal of the School in which prices obtained from the Pearson Wire and Iron Works Ltd., Vancouver, for the supplying of the material for these fire escapes is quoted, also please find attached plans of the suggested fire escapes.\n\nIt will be noted that the price quoted F.O.B. Carcross for fire escape \"A\" is $697.00, and you would note by my report of July 31st that it will cost approximately $200.00 to install these fire escapes on the building, this making a total cost of $897.00 for the job.\n\nWhile the appropriation set aside for this work is only $500.00, I would respectfully request that an endeavour be made to supply the extra money required for the installation of these fire escapes, as in my opinion they are absolutely necessary, the escapes in use at the present time being extremely dangerous for young children using, and in the event of a fire at the building might result in the loss of life.\n\nI would recommend that the fire escapes shown as plan \"A\" be installed at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

A price has been obtained from the Pearson Wire and Iron Works, Limited, Vancouver, for the supplying of the material for these fire escapes, for the amount of $607.00, f. o. b. Carcross. It will require a further amount of approximately $200.00 to install the escapes, making a total cost of approximately $800.00 to complete the work. The church authorities and Mr. Binning, Acting Superintendent for the Department at Dawson, state that the installation of fire escapes is absolutely necessary, as the ones in use at the present time are extremely dangerous for use by young children and, in the event of a fire, might result in the loss of life.\n\nThe Pearson Wire and Iron Works, Limited, Vancouver, are on the approved list and have supplied equipment of a similar nature to a number of other residential schools. I would request your approval to incur the expenditure required in supplying and installing the fire escapes and that the quotation of the Pearson Wire and Iron Works, Limited, be accepted.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nFunds are provided, in the Appropriation for Indian Education, to erect fire escapes at the rear of the Indian Residential School building, Carcross, Yukon Territory.

During my recent visit to the Indian Residential School at Carcross Y.T., I made a close check of the buildings, equipment etc., with a view of bringing to your notice necessary repairs and requirements for the fiscal year 1937-38, and I now forward my findings so that you may give them consideration when submitting your estimates for 1937-38.\n\n2. ADDITION TO THE PRESENT SCHOOL BUILDING.\n\nAt the present time there are 47 Indian children in residence at this school, and there is no doubt that the school is overcrowded, there being beds down the centre of the dormitories and in some cases children are sleeping two in one bed. During recent months several applications for admission to the school have had to be turned down owing to the lack of accommodation. The question of an addition to the school has, I believe, been already drawn to the attention of the Department three or four years ago, and I have no doubt the Department have plans and specifications on file which were submitted by two builders and contractors in Whitehorse for an addition to the school. The estimated cost of the proposed addition has been given as $8,000.00.\n\n3. REPAIRS TO FOUNDATION OF WORK SHOP.\n\nThere is no question at all that this work should be done as soon as possible. Owing to a rotten foundation it is easily noticeable that the floor in the centre has sagged considerably, and the condition of the foundations is in evidence by the fact that the peak of the roof slopes towards the middle. An estimated cost of having this work done, supplying all material etc would be $300.00.\n\n4. BUILDING FOR CURING BACON.\n\nA building for the curing of bacon would be a great asset to the school and one could be erected at an estimated cost of $300.00.\n\n5. Singer SEWING MACHINE.\n\nAt the present time there are two sewing machines in the school both old, and one of which is giving considerable trouble, another sewing machine would be very acceptable, cost $44.36.\n\nF.O.B. Carcross.\nGASOLINE ENGINE.\n\n6. One Gasoline Engine, Fairbanks-Morse, 5-8 H.P., to be used to operate a circular saw. The one the school now possesses is not in very good repair, having given many years service and besides has not sufficient power to do the work it is called upon to do. The cost of a new engine would be in the neighbourhood of $275.00.\n\n7. CIRCULAR CORD WOOD SAW.\n\nOne Circular Cord wood Saw at an estimated cost of $25.00. The saw the school own at present has been in use for over five years and the constant sharpening necessary has shortened the teeth to such an extent that it is difficult to work with it.\n\n8. PAINTING OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL.\n\nDuring the past fiscal year the Department allowed a grant to cover the cost of staining the shingles on the outside of the building and it is felt that the siding, window frames etc should be painted in the near future so as to preserve this wood work. The cost of having this done would be in the vicinity of $450.00 and would include the cost of the paint and oil necessary and the painting of the outbuildings as well, all with two coats of paint.\n\n9.

F. MacKenzie.\n\nThe Manager,\nEast End Branch,\nRoyal Bank of Canada,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Carcross, which reads in part:\n\n\"As several of the Indian Residential Schools under the administration of the Anglican Church and those under the administration of other denominations have been authorized by the Department of Indian Affairs to engage the services of a night watchman, it is strongly felt that such a privilege should be accorded to this school. During the past six years we have had a night watchman such position being filled by the elder school boys, each boy when taken sick at times. At the present time there are no big boys in the school who could do the work as it should be done and we are really up against it unless the Department will come to our assistance. It seems as if night watchmen are regarded as necessary in other schools where the winter may not be as long or severe as they are in the Yukon one is certainly necessary here. During the night fires have to be kept going not only in the school furnace but in the workshop, chicken house and pig pen and so it can be seen that there is an ever present danger of fire. The employment of a night watchman would be a great protection to Government property here and besides assure the children and staff that every precaution possible is taken for their safety.\n\nIn a wooden frame building of this nature once a fire got started it would be almost impossible to put it out and the presence of explosion electric wiring (not in the building) the gas lighting plant, gasoline water pump actually in the school building makes the risk from fire even greater. It would be greatly appreciated if you would take this matter up with the Department of Indian Affairs and recommend that each winter the Principal be authorised to employ someone as night watchman. It is suggested that a position of this nature be filled from October 15th to April 15th a period of six months and that the salary be $40.00 per month.\"\n\nends.\n\nI would strongly recommend that favourable consideration be given to this request of the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

This machine will be shipped to the Principal, Carcross, Yukon Territory. The account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the machine, will be sent you, and I would request that you certify same in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment, after you are assured that the machine has been received at the school, in good condition.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the request of the Principal to be supplied with a new bake oven and giving an estimate of the cost, I have to say that the Department will have no funds during the present fiscal year to authorize the supplying of the oven. I may add that it is doubtful if it will be possible to provide the funds from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1937-38 to supply this equipment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nG. Binning, Esq.,\nIn charge, Indian Office,\nDawson, Yukon.\nOttawa, December 30, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the request of the Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School for a grant towards the salary of a night watchman for a six month period, from October 15th to April 15th.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department provides grants towards salary of a night watchman for a number of the Indian residential schools at which there is a certain element of fire hazard. The amount usually allowed for this service is $40.00 per month. The Department will approve of the Principal arranging for the engagement of a fully competent person to carry out the duties as night watchman for the balance of the present winter months, to April 15th, next, and will allow a grant of $40.00 per month towards payment of salary. This grant will be paid to the Principal at the end of each month, upon receipt of a voucher, in triplicate, from you, in favour of the Principal, for the amount due. For your information, I enclose a sample voucher, which you should submit at the end of each month, when a cheque in payment will be sent the Principal. It is to be understood that the Principal will engage the services of a fully competent man to carry out the night watchman's duties.\n\nEarly next fall, the Principal should renew his request for a grant for this service, when favourable consideration will be given to providing the grant for the period from October 15th to April 15th following.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nG.

Binning, R.C.M.P., Dawson, Yukon, who looks after the Indian work, has just forwarded the following radiogram:\n\n\"Following received from Principal Indian School Garcross: Mr. French builder and contractor has carefully examined basement and foundation of workshop found same deplorable condition. Basement caved in and many fills completely rotted. To put same in condition to last many years will cost approximately $950. for labour and all materials. Basement requires enlarging and concrete walls and floors. Many foundation fills have to be renewed. As basement only place for storing vegetables work should be completed not later than August 1. Stand to lose crop if work not done before freeze up (STOP). I strongly recommend that authority be granted for this work as I examined this building two weeks ago and found repairs necessary.\"\n\nProvision has been made in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year for the sum of $1,200 for repairs and improvements at the Garcross Indian Residential School, Yukon Territory. In view of the Principal's request and the recommendation of Inspector Binning, I would appreciate receiving your authority to authorize Inspector Binning to proceed with the necessary work.\n\nYou will note from the radiogram that repairs should be completed before August first.\n\nActing Director.\nHoffar's Ltd. also give a quotation on the above plants multi V-belt driven instead of direct connected. These are as follows:\n\n2.5 to 2.75 K.W. Unit, f.o.b. our warehouse, Vancouver, $725.00\nFreight Charges to Carcross ........................................... $75.00\n$800.00\n\n4 K.W. Unit, f.o.b. our warehouse Vancouver, ............ $75.00\nFreight to Carcross ...................................................... $80.00\n$935.00\n\nHoffar's Ltd. state that any of these units would be suitable for battery charging.\n\n14. Up-to-date maps are required for the classroom, and although the Department had been asked many times to supply them, the need still exists. Miss Dunn, the Teacher, is very specially fitted for this position, and should be provided with an essential item of equipment such as this.\n\n15. One New Wagon with steel wheels (wide tires) at an estimated cost of $35.07 f.o.b. Carcross. At the present time the School owns four horses and only has one wagon. This hampers the work, particularly during the short haymaking season, when every hour counts.\n\n16. Pyrene Fire Extinguishers - 1\u00bd quart size - 10 only and 10 refills. It is felt that these should be supplied at the earliest possible date. The few Pyrene Extinguishers that the School now has are by no means in the best of condition and many of them will not work. In the case of a fire from gasoline or grease this type of extinguisher would be essential if much property damage was to be avoided. The cost of these would be approximately $125.00 f.o.b. Carcross.\n\n17. Each year certain of our fire extinguishers have to be refilled. In order to carry out this practice it is necessary that the following be supplied, if possible, before the coming winter:\n\n| Item                        | Quantity | Cost |\n|-----------------------------|----------|------|\n| 4 gallons Sulphuric Acid    |          | $28.00 |\n| 50 lbs. Bicarbonate of Soda & 10g | | $5.00 |\n| Estimated Freight Charges   |          | $3.50 |\n\nThe above quantities would last us for several years.\n\n18. In order to keep the building in good repair and in order to give what bays we have two coats of White Enamel it would be appreciated if the Department would supply the following:\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit to our Carcross School I noted the following urgent needs, and at a meeting of our Commission, held on the 13th inst., I was instructed to place the same before you and ascertain what help you could provide towards meeting them:\n\n1. A root-house. This could be secured through the enlargement of the space under the workshop now used for this purpose. A full-sized basement with stone walls and a good floor would provide the storage required. (Estimated cost approximately $500.00)\n\n2. An Ice-house. The small building attached to the back of the main school building and now used for this purpose, is too small, and is by no means heat-proof. It could be made to serve as a bacon-curing house if a new ice-house were available. (Estimated cost of ice-house approximately $800.00)\n\n3. Road around the cut-bank of the creek in front of the School, or the construction of a causeway with a short bridge, over the same. Either undertaking would shorten the distance to the Carcross station by approximately half a mile, and eliminate the danger and fatigue of the existing road over a steep sand hill. (Estimated cost $100.00)\n\n4. New residence for the Principal. The foundations of the present building are decayed, and the cost of\nrepairs and necessary improvements might better be applied to a new structure. (Estimated cost $2,500.00)\n\n(5) An increase in the official capacity of the School from 40 to 50. The pupils in residence at present number 47, and more are available for admission. Here, as at a number of our Society's other Schools, the increased accommodation required could be provided through the building of a detached classroom, thus making the existing classroom available for a dormitory. (The estimated cost of the new classroom is $2,500.00)\n\n6. The placing of all electric wiring in conduits it is felt should be undertaken in the very near future. There is a considerable fire risk having exposed wiring all over the building, especially in the attic. It would not be advisable to attempt here and now to give an estimate of the cost without first getting information from an experienced electrician.\n\n7. Refrigerator for the School kitchen. This is essential for keeping fresh milk, butter, meat, and other foods. (Estimated cost $50.00)\n\n8. One New Bake Oven. The present one has been in use for a good many years and besides blackening the bread with smoke and soot is liable at any time to become a fire menace. In this connection the following data concerning a new Bake Oven is respectfully submitted:\n\nThe Brantford No. 3 New Homestead Oven - floor space required 4' 10\" x 3' 10\" ........................................... $390.00\nLess 10% plus a Sales Tax of 5% ....................... $379.08\nFreight Charges - Brantford, Ont. to Carcross including Terminal Charges & Cartage, .......... 169.51\nTotal Cost .............. $548.59\n\n9. A suitable floor covering is needed for the main hall of the School. This floor space received more wear than any other part of the building and it is likely owing to the present state of the fir flooring, that if some covering is not provided in the near future, a new wooden floor will have to be laid. The cost of lumber in the Yukon will make this a rather expensive undertaking. To cover the Main Hall with Brown Battleship Linoleum would be most suitable and give many years of wear. Data in respect to the foregoing is as follows:\n\nBrown Battleship Linoleum, 60 square yds (6' wide) @ 94\u00a2 sq. yd.. $56.40\nHeavy Wall Felt to place under Linoleum, 2 rolls @ $5.00 ......... 10.00\nEstimated Freight Charges on above from Vancouver .................. 12.00\nTotal Cost .............. $78.40\n10. A cauldron for heating water and cooking pig feed.\n\n11. One Gasoline Engine, Fairbanks - Morse, 6 - 8 h.p. to be used to operate a circular saw. The one the School now possesses is not in the best of repair having given many years of service, and besides has not sufficient power to do the work it is called upon to do. The cost of a new engine would likely be in the neighbourhood of $375.00.\n\nOne Circular Wood Saw at an estimated cost of $25.00. The Saw the School now owns has given over six years service and the constant sharpening has shortened the teeth to such an extent that it is difficult to do good work with it.\n\n12. A Ford Motor Truck, with dual rear wheels on account of the sandy trails, would be a decided convenience.\n\n13. After fourteen years of service the present Delco Lighting Plant is proving to be a source of worry and expense. The cost of repairs and the amount of gasoline consumed makes its continued operation a great expense, not only to the Department, but to the School management. Then there is a considerable danger of fire from having a gasoline engine, not in the best of running order, operating in the School building. This danger can be obviated and expense cut down considerably by the installation of a Diesel Lighting Plant which uses as fuel a product not nearly as inflammable as gasoline. As far as the cost of operating a Diesel Lighting Plant compared with that of a Delco, a reliable authority states that the cost of operating the former is only 1/6 of that of the latter. In connection with this matter the following data is supplied, the same being furnished by Hoffar's Ltd., 1790 Georgia Street, Vancouver, B.C.:\n\n2.5 to 2.75 K.W. Unit. This unit would consist of 1 - 2.5 to 2.75 K.W., 110 volt, direct current, battery charging Generator. This generator would be direct connected through a high-grade flexible coupling to 1 - 5 H.P., 1 cylinder, Lister, full diesel, 4 cycle, solid injection Engine. Engine and generator would be mounted on a substantial base and the unit complete with switchboard.\n\nPrice f.o.b. our warehouse Vancouver ............... $1140.00\nFreight to Carcross ........................................ $ 98.00\nTotal .......................................................... $1238.00\n\nOR 3.5 to 4 K.W. Unit. This unit would consist of 1 - 4 k.w., 110 volt, direct current, battery charging Generator. This generator would be direct connected through a high-grade flexible coupling to a 1 - 7-8 H.P. Lister full diesel 4 cycle solid injection Engine. Engine and Generator would be mounted on a substantial base and the unit complete with switchboard.\n\nPrice f.o.b. our warehouse Vancouver .................... $1400.00\nFreight to Carcross ........................................... $100.00\nTotal .......................................................... $1500.00\nHoffar's Ltd. also give a quotation on the above plants multi V-belt driven instead of direct connected. These are as follows:\n\n2.5 to 2.75 K.W. Unit, f.o.b. our warehouse, Vancouver, $725.00\nFreight Charges to Carcross ........................................... $800.00\n\n4 K.W. Unit, f.o.b. our warehouse Vancouver, ............ $75.00\nFreight to Carcross ....................................................... $80.00\n\nHoffar's Ltd. state that any of these units would be suitable for battery charging.\n\n14. Up-to-date maps are required for the classroom, and although the Department had been asked many times to supply them, the need still exists. Miss Dunn, the teacher, is very specially fitted for this position, and should be provided with an essential item of equipment such as this.\n\n15. One New Wagon with steel wheels (wide tires) at an estimated cost of $35.07 f.o.b. Carcross. At the present time the School owns four horses and only has one wagon. This hampers the work, particularly during the short haying season, when every hour counts.\n\n16. Pyrene Fire Extinguishers - 1\u00bd quart size - 10 only and 10 refills. It is felt that these should be supplied at the earliest possible date. The few Pyrene Extinguishers that the School now has are by no means in the best of condition and many of them will not work. In the case of a fire from gasoline or grease this type of extinguisher would be essential if much property damage was to be avoided. The cost of these would be approximately $125.00 f.o.b. Carcross.\n\n17. Each year certain of our fire extinguishers have to be refilled. In order to carry out this practice it is necessary that the following be supplied, if possible, before the coming winter:\n\n| Item                        | Quantity | Cost |\n|-----------------------------|----------|------|\n| 4 gallons Sulphuric Acid    |          | $8.00|\n| 50 lbs. Bicarbonate of Soda & 10% | | $5.00|\n| Estimated Freight Charges   |          | $3.50|\n\nThe above quantities would last us for several years.\n\n18. In order to keep the building in good repair and in order to give what beds we have two coats of White Enamel it would be appreciated if the Department would supply the following:\n2 gallons - White Enamel @ $4.25 ............ $8.50\n4 gallons - Dark Oak Varnish Stain @ $4.00.. 16.00\nEstimated freight charges on above .......... 3.85\n$ 28.35\n\n19. Painting the Outside of the School. (woodwork only)\nDuring the past fiscal year the Department of Indian Affairs allowed a grant to cover the cost of staining the shingles on the outside of the building, and it is felt that the siding, window frames, etc., should be painted in the near future.\nThe cost of having this done would be in the neighbourhood of $450.00 and would include the cost of the paint and oil necessary and the painting of the out buildings as well, all, with two coats of paint.\n\n20. One set of platform scales - capacity 1,000 lbs., at an estimated cost of $75.80 f.o.b. Carcross. As the weights of the School children have to be recorded every month, and all produce from the garden weighed every fall to say nothing of the many times during the year that fish and meat have to be weighed, a set of reliable scales would be a decided asset.\n\nIt is my understanding that these requirements have been made known to your representative in the Yukon, and that they will be forwarded to you in due course.\n\nIf the School is to be maintained at the standard of efficiency desired by your Department and by our Society, every item given on the list should be provided. The impression I received during the week I spent at this School was that it is being carefully and efficiently managed so far as the required equipment was available. With the provision of the equipment and improvements embodied in the above list, the beneficial influence which this remotely located School has been exerting for so many years, will be greatly extended.\n\nYour careful and sympathetic consideration of these needs will be duly appreciated by the School management and also by our Commission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/KH\nDawson, Y.T.,\nJuly 2nd, 1937.\n\nThe Director of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\n1. During my recent visit to the Indian Residential Village School at Carcross, Y.T., I made a close check of all supplies, equipment, etc., with a view of bringing to your notice the necessary repairs and requirements for the fiscal year 1936-39, and I now submit my findings so that you may give the necessary consideration to the estimates submitted for the fiscal year.\n\n2. Repairs to the foundations of the work shop: There is no question at all that this work should be done as soon as possible. Owing to the rotten foundation, it is noticeable that the floor in the centre has sagged considerably and the condition of the foundation is such that the peak of the roof slopes towards the middle. The estimated cost of the work required, supplying all material, etc., will be $500.00.\n\n3. There is a cellar in this building which is used for storing vegetables for winter use, and the suggestion has been made that this excavation be made larger, so that the school would have a full sized basement with concrete walls in which to store vegetables for the winter months. The size of this building is 20 x 36, but I cannot determine the cost of this. It would be considerably in excess of the $200.00 already mentioned.\n\n4. Additions to the present school building: At the present time there are 47 Indian children in residence at this school and during recent months, several admissions have had to be turned down. The question of an addition to the school has I believe, been drawn to the attention of the Department three or four months ago and mentioned by me in my report of October 13th, 1936. The estimated cost of the proposed addition, of which, I understand the plans are on file in your office at Ottawa, is approximately $8000.00. If the building of this addition cannot be carried out in the near future, could the capacity of this school be increased from 40 to 50 pupils. This could be accomplished by erecting a detached classroom at an estimated cost of $2500.00, and the present class room could be used as a dormitory.\n\n5. A building for curing the bacon is required. At the present time the suggestion has been made that the present building used for storing ice should be turned into a bacon-curing building and a new ice house erected. The cost of erecting this new ice house would be approximately $600.00.\n\n- Continued -\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 5)\nDawson, Y.T.,\nJuly 2nd, 1937.\n\nThe Director of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\n1.

One gasoline engine, Fairbanks Morris, 6 to 8 horse power, to be used to operate the circular saw. The one at the school at the present is in very poor repair, has given many years of service and has not the power to do the work it is called upon to do. The cost of the new engine would be approximately $375.00.\n\n7. One circular cord-wood saw at an estimated cost of $25.00. The saw now in use has been used for years and the continual sharpening has shortened the teeth so that it is difficult to do good work with it.\n\n8. Painting the outside of the school, woodwork only. Last year you were good enough to allow a grant to cover the cost of staining the shingles on the outside of the building. The siding, window frames, etc., should be painted. The cost of having this done would be approximately $450.00, including the cost of painting the building walls with two coats of paint.\n\n9. One set of suitable scales, capacity 1000 pounds at an estimated cost of $75.00, f.o.b. Carcross. As the weights of the school children have to be recorded every month, and all produce from the garden weighed, to say nothing of the many times during the year that fish and meat have to be weighed, a set of reliable scales would be a decided asset.\n\n10. One new baking oven. The present one has been in use for a good many years, blackens the bread with smoke and soot and is liable at any time to become a fire menace. In this connection I wrote you December 10th, 1926. The oven required is a Brantford $5, New Homestead Oven, space required 4 x 10 by 3 x 10; price $390.00, less 10%, plus a sales tax of $5, which makes a total of $379.08. Freight charges, Brantford to Carcross, including terminal charges and cartage, $169.51; a total of $548.59. I strongly recommend that consideration be given to the supplying of this baking oven to the school.\n\n11. Check wiring: The placing of all electrical wiring in conduits should be undertaken in the very near future so as to eliminate fire risk. At the present time I have no information as regard to the cost of placing the wiring in a satisfactory condition as the buildings should be examined by a qualified electrician and the price obtained.\n\n12. Delco Plant: The Delco-lighting plant at the school has been in operation for the past 14 years and is now proving to be a source of work and expense. The cost of repairs and amount of gasoline consumed make its continued operation a big expense not only to the department but to the school management. There is also a danger of fire from not having the gasoline engine in the best of running condition, whilst operating in the school building.\n\n13. No later than October of last year you authorized an expenditure of $125.00 for repairs to this\n\n- Continued -\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 5)\n6.

I would recommend for your consideration that a Diesel lighting plant, which uses as fuel a product not nearly as inflammable as gasoline be obtained. As far as the cost of operating a Diesel plant, as compared with that of a D.C., I am reliably informed that the cost is only about one-sixth of the latter. I understand that Hoffer's Limited, 1790 George Street, Vancouver, B.C., are able to supply a 2.5 to 2.75 K.W. unit. This unit consists of one 2.5 to 2.75 K.W., 110 volt, direct current, battery charged generator. The generator would be directly connected through a high grade flexible coupling, to a 1 to 5 horse-power, one-cylinder, Lister full-diesel, 4 cycle, solid injection engine. The engine and generator would be mounted on a substantial base and the unit complete with switch board. The price f.o.b. Vancouver, $1140.00, freight to Carcross, $38.00.

I would recommend for your consideration that a Diesel lighting plant, which uses as fuel a product non-flam- mable as gasoline, be obtained. As far as the cost of operating a Diesel plant is compared with that of a Delco, I am reliably informed that the cost is only about one-sixth of the latter.

Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 27th last, No. 165-1-5, in which you inform me that an amount of $1200.00 has been provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at our Carcross School. Of this amount, $950.00 is to be used in putting a basement under the workshop, the same to serve as a root house, and you request information as to how the balance of $250.00 should be expended.\n\nOn receipt of your letter, I telegraphed immediately to the Principal of our Carcross School and requested a specific recommendation in this connection. His reply was received here this morning and reads in part, as follows:\n\n\"In connection with the extra $250.00 sanctioned by the Department I would recommend one or other of the two following items of equipment. These are given in order of importance and I have particularly urged the Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Yukon to recommend that the first be installed before the coming winter sets in. The cost of the first is well in excess of $250.00, but I feel that if the Department realize the importance of having a new lighting plant here they will not hesitate to sanction the additional $705.00 required.\n\n1. One new Lighting Plant - 4 K.W. - Lister Diesel - direct current, battery charging generator - multi V - belt driven at a cost of $955.00 F.O.B. Carcross, Yukon. This Plant is highly recommended and can be supplied by Hoffer's Ltd.,\n1790 Georgia St., Vancouver, B.C. The price of $955.00 F.O.B. Carcross was quoted by this firm. The reason why I have put this item of equipment first is that the present Delco Plant, after fourteen years of service, is very costly to operate. Each year gasoline costs the school about $1,100.00 - 2,000 gallons @ 55\u00a2 per gallon. At a safe estimate I would say that at least 80% of this amount is used in the Delco Plant. Hoffar's Ltd. state that the cost of operating a Lister-Diesel - the type that is required here - is only about one sixth of that of a Delco Plant. The low cost of operation is also strongly stressed by a local electrician in the employ of Mr. W.L. Phelps, K.C., Manager of the Yukon Electrical Company. The installation of a new plant of this type would mean a saving to the Commission of approximately $750.00 a year.\n\n2. One Gasoline Engine - Fairbanks-Morse - 7\u00bd H.P. Type \"Z\" Style to be used to operate a circular saw. The one the School now possesses is not in the best of repair having given many years of service and besides has not sufficient power to do the work it is called upon to do. The cost of a new engine would be, according to a quotation received from the Fairbanks-Morse Co. Ltd. of Vancouver, $238.40 F.O.B. Carcross, Yukon.\"\n\nOf the need of the new Lighting Plant there can be no doubt, but as I have already referred fully to this in my letter of July 19th last, I need not repeat what was stated therein. If the additional amount required could possibly be found, the installation of the new Lighting Plant would add greatly to the safety and comfort of the School management and pupils, and also help to reduce considerably the heavy operating cost of this School. Where the nights are so long for so great a part of the year, the importance of having an efficient lighting system cannot easily be over-estimated, and I trust that some way may be found of providing the one which the Reverend Principal Grant has recommended.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/KH\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6479, file 940-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nA request has been received for the supplying of one gasoline engine, Fairbanks-Morse, 7\u00bd H.P., Type \"Z\" Style, for the Carcross Indian Residential School, Carcross, Yukon.\n\nOn the above engine the Principal has received from the Fairbanks-Morse Company of Vancouver a quotation of $285.40 F.O.B., Carcross, Yukon.\n\nFunds for the purchase of this engine are available in the appropriation for the current fiscal year, and I would appreciate receiving your authority to make the purchase.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nA request has been received for the supplying of one gasoline engine, Fairbanks-Morse, 7\u00bd H.P.

Carcross, Yukon. As this request was not granted the same has been asked for during the next fiscal year. The question of a new bake oven was discussed with the Secretary during his visit to the school in the spring of this year and his suggestion was made to have the present oven carefully examined with a view to ascertaining whether the installation of new parts would put it in good working order. On my return to the school after the holidays this examination was made and we are convinced that the installation of new parts would make the oven as good as new and render the school many more years of service. A list of the parts needed was made and I wrote to the Brantford Oven and Rack Company, Brantford, Ont., for a quotation on the same. Their reply reads in part as follows:\n\nItem 1. 1 Complete Fire Box for wood or coal, as described in your letter.................. $60.00\n\nItem 2. 2 Cast Iron pipes which lead away one from each side of the Fire Box known as our #147 pipes.................. $4.00\nItem 3. 2 Cast Iron Boxes as described in the fourth paragraph of your letter, known by us as No. 181A boxes.................. $6.00\n\nItem 4. 1 Oven Thermometer which would be a 6\" stem Palmer Angle Mercury Thermometer........................................... $12.50\n\nItem 5. 1 25# can of #30 cement................................. $2.25\n\n$84.75\n\n\"The prices given are all Government Sales Tax extra @ 8\u00a2. If applicable to you please advise when ordering.\"\n\nThe freight charges on the repair parts etc. listed above would be approximately $20.60 making a total estimated cost of $105.35. The Brantford Oven and Rack Company Ltd. state that they carry these parts in stock and are in a position to make immediate delivery.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you would take up this matter with the Department asking them to authorize the immediate purchase of the parts required. I am convinced that if these new parts are not installed in the near future it will only be a very short time before the whole oven will be beyond repair. The examination that was made of this oven showed that the cast iron pipes #147, boxes No. 181A were completely burnt out and that the fire box sheeting was gone and the fire bricks badly cracked. The Kitchen Matron is badly hampered in her work by having to use a bake oven that smokes badly and blackens everything that is placed therein.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) H.C.M. Grant\n\nP.S. I may also add that having to use this oven in its present condition is dangerous for the point of view of fire risk. The oven space in the Kitchen Range is not adequate for baking the amount of bread that is required here.\n\nH.C.M.G.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connexion with the enclosed letter just received from the Principal of our Carcross School, I very sincerely trust that you may find it possible to authorize the expenditure of $105.35 which he estimates will be required to repair the bake oven. Should the cost exceed the amount he estimates our Commission will meet the excess.\n\nI visited Carcross from May 30th until June 5th last summer, and am in a position to assure you of the urgent need of these repairs, not only for the saving it will mean in the baking of the bread, but as a safeguard against the ever-present danger from fire in a frame building, and where only wood fuel is consumed.\n\nWith the Season's Greeting,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.B.R.W./WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, December 20, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, the Department will allow an amount not exceeding $105.35 towards the cost of repairs required for the bake oven at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have already allowed more for repairs and improvements at this school than was specifically provided in our appropriation for the current fiscal year; consequently no further amounts can be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.
