It is proved also by the fact that the parents gave themselves as Catholics when Dr. Fulton started took the Census. But on account of the school being a Protestant one, and the use of the school building being granted only to the minister, the whole appearance of the place is more Protestant like.\n\nYou understand easily, dear Sir, how I am obliged in duty to look after that matter\u2014and try to obtain that Catholics may have as well as others the benefit of the law.\n\nAs for the school at Thessalon, you may remember that it is after taking your advice that I did not change the teacher as I already wanted.\nto Mr. You will kindly let me know when it will be advisable to find a suitable person for the vacant office.\n\nMr. Sweery who was teaching at Sagamook, and whom I did not change in the summer in consideration of your opinion that it was better to give him another chance, wrote to me lately saying that he was leaving the school to his wife until I find a more competent teacher.

Mr. Frost, Indian Missionary, and one from the Bishop of Algoma. It appears by what I can learn that the Church of England Indians themselves in that part of the Spanish River reserve called Division No. 2 baptised some of them and brought them from Heathcote, now the Indians are after them and want to take the school from them.\n\nI would have written to the bishop before but I was waiting for a reply from Rev. Mr. Frost so I got his letter last night and hasten to send it to you with its other correspondence.\n\nThose families who the Bishop says live down the river near our school I tried to make peace among them by telling the teacher not to teach religion during school hours, but it seems nothing will do but have the school closed.\n\nI am in your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She left this place very poor.\n\nI would recommend that she receive an annuity as she is a very old woman and gave the best of her life to doing a good work among the poor Indians.

General,\n\nMr. Agent Hagan reports that Miss Carrie Morley who has been teaching the Spanish River School for over 12 years has been obliged to resign on account of ill health. It has been frequently reported to the Department that Miss Morley was most energetic and self-sacrificing in the discharge of her duties, and owing to her generosity and small stipend she received she is living in poor health and poor circumstances. Mr. Hagan recommends that she receive an annuity. She is an old woman and will not be able to resume her profession. We have no provision for the superannuation of our teachers, but as this school will not be re-opened, I think the Department will be justified, in view of her past services, in continuing her salary to the end of the year.\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Algoma, in whose diocese this school is situated, wrote some two years ago asking the Department in the event of the school being closed that he should be permitted to buy the school building for missionary purposes. I would suggest that Mr. Hagan be asked to place a valuation on the building (and that His Lordship be advised of the Department's intention to close the school.)\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The reports from the Public School Inspector on the work being performed at this school are exceedingly satisfactory and Mr. MacKay, who recently visited the reserve, states that the teacher is doing good work and is very popular with the Indians. It is an expensive place to live as she has to board in the village.

The Indians themselves, however, should be required to provide at least a portion of them and to clothe the children. At some of the other schools in Ontario this practice is followed, but in no case is the Department asked to furnish all the food supplies.

These supplies should be ready for use when the school opens after the Christmas holidays.\n\nIn your letter of the 7th ultimo you mentioned that arrangements had been made to have the school kept clean for $1.00 a month, the work to be done by the teacher and her mother.

This appears to be a splendid arrangement. The Department is furnishing some food supplied and the parents of the children are providing vegetables, bed clothing, dishes, stove, etc. The mother of the teacher is living with her and, as this will entail considerable work, I think that a small extra allowance should be made to the teacher, who receives a salary of only $400.00 per annum. I would suggest that she be allowed $10.00 a month for the three winter months for this work. I may add that Miss Cadotte is a very earnest teacher and gives good satisfaction.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, December 13, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 10th instant in which you were authorized to purchase supplies, etc., for the children whom it is proposed to keep in residence during the three winter months at the Spanish River School I beg to say that the Department has decided to allow the teacher $10.00 a month for these three months in recognition of the extra work that will be entailed. You will be good enough to advise her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

It is to be understood that this appointment is only temporary, the engagement to cease on the 30th of June unless arrangements are made in the meantime to have it continued.

The attendance for the last year or more has been so small as to hardly warrant the necessary expenditure. It might be in the best interests of the Church of England children on the reserve to have them educated at the Shingwauk Home. If, on the other hand, there is a prospect of better attendance and the school is to be continued a qualified teacher should be secured.

In view of this attendance it is not considered advisable to continue the school, as there does not appear to be any hope of effecting an improvement in the attendance, probably due to a lack of children of school age in the vicinity.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

McLean Esq.,\nActing Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of the 16th inquiring into the small attendance at our School at Spanish River Reserve has followed me here. I am writing to let you know our Ojibway at Massing for information. In the meantime I merely write you to acknowledge receipt of your letter. I had understood that the average was greater than your letter states it to be.\n\nI am\nSincerely yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma.\nSaint John's\nAug. 5, 1913\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe enclosed letter is an answer to mine asking for information about the Spanish River School which you inform me is in the jurisdiction of the Department to close owing to the low average attendance.\n\nThe letter is vigorous, more so than it would have been had it been written for your eyes perhaps. Yet it is straight or honest; you will not be misled.\n\nSincerely yours,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6169, file 435-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nShould see it. If so often happens that there is too little patience or openness of speech or hence oftentimes misunderstandings arise.\n\nCertainly Mr. Young is right in claiming, as I understand him to do, that it is not a fair thing to take the number of the weakest hunter as the year's average. If he has been alone I feel sure you will see that it is hardly just.\n\nBelieve me\n\nTruly yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\nMy Lord Bishop:\n\nYour letter with ref. to closing the Indian school to hand. It is true that the average for the last school quarter fell to 37 but it is the poorest quarter in the year for the Indian schools as most of the Indian families move away to the bush to make sugar in the early part of the term. This I pointed\nout in remarks on my report to the Department.\n\nThe first week of quarter I had no school as all were away. Second and third week I had two children, fourth and fifth three, sixth four, and then six of an attendance and the last week I had seven. The Agent was well pleased. You see that four weeks out the the sixteen bring down the average and\nand for the spring term when they are away making sugar and should not be taken as the average of the year. I had hoped that next term we would bring the attendance up to eight\u2014at least two or three families that live at a distance are trying to persuade to move nearer the school where the land is richer and\nThe children could then go to school. But of course this will settle that plan. I am sorry they intend to close as the school forms a centre around which they seem to gather and it seems to be the one bond of union among them for although most of them claim to live too far away to send the children yet they take great pride in their little school.\nI think if the Department was more interested in getting value for their money out of the Doctor, paid to care for the Indians on the Spanish Reserve and not be so afraid of spending a little money for the training of even the few that do wish to learn, that it would be more to their credit. The Doctor has never been near them yet and I have written twice.\nasking him to send medicine to different Indians they have been ill he never even acknowledged the letters. If they don't get medical attention soon there will be no Indians here to attend either church or school. Another thing, the Department never tries to do anything to encourage or compel them to attend school, the local Agent could do much.\nJust let a white family refuse to send their children to school and see what would happen. The Indians are under the care of the Department; they treat them like children, the Indian priest has no education and does not know the value of it; and yet the Dept will allow them to decide whether their children will be educated or not. They won't let me decide.\nfor my children. It seems so ridiculous to me they say to one who has some education at least and knows the value of education you must send your children to school for a certain number of years. Yet here are these uneducated people whose children are countrymen in the making and they never say you must send your children a certain number of days each year.\nand if they said that the children would be sent. But they don't have to and they don't.\n\nHow many white people would do just the same under the same circumstances, in fact I think it remarkable that we can get any to attend, taking into consideration the Indian nature. When I was a boy in the city, I remember the number of cases all through each and every year in the police courts of parents.\nneglecting to send their children to school. Yes I think it is up to the Department to provide means of education for the Indians and then see through their Agent that they take advantage of it. I have done my best in reporting, to encourage them to keep it open and in trying to get them to attend I have their promise to do better in future but more than that I cannot say.\nOttawa, August 11, 1918.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 5th inst., with enclosures from the Reverend T.H. Young with reference to the School at Spanish River.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of Mr. Young's remarks the Department is prepared to keep the school open on trial for a few months longer. There must, however, be some improvement in the attendance if the school is to be kept permanently in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. George Thorneloe, D.D. & D.C.L.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nDear Mr. Jordan,\n\nI have another letter from Rev. J.H. Young of the Spanish River Reserve about the School. He says:\n\n\"The Indians seem to feel very bad over the prospect of having their School closed. John Sissumah says if they can keep it open there will be ten children attending next term. There are at least twelve who could attend and I really think they will try to beat them if it is kept open.\"\n\nFurther on in his letter he expresses the hope that the Department will continue the School for one year or says he will do his best to make improvements.\n\nI hope the Department will consider this so that they can get this small band.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nGeorge Hyman\n\nIndian Affairs.

They wish to attend this school because they are so far from the other that they cannot go now that the snow is deep. They will find all their own school supplies.\n\nAfter this week we will have eight Indian children boarding at the school, and four Indian children boarding at home making twelve Indians in all so you see we are getting quite a school. The Sissannah had no room for them so they are staying in the school house and Sarah Sissannah is staying with them and cooking for them. She says she cannot continue to do so unless the Dept. will give her at least $10.00 per month as she has been getting more than that for cook in Massey, she is a good cook and seems to be very careful. Will you please do your best for her. We had nothing to cook on, so as we needed a stove at once I bought one that had only been used a year, it is a splendid cook stove and cost $12.00 will you kindly ask the Dept. for the amount Everything goes well.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.

The teacher does his best for the children. It is hard for him to get the children out to school? Poverty and other causes often keep them from sending their children.

There\nis no teacher for the school, and\nhas not been, I believe, for some\ntime. I would be glad to go out\nsay, three mornings a week, and\nteach these children.

Mills Fairbairn, of Massey, Ont., suggesting that he hold school for perhaps 3 mornings a week in the Spanish River Day School to cater to the educational needs of some 10 children whose parents adhere to the English Church Mission.\n\nI have replied to the reverend gentleman's letter stating that we were taking up the matter with you, with a view to having these children recruited for the Shingwauk Home, a C. of E. Industrial School at Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nWould you take this matter up with the parents and let me know in the immediate future what results you have obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I have noted that these children are of parents who are adherents to the English Church, and the Department realizes the lack of educational facilities for Protestants at this point.\n\nYour suggestion to hold school for 3 mornings a week might prove an admirable solution to this problem, but our experience with the Spanish River Day School has been that the small attendance made it an unnecessary expenditure. I am writing to the Indian Agent, Mr. Smith, at Thessalon, suggesting that these children be recruited for the Shingwauk Home, a C. of E. Industrial School at Sault Ste. Marie. If this does not prove a solution to the problem you may expect a further communication from us regarding your suggestion of a part-time day school.\n\nIn the future will you be good enough to address any communications to the Department to the local Indian Agent. If this course is adopted, the recommendation of our employee in the field is to hand without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. R.

We purchased the clergyman of the English church at Kipawa, wrote him re this matter & went to see him to tell him the contents of your letter, but the parents are not willing to send children away too far they claim.\n\nAm going to see Mr. Farnham in the near future & be starting sending a few money in the week.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nC.

If the Church of England parents are not concerned with the education of their children, the Department is not prepared to incur much expense at the day school because of our past experience in this locality. You will remember that the Spanish River Day School had to be closed because of poor attendance.\n\nIt might be well, however, as you have suggested, to see Rev.

Fairburn, of Massey, Ont., that he has the permission of the Department of Indian Affairs to commence teaching in the Spanish River day school. Any school equipment that is needed should be requisitioned for by yourself, upon the Reverend Gentleman's request. In two or three months' time, after you have had an opportunity to determine the nature and extent of the teaching activity that is being carried on, we will be pleased, if the report is favourable, to receive a recommendation from you concerning salary for Mr. Fairburn, as Teacher. If he makes a success of the work and has an attendance that warrants expenditure from the Vote for School Purposes, the Rev. Fairburn will be paid a salary that we will have to determine at that time and that, I trust, will be commensurate with the amount of work that he is doing.\n\nIf this arrangement is satisfactory to the Reverend Gentleman, this letter gives you authority to instruct him to commence work at the school.\n\nG.

The doctor appears to think that it was brought on by overstrain, and he ascribes my condition to the long walk out to the Indian Detox, which he thinks is beyond my capabilities.

This school has however been closed for two years as the building is very dilapidated, quite unfit for occupation, and as I am given to understand has been condemned.\n\nAs will be seen by the attached sketch plan of the Reserve the Indian population has, due to topographical conditions of the Reserve, separated into two distinct settlements; a river settlement along the shore of the Spanish River, being composed mostly of Protestant Indians and a lake settlement on the shore of Lake Huron, composed mainly of Indians professing the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nThese two settlements are approx. 6 miles apart and the necessity of having two schools is therefore apparent. As the river settlement consists of 15 houses having a population of 78 Indians I submit a list of the Indian families comprising this settlement, showing the number of children in each family. Although there are 42 children in all, only 31 of these are of school age.\n\nI would therefore suggest that if at all possible, arrangements be made for the construction of a small frame day school having a capacity for at least 25 children, and that a new site be selected at the point indicated on the attached sketch, which in my opinion is more central, and which the Indians themselves approve of.\n\nH. Bury\nSupervisor Indian Timber Lands.\nOttawa, July 21, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Rev. Mr. Yeomans, of Massey, and certain Indians of the Spanish River Reserve interviewed Mr. H. J. Bury, of this Department, some days ago and urged the re-establishment of the Spanish River Day School, which is for Protestant children. I should be pleased if you would let me have a report and recommendation in this connection. You might intamate the number of children that would be available to attend such school for the full school year of ten months. If you recommend a building programme, you might indicate if it could be handled on a day labour basis, under your supervision.\n\nThere are no funds available for the purpose this year, but an appropriation might be arranged if it is decided to re-establish the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. F. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to letter of July 21, 1925.\n\nLast year I took this matter up with the Department in building a school at Spanish River. The old building is in such a state that it cannot be put in order for school purposes. Also, there is no proper location being too far from the settlements.\n\nThere are about 15 children of school age living in the water pent.\n\nThe site chosen is at reasonable distance for them to go to school.\n\nI made inquiries if the work could be done by the Indians by day work but there are none who could undertake it.\n\nI had two contractors make the prints of a school similar to the one at Sagamook, sent these with the cost of building etc., to the Department.\n\nIt would be of great help for an experienced carpenter to do the work for the material etc., would have to be gotten at Seabury or the Lake. For there are no small mills cutting lumber in the vicinity & the lumber would have to be hauled & prepared for the work. The Arch Bishop & A.G. have seen me about this & he was favorable to the Department.\n\nEnclosing the construction of the school.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have, therefore, to request that you will endeavour to secure the services of a teacher to begin duties, if possible, at the beginning of the new year. It might be advisable for you to consult the authorities of the Anglican Church with a view to nominating the services of a teacher. This school will be conducted under the auspices of that Church. You should have the applicants state the salary they will expect, and the name, qualifications and experience of any applicants received by you should be submitted for the consideration of the Department.

Please inform the Department at once what steps you have taken in this matter. If, after consulting the Anglican Church authorities, you have obtained the services of a teacher, the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher obtained should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.

The Inspector here has no one he can recommend, and the Bishop has also tried through the Normal School at North Bay. You will, I think, appreciate the difficulty of obtaining teachers in the middle of the school year.\n\nThe only application we have had which is in any sense satisfactory is from Mrs. Buell of Massey, who might perhaps take the school temporarily and we could try to get a better qualified teacher next fall. I am told that she passed the entrance examination and has taken 1st and part of the 2nd form work. She taught school on a permit at Espanola Station in 1918 and at Birch Lake 1919 and 1920 under inspectors Hagen and Christie. Mr. Yeomans of Massey speaks very highly of her and she would seem to be the best we can obtain just for the present. Her husband is away from home and she is staying with her Mother at Massey. She has two small children and her sister-in-law would stay with her in order to leave her free to attend to the duties of the school. Please let me know if she would be considered as temporary teacher, and if so at what salary.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

We note that Mrs. Buell has two small children, and in this connection it is expected that she will free herself from domestic duties and devote all necessary time and energy to the classroom work at this school. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $50 per teaching month.

We are planning on a school garden, and you know that by the end of June it is barely started, and if left unattended for through the months of July and Aug., would amount to nothing at all whereas by the end of July it is well under way and one month's neglect would not matter so much and perhaps by that time the children's interest will be aroused so they will spend some time on\nit of their own accord.\n\nWill you kindly let me know as soon as possible what they say about it.\n\nI have received some more of my requisition namely\n\n24 scribblers\n12 scissors\n2 Black Board Brushes\n1 Bible\n\nThank you.\n\nI remain\nSincerely\n(Mrs) Jean Bull\n\nP.S.

I still think you would be very wise to approve of the appointment of Mrs. Gray, especially as she is so strongly recommended by your agent Mr. Rothera, who is a splendid man of very sound judgment and strong common sense, and who knows her well. I cannot understand why you still object to her. If her husband has had no work for five years, it might, I think, be taken that he cannot support her. However, if the Department still declines to accept her, I have no alternative but to concur in the appointment of the teacher whom you mentioned in your night letter.\n\nYou state that she is an Anglican. Of course there are Anglicans and Anglicans, and it is necessary for smooth working with our Missionary at Spanish River that she should be a teacher who is a definite Churchwoman.

His Lordship first nominated the services of Mrs. Kathleen Grey, but it was pointed out to him that, under Section 36 (1) of the Civil Service Regulations, no married woman whose husband is living is eligible for appointment in the public service.\n\nHis Lordship has now agreed to the appointment of Miss Hazel Crooks, who possesses a First Class Interim Certificate.

The Department hopes that you will meet with every success in your work at this school.\n\nI am enclosing a form which you should fill in, giving full particulars, as asked for by the various questions, and return same to this Department.

I regret to say that from the reports I have received from our missionary, she is not at all satisfactory. On his visits he has found the discipline of the school very bad and he also complains that she does not give enough attention to the religious teaching, even dismissing the children without prayer.

MCGILL\n\nMay 17th, 1937.\n\nRE: Teacher at Spanish River Anglican School.\n\nMr. Thomas Farquhar, M.P., in a letter dated the 11th instant states:\n\n\"I am requested by the Bishop of Algoma and by the Anglican Minister in charge, to have the present teacher, Miss Hazel Crooks, replaced at the end of the year by Miss Lilian Sim, and this change is herewith recommended.\"\n\nWill you please let me have a report.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nSecretary.\nMay 21, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Pratt's memorandum of May 17th, regarding a letter which he has received from Mr. Thomas Farquhar, M.P., in connection with the teacher at the Spanish River Anglican Indian Day School.\n\nThe position of teacher at this school became vacant at the end of June, 1936, owing to the resignation of the teacher in charge at that time. The Right Reverend Rockesborough R. Smith, M.A., D.D., Bishop of Algoma, nominated a married woman to take charge of the school, but the Department refused to consider her nomination in view of the requirements of Section 36 (1) of the Civil Service Regulations. The Bishop was unable to secure another teacher, and, as the Department had an application from a qualified teacher, Miss Hazel Crooks, who is an Anglican, her appointment was approved and she began duties on September 1st, 1936.\n\nIn April, 1936, the Bishop wrote the Department, stating that Miss Crooks was not giving enough attention to religious teaching at the school. At that time Miss Crooks was written and requested to cooperate with the local missionary. She replied stating that she was doing so.\n\nI have carefully reviewed the Inspector's reports covering her work, and all of these seem eminently satisfactory. I have taken the following excerpt from the Public School Inspector's last report, dated November 10, 1936: \"The teacher is capable and is giving her best to her work. She has the confidence of the pupils and they are working in harmony with her\".\n\nThe Department is primarily interested in the work accomplished in the school by the teacher and only in a secondary sense in her missionary efforts in the community. In view of the reports regarding her work, which have been received, I cannot recommend the dismissal of Miss Crooks at this time.\n\nDirector.\nH. R. Brooke\nDept. of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease accept my resignation from the position of teacher of the Spanish River Reserve School on December 32nd, 1937. I have enjoyed teaching the Indians, but due to home troubles, it is necessary for me to resign.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHazel Brooke.\nOttawa, November 2, 1937.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of October 30th tendering your resignation as teacher of the Spanish River Protestant School, effective December 31, 1937.\n\nYour resignation is accepted and arrangements are being made towards securing the services of another teacher to take charge of the school in January.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Hazel Crooks,\nMassey,\nOntario.\nOttawa, November 2, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Miss Hazel Crooks, teacher of the Spanish River Protestant School, tendering her resignation, effective at the end of December 1937. Her resignation is being accepted and the Department is communicating with Right Reverend R.R. Smith, Bishop of Algoma, requesting him to nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of this school on January 3, 1938.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nC. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nOttawa, November 2, 1937.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nMiss Hazel Crooks, teacher of the Spanish River Indian Day School, has tendered her resignation effective at the end of December 1937. This resignation is being accepted.\n\nI would appreciate your nominating a fully qualified teacher to take charge of this school for the balance of the current academic year. When submitting your nomination I would appreciate if you would state the name of the teacher whom you recommend, also her age, qualifications and experience.\n\nSalary is allowed the teacher of this school at the rate of $50.00 a teaching month and it should be re-opened after the Christmas holidays on January 3, 1938.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. R.R. Smith, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nBishophurst,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nMiss Hazel Crooks, teacher of the above school, has tendered her resignation, effective December 31, 1937.\n\nHer name should therefore be removed from the pay list at the end of December and no further payments made to her.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nBISHOP: THE RIGHT REV. ROCKSBOROUGH R. SMITH, M.A., D.D.\n\nBishophurst\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario\n\n5th November, 1937.\n\nThe Superintendent of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of November 2nd informing me of the resignation of Miss Hazel Crooks, of the Spanish River Indian Day School, effective December 31st. I cannot, of course, nominate a fresh teacher immediately, but will do so as soon as possible. It is, of course, a little difficult to obtain teachers in the middle of a school year. I could easily have obtained somebody last September.\n\nMeanwhile I should be much obliged if you would kindly tell me if the Department still objects to having a married woman as teacher. I am quite certain, from my visits to these schools, that a married woman would be much preferable as she could take a keen interest in the lives of the Indians which persons like Miss Crooks do not do. I hope that now the Department has changed its name it has also changed its policy, at any rate, in this respect, and I should appreciate it if you would kindly let me know, because it will make a difference in my nominations.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We note that Mrs. Buell has two small children, and in this connection it is expected that she will free herself from domestic duties and devote all necessary time and energy to the classroom work at this school. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $50 per teaching month. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Church authorities accordingly, and arrange with Mrs. Buell to begin duties as soon as the school is ready. Please give Mrs. Buell every assistance you can upon her taking up duties at this school. You should impress upon the Indian parents the necessity of seeing that their children of school age who are in good health attend regularly.\n\nPlease report later the date upon which Mrs. Buell begins duties and also state her Christian name in full, as well as the arrangements she has made for the caring of her children in order that she will be able to devote the necessary time to the classroom duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The school should be reopened on September 1st, next, the same time as the other Indian day schools open, and the second months' holidays could be taken in January, 1929, at which time, owing to weather conditions, it might be advisable to have the school closed. I shall be pleased if you will discuss this arrangement with the teacher, and inform the Department as to whether you would recommend that the holiday period be taken during August and January instead of during July and August, as is done in the case of nearly all the other Indian day schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Besides teaching services, she will also carry out the janitor's work, for which she will be paid at the same rate as Miss Thornton, the former teacher, received, viz.: $4.00 per month.\n\nMiss Crooks will arrive at Manseay Saturday morning, the 21st instant, and I have to request that you will either yourself arrange to meet her there or have the Anglican Missionary do so and accompany her to the school.\n\nShould it be necessary to supply any equipment for the living quarters, you may arrange for the purchase of the supplies absolutely required at the present time. Some bedding, such as blankets and sheets, may be necessary, if the former teacher did not leave a supply at the school. Besides, some dishes, etc., may be required. Should any furniture be required, you may inform the Department immediately what is necessary and give an estimate of the cost.\n\nThe Department will rely on you to see that Miss Crooks is given every assistance upon her taking up duties. It is expected that she will re-open the school on Monday, the 23rd instant; when it is hoped she will meet with every success.\n\nI may add His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma has been informed of the appointment of Miss Crooks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Since the fire Miss Morley,\nthe Teacher, acting & taking upon your instructions,\nhas been carrying on her School under great\ndifficulty in a little Cottage which was\nfortuitously vacant at the time of the fire. She\nhas the use of this Cottage, incidentally only\nwith the Indians. It becomes necessary therefore\nto consider what is to be done for the future.\nIn any case, were it at her disposal for a longer\nperiod, the Cottage is not suited to the purpose\nfor a school; and something should be towards\nrebuilding.\n\nI called the Indians again on the 6th\n\nJuly 19th 1848\nand talked the matter over with them. They are anxious to have a new School Room. The last, as the last was, as a Mission School under the management of the Church of England, to which they belong, with few exceptions.\n\nThere are 8 heads of families belonging to the Church, and about others. There are 26 children attending more or less regularly at the School. A boy recently received into the missionary Home from this School was present by my appearance as a very well trained lad.\n\nThe Indians are willing to give labour in the rebuilding of the School; but they ask that materials be furnished to build with. It would probably also be necessary to have a little skilled labour. If so, it would be through the Church, not suitable building. I shall be glad to hear what the Department's views upon the subject are, and to what extent we may look to it, in the present emergency, for succour. I believe materials were promised for the old School by the Department.\n\nBelieve me Very faithfully Yours\n\nGeorge Algoma\nCouncil Room\nSpanish River Reserve\nAug 20 1898\n\nResolved by John [signature]\nand Resolved by Miss Council\nThat we rebuild the School\nHouse & Sage as formerly\nThat the dimensions be as\nfollows Main building 18 feet\nby 24 feet, 14 feet high, and\nan addition 12 feet by 18 feet\n9 feet high, covered with\nshingles also that we build\ntwo Brick Chimneys, that\nthe Retained Cost will be\nabout three hundred and fifty\ndollars $350.00 and that the\nSchool House be built on\nthe old site.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. Ross, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Manitowaning,\n\nDear Mr. Ross:\n\nThe Indians have got through their summer work, and are only now ready to commence building the school-house. They had a Council on the 20th August, when a resolution, and the cost of the building was made and sent to you in duplicate, but as it is getting so late in the season they had another Council on 8th September about commencing on Monday 12th. It is to be built in the same place as it is more convenient to the majority of children who attend school. Oshkenahwa, an Indian has undertaken the job but they want provisions, so I went security to A. Cadotte for $7.60 which is to be paid out of the grant allowed by the Department for the building of the school-house, but I do not wish to have any further responsibility. I think the Indians require someone to superintend the work. I had as little expense put on the house, as possible, in hopes that the school-house would be ready by the end of September when the agreement ends, after which the Indian who owns this house, wants $1.50 per month for rent. This house would require a great deal of repairs to make it habitable for the winter. Please send me your word of assurance, then the Department will grant the money for the school-house and appoint Mr. Sins superintendent, who transacts most of the business for the Indians.\n\nAwaiting your early reply\n\nYour truly,\n\nCarrie Morley.\n13th P.

There are very few young children now living within reasonable distance of the School building and there seems little hope of its number increasing. Under these circumstances, there being still a number of families in the vicinity who can assemble at intervals for public worship I would like to buy the little building at a moderate price for mission purposes. Will you kindly inform me whether the Department will entertain the proposal to sell it and what price they would be disposed to put upon it.\n\nI shall be grateful for an early answer to this inquiry.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Atwood\n\nTo J.D.

The Department would like to have a report on His Lordship's proposal at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nJ. Hagan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nIn these circumstances, I would advise the sale of the building at a fair price if practicable. If the consent of Spanish River Band No. 2 only would be necessary to the sale that consent I am persuaded would be readily given; but if the whole reserve (both Bands) would be required to vote on the sale then I think the influences prevailing in Band No. 1 would be exerted to the full with the view of discouraging the establishment of Church of England Mission in the school building in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSamuel Hagan\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter enclosing copy of a letter from the Bishop of Algoma with suggestion for the closing of the school at Spanish River Reserve, and the sale of the building to him for mission purposes, and requiring my report on the proposal. The fact cannot be ignored that the attendance at the school has sadly dwindled, and it must appear that the closing of the school in the near future has become a necessity, although any report shows only a list of ten pupils at school and a late average of but two. I have just recently and since my inspection received a letter from Miss Morley the teacher stating that there are now six pupils regularly attending, and she has the faithful promise of these six and their parents that they will continue to attend regularly.\n\nIn view of this, as well as in view of the long and faithful service of Miss Morley, I would respectfully suggest that should the Department decide on closing the school, such closing might take effect only from the end of the current year, and that Miss Morley should be notified of the decision of the Department as soon as such decision has been arrived at.\n\nShould the school be closed this year, the building could not be used for a long time for school purposes, and being unoccupied would rapidly deteriorate in value and fall into decay.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Should it, however, be ultimately decided to close the School, Your Lordship's proposal will then receive due consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nReverend Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

I may say that the desks in the Spanish River Indian school were not worth repairing as they had been in use for about 20 years.\n\nI beg to say that the desks were very much wanted as the old ones were so broken that a person could not lay a slate on them. I hope I have not done a grave wrong. I was well pleased to get them and had them put in the school as quickly as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSamuel Hogan\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, February 25th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in reference to the ten school desks forwarded you, which you placed in the Serpent River school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your action in placing these desks in the Serpent River School is approved and the account will be charged to the funds of that Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nSamuel Hagan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nI told Mr. Hagan today that woodshed at 202 School, Spanish River Reserve, was falling down, only held up by the wood inside, he wishes to know if I can put a man to fix it up.

Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI was appointed last spring by the Most Rev. G. Horne, Archbishop of Kingston, to the charge of Massy mission, where part of my work consists in ministering to the Indians on Spanish River Reserve, about ten families belonging to the Anglican Communion. During the summer I have been holding services in the old school house, but find it will be impossible to carry on during the winter on account of the dilapidated condition of the building.\n\nThere are sixteen children of school age in this section of the reservation, and no provision for their education. If a teacher were found for the position, work could not be carried on in the present building.\n\nAt a meeting of the Indians held after service yesterday afternoon, I was asked by the Band through their Chief to request consideration by the Department of a new\nbuildings, said building to be erected and equipped at the earliest opportunity, and situated more central for the children.\n\nMay I say that the request of the Indians has my entire sympathy and support, and I believe the Archbishops as well. I hope you will take up this matter with the Department without delay, and press upon them the urgency of the situation. I shall be only too glad personally to assist in any way possible in the advancement of this work.\n\nHoping you in anticipation,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSidney F. Yeomans\nPriest in Charge.\nSir,\n\nThe school house at Spanish River belongs to Spanish Band No. 2 and is in need of repairs. There has been no school since Rev. Mr. Fairburn taught there, but it has been used for church services off and on.\n\nThe building is of logs, very old, built in a place where there are no Indians now. I would suggest that if the Dept. would build a new school or have it placed in a more central location we might start a school next year.\n\nI asked the chief councillor to make out a list of repairs to the building last summer, but did receive it until the other day.\n\nThe building is 26 x 19, long 12' high.\n\nThere will need work under the building & the roof strengthened, also the inside plastered.\n\nThe floors need repair & the window frames mended.\n\nThe chimney is not very good & also the shingles in showing signs of decay.\n\nAn excellent letter deserves from Mr. Yeomans re this building.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sidney F. Yeomans, in which he requests that the school building on the Spanish River No. 2 Indian Reserve be repaired and placed in good condition, for the purpose of holding church services and as a classroom for the Indian children.\n\nIn reply I beg to say, in view of your report as to the present state of this building and the repairs that would be required, it is considered that the Department would not be warranted in undertaking any expense in this connection.\n\nIt is noted, from the Rev. Mr. Yeoman's letter, that there are 16 children of school age. Your report that the building is not centrally located has also been noted. I should be pleased to have your opinion as to whether you would recommend that a new school building be erected on a more central site. I may say that, in view of the past experience as to the poor attendance and lack of interest on the part of the Indians when the school was formerly in operation, the Department would hesitate to incur the expenditure necessary for the erection of a new building, unless conditions have materially improved and the Indians show a greater desire for the education of their children. The funds at the credit of the Band would hardly stand the expense and it would be necessary to provide the amount required from Parliamentary appropriation. If you recommend that a new school building be erected, kindly state the number of children which it should accommodate, advise us if a teacher's living quarters should be arranged for and estimate the cost of putting up the building. As there are no classes being conducted at present, the Department cannot approve of any expenditure on the old building.\n\nPlease reply at an early date, giving your views regarding the erection of a new building and as full particulars as you can concerning size required, cost, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Which should be done if a school is to be erected a better site more central should be gotten.\n\nLast year Rev P. Farnham taught occasionally and the attendance was very poor. The excuse was that the school was too far away from the settlement which is the truth.\n\nI would recommend that this be laid over until the spring when I can choose a good position for the school & look into matters of building etc.\n\nAt this time of year owing to the fact that all building supplies would have to be hauled across the Apamitok River and the only means of locomotion being the snow, which will be drawn out at any time and the expenditure would be double what it would be if done in the spring time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Yeomans that the Department is not prepared to authorize the expenditure necessary in repairing this old building.\n\nRegarding the question of erecting a new school building on a more central site, this can stand over until next spring, at which time you should visit the Reserve and enquire into the situation. You should select a central site, and furnish particulars regarding the size of the building you would recommend be erected, also whether accommodation should be provided in the building for a teacher, and the number of children of school age who would likely attend. You should also state the amount you estimate would be required for the purchase of the material and for the labour in erecting the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

After reporting to the Committee I have been authorized to write to your Department in their name.\n\nWe have been anxious for some time to have facilities provided for the instruction of the Indian children at our end of the Reserve. The Indian Agent, Mr. Rothera of Massalon, has been appealed to often to have written your Department with regard to this matter. As you are aware the School house is not at all conveniently situated, & is in a very bad state of repair, & for a long time now no teaching has been given to the children of our families.\nI visited the Reserve on a week-day with our missionary from Moses, Rev. J.F. Yeomans, who holds service in the Schoolhouse at stated & regular intervals. There were 25 present, & the service was held. The hymns were sung in the Ojibway. It was a hearty service.\n\nThey tell me there are 17 children of school age growing up without any instruction at all.\n\nThe ideal would be a new Schoolhouse farther on where the families concerned live, & a teacher provided to give regular instruction in at least the rudiments to these children.\n\nAt least the old Schoolhouse should be put into a thorough state of repair & teaching provided.\n\nWe have under consideration the building of a little Church if the Band is willing that a small piece of land should be ceded. But this is another matter.\n\nOur Executive Committee earnestly hope that your Department can take some action.\n\nWe meet again for our bi-annual business on Oct. 5th so that we may hear from you favorably before then.\n\nWe feel sure of your sympathy with us in our work of endeavor to help these Indians for whom we are responsible, especially their spiritual welfare.\n\nfaithfully yours,\n\nP.S. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Rother.\n\nC. Wilfred Balfour.\nOttawa, September 21st, 1926.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the providing of educational facilities for the Indian children of the Spanish River Reserve.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform you that the Department had in mind the erection of a classroom and teacher's residence on a site central to meet the requirements, but the item for the purpose in our Estimates was not allowed. A note is being made, however, of the expenditure required for this purpose for inclusion in our Estimates for the next fiscal year.

You should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, from time to time, covering the cost.\n\nMiss Crooks has requested that a plot of land be fenced for playground purposes. I would request that, on your next visit to the school, you discuss this matter with Miss Crooks, ascertain the area of land you would recommend be fenced and give an estimate of the cost of the fencing material required. It is considered that the Indians would be able to get out the necessary fence posts and do the work in erecting the fence without cost. You should inform the Department of the quantity and type of fencing required and the approximate cost. Consideration will then be given as to whether the expenditure can be incurred.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC.

Willis, teacher of the Protestant Indian Day School on the Spanish River Reserve, has made a request for a fence to be built around the school as none exists at present.\n\nThere is a fence around the R.C. school. I think that Miss Willis' request should be granted as there is a large number of cattle and horses running loose on the Spanish River Reserve in the summer time and they all seem to head for the ground around the school. This makes it unsafe for the children when they are at play and tends to distract their attention when they are in school.\n\nThe length of fence required would be approximately forty-eight rods. The cost per rod would be\u2014wire 60\u00a2, posts and staples 40\u00a2, labour 60\u00a2.

Laurence,\nOffice of the Indian Agent,\nSAULT STE. MARIE,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs you are aware there are many little jobs that may be done around this school both for the good of the fabric of the building, and for the edification of the children. Additional cupboards are required in the school room. Some of the desks are in need of repair. There is need of a wood box. Racks are needed in the school room. These are but a few of the little things which need to be done around here.\n\nAll of them could be done with but little expenditure of my leisure time, but all of them require tools and materials. I would be only too glad to give my time to these things, as I did in painting the interior of the school, if I were but supplied with the tools and materials.\n\nI therefore submit for your consideration a requisition for the following:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|\n| General Purpose Saw                       | $1.00|\n| Small Block Plane                          | $2.75|\n| Claw Hammer                                | $1.00|\n| STRONG Screw Driver                        | $.50 |\n| Spade                                     | $1.00|\n| Rake                                      | $.85 |\n| Hoe                                       | $.85 |\n| Gallon Linseed Oil For School Floor        | $1.60|\n| 10 Yards Fine Wire Screening              | $4.00|\n| Screen Moulding 100 ft                    | $3.00|\n| Finished Lumber... 250 Board Ft.          | ?    |\n| Sack Cement To Seal Well                  | $1.50|\n| Glass Cutter                              | $.50 |\n| LB. Glazers Putty                         | $.25 |\n\nThe Cement mentioned above is urgently needed. At present the well, which is in the basement, is open, and consequently, the well floods in rainy weather and in the spring, which is inconvenient; and from time to time mice fall in and are drowned, which is very unhealthy; for the drinkers of the water.\n\nScreens are badly needed, but I think they can be made cheaper than they can be bought. There are no screens at all for the school or residence windows, and the one screen door needs re-screening. I\nhave therefore asked for the materials wherewith I might make the school fly-proof.\n\nThe finish has completely worn off the school-room floor. If it were painted with HOT linseed oil it would be greatly improved and would also be preserved. So I have asked for one gallon of linseed oil.\n\nMany of the window panes are loose and some are cracked. There are some pieces of glass lying around so if I had a glass cutter and some putty I could fix up the windows as needed.\n\nWith tools and some finished lumber badly needed cupboards could easily be built in the school-room. They would repay any expense of time and money in preserving the school supplies. At present there is but one small cupboard in the school-room, and as a result of the lack of space school books and other supplies have to be piled wherever room can be found. Many other things, too, could be built.\n\nI am fully aware that rigid economy is needed in these times, but I consider that the above things will be of great benefit, and will counteract future and larger expenditures.\n\nTrusting that my request will meet with your approval may I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nCharles G. Kehler,\nTeacher.\n\nP.S. I also need:\n\n1 Floor Broom -- Horse Hair Bristles... Cost $1.75 Approx.\n1 \" \" \" -- Corn Bristles........... \" .50 \"\n\nCould these be added to the above articles, or do I have to supply them at my own expense?.\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nJune 17, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith please find letter received from Mr. Kehler, Teacher at the Anglican Day School on the Spanish River Reserve, requesting material and tools to the amount of approximately $32.50 to make necessary repairs to the school.\n\nAs Mr. Kehler is willing to make the necessary repairs himself in his spare time, I would recommend that his request be granted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.P.G. Laurence\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nJune 20, 1941.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant you may purchase the following articles for use at the Spanish River C.E. Day School:\n\n1 General purpose saw\n1 Small block plane\n1 Claw hammer\n1 Strong screw driver\n1 Spade\n1 Rake\n1 Hoe\n1 Gal. linseed oil\n10 Yds. fine wire screening 30\"\n100 Ft. screen moulding\n250 Board ft. finished lumber\n1 Sack cement\n1 Glass cutter\n1 Lb. glazer's putty\n1 Horse hair broom\n1 Corn broom\n\nIt is noted that the cost of the above will not exceed $32.55.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.F.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nExtract from Inspector MacKillop's report on the Spanish River Indian Day School visited on June 6, 1941.\n\nThe school requires large screens fitted on frames for the windows. These screens should be closely hooked on the window sashes. A screen door should also be provided. On the day of my visit the flies were bad. Carpenter tools, such as saw, hammer, plane, etc. should be provided as well as the common garden tools.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Spanish River C.E. Day School on June 6 Inspector MacKillop states that screen windows are required, also a screen door. Please let me have a recommendation from you in this regard and if you believe the articles mentioned should be supplied you should give an estimate of their cost.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that we supply to this school carpenter tools such as saw, hammer, plane, etc., as well as common garden tools. If you consider that the teacher would make good use of these you might let me have a list of what is needed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nJuly 18, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 12, 36-3-5, advising that Inspector MacKillop states screen windows and a screen door are required for the Spanish River Reserve C.E. Day School and recommends the supplying of carpenter tools and common garden tools, I beg to state that I wrote on June 17th and enclosed a letter from the Teacher of the above school in which he listed the various tools desired and also the materials necessary for repairing the school. This list included 10 yards Wire Screening and 100 feet Screen Moulding.\n\nA letter received from the Department dated June 20th, 36-3-5, authorized the purchase of the items listed, the total cost of which was not to exceed $32.55, and I advised Mr. Kehler that it would be in order for him to procure same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.P.G.

Lawrence, Esq.\nOffice of the Indian Agent\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Lawrence:\n\nThe pump in the school here is old and the cylinder is so worn that it is impossible to repair it further. The base of the pump, where the cylinder is joined to the intake pipe is cracked, and, though I have had it welded, an air-tight joint is no longer possible. Consequently the pump sucks air and will not raise the water from the well.\n\nBecause of the failure of the pump, I am obliged to obtain all water used in the school from the Spanish River. During the cold weather the water is not too bad, but when the weather turns warm, the river water is not safe for drinking, as into it is poured all the sewage from the town of Espanola upstream. Even now, I take the precaution of boiling the water and giving the children hot drinks rather than let them drink too much cold water.\n\nI am, therefore, enclosing a requisition for a new pump of the same type as is now here. The approximate cost will be around $6.00 and can be purchased locally at Bower's Hardware in Massey.\n\nThanking you may I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nCharles G. Kehler\nTeacher.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 5, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to requisition of the 31st ultimo you may purchase a 3\u00bd\" cylinder force pump for use at the Spanish River Anglican Day School. It is noted from the teacher's letter that this can be secured for approximately $6.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

Kehler of the Spanish River Reserve Anglican Day School has requested that he be supplied with material to build a much needed kitchen, to be added as a lean-to behind the school building, and for sufficient paint to paint the exterior of the entire building - all work, the building and painting to be done by him without charge.\n\nAt the back of the school room in this school there is a passageway about seven feet wide with a stair-case at one end which has in the past served as a kitchen. In the winter time this works satisfactorily but in warm weather it makes both the small room and the school room too warm when a fire is kept on in the stove continually.\n\nAs Mr. Kehler is the first married teacher who has occupied these quarters, the kitchen stove is naturally more in use now than it was in the past and some kind of a summer kitchen is badly needed.\n\nMr. Kehler is very interested in his work and intends staying at the school all summer. He is putting in a large garden, cleaning the school up, and is anxious to improve the place and doing whatever he can towards encouraging the Indians immediately around him in gardening. He is well thought of by the Indians and intends staying at this school as long as his services are satisfactory.\n\nIn view of the above, I would recommend that if at all possible he be granted the material\nrequired to do this work.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, in duplicate, a Requisition for the material required, the approximate cost of which would be $150.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.F.G.

Lawrence,\nOffice of the Indian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs the woodwork in the school room has never been painted since the school was built in 1928 would the Indian Affairs Branch consider purchasing 1\u00bd gallons of ground-colour paint and 1\u00bd gallons of enamel and two paint brushes so that I may paint this wood-work in my spare time?\n\nAt the same time would the Indian Affairs Branch consider replacing the present tin wall covering with insulated wall board? The squares of tin wall covering that are now on the walls of the school room and dining room are most difficult to keep clean, they are very hard to wash, and even harder to paint. In many places the nails holding the squares of tin have loosened. The very nature of the squares and the fact that they are backed with but \u00bc inch boards combine to make it most difficult to hammer them back into place permanently.\n\nIn consequence dust and dirt lodge under the tin squares, insects crawl under them and multiply, and so render the walls un-sanitary. These facts are especially true of the ceiling.\n\nTo replace this tin it would be necessary to obtain from Eatons:\n3 bundles of 7 sheets each Wall board No. 055-560 @ $11.40 a bund\n4 \" 7 \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" 055-558 @ $8.60 \"\n300 linear Feet 1\u00bd in.

The cost of same with handles etc., would be approximately $15.00.\n\nThe goat barn, wood shed, toilets, brooder house and fence posts all need painting. The cost of paint for same would be approximately $15.00.\n\nIn order to improve the outside appearance of this school, the lawn needs to be put in shape. This would require 25lbs. of lawn seed at a cost of $12.50.\n\nLabour to help the teacher to make these necessary improvements would be $40.00.

It is impossible for the older and bigger pupils to sit comfortably and erect at these desks. As front desks and rear seats were not sent the twelve desks will only accommodate ten pupils.\n\nWould the department consider sending to us six study desks such as Moyer's No. 66, and Six chairs (As Moyer's No. 36-18, Rigid; or Moyer's No. 70, Folding)\n\nAlso because of the entrance of six beginners may I submit a second requisition for school supplies, listing those materials which we now need and of which we have no supply.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if as much of the material listed on this second requisition as is readily available could be sent for use in the next two months. At present we have no material to use with the six beginners comparable to the items listed. In order to maintain initial interest we need materials.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCharles G.

Phelan,\nTraining Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen Mr. Indian Agent Laurence was passing through here on his vacation he asked me to write to you concerning the water supply at this school.\n\nWe have, so far, spent approximately $50.00. In various places at the back of the school buildings we drove a well about 40 feet into the ground but we were unable to pierce the thick stratum of clay and tap the water beneath it. However, in another location in front of the school we found excellent water that has been classified \"Class A\" by the Ontario Public Health Laboratories. This water is in coarse sand about ten feet below the surface.\n\nIt is proposed to dig and crib a small well and pipe the water into the school. This work will entail the expenditure of a further $60.00, but will assure a plentiful supply of water with convenience.\n\nMr. Laurence asked me to write to you to ask if the Indian Affairs Branch would consider approving this expenditure. The Indian Agent will be on vacation and away from his office for another two weeks, but will be on this reserve again next week. If you so prefer a reply sent here will be handed to him on his return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Rev. Charles G.

MARIE, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Laurence:\n\nAs the twelve children who attend this school, all stay for lunch, I have, since my appointment almost five years ago, provided, at my own expense, hot cocoa or soup in order to supplement the lunches that the children bring.\n\nWould you kindly approach the Indian Affairs' Branch and ask them if they would consider granting me two dollars ($2.00) per month for the months of November to March inclusive to provide these supplements.\n\nAs all the milking goats have been given to those Indian families who applied for them, we have no goats' milk for use in the school. This is what is desired for it does more to encourage the keeping of goats by Indians themselves. It also shares the work of milking rather than leaving the work of milking the entire herd on the shoulders of the teacher. At the present time, I have more applications for fresh goats that I can satisfy for some time to come.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to buy evaporated milk, soup and cocoa to serve to the children in school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCharles G.

Marie Agency and recorded in the Official Cash Book.\n\nAmount $13.00\n\nAgency Receipt No. .......\n\nPayer on account of unexpended balance advance for securing water at Spanish River School (Anglican) - 435-76-13-998.\n\nFor Treasury Branch\nSpanish River Reserve Anglican School,\nMASSEY, Ontario.\n20th November, 1945.\n\nMr. R. F. G. Laurence,\nOffice of the Indian Agent,\nSAULT STE. MARIE,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you are aware the only means of illumination at present available at the Spanish River Reserve Anglican School is in the form of coal oil lamps. These provide but poor light and are a constant source of danger of fire. It costs about $15.00 per year for coal oil, an expenditure that, though small does not provide very good nor adequate illumination.\n\nI have learned that it is possible to purchase a Windcharger in Massey for the total cost, including installation of $150.00. Of this sum the Bishop of the Diocese, The Rt. Rev. Wm. L. Wright, D.D., has offered $75.00. This sum has been offered and is available on call from me to the Synod Office, Sault Ste. Marie, because the Bishop desires to make life here more convenient and comfortable, and because the installation of wind-developed electric light will enable us here to give more handicraft and trade training to the young adults, as well as be less dangerous.\n\nThe Windcharger that is available at the low figure of $150.00 installed is the property of a man who lived for a short time in the country and then moved into town where hydro-electric power is available. The outfit is entirely complete, and is in good order. I asked the manager of the Deagle Light and Power Co., Massey to inspect it and he has stated that it is in good shape and that it would provide us with adequate power for the single cost of the purchase. I shall enclose a complete list of all the parts and accessories that are covered by the purchase price of $150.00.\n\nThe above mentioned manager of the Deagle Light and Power Co. (a personal friend) has promised to install the Windcharger and wire the School at no additional cost to the Department if the Indian Affairs Branch will see fit to make it available at this school by voting the other half of the purchase price, i.e. $75.00.\n\nThe outlay of $75.00 would be saved in five years at the rate of $15.00 per year; the present yearly outlay for coal oil. I am assured by many users of Windchargers that the initial cost is the sole cost for many, many years. Here we enjoy almost constant breezes from the river, and it takes but a 6@ m.p.h. breeze to generate power with the 7\u00bd foot propeller.\n\nIf bought through the usual channels the outfit would cost about $300.00.\n\nWould you therefore, approach the Indian Affairs Branch regarding the installation of the Windcharger at this school, and at the same time tell them of the Bishop's offer to assist in the purchase of it. Installation would include the erection of a suitable support away from the fabric of the school building.\n\nBy having wind-developed electric light at the school we will be enabled to give evening instruction to the young adults. At the present time the young adults want to come to the school to receive some handicraft and trade training but we are handicapped by lack of good and sufficient light. We have tools and materials to use in this training, and through the kindness of friends we expect to get more.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCharles G. Kehler,\nThe Rev. Charles G. Kehler,\nTeacher.\n\nP.S. Mr. Geo. King, manager of the Deagle Light and Power Co., Massey, has promised to donate additional fixtures if necessary if the Indian Affairs Branch approves the installation of the Windcharger.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will notice that there are several shipments unpaid. We have been careful to make shipment, mail copies of invoices and copies of paid freight bills to the various Agents. However, it has come to our attention that although all the required copies have been mailed, yet requests are still coming in for extra sets of copies. In fact, the Indian Agent at Norway House has been mailed three complete sets. We are very anxious to comply with your requirements and if there is anything we can do to expedite payment we shall be very pleased to do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPaulin Chambers Co., Ltd.,\nWm.

We now have sufficient good cupboard space in which to store the supplies. It may be that by being early some congestion may be avoided.\n\nYou will note that among other things a projector is requisitioned. Either a Slide Projector or a Film Projector or both would be a great educational help, for the young AND the Adults. I have long known that both Slides and films can be obtained from various Governmental Departments, both Federal and Provincial. Industrial Advertising Agencies, Travel Agencies and others make films and slides available. We have six volt current available here and I have had experience when in the Lesser Slave Lake country with the type of projector I now have in mind. When in the North I used the battery of my car to provide the current, keeping the car motor running to generate enough current. With the Wincharger here and the school Room wired the current is always handy. I could obtain educational films at no cost to the Department which would further the education of the people here if a projector, preferably a 16 mm. Film projector adapted for six volt direct current were provided. Please consider this request as favourably as possible.\n\nCopied:\nCS\n\nCharles G. Kehler,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Kehler, teacher of the Spanish River C.E. Indian Day School, Spanish River Reserve, requesting among other things a slide projector or a film projector.\n\nIf a film projector were supplied, it could be used as well for showing educational films at the Community Hall, by use of car batteries for power.\n\nMr. Kehler's school is small and only serves a small portion of the reserve, while the Community Hall is about two miles from the Anglican School and is situated at the centre of the population, near the R.C. school.\n\nWith reference to the Homemaker's Club mentioned in his letter, I intend to get this club organized on my next visit to this reserve.\n\nAs Mr. Kehler has now disposed of the goats to the Indians on the reserve, it was agreed that the goat barn could serve a good purpose by being turned into a workshop for the young men of the reserve, who are interested in this work.\n\nR.P.G.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 11, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nClassroom Inspection Report -\nSpanish River C.E. Indian Day School.\n\nTeacher - W.H. Thompson - No Certificate -\nNo Experience - One Year Tutor Teacher - Age 28.\n\nThis teacher was formerly attached to the Society of St. John Evangeline at Bracebridge. He is more interested in missionary activities than in teaching at this school. When I arrived at the school at nine fifteen he had not yet had his breakfast and it seemed evident that school would only begin at nine thirty or a quarter of ten. Some children had drifted in about nine fifteen and they were still arriving at ten thirty. Mr. Thompson seems afraid that the Indian parents might resent his insistence that the children arrive at nine o'clock. Evidently this would interfere with his missionary activities. He informed me that he was keeping these children in after school in order to make up lost time. I left no doubt in his mind as to the Department's attitude with regard to the opening of school on time. Enrolments:\n\n| Grade | Present |\n|-------|---------|\n| 1     | 6       |\n| 2     | 3       |\n| 4     | 3       |\n| 5     | 3       |\n| 6     | 1       |\n\nThe classroom is small but well lighted with four windows on one side and one on the other. There is a side room which was used as a work shop by a former teacher and is now used for Homemaker's Club meetings. The classroom is lined with beaver board walls and is on the whole quite satisfactory for this small school.\nThere is a living-room and kitchen at the back of the school and three bedrooms above the classroom. Vents in the ceiling of the classroom heat the rooms above. Electricity is provided by a wind driven charger. There is a pump in the corner of the classroom. In Spelling three failed and one passed. In Arithmetic four failed and one passed. This teacher is willing enough but is accomplishing little. The instructions lose purpose and motive. These children need a strong teacher. They neither speak out nor read well. Neither does the teacher. With a good teacher this could be a bright and interesting school.\n\nBernard F.

Original on file # 77-13.\n\nThe Protestant day school on this reserve has very poor accommodation for the teacher, and the heating system, (by means of stoves) somewhat precarious, there have also been a number of complaints about the building being cold.\n\nThere is no basement in the school, and I think it would advisable to build a basement and install a furnace to provide a good heating system, both safe and efficient, the teachers quarters were good enough for a single man, but not adequate for a married teacher with a family. I favour the employment of married teachers, as usually they are more stable and settled and with the provision of suitable living quarters we are more liable to retain or be able to engage more married teachers, so would recommend that the necessary alterations be made to the building.\nNovember 3, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMISS WALTON,\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter received from Superintendent Laurence.\n\nYou will notice that the second paragraph refers to Vote 511.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nEncl:\nPP/HM.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 1949-50 Estimates\n\nWould you kindly add $4,000.00 for basement and furnace for the Anglican Indian Day School, Spanish River Reserve, to the Indian Education Estimates, Vote 516, for this Agency.

Sault Ste. Marie and not F.O.B. School as mentioned on the Purchase Order No. 45957.\n\nHowever, the Thayer Lumber Company are willing to forego the freight charges to Spanish, Ontario, but do not feel that they should have to pay the cartage charges from the station to the school as they knew nothing of the distance from Station to school. All other shipments of materials to this Reserve have always been \"F.O.B. Station\".\n\nIt was on my instruction that Alfred Eshkakagon transported the roofing from station to the school and I feel that it is only fair that the Department should bear this extra cost.\n\nR.

I omitted two porches, sunroom, and shed which also needed roofing; I was also short on the amount for the main roof.\n\nThis shortage was brought to my attention when the carpenters were on the job and as it is difficult to get suitable men on the Reserve to do this sort of work, I thought it advisable to get this job completed when I had the competent labour.\n\nI trust you will agree with this decision and pass the attached voucher for payment.\n\nR.
