She was quite emphatic in stating that a small Quebec heater of this type has proved unsatisfactory. She is very much opposed to having the present stove replaced by one of a similar type. This teacher recommends the purchase of a larger stove which would hold fire over night. The type of stove which would suit Mrs. Clemens is available in Forest at a cost of $69.50. I agree that the larger stove would be more suitable and if funds are available I recommend the purchase of the more expensive heater.\n\nKindly advise at an early date as to which stove should be purchased for this classroom.\n\nM.

There is no regular milk delivery on the Reserve with the result that the average child receives very little fresh milk unless it is procured at school.\n\nLast year eight quarts daily were delivered, but the attendance this year is larger. There are eighty-two children enrolled and I think ten quarts per day for the period January to March 31st should be purchased. The Page Dairy at Ravenswood would supply the milk and bill us each month.

The line is located on the road on which the Kettle Point Indian Day School is situated and we can therefore secure electrical service for the school and teacher's residence.\n\nWhen Mr. A. J. Doucet visited Sarnia recently I mentioned this matter to him and he suggested that I procure estimates from local firms in Forest re cost of wiring the two classrooms and teacher's residence. Enclosed please find two estimates, one from the Eliot Electric, Forest, Ontario for $441.15 and the other from Gale and Milburn, Electrical Contractors, Forest for $360.00. Both firms have quoted on a three wire service as an electric stove will eventually be required in the residence. The usual number of outlets are to be placed in the residence. In the large classroom six large lights are required. In the small classroom four will be sufficient.\nI believe either one of these electrical contractors would make satisfactory installation and as the estimate of Gale and Milburn is much less than that of Elliott Electric it would appear that their tender should be accepted.\n\nWould you please give this matter consideration and advise if I am authorized to have the teacher's residence and the two classrooms wired for electricity, and if so please name the contractor who is to be given the job. A voucher in payment for materials supplied and labour performed would be submitted when the wiring has been completed and passed by the Wiring Inspector.\n\nM. W.

Miss Powell recommends that tooth brushes, tumblers and tooth powder be made available to Mrs. Mills who is prepared to instruct the children at the Kettle Point School with respect to the care of their teeth.\n\nWe understand that you will provide the tooth brushes and tumblers. There are two dental powders available through Indian Health Services supply. One of these contains sodium perborate but we are not in favour of the regular use of this since it may, after continuous use, set up some irritation. The other powder contains camphorated chalk and is much more suitable for regular use. We will suggest that Miss Powell prepare a requisition for sufficient quantity of this tooth powder, although we would anticipate that in due course the students or their parents will find themselves in position to provide this material for themselves.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

Dr. Ross has almost completed the repairs so now would be quite a good time to start preventive measures. We thought perhaps if each child had a cup of some sort and a tooth brush, Mrs. Mills would conduct them in twice daily cleanings. I suppose sodium perborate is as good as anything for a tooth powder and I don't think they would mind the taste.\n\nI would like to start the same thing in the Sarnia reserve school so between the two there are nearly 200 pupils. Perhaps paper cups would do and would be less expensive. If you agree to this plan should we send in a special order for tooth brushes, cups and tooth powder. Or does the order come from your office.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) S. W.

I did not authorize Mrs. Orr to make these purchases, nor did the Randolph Office Supply consult me regarding them until a few days ago. You are aware that Mrs. Orr was on the verge of a nervous breakdown during the time she taught at Kettle Point. I have little doubt but that she did make the purchases on the understanding that she would pay for same herself as she often did buy equipment of this nature without consulting me and assumed the expense herself. I repeatedly cautioned her against this practice but it had little effect on her. To the best of my knowledge the printing set, newsprint and pencil sharpener are not in the school at the present time, although many supplies were taken by the children when Mrs. Orr was teaching there. On the other hand the Randolph Office Supply apparently gave this teacher the above-mentioned articles in good faith, and should be paid.\nI believe Mrs. Orr is now blind and practically destitute. I have reason to believe that her only source of revenue is a blind pension. I do not know her present address. The last contact I had with her was about ten months ago when her address was as follows:\n\nMrs. Dora M. Orr,\nR.R. #1,\nAncaster, Ontario.\n\nAs indicated above it would be a waste of time in trying to recover the amount of this account from Mrs. Orr and after careful consideration I recommend that the Department arrange payment. If this is impossible kindly advise so that I can report to Randolph Office Supply.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\n\nEncs. 4\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nTeachers at Kettle Point and St. Clair Indian Day Schools of Sarnia Agency are planning on taking school children on a bus trip to visit a zoo in Detroit, U.S.A. on or about June 8th. The parents of the children are paying all expenses in connection with the proposed journey.\n\nI mentioned the plans which the teachers have to Regional Supervisor Morris when he visited this Agency on May 30th. He was in favour of giving the teachers permission to take the pupils on this educational trip but suggested that I acquaint the Education Division in Ottawa also.\n\nIf you do not approve of the plan kindly advise by wire. I think it would be interesting and educational for the pupils. The only reason why permission should not be given is that some child might get lost or hurt, in the event of which the parents would no doubt hold the Department responsible.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nJune 4th, 1949.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSarnia, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to the action that is being taken by the teachers of the Kettle Point and St. Clair Indian Day Schools to take the children on a bus trip to visit a zoo in Detroit.\n\nIt is noted that the parents are paying all the expenses.\n\nAs it is understood that the children will be transported in a Standard Bus which carries insurance, the Department does not see any reason why the permission you request should not be granted.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nWhen the Director and Regional Supervisor J. E. Morris visited this Agency on May 30th I was advised that funds are available to erect a new school on Kettle Point Reserve. Mr. Morris instructed me to write to the Department on this subject.\n\nI have made some preliminary investigation in this connection and beg to report as follows:\n\nAs the initial step, additional land should be secured to enlarge the present school site. I think about one (1) acre would be sufficient and could be purchased from Moses Wolfe Sr., who is the recognized owner of most of the lands in the East half of Lot 2, Range \"B\" immediately east of the existing school lot. The probable cost would be $50.00. It would have to be fenced, clay fill put in and levelled.\n\nI understand that the Department plans to erect a single classroom with full basement as a separate unit rather than build an addition to the existing two-roomed structure. If funds are available I suggest that a small residence be built in conjunction with the proposed new\nclassroom as the residence now in use will not be large enough to accommodate three teachers.\n\nWith regard to water supply I have been informed by reliable Indians that we would be certain to procure a good supply of pure water if a well were drilled to a depth of about eighty feet. Then an electric pumping system and modern plumbing with a septic tank could be installed. At present there is a very poor dug well about thirty-five feet deep at the school, but it goes dry almost every summer. Hydro is available and has been used in the existing school and teacher's residence for the past two months.\n\nThere are at least two good Indian carpenters on the Reserve who are capable of erecting the proposed school according to plans and specifications. They are Grant Milliken and Wilfred Shawkence. Both are quite anxious for the work, particularly Milliken. He has built one or two houses in the nearby town of Forest, repaired and renovated stores and built and repaired houses on the Reserve. If either of these two Indians were given the job I believe they would wish to do it on the hourly basis at rates of $1.00 or $1.25 for foreman and carpenters and about 75\u00a2 or 80\u00a2 per hour for labourers. I strongly recommend that the erection of the school be done by contract rather than by day labour for obvious reasons.\n\nThe classroom should be large enough to accommodate up to thirty-five pupils. The teacher's residence could be on one end or side of the classroom or above it in the form\nof an apartment.\n\nIt would appear advisable to have Mr. Doucet or some senior official from the Education Division come to Sarnia to decide upon the location, type and size of building, etc., and then have blueprints prepared for the contractor to follow.\n\nYour advice and instructions in this matter will be appreciated.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nJune 22, 1949.\n\nMr. M. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSarnia, Ontario.\n\nKettle Point Indian Day School\n\nUnder separate cover we are mailing you one set of plan 865 and one set of specifications covering this building. As you will note from the attached memorandum to Mr. Brown, we are arranging for the purchase of the property.\n\nBefore the construction of the school can begin we must be assured of a satisfactory source of water for toilet purposes.\n\nCould you please advise me as to the probable cost of such a well. If the amount is below $300.00, you can make immediate arrangements to have work begin on securing an adequate water supply.\n\nIf the cost is over $300.00, please advise me as to the probable cost, and the name and address of the well driller.\n\nI note that you wish to have this school erected by contract. If so, it will be necessary to advertise for tenders and I would like to hear from you as to the newspapers in which we should advertise.\n\nI think you will note from the plans that it will be quite a satisfactory building covering all the requirements mentioned in your letter. It will not be possible to have Mr. Doucet or other official from the Education Division come to Sarnia at the present time.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Erection of New School - Kettle Point Reserve.\n\nWe wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter 401-5 of June 22nd, 1949 on the above subject.\n\nPlease be advised that the plan #865 and one set of specifications were received. The building as proposed on the plans will be quite suitable.\n\nIf this school is to be built by contract it is suggested that an advertisement for tenders be inserted in three papers, namely The Sarnia Observer, Sarnia, Ontario, The London Free Press, London, Ontario and The Windsor Star, Windsor, Ontario. I believe The London Free Press has the largest circulation in the Kettle Point area. My reasons for recommending that the school be built by contract result from past experiences at Sarnia where the St. Clair School and St. Clair teachers' residence were erected on a cost plus basis and the final cost was practically double the original estimated cost in both cases. I fear that similar experience might be encountered on the Kettle Point\nSchool if it were erected on an hourly basis. However, as mentioned in my previous letter of June 16th, there are experienced Indian carpenters on Kettle Point Reserve who could erect the building if given an opportunity and cost might be controlled by close supervision and assistance from an official at Muncey, Caradoc Agency. After careful consideration I favour plan of erecting this building by contract.\n\nWith regard to adequate water supply I would advise that I intend to visit Kettle Point Reserve early next week to interview drillers, at which time an estimate of the cost will be secured. I shall write you further on this subject as soon as the information has been obtained, and if the cost of a well will be less than $300.00 the driller will be instructed to commence.\n\nIn connection with advertising, if interested contractors are instructed to submit tenders, a supply of tender forms should be forwarded to this office. Of course this will not be necessary if the Department wishes the tenders forwarded directly to Ottawa by the contractors.\n\nM. W.

Wells of a similar nature on Sarnia Reserve with 4\" casing are not large enough to allow a continuous supply of water to operate a pressure system. The well at Kettle Point will have to provide water for approximately eighty-five pupils and three teachers and when it is being sunk the proper size casing should be installed even if the cost is greater.\n\nWhen replying to my letter of June 28th please advise as to the size of the casing you consider should be used. No doubt 6\" casing will be much more difficult to procure than 4\". Kindly advise if it will be in order to use 4\" casing if 6\" cannot be procured within a reasonable time.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Erection of New School - Kettle Point Reserve.\n\nI wish to report further with regard to drilling a well for the new school at Kettle Point and in this connection beg to refer you to your letter 401-5 of June 22nd, 1949.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, June 27th I made a trip to Forest and Kettle Point to interview well drillers. The only driller in the Kettle Point area is Mr. Frank Rendle, Forest, Ontario. Another driller named Andrew Heal of Watford, Ontario (about twenty miles from Kettle Point Reserve) customarily does considerable well drilling in the Forest district. I did not see Mr. Heal but had a personal interview with Mr. Rendle. I was reliably informed that both of these drillers have adequate drilling machinery and that their work is satisfactory.\n\nMr. Rendle is of the opinion that it would be necessary to drill to a depth of approximately ninety-five feet to procure water on the school site. He charges $1.25 per foot when drilling through clay, shale or sand,\netc. If he encounters hard pan rock the charges are $1.50 per foot. The well would require 4\" casing which would cost approximately $1.30 per foot. The casing is in short supply but Mr. Rendle believes that a dealer in Petrolia, Ontario will have the quantity required in about two weeks from this date. Mr. Rendle is willing to commence drilling operations in about two weeks as soon as he finishes two small jobs on which he is now engaged. However, he pointed out that there would be little use of starting to drill if the casing is not available.\n\nFrom the above you will note that the estimated cost will be about $260.00. If a dry hole were encountered this cost would be doubled. The cost would also be increased if the driller had to drill beyond the estimated ninety-five feet. On the other hand it is possible that he might strike a good supply of water at eighty or eighty-five feet. In view of the uncertainty of the final cost I did not instruct Mr. Rendle to commence. In any event he could not start until about July 11th.\n\nWould you please give the above consideration and advise any further action which you wish taken in connection with well drilling for the proposed school on Kettle Point Reserve?\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Kettle Point Indian Day School - New Building.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter 401-5 of July 4th with regard to advertising for tenders to erect the above-mentioned building.\n\nThe sample advertisement is quite satisfactory. However, I wish instructions as to handling the matter when interested contractors appear at this office. No doubt each contractor will request a copy of the drawings and specifications so that he may study them. I have only one set of drawings and specifications on hand and cannot very well allow any one contractor to take them from this office as other contractors may want to study them at the same time. Would you please advise if any contractor who appears is to be allowed to take the plans, and if so what length of time should he be given before returning them? I note that tenders must be submitted on forms provided. We have no such forms at this office and a supply should be forwarded immediately.\nIn connection with the water supply I beg to advise that I am waiting for a reply to my letters of June 28th and 29th in which I pointed out that no guarantee that the cost will be below $300.00 can be given and also asked for a decision as to the size of casing which you consider should be installed. I have not instructed the driller to commence operations pending advice from the Department.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nMr. M.W.

The work is not exactly urgent, but if funds are available I recommend that it be performed this year.\n\nI have secured an estimate of the cost from an experienced Indian painter. He will paint the outside of the entire building, which consists of two classrooms and the teachers' residence, with two coats for $325.00. This would include the cost of the paint as well as labour. The estimated cost of the paint which he will use is $110.00 with the labour being $215.00. The first coat would be put on with brush and the second coat with either brush or spray equipment.\n\nThe interior painting of the senior classroom for materials and labour for one coat would cost $170.00, being $80.00 for paint and $90.00 for labour. Painting of the interior of the junior room would cost $55.00, being $20.00 for paint and $35.00 for labour.\n\nIf the Indian who submitted the estimate is given the contract for this work he would replace a number of\nbroken window panes and also oil the floor of each classroom at no extra cost. This man has painted quite a number of public schools in white localities in the surrounding township and I am certain that he would do a good job. The interior of the teachers' residence does not require painting this year as it was redecorated last summer.\n\nWould you please advise if you wish to have this work done, and if so an accountable advance cheque for $550.00 in favour of Sarnia Indian Agency Trust Account should be forwarded to cover cost of materials and labour. If you decide that only the exterior of the building is to be painted only $325.00 would be required.\n\nThe Indian who submitted the estimate is Sam Greenbird. He would employ three or four other Indian members of the Band to assist him and thinks that it would take about three weeks to complete the project. No action will be taken in connection with this painting until I am further advised.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nJuly 20th, 1949.\n\nMr. M.W.

The driller reached 110 feet at the first site and when he ceased operations, the formations was what he called soapstone which he considers unproductive. I enquired in the immediate neighbourhood and learned that the depths of wells averaged 90 - 103 feet.\n\nThe site I have picked lies between the entrance of the teacher's residence and the site of the new classroom on the edge of the present driveway. Mr. Rendle will return to resume operation on Monday, August 1, 1949, unless otherwise advised.\n\nIf it is satisfactory to proceed please advise by return mail.\n\nRobert J.

(RG 10, Volume 6138, File 401-5, part 5)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nOn visiting Kettle Point School last evening I found that a number of window panes have been broken in the classrooms and teacher's residence since school closed in June. The two outdoor toilets are in need of cleaning. Various other small repair works are required consisting of replacing broken boards on woodshed and garage, fixing latches and locks on doors, screening on windows, etc. If we are not successful in securing water for the proposed new school a new pump will have to be purchased to enable us to get water from the present dug well.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the cost of attending to these repairs, but I think that $75.00 should be sufficient for labour. I therefore suggest that an accountable advance cheque for $75.00 be forwarded in favour of Sarnia Indian Agency Trust Account so that I will be able to pay the Indian labourers as soon as the work is completed. The materials required for the repair work would consist mainly of screening, window panes, and, of course, a pump if it is found to be necessary at a later date. These purchases could be made locally to good advantage and accounts submitted to the Department under cover of vouchers for payment. I do not propose to replace the broken\nwindow panes until the last week in August or the first week in September as they would no doubt be broken again by rowdy youths who congregate around the school and sometimes appear to derive pleasure from damaging property. I might mention that both the Indian Constable and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Sarnia have been instructed to keep close watch on the building during the summer holidays when the teacher is absent.\n\nKindly advise if the repairs as suggested above meet with your approval.\n\nM.

Sup't Gen'l of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of the following communication,\n(from Indian Agent Mr. J.P. Donnelly) of the 12th instant:\n\n\"Rev. Father Macdonald, S.J.,\nFort William Mission.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\n\"The Dept wishes me to inform the\nChurch authorities that the Lake Helen Mission school must be finally\nclosed by the 31st of March next, and sooner if a vacancy can be found for Miss\nMurphy, the present teacher, and that there is a vacancy under Mr. Ross'\nsuperintendency at Chassalon (a Roman Catholic school), and apply\ncation could be made to the Rev. Father Atus, in charge of that district to\nsecure the position.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.P. Donnelly.\"\n\nNow, respectfully wish to call the attention of the Department to the following\npoints:\n\n1. Although it cannot be denied that, in Miss Lahaye's (the former\nteacher) time, the Lake Helen Mission school was poorly attended,\nyet it is a fact (as the returns of this quarter will show) that, since this\nMurphy took charge of it on September 2nd last; the attendance has much improved and surpassed that of the school on the Reserve. Last month I visited the Lake Helen school twice, once I found 12 pupils present, and the other time 10.\n\nWhile at Lake Helen there are 15 children of school age, at the Reserve there are but 12. Of these latter, six (6) have been away from the Reserve away in the bush ever since last fall, and will not, in all probability, be back till before May or June even. Of the six remaining pupils, one at least, Miss Angelique de Laronde, used not to be taught in the school nor even otherwise by the teacher, Mr Deschamps, but privately at home by her uncle, Mr Henry de Laronde (and such is now sadly the case yet); consequently the teacher could not put her on his return list. Moreover: When last month I was at the Reserve (Wepigon), I asked the teacher, on the second day, whether he would be at his school that afternoon, as I wished to visit it. He answered in the negative, adding, \"Whom shall I teach? There are no pupils; you took the best away\" (he was alluding to two girls that went to the Lake Helen school, their parents having removed thither).\n\nThese being the facts, why would the Department close a school (that of Lake Helen) which is picking up, and is the last at Wepigon, while it keeps open one that has a smaller attendance, and has been established much later.\n\nIf the Lake Helen Mission school be closed, where will the children go for their schooling? Up to the Reserve? But there are at least four miles, if not more, between the two places, a distance which has to be made in canoe (on Lake Helen) in summer, and on the ice in winter.\nI cannot believe that the Department would insist that the children should go that distance (without speaking of the danger of the route) twice every day, five days every week. Why! this very question of distance and danger was the main reason the Reserve people put forward to get a school of their own, some years ago; and they probably got it too on that very score too.\n\nWill they go to the public school, at Nepigon village, some two miles off? This would require them either to cross Lake Helen, or else the bridge of the C.P.R., over the Nepigon River, almost all of them. Neither of these two alternatives would be without danger for the children, and I do not think that their parents would let them go under such circumstances. Besides we like our Catholic children to frequent a separate school.\n\nThere are in the Nepigon, i.e., Red Rock Band, just 37 children of school age\u2014Catholic children (there are no others)\u2014they are divided thus:\n\n- At Lake Helen Mission: 15\n- On the Reserve: 12\n- At the mouth of the Nepigon River (amboispan): 6\n- On White Hill (12 miles from town): 4\n\nTotal: 37\n\nI am confident, dear Sir, that the Department will give this matter the consideration it deserves, and decide according to the best interests of the Band.\n\nYours, dear Sir,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nJos. Specht, SS.\n\nKinzy,\nin charge of Nepigon Mission.\nOTTAWA 27th December 1895\n\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant in reference to the proposed closing of the Indian School at Lake Helen Mission; and in reply I beg to say that enquiry will be made in regard to this matter.

Super-t-Gen'l of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere are a few points about which I would like to have an understanding with the Department:\n\nAbout the recommendation to the dismissal of teachers:\nEver since the schools of Michipicoten River, Red River, Red Bay, and Nepigon Lake (Jackfish Lake) have been granted, with a salary of $250.00 per year as teacher's salary, we, the missionaries of Fort William, have had the privilege of nominating, or rather recommending teachers, to be approved by the Department; and it was understood that such teachers needed no certificate in the sense the word is understood for teachers among the Indians. With regard to the dismissal of the same, I think that our request to have objectionable teachers removed from position, ought to be taken into consideration, as we are able to form an adequate judgment of the situation. Now dear sir, let me well known\u2014because I well expressed wish to have the school of Paps Plat & that of the Red Rock Reserve removed, Mr. Smith, who knows perfectly well my grounds for complaint, has retained those two teachers in their position, to the utter disgust of\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6139, File 402-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndians of those two lands. After all the teachers are for those people and not vice versa.\n\n2) About the Lake Helen Mission school? Isn't the intention of the Department to close it finally at the end of the present quarter? Mr. Donnelly told me so by word of mouth only. I would certainly have been very thankful to the Department for a written notice to that effect.\n\nI must confess that the decision surprised me. Believing (in your letter to me no. 153816, 27th Dec. last), you said:\n\n\"... In reference to the proposed closing of the Indian school at Lake Helen Mission... I beg to say that enquiry will be made in regard to this matter.\"\n\nWas the enquiry made? Did Mr. Donnelly make his report? Was the latter favorable to the above school, or unfavorable?\n\nAbout these points I am left in the dark entirely. I am afraid the Department was not properly enlightened on the state of the Lake Helen or the Red Rock Reserve schools; for, as far as I am concerned, I have always found it fair in its dealings.\n\n3) About the Michipicoten River school... On the 1st inst., Indian Agent Van Abbott, of Baillie-St. Marie, wrote me thus about it: \"I am instructed by the Dept's Chief General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, to inform you, in reply to your letter, that the Department having no available funds for a school at Michipicoten, they cannot contribute anything towards...\"\nthe payment of a teacher's salary\" (Letter book 718, file 16450, 6th May 1896).\n\nFrom the wording of the above, one would infer that the Department is under the impression that there is question of opening for the first time a school at Michipicoten, while there is only question of re-opening one that has been granted by the Department some 15 years ago (though, through incontrollable circumstances, it was in operation only one year - 1882-3).\n\nThis is clear from the following words written me by the late Bishop Jervis in March 1887: \"I am sure that by this time you know that everything has been granted concerning the four Indian schools at Red Rock, Nepigon Lake (Jackfish), etc., Michipicoten.\"\n\nThe same your non predecessor in office - Mr. Van Horne - implicitly acknowledged (for he knew it) when he wrote me (no. 16450, 17th March, 1892): \"No appointment of a teacher at the above point (Michipicoten) could be made until the school house has been removed and ready for use.\"\n\nMr. Van Abbott knows all this. Why he has not said anything about it, he knows best.\n\nHope, dear Sir, in the interest of the Michipicoten Band, which is composed of intelligent people, that you will come to their help in this matter, as they really deserve it.\n\nHoping to receive an early reply to this my letter, I remain,\n\nDear Sir, - Your obedient servant, Jos. Specht, J.M.\n\nIndian Affairs.

All applications should embody previous experience and qualifications and should be submitted through the local Agent of the Department.\n\nWith regard to the dismissal of such teachers, before they are removed, the Department should be fully advised as to the causes which call for such removal when if they considered sufficient their dismissal will receive the sanction of the Department.

There is now, therefore, a vacancy at the Pic, which will require to be filled before the close of the summer holidays.\n\nThe teacher of the Red Rock School, John Deschamps, will not be retained and you are at liberty to nominate his successor.\n\nWith regard to the Lake Helen school, I beg to say that, as Mr Separate School Inspector Prendergast has given a very favorable report thereon, and as the attendance during the year was much better than anticipated, the Department will consent to withdraw its decision to close the school, and it would be glad to retain the services of the present teacher Miss Murphy, should she care to remain there.\n\nWith regard to your application for the salary of a teacher at Michipicoten River I may state that the reply made to you by Mr Agent Van Abbott of Sainte Marie, that no funds were available for a school at that place, was correct; but an effort will be made to obtain a grant for this purpose at the next session of Parliament. Unless this money is voted the Department cannot authorize the school being opened.\n\nI may add that a copy of this communication in as far as it relates to this schools in Mr Donnelly's Agency, will be sent to that gentleman for his information and guidance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Durney\n\nSecretary Dept.\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\nFort William, Ont.,\n24th January 1898.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 141198, dated 4th inst., re, Indian Reserves on Lake Superior.\n\nI state present there is no Indian Agent at Port Arthur, where I am attending myself to some business with regard to our Indian schools.\n\nWhen Mrs. Jessie H. MacKay, teacher of the Lake Helen Mission school (Red Rock Band) returned from her six weeks' holidays about the middle of last month, Mr. J. P. Donnelly sent her to take charge temporarily of the Rays Plat Reserve school, with the distinct understanding that she was to return to her own at Lake Helen.\n\nAccordingly, some three weeks ago, when away from here & not having heard yet that Mr. Donnelly was no more Indian Agent, I wrote to Mrs. MacKay to return & take her Lake Helen school which she promised to do. So, I expect her to be at the latter school by the 1st of next month, to resume her work.\n\nI also wrote East for another teacher for Rays Plat Reserve, as said school will be left vacant by the departure of Mrs. MacKay.\n\nAs to news about the school at Pic River: On November 27th last, Mr. J. P. Donnelly informed me that he had applied to the Depart...\nment for a box stove for that place, also a galvanized iron chimney... but that the Department declined the application on the ground that they had no funds available for that purpose. That he was further instructed to put the school in as good repair as possible for the winter.\n\nAt the same time he asked me to stop the teacher, with whom I had been corresponding, from coming to Pic River, as the room could not be kept without a stove, besides being unsafe without a chimney.\n\nThe consequence is that the poor children of that Reserve have been without schooling during the last six months. The fact of the matter is that with another stove & a good roof-jack, the building will not be in danger from fire.\n\nNow Mr. Antoine Morissette, one of the residents (half breed) of Pic River offered to furnish the necessary articles, viz.: a stove 3 ft long, a roof-jack, stove-pipes with a damper, as he says \"for the sake of the school\".\n\nI can get a teacher for that school at any time, and a good one too. For the last half year the people have been clamoring for one. I hope the department will accede to their laudable wishes soon.\n\nI am informed by Indian Agent Van Abbott that the Department has changed its mind, and decided not to grant a teacher for the Michipicoton-River school. I feel sorry for the poor children!\n\nIn the hope of receiving an early favorable answer,\nI remain, dear sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nRev. Jos. Specht, S.J.\n\nMissionary\nMr. J. H. Hodder\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been thinking for some time of asking you if I could take my holidays from the first of September instead of the first of October as I did last year. For in September there are tourist and exhibition dates which are over by the first of October. And the Indians generally start for their fall fishing some time in September. If I was getting holidays from the 15th of August that would be getting the six weeks all in the one quarter. Getting from the first of September two weeks in October would be in the next quarter. Would that make any difference with the Department? Would you kindly let me know.\n\nWould you please send me two or three blank reports before the end of this month.\n\nMr. Hodder, did the Dept. not allow two dollars $2.00 for kindling the school fire last winter. They have allowed it other winters for some years past.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nJessica H. MacKay\nPort Arthur, 10th June 1898\n\nSir,\n\nHereewith find letter from Jessie H. McKay, teacher of the Lake Helen Mission Indian School, asking to be allowed to take her holidays from 1st of September instead of the 1st of October. Also asking if an allowance of Two Dollars was made for handling the school fire this winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. F. Hodges\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, 16th June, 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant enclosing a letter from Mrs Mackay, teacher of the Lake Helen school, asking whether she may be allowed to close the school for vacation on the 1st of September instead of the 1st of October. In reply I beg to say that the Department does not see its way to allowing the vacation to begin so early, but it will consent to the school being closed on the 16th of September as the Indians generally leave for their fishing grounds some time in September.\n\nReferring to the matter of the kindling of the fire in the schoolhouse during the winter, I may say that there is an allowance of $2.00 for this purpose, and upon your sending in an account therefor, the same will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Do you not think the Department would reimburse me for this?\n\nAnother matter I wish to ask your instructions on. The Indian families who live down the river are anxious to have me come down there and teach their children for two weeks in each month during the winter. As I mentioned in my last report my school is smaller than usual this winter, owing to some of the Indians being short of a supply of fish, for the winter and moving inland with their families.\n\nThese children down the river are unable to come to school owing to the distance. I am willing to teach those children provided the Dept. is agreeable.\n\nI remain your obedient servant,\n\nJesse H. MacKay\nPort Arthur, 1st February 1899\n\nSir,\n\nHerewith I communicate from Mrs. Jessie H. MacKay, school teacher of the Lake St. Ellen mission Indian schools, on account of the small catch of fish the number of families living at the mission this winter is greatly reduced. I see no objection to Mrs. MacKay dividing her time between the mission and the town river settlement during the winter months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.T.

In reply I beg to say that the Department has no objection to this being done, and it will not be necessary for Mrs Mackay to send in a separate return for these new pupils, if she will be kind enough to mention them on the return from Lake Helen school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Bonin, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.:\nNepigon, 30 November 1907\n\nNeil McDougall, Ind. Agent,\nPort Arthur.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you be pleased to present\nthe following appointments of teachers:\nMr. John Deschamps for the school situated on\nthe Nepigon River Reserve. I went last month\nto ascertain by myself the number of pupils we\ncould count upon to attend school and found that\nthere were 10 children whose parents are anxious to\nhave a teacher for their children and next spring these\nmore children could attend the school.\n\nAt Pic River Reserve there are over 25 children\nof age to attend school. We cannot count on such\nan attendance because there are always some of the\nfamilies away, but the average attendance should be\nfrom 10 to 15. The school was closed for over one year\nbecause we could not find a teacher. But I would\nrecommend Mrs Alice Wissian a former pupil of\nthe Fort William Industrial School, where she was\nfor 7 years.\n\nAnd as Miss Alice Barker, teacher at the Nepigon\nschool\nSchool on Lake Helen near the church for over three years, has notified me in October that she would teach only until June. I would recommend Miss Sara Lagarde as trial. She is an older girl who has been two years in the Fort William Industrial School. I am aware that she is not much qualified for teaching, but she will have to prepare her matters more carefully.\n\nThere are actually 14 or 15 pupils attending school every day and some of them are doing very well. It would be too bad to close the school. But on the other hand it is nearly impossible to obtain qualified teachers in such lonely places for a salary of $300.00.\n\nBut I promise to visit these schools as often as I can and try to help the teachers to improve their teaching. The school at Nepigon on Helen Lake needs to be repaired; the roof is leaking and it is very cold. Water and ink get frozen inside when temperature is a little low.\n\nPlease to inform me of the Dept's answer as soon as you get it.\n\nYour humble servant in lot\n\nRev. P.E. Lamarche\n\nNepigon, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nHerewith I beg to attach letter from Rev Father Lemarche. He states that Miss Parker, the teacher of Lake Helen school has notified him that she will only teach till the Xmas holidays. He recommends Miss Sara Legarde on trial to take this school. He reports an attendance of 14-15.\n\nHe also recommends that a school be opened on the Red Rock reserve up the river with John Deschamps as teacher and says there will be 10 children attend with additions in the spring. He further reports regarding the Pic River school and says there are over 25 children of age to attend - the school has been closed for about a year as we could not get a teacher. He names Mrs Alice Wisian as teacher who was formerly a pupil of the Fort William Industrial School.\n\nAll which is submitted for the consideration of the Dept.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

E. Jones.\nSir,\n\nThey propose that I am only half surprised at Father Lamarche's request. He may be leaving Lake Helen School.\n\nAs it would be utterly impossible financially speaking to leave town and dispose of buildings, kitchen utensils, etc., may I beg that I could delay until the Inspector comes? Which, perhaps he would lend his investigation?\n\nThis amount leaving now would cost me at least $50.00 and I have not one.\n\nAs familiarly written, as if I had you to read the letter written to the agent. Such a request... and may explain my letter asking if a substitute could be asked for.\n\nFather Lamarche wants me to send in an estimate of the work and materials supplied for building stair & other orders. But as I said before, that I would do the work free of charge.\nI find it hard.\n\nConsidering the circumstances I am in, I am not sure if I have certainly made a mistake. Let's put the term \"Common Law\" aside and consider me \"on duty.\" The offer of the Substitute and the acceptance of the by both Debt & Writer Samson had previously released me. And what is more, there was sufficient additional circumstances... serious ones.\n\nHalf of petitioners live 5-6 miles from here and have no children in the school.\n\nI could easily send in correspondence, but the names of those who have and send children at school. Especially the petition from the pupils.\n\nTo which - This is - So how it is that here as well as at Squaw Bay last year, I found children who had been on the Roll for 3-4 years and could not read... but I am not a \"Mormon.\"\n\nIt is completely impossible for me to leave here now. I had to cancel all my engagements to work out by the refusal of my Substitute to make good her word. I am penniless.\n\nHaving depended on more income than I had, through these circumstances, I have been forced on it.\nIn a word, I do not think I could clear my way out with a month or days teaching. And then I have not it; and nothing follows on till I get it.\n\nFor all these reasons I beg that a little more time be given me.\n\nHoping that the Department will grant my humble request & begging forgiveness for writing so long.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. Alix\nSchool Teacher\n\nP.S.) I beg to refer to state that Miss Parker did not like my having asked for a substitute she had dealt privately with Walter Lamarche. I sincerely ask for investigation in the matter as to whether.\n\nIn an other envelope I send correspondence which will explain why the quickest way is to write directly - with the present local system honest and conscientious teachers are a rare commodity but my particular case is...\n\"Bona fide Affidavit\"\n\nI hereby declare that in the past month of April I had an attendance averaging 198. 343 attendance in 18 days - highest 83 lowest 74.\n\n3 holidays viz: Good Friday & Easter Monday\n\n8 days 15th & 16th I was sick seriously.\n\nThe five days I kept school here in the month of May ran as follows: 80 4th 6th 15th 17th average 14 3/4.\n\nI would be anxious to show, particularly for the past year to compare with this.

It has been closed for two days after which Father Laramache closed it again on the ground that the agent could not have forwarded his letter.\n\nSo once more I ask whether having no money I cannot come away.\n\nI was not fighting for the poor position I was fighting for principles, but I see how useless would be for me to stay on my ground. But as it would pain me to believe that doubt may be entertained in my sincerity I will in due time expose the whole thing in an open letter to Hon. Sir W.

Alia, stating the reasons why he should be dismissed, enclosing the signatures of all the heads of families who voted for his dismissal. All those who could attend the meeting that took place on May the 20th, voted for his dismissal, except one who had compromised himself, if I am not mistaken.\n\nWas this letter received by the Department? or why was it not acknowledged at least? Mr. J. Alia had been suspended, but was not dismissed until I received the Dept's letter of June the 23rd informing me that Mr. J. Alia had sent his resignation which was accepted.\nFor my part I have always sent to the Dept. the Teachers' Applications for Indian Schools or their resignations; it is the 1st time I had to ask for a dismission.

It is claimed that this boy uses dirty language to the girls. The teacher, according to the chief, is alright but she does not keep the school clean. At different times she has kept dogs, cats, and now chickens in the building. The teacher is old and keeps a dog in the school room during the summer and as the windows are kept closed, the Indians are afraid that their children are liable to contract diseases there.\n\nThe Indians at Lake Helen have not been sending their children to school regularly for sometime and it would probably be best to keep it closed for a term of two or until the Indians petition to have it reopened.\n\nChief Joe Salt of the Red Rock Reserve is very anxious to have a school opened on his reserve.

The Department has informed Agent Burk that we have no objection to Mr. Ducharme returning, and it is hoped that he will be able to induce him to do so, in order that the school will not remain closed.

However, he told me he had an Ontario First Class certificate. I was talking to Public School Inspector Hamilton of Fort William and I find out that Mr. Hopkins has caused trouble to a number of Public school inspectors by stating he held a \"first\" and he doesn't. I made inquiries at the Ontario Dept. of Educ. and find out he hasn't any certificate. They said, \"He has none and is a fraud.\"\n\nHe is a fine looking fellow and as Mr. Hamilton says he's a good man as far as teaching is concerned. I will ask you to correct this in my report and put yourself as to what you intend to do in the matter. But so far as I am concerned he will never enter any of my own Separate Schools. His record upon inquiry appears excellent from various sources. You look for his induction in telling an honest story.\n\nJ.M.

As his record in the school appears to be excellent, and there is great difficulty in obtaining teachers for Indian schools which are more or less isolated, the Department considers that it is not necessary to take any action regarding the statements made by Mr. Hopkins as to his professional qualifications.

He left that evening, April 2/24, at 10.30. I felt sorry for him and the school. I intend writing to him to correspond with you. He deserves good consideration.\n\nI wish to report that I lost my way in the bush and snow and on my way walking to the school from Nipigon. Before I found the proper path I spent almost two hours plodding in loose snow. I finally found an Indian to finish the journey with me.\n\nJ. M. Bennett, INSP.\nSir,\n\nMr. Hopkins, teacher at Lake Helen Indian School, borrowed $8.00 from me on January 29th and said he would pay me back in one week. But he has made no attempt to pay me one cent. I am a poor man with a large family. I want you to write Ottawa and tell them to get my money from Hopkins. He also owes Mr. Brown and ours a mother Indian for 50 meals at 30\u00a2 a meal. Will you please try and see that these men are paid?\n\nPaul Cameron\nSir -\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from Paul Cameron, an Indian residing at the Red Rock Indian Reserve. It appears that Mr. H. J. Hopkins, the teacher at the Lake Helen Day School, Nipigon, Ontario, has contracted debts to the amount of $108.00. Joe Peltier, another Indian residing at the Lake Helen Indian Reserve, just called to report that Mr. Hopkins owes him for fifty meals - $15.00 per meal. He also owes Dr. Brown $75.00 and Father Belanger $10.00. Mr. Hopkins gave the Indians and Dr. Brown to understand that he was coming back next term but I just received his resignation today. I would like to be advised if it would be possible to secure payment from him through the Department. The following are the names and the amounts owing -\n\n| Name            | Amount |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Paul Cameron    | $8.00  |\n| Dr. Brown       | $75.00 |\n| Father Belanger | $10.00 |\n| Joe Peltier     | $15.00 |\n\nAll these people reside at Nipigon, Ontario.\n\nMr. Hopkins has just written me to find out if the Indian Department would furnish him with transportation from Nipigon to Toronto. I advised him that I did not think the Indian Department furnished transportation for teachers. He also informs me he is keeping the school at Lake Helen open for one extra week until his cheque arrives and believes he should be paid for this time but I do not see that the Department should pay for this additional week as Mr. Hopkins was absent from Lake Helen for two weeks on account of his mother's death.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Two advances on salary for the June quarter to the total amount of $55 were forwarded on the order of the teacher to the Sterling Bank, Tamworth, Ont., and this leaves a balance due him for the quarter of $155. We are enclosing herewith a cheque for $45 covering the amount of bonus due for the June quarter. Both salary and bonus cheques are in favour of Mr. Hopkins, and you should arrange with him to call at your office and endorse these cheques over to you, and you can then arrange to settle his outstanding bills. It is expected that before leaving the locality he will pay his obligations. You should obtain receipts from the parties whom you pay, and hand them to Mr. Hopkins.\n\nWe do not furnish teachers with transportation, and are, therefore, not prepared to accede to Mr. Hopkins' request to provide him with transportation from Nipigon to Toronto.\n\nWe note that you have received Mr. Hopkins' resignation, which is accepted by the Department. You should arrange with the Church authorities to nominate a suitable teacher having the necessary qualifications for the next school year. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher so nominated should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nNo salary can be allowed Mr. Hopkins for any period he carries on the work after June 30th, last, which was the end of the school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We therefore forwarded your cheques to Mr. Agent Burk and requested him to have you endorse them and arrange for the settlement of the amounts owing by you in the vicinity of Fort William.

They have recommended Miss Elizabeth Leusch, at present at the Spanish Residential School, a teacher of many years' experience in Indian schools, for the position at the Lake Helen School. The department is approving of her appointment to begin duties on or about October 1st, next. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $700 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Payment of both salary and bonus is based on ten teaching months in the year.

The salary allowed you will be at the rate of $700 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. The bonus allowed during the present fiscal year ending March 31st, 1925, to teachers in Indian day schools is at the rate of $15 per teaching month. Payment of both salary and bonus is based on the ten teaching months in the year.\n\nPlease send word immediately to Mr. Burk as to the date you will arrive at Nepigon in order that he can meet you there and arrange for the purchase of any furnishings and other supplies you may require for the use of the living quarters. You should give him full information as to any supplies you may require in the way of house furnishings and kitchen supplies. It is expected that you will keep the list of your requirements and the individual cost as low as possible.

This gave me the impression that you were no longer at your post. It was therefore a real pleasure to find your name attached to letters from the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6139, File 402-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nHave you ever been at Lake Helen? If not I am sure you would enjoy a holiday fishing on the Nepigon River and could visit our school at the same time. Until now the building was a very small and dingy one, but now owing to the repairs Mr. Hattie Couture is having made it will be quite comfortable and respectable looking. Part of the interior, although over forty years old, has never been painted. Of course no white teacher has ever lived in the dwelling and most of the Indian teachers, even, boarded with some of their friends. So there was really never a great need of having any work done.\n\nGetting the lumber for the new kitchen was quite a task. It had to be brought by freight from Port Arthur, then by truck to the boat landing across Lake Helen in a canoe, and on a jumper from the lake to the school.\n\nThere is quite a difference between the Indians here and those among whom I have worked until now, but I like working among them. In some ways it is like\nBeginning all over. They have no gardens, no stock, horses, nor even poultry. The children are quite proud of their school garden produce.\n\nMany of the Indians tried to discourage me last spring by telling me that nothing would grow. In spite of all their predictions we had quite a garden.\n\nOnly a day or two ago I wrote to Mr. Phelan asking his advice and help, if necessary, to start a Penny Bank.\n\nThe people and even children here seem to have more money to spend than those east. All last year I spoke to the young men, who spend their evenings in the school, about placing at least a little of their earnings in a bank. Talking the matter over with Miss Griffit this vacation she advised me to try the Penny Bank. She tells me it works well at her school. I shall be pleased to do the extra work required if it teaches them to save.\n\nYou spoke of yours of the 19th instant about the Indians returning to Red Rock. I fear this will never come to pass. The Fathers in charge of this Mission have for years tried\nTo get them to move to the reserve. This place is too near town where they are under influence which is anything but good, but the Indians like this place and the pleasures they find in town and are determined to remain. It is for this reason I give the class-room to the young men in the evening and spend my time teaching music, reading, arithmetic and singing. Besides I have several musical instruments and games for their amusement. Many of the young men have given up their evening in town for those in school. I hope to get more of them this year.\n\nSome of the Indians from the reserve think of moving here. They are afraid of a dam that has been built some miles above the reserve.\n\nHoping that you will be able to come to see me at Lake Helen before long, I remain\n\nMost gratefully yours,\n\nElizabeth Lurie\nOttawa, September 29, 1925.\n\nSIR,\n\nThis Department has received an application from the teacher of the Lake Helen Indian Day School, which is located near Nipigon, Ont., requesting that arrangements be made to establish at the school a branch of the Penny Bank of Ontario.\n\nThis teacher is quite capable of handling this matter and I would request you to advise me if a branch can be started at the place mentioned and, if so, furnish me with full particulars regarding the procedure that will be necessary to establish it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I was told that he had written two letters, one concerning which I wrote, explaining matters, the other complaining of being obliged to send his child to school when she was sick.\n\nFrom what I am told, he is going around trying to get signatures for both letters.\n\nOne man told me that even after he told Paul, at the meeting, that he had nothing to complain of, Paul has coaxed him twice to sign.\n\nLake Helen [signature]\nPapigon, Ont.\nJan. 23, 1928\nThis man, Peter Bouchard, the constable, told me that he is trying to get some of the old men who cannot read, nor know what the letters are about to sign.\n\nThis thing happened last year also when they had trouble in the reserve about the pulpwood. One of the men gave a dance and then asked all our young people who went to sign a letter. Not one of them knew what the letter was about. This I am sure of because when I questioned them not one could tell me, said they signed because they were in David Deschamps house and he asked them to sign.\n\nNow the complaint that the children are obliged to come to school, even when ill, is not true.\n\nNearly everyone of my pupils like to come to school and sometimes do come when they are really sick.\n\nI have a thermometer in the class-room and when I find a child not looking right take its temperature.\nA number of times I have had to send some home because they were too sick to be in school.\n\nPaul Cameron's girl is a big strong child, but lazy. Besides her father keeps her home for the least inconvenience, often without the least excuse. As he often told me he is afraid that she would get sick and he would have to spend his money to get the doctor.\n\nHe is the one man of this mission who looks after his money.\n\nIt seems that he suggested, in his letter, that the government send a doctor around each month to look after the health of the people. There is no cause whatever for this.\n\nTrue native persons have had to go to the hospital since last June but this is because the doctor in Regina is not competent.

Kendall J, I left Fort William by G.P.Ry at 6.05 and proceeded to Nipigon, Ont., and to Lake Helen Indian Mission. I found as is usual at this time of the year most of the men were away hunting. Miss Joyce, the teacher had no complaints with regard to the children with the exception of two children who were not attending school as they should. Notices were served on the parents of Albert Ray and Paul Cameron by Const. Kendall and the parents were warned that they would be punished if their children did not attend school regularly. They promised to send the children to school the following day. The teacher was instructed to notify me if these children did not attend school.\n\nOn the same day Parmacheen I.R., situated on the same lake and distant some four miles across the lake, was visited. Most of the Indians were away hunting. The Indians at this reserve have organized a small school and have a local Indian girl teaching. The Indians pay the teacher themselves. No disorderly conduct was reported during the patrol. There appears to be very little sickness among these Indians.\n\nThe following morning accompanied by Const. Kendall I left Nipigon by C.N.Ry at 5.26am and proceeded to Varlanger on Lake Nipigon arriving at 7.30am. From Varlanger I proceeded on foot to the Sand Point I.R. I visited the day school and found that the teacher Miss Joyce had complained regularly of attendance. She told me that she had to send about half the children home as about that number were suffering from the disease and are being treated. I also visited the house of the Seneway who has a son dying of Tuberculosis. This house had been reported to me as being in a bad state by the travelling matron. I found that some work had been made since the visit of the matron to assist the Seneway family to get the place cleaned properly, as there was still opportunity for improvement. Most of the men have been away since the freeze up trapping and there were no reports of recent sickness owing to the fact that MacDiarmid is now deserted since the close of the fishing season last week or so the ice season commences at MacDiarmid and a considerable number of men who are away at present will return and then this locality will need watching.\n\nAfter lunch at the Indian constable's house at Sand Point, I proceeded to MacDiarmid and found this place quiet. I left MacDiarmid with Const. Kendall that evening and returned to Fort William arriving there on the morning of the 11th inst. Mileage as follows: Train 230 miles, on foot 20 miles.\n\nI have the honour to report,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I received the two maps but neither on spring rollers. I can manage by having the one of North America underneath. The map of Ontario is not at all suitable for our school. It has all the automobile roads and other important roads etc., of Old Ontario and only a small inset on much reduced scale of our end of the province.\n\nOur grown up men use the map almost as much as the pupils for looking up trapping lines etc. The new map is of no use to them. What we need is a map giving the most important railroads and new Ontario on the same scale as Old Ontario.\n\nCould the map I have be returned and exchanged for another on spring rollers? I have not yet used it.\n\nPerhaps you have heard through Mr. Burk that Lake Helen School has had to turned into a sort of Sanitorium.\n\nFor quite a long time I noticed that some of the pupils were not well. About two months ago one of the oldest girls had to go to the hospital for skin disease. After examination she was declared to have T.B. Just before Xmas another had to see a doctor with the same result. I then asked Mr. Burk's permission to have all those whom I found below the mark examined with the result that\nfor more have the same disease and two others are suspicious. Several others live in homes where persons have lately died of T.B., so that more than half of the class seems to be infected.\n\nDr. Quackenbush says that none are beyond cure but that they would need plenty of fresh air and nourishing food. Mr. Burk has supplied us with eggs, milk, fruit and vegetables for them.\n\nAs all of the children are more sure of the proper care at school than at home we are keeping them here. I am teaching only half periods and have them out in the fresh air the rest of the time. Every morning and afternoon they get a lunch in our kitchen. They bake bread and prepare all they use. After three weeks of this treatment many show marked improvement already.\n\nWhile at Fort Arthur after New Year I asked several other doctors if there were any danger to the other pupils if these are kept in school. They all said that as long as the sick do not cough etc. and all is kept in very good order there is no danger whatever.\n\nAs the three entrance pupils are among the sick I doubt if they will be able to pass. They have ambition enough but they cannot have time enough to finish the work. Fresh air is more important for them than studies just now. While those under treatment are out playing I can work with backward pupils and get these up to the mark in lessons.\n\nThe next time there is occasion for me to write I hope to be able to give a better report of the school.\n\nMost respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.

Deschamp\nNick John\nJohn Ogima\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. Burk in which he assures me of his co-operation in my trouble with Mr. Daba.\n\nHe wrote an official letter to be shown to the Indians, telling them that it is the wish of the Department that the clothing should be given only to the destitute; among other things he offered to write Michel Daba and criticize his action.\n\nI appreciate his help very much and thought it better to let you know of his action, for fear the Department might be inclined to think that he was not doing all he could to help me.\n\nEven after Mr. Burk's help I would very much appreciate the letter to Mr. Daba, refuting the false statement he made and telling the Indians that my work is appreciated.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nElizabeth Lewis.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCape Helene School\n\nNipigon, Ont.\n\nJan. 8, 1931\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere are a few points which I would like to bring to the notice of the Department.\n\nA few days ago I had quite an argument with some of our Indians. The trouble began over clothing sent by Mr. Burk for distribution to destitute Indians.\n\nIn the first place, Mr. Burk, when he had a field day and election last October, brought a large quantity of clothing to be distributed among needy Indians. As he was surrounded by men and women many that are not poor as well as the destitute received a good supply. Still he had quite a few pieces left which he asked me to take to the school and distribute later or use as prizes as I wished.\n\nThe very next day Michel Datta, the newly elected councillor came to know...\nwhere the articles were which Mr. Burk had left behind. I told him what I had been able to do, never dreaming that he was not satisfied with this arrangement.\n\nAs Mr. Data is a new man in office, he was at once besieged with applications for help. Mr. Burk, knowing that I am well acquainted with the needs of our people, each time answered Mr. Data that he would have to investigate first and then sent the letter of request to me to know what I thought of it.\n\nThough I have always been extremely careful not to let the Indians find out about this arrangement, knowing that it causes a lot of trouble, it seems that, either they did find out or only suspect that this is the case.\n\nFor my part I find Red Rock Band Indians very thriftless and always trying to get what they need without work. Some of them make quite a sum of money during the summer months when they act as guides to C.P.R. tourists.\n\nWith most of them the money is spent as fast as earned. Ever since I came I have tried, by all sorts of means, to teach...\nthem to save part of their earnings for times of need. When I do not succeed in persuading them to save, I refuse to help them when they run short of funds.\n\nOften when I saw them spend money foolishly, I warned them and tried to show them how foolish they are. Very naturally some persons do not like to be shown that they are wrong.\n\nMichel Datta, of course, feels that since he is counsellor, all his requests should be granted and he very much resists the idea of anyone interfering with his office.\n\nTo make matters worse, we had trouble over Cod Liver Oil.\n\nEach fall when ordering the supply of coal oil, gasoline etc., for the year I also ask for the winter's supply of Cod Liver Oil. Mr. Burk brought five gallons C.L.O. with him at the same time as the goods for the field day and asked Mr. Datta to bring it to school. Instead he took it to his own home. Mr. Burk wished me to insist on its being brought to me but I suggested that as Mr. Datta seemed to like distributing it, he should take charge of it. In a short time I was told the oil was being fed to dogs.\nI cannot say if this report is true but do know that the amount that lasted me nearly all winter lasted him less than two months. When Mr. Burk came with Miss Inge he brought another five gallons and again Mr. Data who met him at the station to bring it to the school but it again went to his home. As this oil belonged to the nurse she insisted on having it brought to the school and as I did not wish to have any of it fed to dogs I sent a boy for the oil. Of course Mr. Data became more offended.\n\nWhen Mr. Data wrote complaining about the clothing I had on hand Mr. Burk sent him a supply. I was later told that they had been given to his relatives and friends rather than to the needy. In some instances I knew that this was the case.\n\nWhen Mr. Burk brought the nurse, Miss Inge, he informed me that he intended sending me some clothing for the poor. I refused to accept them because there is always trouble. These people are very jealous. After I heard a number of complaints about Mr. Data's way of distributing clothing I wrote Mr. Burk saying that I would accept the ones he wished to send.\nThey arrived on the last day of the year.\n\nAs I knew that all had received a supply of clothing I was in no hurry to open the bags. I intended doing so after the holiday and give what I thought would be needed and store the rest for use later on. I always keep a supply on hand as sometimes someone gets sick and has to be taken to the hospital or for some other reason needs better clothing than he has and I am glad to have some to give.\n\nBesides the more these people get the more they want and then do not take care of what they have but throw them out when torn instead of mending them. To give an example of this\u2014two years ago I had the older pupils knit long stockings for their fathers for winter. Two months later I picked up one pair out of the snow that had been thrown out town. Took them home and after washing and ripping them I knit a pair of stockings for one of the children of the same family. Of course this was done to teach all a lesson.\n\nTo come back to the clothing, I had no idea that anyone was displeased about the clothing until I was told a few days ago that Daniel Doba had called a meeting to condemn me for this and, as he said, interfering in his work among other things he tried to persuade...\nthe Indians to send me away. The letter writer and better instructed, of course, objected. Another meeting was held the following evening with the same result.\n\nThe next night, which was last Tuesday, the 6th, I called a meeting. I thought it best to talk matters over with them and let them make whatever charges they liked so I could answer them and give them my reasons for acting, not because I fear them, but to let them see that I did not fear to face any of their charges. No one had a word to say and I had to almost challenge Mr. Data to say anything.\n\nAmong other things he had told the Indians when he tried to persuade them to send me away that another school where I had taught the Indians had written to the Department and that the Department had sent me away.\n\nI told him and all that this was a lie. I asked him to prove all his statements. The only answer I could obtain was that the Indians said so. Some of those present were so displeased with Mr. Data that they several times interrupted him to tell him that they had never said a word. A number came to me even before I called the meeting to tell me that they were dissatisfied with Mr. Data's actions. All agree that he is simply upset because he has not all\nI explained to the Indians, at the meeting, that I am here not simply to teach the children but more especially to help the grown-ups to lead better lives and to help them, that is, to educate them to become respectable citizens, men and women who would be able to support themselves and not be a burden to the government or those about them. I told them that teaching the children is only a small part of my work, and that work done for the good of the older Indians is much appreciated by the Department. To some present this seemed a new idea. They took all I did for them for granted without giving it a thought; several spoke of my care of the sick etc., after that.\n\nFor one thing, it seems to me the people here get too much assistance. The people in Manitoulin Island and that part of Ontario get, one might say, very little help and they do not expect it and get along just as well. Mr. Burk is very kind and does not like to refuse anyone so many impose on him. These think they should all get help. I told them the other evening that I considered only three families deserving of help from the Department.\nWhat I would be very grateful for from the Department is this.\n\nI would like to have you write Mr. Data and tell him that his statement, that I had been sent away from a former school by the Department, is a lie.\n\nHe should call a meeting and read the Department's letter to the Indians.\n\nAt the same time if the Department would tell him that they approve of my action of giving help only when really needed and not to all, at any time, when they know that I have clothing etc.\n\nAlso that the Department approves of my trying to induce them to become more thrifty and self-supporting.\n\nThis action of the Department would quiet Isabel Data and his friends and would be a great help to me in my work.\n\nThanking you in advance for this favor.\n\nYours,\n\nElizabeth Lewis\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 13, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department understands that you have been circulating a report to the effect that Miss Elizabeth Leusch, teacher of the Lake Helen Indian Day School, had been dismissed as teacher of a former school before she was appointed to Lake Helen. This statement on your part is entirely unfounded and uncalled for. Miss Leusch has been in the employ of the Department for a lengthy period, and her services have always been entirely satisfactory. She is devoting her time to helping both the Indian children in the school and also the older Indians on the Reserve. It is your duty to assist Miss Leusch in her work on the Reserve. You should encourage the Indian parents to see that their children attend school regularly, and inform the Indians at every opportunity that it is in their best interests to comply with the kindly advice which she is always ready to give them. The Department expects that you will assist Miss Leusch in the devoted work she is doing for the benefit of the Indians at Lake Helen, and that there will be no further cause for complaint in respect of any action taken by you.\n\nYou should read this letter in full to the Indians at the next meeting called by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. Michael Daba,\nLake Helen,\nVia Nipigon, Ont.\nOttawa, January 13, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letters of the 5th and 10th instant, relative to certain trouble you have been experiencing regarding the distribution of destitute supplies, and with reference to a report being circulated by Michael Daba that you were dismissed from your position as teacher in a former school.\n\nIn this connection, I enclose for your information copy of a letter which we are today forwarding to Michael Daba, and it is hoped that, as a result, the report which he has circulating regarding your previous services will cease. I may add that the Department is entirely satisfied with the services you are performing at Lake Helen, not only in the school, but in your work among the older Indians on the Reserve.\n\nRegarding the issuing of relief supplies, this is a matter which the local Indian Agent will have to deal with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Elizabeth Leusch,\nTeacher, Lake Helen Indian Day School,\nNipigon, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A statement had been made\nat an Indian Council meeting by one of the Councillors named\nMichael Daba to try and force the Indians to put in a general\ncomplaint to make the teacher resign at the Indian School. The\nstatement was as follows:- \"That the Indian Department had\nrequested the resignation of the School Teacher named Miss\nE.Leuch\".\n\nThe above statement being absolute untrue in so far\nas the Indian Department was concerned, we were asked to\ninvestigate in this matter.\n\nI proceeded to Lake Helen where the Indians are\nresiding. I interviewed Miss E.Leuch on the subject who stated\nthat Michael Daba had made this statement not knowing as to\nwhat he had said. She stated that he was not very friendly\nwith her, as trouble arose over the distribution of clothing\nsent to the Indians by the Department and elsewhere. This Indian\nwas a newly appointed Councillor last summer, and having this\nauthority was urged by the Indians to handle this clothing for\nthem, so took it upon himself to approach Miss Leuch and force\nher to hand over the clothing for distribution. He made several\ntrips to the school in his manner molesting the school teacher\nbut she held her ground, and would not give him the clothing.\nShe told him that she had been given instructions by the\nDepartment to handle the clothing amongst all needy cases,\nand it was up to him to help her to locate the needy cases.\nMiss Leuch informed me that if this Indian Michael\nDaba obtained the clothing, he would just give it out to all his\nfriends and relations, and others would starve.\n\nOn interviewing Michael Daba he stated that he only\ntold them at the meeting what he had heard Ignatius Pellier\nand Mrs Paul John say. They told him that they came from Spain\nbetween Saulte St Marie and Sudbury, that they knew this\nteacher at this point, and she had been requested to resign\nas school teacher for the Department at that point. Daba said\nhe did not know whether this was true or not, but as he had\nhad a little dispute with her over the clothing, he told all\nthe Indians as to what he had heard.\n\nActing upon authority of J.G.Burk - Indian Agent I\nsuspended this Indian Michael Daba for two weeks as Councillor\nuntil the 1st February until the investigation is completed.\nNipigon, Ont. 16th January 1931\n\n(2)\n\nThe suspension as Councillor seemed to hurt Michael Daba very much, for about an hour after my return to the Detachment, he came along with a very nice pleasing manner, with a written confession thinking that his suspension would be immediately lifted. His letter is as follows:\n\nThe R.C.M.P. Police\nNipigon, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI forgot to advise you that what I have said to the teacher was said at a meeting which she called up, and to which I have been specially requested to attend.\n\nAt the beginning of the meeting she requested that all complaints be brought up there and then and all complainants not to be afraid to say anything.\n\nWhen my turn came to speak I told all what the Indians were complaining about, and also told regarding the Department having once requested her to resign. I said this because she gave us to understand that we may say any we want to say and I wanted information on the subject.\n\nI did not think I was doing anything wrong and did not mean any harm.\n\nThis statement is absolutely true and the best of my knowledge and I am sorry if I had done wrong.\n\n(Signed) Michael Daba\n\nMichael Daba assured me that he was trying to do his best for the Indians and was sorry if he had done anything wrong, and would not act in such an hasty manner with things of this kind again until he was sure of his ground.\n\nI have the honour to be\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\nCorpl.\nReg.No.8944\n(P.H.Hebb)\nI/C Nipigon Detachment\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nForwarded for your information, 19-1-31.\n\nSupt.\nA.B.

The teacher, Miss Leusch, reports several families have left for their fishing grounds and taken their children with them. From information obtained from the North West Mounted Police, and reliable Indians, I find in some cases Indians were obliged to have their families accompany them as it was impossible to provide food for their children if they remained on the Reserve.\n\nThe situation is extremely hard to cope with, and it is very hard to know if it is wise to compel the families to return to their Reserve, or allow them to continue fishing until they have caught sufficient fish for the winter. I deemed it advisable to take the latter course.\n\nI also wish to draw the Department's attention to 2 families\u2014John Hardy with 4 children, living at Ozone, and Albert Ray with 3 children, living at Gurney. Both these families have been able to secure work on the Government road, and have built shacks to house their families. Both families have written and reported it would be a great hardship if they were compelled to move back to their Reserve.\n\nIf the Department insist on this course I can get in touch with the Mounted Police and see that these families return to their Reservation in order that the children may attend school. As work is so frightfully hard to secure I would suggest that these families remain where they are, and send the children to St. Joseph's Boarding School.\n\nI would be pleased to have the Department's views on the above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Bark,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 18, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, regarding a number of Indian families who have left for their fishing grounds, taking their children with them, and requesting to be informed if steps should be taken by you to have the children placed in school.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is considered, in view of the present situation, that it would be more satisfactory for the parents to earn their living than to compel them to return in order that their children can attend school. If, however, you could arrange to have a number of children referred to placed in St. Joseph's Orphanage, Fort William, the Department would be pleased to approve of their admission, provided they are in good health and there is accommodation for them and they would not be in excess of the number for which per capita grant is allowed. It will not be necessary to have the mounted police return these families to their reserve, but if, as stated, you could arrange to have some of these children placed in the residential school at Fort William, the Department will be pleased if you will take the necessary action in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJan. 30, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month ending January 31st, 1932.\n\nOn January 11th I visited Lake Helen Indian Day School re absentees. This school is conducted by Miss E. Leusch, who is one of the best teachers in the Agency, and very splendid work is always in evidence here. The teacher is an untiring worker, social as well as in school. Special attention was given to fire drill at this school, and all other schools in this Agency.\n\nX X X\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 29, 1932.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, informing the Department that, on account of failing health, Miss Leusch will not be resuming duties as teacher at Lake Helen and recommending the transfer of Miss Sadie J. Burke, formerly teacher at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, to succeed Miss Leusch at Lake Helen. The Department will approve of this transfer. The salary allowed Miss Burke will be at the same rate as paid Miss Leusch, viz.: $100 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\nApproval is granted for the appointment of Miss Louise Gatty to succeed Miss Burke at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School. The salary allowed in her case will be the same as was paid Miss Burke, viz.: $95 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\nThe respective Indian agents are being informed of the above appointments and will be requested to give each of the teachers every assistance they can in their work at the schools.\n\nThe Department learns with regret that Miss Leusch is giving up teaching duties, after many years' successful service. Her service while teaching for this Department have been entirely satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Louise Bennet,\nPrincipal,\nGirls' Indian Residential School,\nSpanish,\nOntario.\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nAugust 31st, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith application which is self-explanatory. Miss Leusch, unfortunately, will not be able to continue teaching at the Lake Helen Day School, owing to poor health. She will, however, continue to stay at the Lake Helen school as companion to the newly appointed teacher.\n\nI would be pleased if the Department will advise if they approve of Miss Sadie J. Burke's application for the Lake Helen School.\n\nI would appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience. I may state the applicant has been highly recommended by Miss Leusch.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report I have just received a letter from Miss Elizabeth Leusch, teacher of the Lake Helen Indian Day School, advising she was in very poor health, and consequently was advised by her doctor it would be impossible for her to teach this coming term. Miss Leusch informed me she would not return to the Lake Helen School as teacher, but will return as companion to the new teacher.\n\nMr. Greening and myself consider Miss Leusch was one of the best teachers in this Agency, and it is deeply regretted she will not be able to continue teaching at the Lake Helen Indian Day School this fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, file No. 9-4-1, and note that Miss Elizabeth Leusch, teacher of the Lake Helen Indian Day School, will not resume duties as teacher during the coming term, and in reply I wish to state I was indeed very sorry to hear Miss Leusch is failing in health, but was most pleased to hear she is returning to the Lake Helen School, as companion and housekeeper.\n\nI note Miss Sadie J. Burke, will be transferred to the Lake Helen School from Wikwemikong school. Every assistance will be given to the teacher, and I will endeavour to see that a regular attendance of Indian children is carried on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Miss E. Leusch, who has recently resigned as teacher, from the Lake Helen Indian Day School, I wish to report she will continue to live at the school as companion to the teacher who will be appointed for the vacancy.\n\nMiss Leusch has rendered valuable service, not only as teacher, but also in assisting Indians to live better and healthier lives. I would suggest Miss Leusch be paid $15.00 per month, as she will continue to assist the Indians and will act as field matron at Lake Helen and Parmacheene.\n\nMiss Hamer, the teacher at the Sand Point School, was paid an additional $15.00 per month for her work as field matron, and I would suggest that this sum be transferred to Miss E. Leusch.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 6, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, recommending that a grant of $15 per month be allowed Miss E. Leusch for her services in carrying on field matron's duties at Lake Helen.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our funds this year are extremely limited, I regret that it will not be possible to make any grant to Miss Leusch for any services she will perform for the Indians at Lake Helen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

On receipt of this return your salary will be paid. The necessary forms for preparing the returns can be secured from the agent.\n\nAs pointed out above, salaries of the teachers are paid quarterly but, in view of your letter, we are making you an advance of $60.00 on your March quarter salary and a cheque for this amount is being forwarded under separate cover.\n\nIn future, when you have requests to make you should communicate with the agent and not direct to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

If you consider it necessary you might forward, about the first proximo, a request for a further advance on his March quarter salary and this will be made in view of the special circumstances in his case.

Leusch. As many of the articles we purchased for this school are worn out, it will be necessary to replace same with a new supply.\n\nAs you will note, Miss Leusch has included a few carpenter tools, which will be used to teach the young Indian children carpenter work. On my last visit to this school I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Indian children take very kindly to carpenter work, but unfortunately the teacher did not have sufficient tools to enable her to carry out this work. I would strongly recommend that her request be granted.\n\nMiss Leusch also inquired if it would be possible to purchase a coal oil stove and oven, and oil cloth for the kitchen floor. The measurements for the latter article will be sent to this office when the teacher returns to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

Burke, Esq.\n\nPort Arthur,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDon't you think the Indian Department will find it reasonable to increase some of the school house rent at wigwam mission, suppose from $25.00 or a month to $35.00 for the year round? There is a good amount of money invested in this building. Beside the main building, a kitchen has been added a few years ago, which, with some repairs has cost $800.00. This year I have installed a hot water system which have cost about $150.00 and there are always some others repairs to look after. I have also to pay an insurance. But the main part is the depreciation of the property which I calculate to be above $100.00 a year. There is a possibility that this school may close in some years and then the building turns to no use to us and all the money invested is a loss. Will you please submit this to the consideration of the Indian Department.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nT. A. Desautels, F.P.\nReverend.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to rental for the Lake Helen Indian Day School, I beg to advise I am enclosing herewith letter from the Rev. T. A. Desaultels, Missionary, which is self-explanatory.\n\nAs you will note a new kitchen has been added to the building and a soft water system has been installed costing $150.00. Under the circumstances I would suggest that an increase of $5.00 per month be granted. The Department are now paying $20.00 per month.\n\nAn early reply regarding the above will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, May 16, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a communication from Rev. T. A. Desautels in which he requests an increase in the rental paid for the use of the building for school purposes at Lake Helen. It is noted that an amount has recently been expended in the addition of a new kitchen and the installing of a soft water system.\n\nAs you are aware, when the Department first rented this building the sum of $10 per month was paid for its use up to June 30th, 1925. This was increased to $20 per month from that date. Taking into account the locality in which this building is situated, it is thought that the rental now paid is adequate remuneration for the money invested by the missionary in the erection and any repairs made to same. You might, however, make further enquiry and furnish your recommendation as to whether you consider the rental now paid is ample, or if the request of Rev. Father Desautels for an increase be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G.

Leusch, teacher of the Lake Helen Indian Day School, requesting me to purchase the following supplies:\n\n2 Rough inexpensive cocoa mats,\n3 Inexpensive locks for school cupboards.\nRefill for fire extinguisher.\n\nThe teacher also requests that the walls and ceiling of the classroom be cleaned, as the smoke from the box stove has darkened the walls.\n\nI would be pleased to receive the necessary authority to purchase these supplies and carry out the work in the classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 21st, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, and in reply have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following supplies for the use of the Lake Helen Indian Day School: 2 cocoa mats, inexpensive; 3 locks, with keys, for school cupboards, and 1 refill for fire extinguisher. You should see that no unnecessary expense is incurred, and when the refill for the fire extinguisher is delivered, you should arrange to have it placed in the extinguisher and see that the extinguisher is put in good condition and ready for use in case of fire.\n\nRelative to the request of the teacher that the walls and ceiling of the classroom be cleaned, I have to say that, while you have not stated the approximate cost of this work, the Department will approve of your arranging to have it carried out. You may purchase the material required. It is thought that if these walls were kalsomined it would be satisfactory. It is expected that you will keep all expense in the cleaning of the walls of the classroom as low as possible.\n\nPlease forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified covering the above authorized expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As you will note there are 6 active tubercular cases attending school who should receive nourishing food. Miss Leusch, who was teaching at the school last year, and is now acting as housekeeper was in the habit of giving the children an egg-nog, which is very nourishing. Miss Burke, as you will note, by the enclosed list has suggested the following monthly rations: 15 doz. Eggs, 1 case of Milk, 30 lbs. Carrots, and 5 lbs. Sugar.\n\nAdditional rations for other tubercular children at the school as follows: 5 lbs. Butter, 10 lbs. Sugar, 10 lbs. Carrots, 3 doz. Eggs.\n\nThe teacher has also sent a requisition for: 6 lengths of stove pipes, 2 elbows, and 1 roll of stove pipe wire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

In reply I have to say that you may purchase the quantity of butter, eggs, milk, carrots and sugar that is absolutely necessary to give these children special meals until the end of April.\n\nThis expenditure will have to be paid from the Appropriation for Indian Education, and, as our funds are extremely limited, the Department will rely on the teachers and yourself to keep the expense as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Allen\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nJ.G.

I note the Auditor has drawn attention to the charge of 42\u00a2 per gallon for coal oil which is the price charged by the Imperial Oil Company.\n\nIn this respect I wish to state this Company charge $1.00 for the tins. A barrel of coal oil weighs 450 lbs. and it is impossible to get these barrels in canoes and have them conveyed to the Reserves. Consequently it is necessary to purchase in 4 gallon tins. I may say that the Hudson's Bay Company purchases all their coal oil in 4 gallon tins, as it is impossible to handle the barrels.\n\nThe schools are some distance from the station and the oil has to be conveyed by canoes and boats to the Reserve. It is, therefore necessary to purchase the oil in 4 gallon tins, and $1.00 is charged for each tin, consequently the price is much higher than in barrel lots.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

He advises that many of the children live much farther from the municipality than the 1\u00bd miles mentioned in your letter. He has also been informed that we cannot contemplate the erection of a school at Lake Helen this year. He has made the counter proposal that he effect repairs to this school and that the amount be deducted from the rent paid him by the Department. It is our understanding that repairs can be effected to the amount of four or five hundred dollars, which will render this school usable for another two or three years. It will also assist us in obtaining another teacher, if it is decided to replace Mr. Vesey.\n\nBernard F.

Labelle, a statement in the form of an account of the repair work he has undertaken.\n\nAttached hereto is our Voucher #169 for $590., in favour of Father Labelle, which is to reimburse him for this expenditure. From the account it will be perceived that the work undertaken was the removal of the old foundation, the putting in of a new one, the laying of a new floor in the classroom and interior painting.\n\nWe might comment here that Father Labelle is considerably agitated about the slow recovery of the amount he expended. However, the first concrete knowledge given to us as to what was undertaken, was upon receipt of the attached account. Apparently you vetoed the idea of vouchering the school rental at $40. per month rather than $20. per month, as a method of repaying Father Labelle. Father Labelle is anxious to be reimbursed at an early date, so any action you can take to expedite the process of payment would be greatly appreciated.\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRef. I.A. 9-4-5, Feb. 20th.\n\nFollowing the sending to you of my letter of yesterday's date, on the above dealt with matter, I have perused the account submitted by our voucher #169, in favour of Father Labelle, for $590.00.\n\nIt appears to me that in order this voucher will pass muster with the Treasury Branch that it will be necessary to insert under each man's signature for the work done a statement to the effect that they were paid by Fr. Labelle for the amount as indicated on the account. I feel the accounts in their present form may be understood by you, but not acceptable for Treasury.\n\nWould the accounts be reviewed and if you concur, you could have this certificate typed under each man's signature, for we have Fr. Labelle's personal assurance that as well as doing the work, the men were duly paid.\n\nN.V.

You have already on hand the blue prints and specifications of the school which is identical to that erected last year at Mission Bay.\n\nWe have found that the only way to keep the construction of this school down to a reasonable minimum\ncost is by the use of day labour under a competent foreman carpenter.\n\nYou have often told me of the skill of your Indians with tools and it would seem that if we can engage a competent carpenter at an hourly rate to supervise the work, we should be able to build a good school for a fairly reasonable figure.\n\nBernard F.

One is from Mr. O. Vezina, Fort Arthur, in the amount of $19,537.00 and the other is from Mr. Jos. Skopyk, Fort William, amounting to $17,409.00. The latter contractor was the builder of the recently completed Mountain Village I.D.S., on the Fort William Reserve, which was inspected by Mr. A.J. Doucet of your Branch.\n\nAt the present time, Mr. Skopyk is completing a new R.C. Church at Nipigon and our proposed I.D.S. would be located only a short distance from this church, and he informs me he could start construction at once on the school, with 19 men available, including four treaty Indians.\n\nI did not forward bids at an earlier date, for I was waiting word from you in connection with the Arroland School. As a new school is badly needed to serve the Nipigon Indians, I trust that authorization can be given to start construction immediately.\n\nAs electricity is just a short distance from the location of the proposed school, I hope authorization to wire the school can be obtained. I also hope that suitable plumbing, (similar to that installed in the Mountain Village School), can be installed, including septic tank, a bath, hand basin and a kitchen sink. As our skilled Indian tradesmen in the Agency are all pretty well tied up with regular employment, which they do not want to jeopardize, we cannot count on their employment on this project, but as stated the contractor can place the required workers on the job at once, when authorized.\n\nJ.G.

Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the Contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classify the work so as to give effect to such decision. If the Contractor shall fail so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or for any hours of labour wages according to the rates set forth in the schedule fixed therefor by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding over-time and other matters, the Minister of Labour may authorise and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed until the deduction thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such amount shall for all purposes be between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, visited or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, residences of the workmen employed, the rate of wages paid to and the time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attesting by sworn declaration, signed by him, the rate of wages and conditions of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrears; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages which the same are owed. The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such further detailed information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is claimed have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams and the personal services of payers for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuse which might arise from subletting, the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than such as may be permitted by the terms of the main contract and approved by the approval of the Minister is obtained, subcontractors shall be bound in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractors. The contract shall not, notwithstanding any provision thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA. I.\nPort Arthur, Ontario\n9th December, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nATTENTION: Col. B. F. Neary, Superintendent of Education.\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence, and also our telephone conversation last week regarding the building of an Indian Day School at Lake Helen Mission, the situation at this point is rather a difficult one. The Reserve proper is situated at the mouth of the Nipigon River, a distance of approximately 4\u00bd miles from the Mission. The largest percentage of the Indians had lived at the Mission for many years, owing to the fact that the school and church were situated there. Unfortunately the condition of the school for years was deplorable, also the teacher Mr. Veysey was most inefficient. These facts caused many of the Indian families to move to scattered locations around the town of Nipigon, which is approximately one mile from the Mission. The Missionary and myself feel that if a new school were built at the Mission, many of these families would move back.\n\nOn my last visit to the Lake Helen School, there were twenty-six pupils, eighteen of which were Treaty Indians. The remainder were non-Treaty and white children. We are attaching a list of the pupils at the school.\n\nIn my conversation I stated the property where the school would be built belonged to Mr. D. A. Clark. However I find that after going over the property with the surveyor, it is owned by the Jesuit Missionaries and not by Mr. Clark. Father Labelle has informed me that they will transfer sufficient property for school and grounds to our Department.\nMay I also point out that the Municipality of Nipigon is willing to transfer to our Department, twenty-five acres of park property previously transferred to the Department of Highways, who have abandoned plans for using this property. This location is a few hundred feet from the new school site. Needless to say the Municipality is anxious to see the Indians move from town property back to the Mission.\n\nI am enclosing a map showing proposed school location and park property, also a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Allan, which is self-explanatory.\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\n(Personal)\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nThe map mentioned in letter will be forwarded at a later date. The delay in sending a letter to Mr. Allen was caused by the Missionery being out of the city.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nIndian Sup't,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\n(The teacher's residence at the School at Squaw Bay (F't W'm I.R.), is in wretched condition and perhaps the Lake Helen appropriation could be used to rehabilitate it).\n\nJ.G.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. B. F. Neely,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nReferring to your memoranda of December 7th and 17th, this Division is awaiting Mr. Burk's letter and plan referred to in his letter to you of December 9th, file 402-5.\n\nThe Indians at the Lake Helen Mission appear to be a part of the Red Rock Band which numbers 223 according to the census. A substantial number, apparently about twenty families, live either at the Mission at Lake Helen or at Nipigon. They appear to wish to remain at Lake Helen Mission rather than move to their Reserve at Red Rock.\n\nIt further appears that the local white community at Nipigon want these Indians to live at the Lake Helen Mission rather than in the vicinity of the town of Nipigon and the Municipality offers us 25 acres of municipally owned land for their accommodation. It also appears that the Jesuit Mission is prepared to make available to us a site from the Mission property on which to build a school.\n\nIf the 25-acre block offered by the Municipality would serve as the site of an Indian village (with gardens, etc.), it might be desirable to secure it and constitute it an Indian Reserve as an addition to their present Reserve No. 53 at Red Rock (468 acres).\n\nThis appears to the writer to be feasible if the site is suitable and the permanent establishment of this group at Lake Helen is approved.\nIt is suggested that the first requirement would be a legal survey of the parcels to be acquired and the second step would be to have it duly constituted an Indian Reserve by Order in Council as an addition to Red Rock No. 53.\n\nFrom the number of Indian school children in the group as reported by Superintendent Burk, I would estimate that there might be twenty families to accommodate at this point.\n\nD. J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves & Trusts.\nDecember 27, 1948.\n\nMr. F. Matters,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCamp Chippawa, North Bay, Ontario.\n\nProposed Establishment of Indian Day School at Lake Helen.\n\nWe have had considerable correspondence with Mr. Indian Superintendent Burk with regard to the building of a new Indian day school at Lake Helen. At present we are renting a building from the Roman Catholic Church authorities because these Indians are not living on a reserve and hence we cannot erect a school for them. In a recent letter to the Department, Mr. Burk sets out the position as follows:\n\n\"The Reserve proper is situated at the mouth of the Nipigon River, a distance of approximately 4\u00bd miles from the Mission. The largest percentage of the Indians had lived at the Mission for many years, owing to the fact that the school and church were situated there. Unfortunately the condition of the school for years was deplorable, also the teacher Mr. Veysey was most insufficient. These facts caused many of the Indian families to move to scattered locations around the town of Nipigon, which is approximately one mile from the Mission. The Missionary and myself feel that if a new school were built at the Mission, many of these families would move back.\n\n\"On my last visit to the Lake Helen School, there were twenty-six pupils, eighteen of which were Treaty Indians. The remainder were non-Treaty and white children. We are attaching a list of the pupils at the school. ............\n\n\"May I also point out that the Municipality of Nipigon is willing to transfer to our Department, twenty-five...\"\nacres of park property previously transferred to the Department of Highways, who have abandoned plans for using this property. This location is a few hundred feet from the new school site. Needless to say the Municipality is anxious to see the Indians move from town property back to the Mission.\"\n\nIn view of the fact that Mr. Burk as requested that consideration be given to the establishment of a small reserve for these Indians, I referred the matter to Mr. Allan, Superintendent of Reserves and Trusts. I attach, for your information, a copy of his reply.\n\nI would like to thoroughly discuss this situation with you when you visit Ottawa in January for the conference of Regional Supervisors.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\n\nHFH/EM\n\nIndian Affairs.

This number will be increased if we secure title to and establish a reserve on the twenty-five acres bounding the river. Without this increase it seems hardly necessary to build a school.\n\nThe children could be sent by bus to Nipigon and receive a good education among white children for a much lower cost. Mr. Greening, the school inspector, thought this would be to the best advantage of the children.\n\nI would not recommend either of the other sites of one acre or so suggested by Mr. Burk. The School should be the centre of the community. To place it at the end of the settlement would reduce its value.\n\nMr. Burk was requested to trace the matter of the land transfer of twenty-five acres. When this is complete we can then start to develop the reserve. The date of June 10th was set as a deadline, if the title is not assured by then it can be assumed no school will be built this year and the money transferred to some other school.\nThe present building is hardly fit to use next year. In the event a new school is not built this year, and this does not appear likely to be done, I would recommend that transportation be arranged to take the Indian children, about twelve in number, to Nipigon.\n\nF.

MMcN\nLAKE HELEN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL INSPECTION REPORT\n\nDate of Inspection - September 23, 1949.\n\nSchool Building\nThis is not a Government owned school but is operated in the building rented from the Church. It is a poor building and will obviously have to be replaced when the problem of the establishment of a new reserve is settled.\n\nTeacher and classroom\nMiss M. Cox has a second class certificate from Quebec Province and has eight years of experience in Indian schools and seven years of experience in provincial schools. She is not a good teacher and has not recently attended summer school. She is a teacher of the type we are trying to replace in our schools. She has made no effort to improve her professional standing in spite of repeated warnings from the Department. I do not consider we should retain her services in anything but a small school where the services of any other teachers are not available. She should most definitely not be hired for the new school when it is erected.\n\nAchievement Tests\nThere were 23 children enrolled with 14 Indians and 9 non-Indians. These were in Grades 1-6. These children tested poorly. Their reading was unsatisfactory and she did not have the teachers' manuals nor had she ever used them. In fact she was using the wrong readers in Grade II. There was little evidence that she was attempting to follow the course of study.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. The new school should be erected when the matter\n\n.....2\nof the reserve is settled.\n\n2. The site has already been selected by Mr. Matters, Mr. Burk and myself.\n\n3. It should be possible to erect a school with electricity and running water.\n\n4. Miss Cox should be employed in a newly opened school where Indian children are very primitive and require only basic education.\n\nBernard F.

A school should be established at Pickerel on the main land where there are over 12 Indian children of school age and about that number on the Contin island. The Indians are making their homes in the village of Pickerel where they secure ready and steady employment in the mill of the Pine Lake Lumber Co. The children of the white people of the village would also attend school and I am sure they would bear part of the expense of the establishment and maintenance of such a school. For further details in the scheme, reference could be made to Supt. Logan who is acquainted with the needs of these people in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nParry Sound,\nMay 11 1920.\n\nI beg to submit to you Minutes of Council meeting held at Pickreil, Henry Inlet on May 3rd at which I was present. After voting on two surrenders for lease of land to Pine Lake Lumber Co and to James Ludgate for a Mill site the following business was discussed and motions passed.\n\nThe question of erecting a school at Pickreil was discussed and it was moved by John Wikemakis and seconded by Wm Missabie that the school be built on the mill side of the river instead of on the island. Carried.\n\nSigned\n\nChief Missabie.\nParry Sound,\nMay 11 1920.\n\nI beg to submit to you minutes of meeting held at Pickreil on May 3rd, at which I had a good attendance of Indians as I paid out Interest money. It is very hard to have a good meeting there unless it is payday as the Indians are scattered over a large area. I endeavoured to have a meeting before to submit the Surrender but could never get enough of them together, however we had a good meeting on the 3rd and took up a lot of important business.\n\nThe question of a school was gone into and as I explained to the Indians there was no use doing anything until they decided and agreed on a site as a great many wanted it built on the Island where only a few Indian children lived and where it would be impossible to get a teacher to live. If they agreed to have it on the mill side of the river, the Pine Lake people would help them and suggested a union school and I have a promise from Mr Fraser of the Pine Lake Co. that they will build the building and supply the fuel to heat it if the Indian Dep't will run it or any other arrangements satisfactory to the Indian Department as they must have a school there being a great many white children.\n\nI would like to know if the Dept would be in favour of a union school or purely Indian school. I think there would be about 22 children belonging to the band who could attend a Logan. [Handwritten]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6140, File 403-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Superintendent Logan forwards a resolution, of a meeting of Council held at Pickerel, requesting that a school be established for the use of the Indian and white children residing on Contin Island Reserve and on the mainland in the village of Pickerel. The school is for the benefit of the children of the Indian and white employees of the Pine Lake Lumber Company. A number of the Indians live on Contin Island, but the majority reside near the plant of the lumber company.\n\nSuperintendent Logan states that there are about 22 children belonging to the band who would attend, besides there are a number of white children for whom no educational facilities are provided. He states that the Pine Lake Lumber Company suggests a union school and that they will put up a building on their property and supply the fuel, if the Department will provide the equipment and pay the salary of a teacher. The Indians at this point secure steady employment in the lumber mills. A request was made in 1914 for the establishment of a combined school at this point.\n\nRecently I had a visit from Mr. Cole, a member of the Pine Lake Lumber Company. He requested that a combined school for the Indian and white children be established. He stated that the white people would be prepared to bear their share of the expense.\n\nAs the Indian children at this point are receiving no education, I think that a good arrangement to provide the same would be to combine with the white people, and, if the lumber company will erect a building and supply the fuel, we should furnish the equipment such as desks, school material and\nand blackboards, and engage the teacher and pay the salary. This school, if erected in the village of Pickerel, would be on what was formerly the lower French River Reserve, but the portion on which the village is situated was surrendered to the C. P. R. for piling grounds and has since by them been transferred to the lumber company. By combining with the white employees of the lumber company the Department would obtain educational facilities for the Indian children at much less expense than if a school were erected and carried on for the benefit of the Indian children only.\n\nI would suggest that Mr. Superintendent Logan be instructed to communicate with the Pine Lake Lumber Company with a view to having them provide a suitable building, and, if the building is provided by them, that this Department engage a teacher and pay the salary.\nOttawa, June 9, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo submitting the minutes of a meeting held at Pickeral on the 3rd of the same month with regard to the establishment of a school for the benefit of the Indian children residing in the village of Pickeral and on Contin Island and for the children of the white employees of the Pine Lake Lumber Company.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted that, if a building is erected for school purposes, the Council have agreed that it be built on the mill side of the river instead of on the island.\n\nYou may take this matter up with the management of the Pine Lake Lumber Company and inform them that, if they will erect a building with the necessary accommodation to provide for the Indian children and supply the fuel to heat it, the Department will be prepared to furnish the equipment such as desks and blackboards, also the stationery and school supplies required by the Indian children, and will pay a proportionate share of the teacher's salary and running expenses; it is to be understood that they will engage the services of a properly qualified teacher and responsible for the management of the school.\n\nYou should take this matter up with the company as soon as possible and inform the Department as to whether they will comply with the Department's offer for the carrying on of a union school for the Indian and white children in the village of Pickeral.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nAt a meeting held at Pickeril, Heny Inlet Reserve, it was resolved that a school house be erected on Countin Island for the benefit of the Indian children of which there are at present some eighteen.\n\nI would recommend the construction of this school at once as they had been expecting a union school at Pickeril but there are a great many children there and the Indians think it better to have a school of their own. Mr. Fraser of the Pine lake Lumber Co. will supply all the rough material for a building 20x30, if the Department will pay for labor and other supplies.\n\nThis school might be built at once and be ready for opening after the holidays. I think a teacher could live on mill side of the river as there is a good boarding house there.\n\nI would like to get Departments views on this matter as soon as possible.\n\nI am Your Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6440, File 403-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOTTAWA, July 22nd, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant with reference to the erection of a school building on Countin Island for the benefit of the Indian children.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department is not disposed to pay for the cost of the work of putting up a building, furnishing the same and for its future maintenance for the benefit of Indian children only. It is considered that the arrangements made last year for the erection of a joint school for white and Indian children residing in the village of Pickerel and on Countin Island should be adhered to, as per official letter to you of June 9th, 1920. It is doubtful if a school for the benefit of Indian children only would meet with the success which would warrant the Department in assuming the cost of the work of putting up the building, and for maintenance and payment of the teacher's salary.\n\nIn letter to you of June 9th, 1920, mentioned above, you were requested to take up with the management of the Pine Lake Lumber Company the erection by them of a building of suitable size to accommodate the Indian and white children, also that they agree to supply the fuel required, engage the services of a properly qualified teacher and assume a proportionate share of the cost of salary.\n\nYou should inform the Indians at Pickerel accordingly, and endeavour to have them consent to the establishment of a joint school, and you should also arrange with the Lumber Company for the carrying out of the arrangement as mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that while at Pickerel paying interest money to the Senvey Inlet Band the following matter was brought to my attention.\n\nThere are twenty children of the band at Pickerel who have had no education. There are ten children under ten years of age and ten children over that age.\n\nThere is a Public School at Pickerel but on making inquiries I found that the settlers and the Inspector of Schools object to Indian children being accommodated in the Public School.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that this matter be earnestly considered as it has been said to me that the children in question are practically growing up wild.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nDunc. C. Scott Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Nov. 9, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 8-229 of the 21st ultimo, referring to the educational needs of the Lower French River Reserve, Henvey Inlet.\n\nIn reply I wish to review, for your information, the facts on file and ask for your recommendation. During the past year this Indian band at Pickerel surrendered about one-half an acre to a Public School Board for a school site. The original intention was to operate a combined white and Indian school. The school Board and the Ontario Department of Education decided on a public school for white children only, and in the lease of the school site we asked for an annual rental of $25.00.\n\nThe former Indian Agent, Mr. A. Logan, informed the Department in January of this year that the Indian band at Pickerel were somewhat disappointed over the attitude taken by the white people. Our representative intimated that the Indian band would like a school of their own at Countin Island. It was reported at that time that there were 6 families on the island with 14 children of school age and 3 families on the mainland near the Pine Lake Company's mill with 5 children of school age, making a total of 19 Indian children who could be accommodated at a day school on the island.\n\nMr. Logan reported also that there was a good building 20 x 30 on the island, which was used for church services and could be bought for, roughly, $100. It would require some alterations and improvements amounting to about $200 to put it in good condition. He believed that the Pine Lake Lumber Company would give some assistance and that the teacher could live at the company's boarding house.\n\nWould you either visit Pickerel or make enquiries regarding this church building and ascertain if it can be purchased, and the amount necessary in the event of a transfer. Also offer the Department a rough estimate as to the cost of putting it in shape for school purposes. The Pine Lake Lumber Company might be approached with a view to securing the necessary lumber for the alterations, gratis, and to learning if a teacher could be accommodated at their boarding house. Please state whether it is possible to cross from the mainland to the island at all seasons of the year, and make a general recommendation as to the advisability of commencing a day school for the Pickerel band.

During the past year this Indian band at Pickerel surrendered about one-half an acre to a Public School Board for a school site. The original intention was to operate a combined white and Indian school. The school board and the Ontario Department of Education decided on a public school for white children only, and in the lease of the school site we asked for an annual rental of $25.00.\n\nThe former Indian Agent, Mr. A. Logan, informed the Department in January of this year that the Indian band at Pickerel were somewhat disappointed over the attitude taken by the white people. Our representative intimated that the Indian band would like a school of their own at Countin Island. It was reported at that time that there were 6 families on the island with 14 children of school age and 3 families on the mainland near the Pine Lake Company's mill with 5 children of school age, making a total of 19 Indian children who could be accommodated at a day school on the island.\n\nMr. Logan reported also that there was a good building 20 x 30 on the island, which was used for church services and could be bought for, roughly, $100. It would require some alterations and improvements amounting to about $200 to put it in good condition. He believed that the Pine Lake Lumber Company would give some assistance and that the teacher could live at the company's boarding house.\n\nWould you either visit Pickerel or make enquiries regarding this church building and ascertain if it can be purchased, and the amount necessary in the event of a transfer. Also offer the Department a rough estimate as to the cost of putting it in shape for school purposes. The Pine Lake Lumber Company might be approached with a view to securing the necessary lumber for the alterations, gratis, and to learning if a teacher could be accommodated at their boarding house. Please state whether it is possible to cross from the mainland to the island at all seasons of the year, and make a general recommendation as to the advisability of commencing a day school for the Pickerel Band. In the earlier correspondence this proposed school has been spoken of as the Lower French River Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6140, File 403-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir.\u2014\nI beg to report that Miss Louise B. Dale of Shawville Que., a teacher holding a third class certificate and having three years experience teaching has applied for the position as teacher of the Gontin Island School. She was recommended to me by Miss McLarnon, teacher of the Ryerson Day School at Parry Island and I believe that she is well qualified to fill the position. She would like to start at once at a salary of eighty dollars ($80.00) per month which I believe is not too much to pay for this position. Please state if the Department will consider this application. I have the honour to be, Sir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept.

Dale for the position as teacher of the school which it is proposed to open on Contint Island, Lower French River Reserve, and stating the qualifications which she possesses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that Miss Dale's services would be satisfactory, and her appointment is approved.\n\nThe salary allowed Miss Dale will be at the rate of $700 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law. A bonus is provided for teachers during the present fiscal year only, at the rate of $15.00 per month.\n\nYou will be good enough to ascertain definitely whether Miss Dale will accept the position, and, if so, you should arrange with her to begin duties when the school is fitted up and ready, which will likely not be before the 1st of March, next.\n\nThe tenders for the desks are due here on the 1st of February, and from the time the order is placed, and the desks are delivered at the school, it will take at least two weeks.\n\nYou should let us know at an early date as to whether Miss Dale accepts the position, and also the date on which the school is ready and she takes up duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dale has accepted the position as teacher of the school which it is intended to open on Contin Island, Lower French River Reserve, and that you have arranged with her to begin duties on March 1st, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the appointment of Miss Dale is approved, and, as you were previously informed, she will be allowed salary at the rate of $700 per annum. As far as we are aware, bonus will only be allowed during the month of March, which will end the present fiscal year. Whether the bonus will be continued during the next fiscal year will depend upon the action taken by Parliament during the present session.\n\nWe hope that this school will be ready for the teacher to begin duties on the date above mentioned, and that she will meet with every success in her work. We shall be pleased if you will give her every assistance you can, and hope that the Indian parents will take full advantage of the opportunity offered and see that their children of school age, who are in good health, attend regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dale, teacher at Lower French school.\n\nI should explain that in talking with Miss Dale about the break-up, I told her that she was to take no chance in trying to cross the river and even if she could not make it for a day or two, all she had to do was to mention it in her report.\n\nI cannot understand her actions in presuming to take the liberty to go on a holiday without the permission of the Dept. I feel like telling her when she returns that her services will be no longer required after this term. However I await the Department's opinion on the matter. I cannot allow, in this agency, such high-handed methods of behaviour by any of the teachers, unless the Dept. approves of same.\n\nPlease note that there were three days elapsed before Miss Dale notified me that she had taken a holiday.\n\nPlease advise at your earliest.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D.

It was, no doubt, necessary, owing to the condition of the river and the impossibility of crossing, for her to close school for a few days. She had no right, however, to close the school for a lengthy period without permission. When her returns for the current quarter are being forwarded, please be good enough to state thereon the number of days the school was closed and the number for which no payment of salary be allowed on account of her absence. Upon her return you should inform her that, before closing school for other than authorized holidays, she should first receive the necessary permission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

She would have qualified as High School Teacher but owing to my need of her at home, she gave up her ambition to become a teacher so that she might keep house for me.

MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nOttawa, May 3rd, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a resolution from the Indians of the Lower French River Reserve in which they request that the services of Miss E. Daly, the teacher, be continued for the next school year, viz., to June 30th, 1929. The Indian parents seem anxious to retain Miss Daly's services, as they state the children are getting on well under her instruction. As you have been informed, this school will be inspected by a separate school inspector, and this arrangement will be carried out during the coming academic year. This change in the inspector does not necessarily mean that a Catholic teacher should be engaged forthwith, and I should be pleased if you would let me know without delay if you can agree to satisfy the request of the Indians, i.e., the retention of the services of Miss Daly for the coming academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

L. Boucheron\n\nSt Ann's Rectory, Sudbury, Ont.\nOttawa, May 10, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the Lower French River Indian Day School. It is true that the Department was and is prepared to consider this a Catholic school as from the first of September next. The point I raise in my letter of the 3rd instant is that the Indians are more than satisfied with the present teacher and would like her to remain for another year. However, we could arrange to have the school inspected this coming academic year by a separate school inspector.\n\nI note your question concerning the decision of the Provincial Department of Education. May I point out that the decisions in connection with this school are made by the Department of Indian Affairs. The Provincial Department of Education will be glad to have this school inspected by either public or separate school officers. If you agree to the retention of Miss Daly for another year, I will write the Provincial Department, asking them to have a separate school inspector visit there in future. Please let me have an early reply, stating if you can agree to this proposal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6140, File 403-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nAs I have heard much about you from missionaries, I have written to you at Picton or Long Branch. There is an Indian school in which all the pupils are Catholic, and the teacher a Protestant, Miss Daly, a very good girl, no doubt. I have nothing to say against her. But she can't give what she has not. Not being of the same religion, it is very easy to understand that she cannot give the Catholic training. If I were a Protestant minister, I would try to have a Protestant teacher to train...\nthe Protestant children. It seems to be situated in a mission where I go not even once a month, for the religious training is given more by the teacher than the first minister, who visits the mission. But I am a priest, and so I am asking for a catholic teacher for catholic pupils. I have no Indian missions to visit, I have been 10 years an Indian missionary, and never had I any opposition from the Department. I believe they have M. A. T. the King's Mills, or that there is a resolution from the Indians to retain Miss Daly. I questioned the Indians about what resolutions and nobody signed it or heard about it except the chief, a Protestant, who says that Miss Daly is to be released because she can't pull the ears of the children and because she wants to make money to get married, and besides I heard about this resolution from M. A. T. the King's, and M. Daly, Indian agent.\n\nSo, I would ask you to do something for me. I don't want to write any-\nto Mr. Stewart not to see him about that case. I would prefer to have it settled by the Department. In 1927, I wrote to Mr. A.D. Maclean about that question, and I have still my letter in which he told me that since September 1928 there will be a catholic teacher in Pickle River Indian school. Lately I had a letter from Mr. A.D. Maclean stating that there was a resolution from the Indians to retain Miss Daly. I wrote again about it to Mr. A.D. Maclean and it is always Mr. A.D. Maclean who answers. If Mr. Maclean still lives, or still in charge, or do any letters reach him, I would like to know; even I will know, one day. But I don't like to work against the Department.\nwithout it being absolutely necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. L. Porcheron\n\nSt Ann's Rectory\n\nSudbury\n\n[signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Y.\nParry Sound, Ont.\nJune 22, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir;\n\nYours of June 16th, 22-6-1, re conversation between Rev. Porcheron and myself concerning Miss Casper, the teacher at Lower French Indian Day School. In my conversation with Rev. Porcheron, I stated to him that being the father of five girls most of them grown to womanhood, I felt a great responsibility concerning the lady teachers in my Agency and asked Rev. Porcheron, if he as a Missionary Priest had cause to speak to Miss Casper about a young man, who has been paying her court, for staying late at night at the teacher's house, Lower French Reserve.\n\nFather Porcheron, said he had. I explained to him my desire at all times to cooperate with the church for the betterment of the Indian, particularly in connection with scholastic matters. He was delighted at my remarks (which I thought rather strange) for this reason. He, Rev. Porcheron seemed to rather welcome my statement that although I had sympathy with young men and maidens in their love affairs I did not believe all I was told about Miss Casper and her young man keeping unseemly hours but the dignity of the Department of Indian Affairs must be upheld and that the Department could not afford to have even a breath of suspicion cast upon their teaching staff, and as there was a talk among the whites and Indians that the young man who is paying court to Miss Casper was staying late at the teacher's house, and as Miss Casper had made application to continue teaching I was going to write him, as I had heard he had found it necessary to speak to Miss Casper about the matter. I said I was glad I had met him, and went into all the details of what he knew, and I found out by his conversation that he knew nothing except that there were suspicions.\nthat there might be improper conduct between Miss Casper and her intended.\n\nI asked him to keep me posted on any teachers whom he thought might be suitable and he said he would, and immediately mentioned two teachers, one of whom the Department refused to have teach in this Agency. I then told him not to do anything definite, as from experience I knew he is inclined to reach beyond his depth, in matters which he has nothing to do with. I told him I would write to Miss Casper in a fatherly way, advising her to resign, as I did not mean to be the cause of any harm to this young woman, whom I know to have wonderful qualities as a young woman and as a teacher.\n\nEnclosed is a copy of the letter I mailed to Miss Casper on the following day, to which I have not received a reply, yet.\n\nSir, when I was talking to the Rev. Porcheron about Miss Casper, it was in strict confidence, because Miss Casper lost her father in the Halifax disaster and her mother worked to put her through Normal, therefore I did not want her to be dismissed without just cause and for that reason, I sent her the enclosed letter asking her to resign. The letter will explain itself. I was trying to play cricket or ball, as I understand it should be played. I explained in confidence about some trouble I had with a teacher and how I booted the young man out of the house, and warned him if he was seen on the Reserve again I would have him arrested. I then told the teacher she was through. I also explained how the Department had insisted I must get proof of misconduct, and explained to him that I furnished the proof to the satisfaction of the Department, but I hated myself for having been forced to do so, as I expected the Department would have accepted my word that it was time for a change. I did not say to him that it was suggested to me after I took over the Agency at Parry Sound that the teacher referred to was of an obliging disposition.\n\nThe reason for this lengthy letter to the Department in the case of Miss Casper, and the enclosed letter from me to Miss Casper asking her to resign, is this; I do not want to be a party that would injure the prospects of Miss Casper earning her living. My letter to Miss Casper explains my position in the case and I would like to be able to recommend her for her services in this\nAgency, and I feel that I can honestly do so, therefore I feel I do not approve of the Rev. Porcheron writing the Department on the matter at all. I do not think he was playing good cricket, I do not think he was playing cricket at all. Furthermore, my belief in the Service as I understand the Service, is this; that the Church and the state can cooperate for the general good of the people but when the Church starts to take upon itself the duties of the officials of the state, in my opinion it is time the service as representing the state should tell the Church in a diplomatic manner to hustle, hustle, and play ball, play cricket as it should be played.\n\nEnclosed also is petition from the members of the Lower French Band, brought to this office by Miss Casper.\n\nTrusting the Department will understand my situation as their representative in the field in Parry Sound and Muskoka Districts.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/EK.\nEnclosure. 2.\nOttawa, June 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, concerning Miss Casper, teacher of the Lower French River Indian Day School, and enclosing copy of a letter which you addressed to her, as well as a petition from a number of the Indians regarding the retention of her services.\n\nIn reply I have to say that it is considered it would be advisable to make a change in teacher at this school for the coming school year, and the resignation of Miss Casper is, therefore, accepted. It will be necessary to obtain the services of a qualified teacher to succeed her, and I have to request that you will give this matter your attention, forwarding to the Department any applications which you may receive. Full particulars should be given in each case as to qualifications and experience.\n\nIt is noted that Miss Casper wishes to continue in our teaching service. Should there be a vacancy for a teacher to which she could be appointed, favourable consideration will be given in her case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M.

I may say that there is an official letter going forward to you today, with reference to another school which has just become vacant, viz.: the Maganetowan Indian Day School, at Byng Inlet. I really think that this would be better for you than the Lower French River School at Pickerel. Please let us have a reply at the very earliest date, so that the Department can proceed with filling the vacancies.

You may inform Miss Lillian Sampson, of Bonfield, Ont., who wrote you on the 16th ultimo, and Miss Carmel Keon, of Sheenboro, whose letter to you is dated the 17th ultimo, that, if their services are required, they will be written again. Please inform Miss Rose Chaput, of 142 Maple Ave., Pembroke, who wrote to you on the 22nd ultimo, that her services will not be required. For your information, I may say that we have already had Miss Chaput in our employ and we will not require her services again.\n\nThe Department has some good applicants, some of whom have had experience in Indian schools, and I will write you later with reference to appointments to the Lower French River, Maganetowan and Ryerson Indian Day Schools.

If this is the case how could I be fit to teach in any other Indian school. I have also advised them to this effect.\n\nRegarding the length of time I am taking to vacate the house, I understood you to have said when I was at your office that I could take all the time I needed now this time is limited to little more than a week and it appears to be too much. Teachers in white schools are given a months notice except when fired during a school term which is then not less than two weeks.\n\nAfter working and doing what I have done for this place I did consider that a months notice would be no favour. The Dept. will know this too.\n\nRegarding reference I knew my work here will count more than any reference on a piece of paper because if it hasn't been appreciated by the Dept. it has been by the Indians and white people even outside of Pickeral. I feel very sure I can get other schools within a short distance from here if I wish to take them because I was told by a school board to put in an application and I would not need to furnish reference. They had seen my work here. I have also been told to put in applications at two other schools within ten miles of here both of whom claim to have heard of my work in this school. They have also asked me to see their schools first. So from this I have reason to believe that I will not have difficulty in getting another school.\n\nI have understood your letter Mr. Daly and rest assured I will vacate very shortly.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A few days previous to this he was in Pickerel and in the presence of a number of Indians stated that I would have my school another year. However on his return to Parry Sound he met Rev. L. Porcheron, whose reports I understand were not favorable. I understand also that he reported some unfavorable matters to the Department. I explained the cause of the trouble to Mr. Daly and he said he would in turn explain same to the Dept. If this has not been done I would be very glad to furnish further information. I delayed resigning for two weeks because the Indians who still want me back urged me to do so. They sent a petition to Mr. Daly to have me remain and a councillor went personally but he deemed it advisable to refuse this.\n\nOn June 29th, I got a 2nd notice from the Agent and it stated that if I did not resign he would be forced to \"act differently\" I did so immediately and stated that I would leave as soon as possible. On July 6th, I received the enclosed letter.\n\nI have accepted the Departments decision to have me resign, as final, since I am given to understand it is their wishes. For my own information I would like to know is a teacher given a months notice as in other schools. I have a considerable amount of furnishings here which have to be moved and I wanted to leave the place as I found it so I did not figure I needed to rush myself in order to leave.\n\nAfter fixing and doing what I have for this school I cannot understand matters if it is the Departments wishes that a teacher should have the shortest notice possible instead of a month as is customary.

The letter also puts me in mind of the First Woman and her guile.\n\nEnclosed is a copy of the letter that I have sent to her in reply. There is just this difficulty at the present time. The doctor wants me to stick around and not go away anywhere as I had a pretty rotten night last night.

I concur in Mr. Daly's statement: \"a week is a reasonable time\".

The homes for the teachers are quite comfortable, and there is lots of wood provided.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if the Department would let me know if they have made any progress in the hiring of teachers for the schools at Magnetawan and Lower French.

Her remarks re the ice are not true, the ice is perfectly good, and the school should not be closed on April 11th. Would you please note her remarks about the cheques, she is asking for her cheque on the 16th of April, and is going to close the school on the 11th of April.\n\nHer cheque came to this office last night and knowing the fuss she made about her last cheque, as there is no mail going to Pickeral until tomorrow the 13th, I sent her cheque on to the address given in her letter, Dr. F.A. Kelly Sudbury.--having inside information that she would be going away.\n\nThis woman ignored me when I got off the train at Pickeral on the night of the 8th, and she did it in such a way as to try to discount me as an official of the Government in the eyes of the people in that section.\n\nI received the enclosed letter this morning. Our train service here is tri-weekly, and it would be impossible for her to receive her cheque before Thursday night if I sent it in the usual way. She would not receive it until after the train would leave Pickeral Station on the night of the 13th of April, as it would arrive on the train from the south, which she would be leaving on to go North. That is the reason I sent her cheque care of Dr. F.A. Kelly, Sudbury, who is a woman doctor. I had inside information that she would be doing this.\nI will be very glad when Inspector McGeekin comes to this Agency to clear this matter up. Every week that passes goes to prove that this woman should not be in the employ of the Department.\n\nWould the Department please note that Mrs. Munson is closing the school without asking permission, and that she is enquiring about her cheque in the letter dated April 10th, when her cheque is not due her until the 13th at the latest.\n\nI am sending this letter for the information of the Department, and so that they will see the slick disposition of this individual.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/RE\n\nAgent\n(Private and Confidential)\n\n(Attention-Mr. Sutherland.)\n\nThe Department of Education,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nBritt, Ont.,\nMay 1, 1933.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI have been requested by Mrs. A.K. Munson, teacher of the Indian school at Pickerel, C.P.R., Ont., to write to you as to her services in Pickerel in so far as I am acquainted with the matter and her moral influence on the Indians.\n\nI have made but a few visits to Pickerel monthly, and hence I cannot claim to be perfectly posted on the matter, as at the time of my visits I have many things to look after. I believe Mrs. Munson takes a real interest in the Indians and in her school. The people seem to like her.\n\nAs regards the complaints against morality, I can say nothing either for or against, except that to my way of thinking she seems to be too sociable with men, for a married woman. Perhaps I am mistaken. Whether there has been much scandal or talk of her visits to these men or theirs to her, I am not aware.\n\nI have stated the above on the understanding that this is private and confidential and that this matter will not be revealed. Trusting that it may be somewhat helpful in judging of the matter, I am,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n(Pw.) H. Sharp.\nMr. D.

She is good to the children and she is beloved by them. She gives attention to the moral and temporal needs of the families. I never heard any complaint against her by any Indians.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nT. A.

I scorn the thought. That is the reason that I am sending the communications received from the Henvey Inlet Band direct to the department so that the department can read between the lines.\n\nThe possibilities are that I may be in Ottawa any time, as I have had news to the effect that my wife's mother may not live very long. My wife is down there now and if I am down I will call in to the department and see what can be done about cleaning this situation up. It surely needs cleaning up.\n\nJohn H.

After reviewing the correspondence, extending over a considerable period, I have to inform you that it has been decided, in the interests of the work, that your engagement as teacher should terminate at the end of the present school year viz.: June 30th, next.

They discovered this last affair last Sunday and left everything as they found it as they were at a loss what to do until they would hear from me.\n\nThe thieves stole a flour tin and quite a lot of food stuffs. The flour tin was the property of the government, goes with the house\u2014they also stole a considerable amount of coal oil. Left the canned goods untouched on account of finger prints as this habit could become a serious matter. Bureau drawers and trunks were rummaged and things in general left in a most disorderly mess.\n\nI spoke to Mr. Daly some time ago about the first Yale lock having been\ntransferred with but he did nothing about it. I have been in the habit of locking the front door this way, the back door lock has a very ordinary lock, the key of which was thrown away when the intruders beat a hasty retreat through the back door, having entered by the front\u2014it was impossible to get in but the back door the second time as the boys had raised it and bolted the inside back door.\n\nI have notified the Police of this and would appreciate your cooperation in whatever is advisable to prevent a recurrence of this rather serious deed.\n\nI trust you have had a pleasant summer.

I am sending two hasps and padlocks\nto the caretaker and have instructed him to put them on.\n\nI informed Mrs. Munson that I expected the\nMounted Police would be in that district, and I would send\nhim around to see her and she could explain the situation\nre the breaking into the house. Mrs. Munson states that they\nbroke through the cellar window. She also states that they did\nnot get in at the front door, they must have got in at the\ncellar window and went out by the back door.\n\nAs far as I can make out by what Mrs. Munson\nsays there has not been very much damage done, but it would\nappear that some person got in at the cellar window, although\nthe window seemed to be all right. When I discussed this\nmatter with Mrs. Munson she explained that the glass had been\ntaken out, as there was no putty around the glass all they had\nto do was take out the nails, which they seemed to have\nreplaced.\nHowever, as explained to Mrs. Munson, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police will be visiting the Reserves during the Fall Fairs, according to a letter received from Corporal Traves of Sudbury, and I will ask him to look into the matter when doing his rounds.\n\nThe Department knows my opinion about Mrs. Munson teaching and I am surely convinced that the Christmas vacation cannot come too soon.\n\nThe hasps and locks for the doors will be sent on this afternoon's train.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/XX.\nNovember 1, 1933\n\nMr. A.

Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to conversation with you some little time ago, I now wish to tender my resignation from the position of teacher of the Lower Severn River Indian Day School on the Lower Severn Reserve, & takes effect at the end of the December quarter.\n\nFrom all appearances we are to have an early winter so that I am looking forward to being able to remove my piano and other furniture as soon as there is good ice on the river.\n\nAs outlined in part by you when we met, I have other very interesting work awaiting me in Sudbury and I am anxious to go albeit the fact that in many ways it grieves me to leave my\nI like my children and they like me but a nice ready-made family for my own little lovable son appeals to me very strongly. If you remember, I appreciated you with some of the facts regarding my personal life and I am happy to be able to say that the plans for the future appear to be almost entirely satisfactory and successful.\n\nIn view of my experience here and the work which I have done amongst the people, I wonder if I may be allowed to make a suggestion for the Dept. of Education. Please that they will not send any poor little misguided, inexperienced teacher to this very lovely place. It is wonderful country here, if you are fitted to this life and are not dependent on any social life whatsoever. Also, if possible (and it ought to) send one with some experience in nursing; this is very isolated and you will find, by looking up the records of the Medical end of the Reserve...\nthat the medical expenses were much lower,\nand the sickness very much less while I was\non the Reserve. All the Reserves needed more than\njust a teacher. I have done a very thorough\nnursing service here, always ready and willing\nwhen they called, which has been at all hours, and\nI have travelled considerably over land and water\nthe Indians. The Doctor's visits have been very few.\n\nIn view of these facts, and the added fact\nthat I have been obliged to ferry the children\nvery frequently, for a month at a time last year and\nthis \u2014 always at my own expense, would it be\ntoo much of the Department that they pass approval\non the attached bills and forward check to cover. The\nthree fifteen ($3.15) is for general repairs, greasing etc.,\nto engine after being in use two and a half years.\n\nYou see, I also have had and will have\nagain, considerable expenses in transferring\nmy piano and other articles from the island.\nThese have greatly facilitated my life here and\nmade a pleasant social and musical life for the\nIndians so I would appreciate a little help.\non these accounts.\n\nMay I add here that my association with the Department have been most pleasant; the kindness and consideration shown at all times have been very gratifying and I surely appreciate it.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nAlfreda K.

The Department will arrange for the appointment of a successor, to begin duties on or about the first of January, next, and you will be advised later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Munson, teacher of the Lower French River Indian Day School, Pickering P. O., Ont., in the federal district of Parry Sound, has tendered her resignation, to take effect December 31st, next.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain for this school a teacher who should have at least Ontario Second Class professional qualifications. As this school is isolated, it would be advisable to engage a teacher with previous experience. Further, the Indians in this district are Catholic, and it will be necessary to obtain a teacher of that denomination.\n\nThe salary paid Mrs. Munson was at the rate of $85 per teaching month, less 10%. As rural white schools have decreased salaries during the present academic year and as there are a large number of qualified teachers available, it is considered that it would be possible to secure a teacher for $80 per teaching month, less 10%.\n\nAn application for this position has been received from Miss Monica McAuley, 408 Lewis Street, Ottawa. She possesses an expired Ontario second class professional certificate and has had teaching experience in the Sudbury district. Miss McAuley has visited the Department and, if appointed, would be satisfactory.\n\nI should be glad to be informed of the name, qualifications, etc., of the teacher whom you desire to have appointed.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nRAA205 44 NL VIA COLDWATER STANDARD TIME\n\nFESSERTON ONT 2\n\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nPARLIAMENT BLDGS OTTAWA ONT\n\nIS THERE OPENING FOR TEACHER ON PICKEREL INDIAN SCHOOL STOP MALE TEACHER STOP 5 YEARS EXPERIENCE STOP CATHOLIC STOP CAN PRODUCE EXCELLENT REFERENCES PLEASE REPLY BY LETTER AT ONCE IF SUCH IS THE CASE WILL SEND OTHER PARTICULARS BY LETTER WHEN YOUR REPLY ARRIVES\n\nDENNIS J GARVEY\nDecember 4, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nM.F.

In June (1933) I passed in teaching, and in all subjects except two, which I will have to try in June of this year. I have all my Middle School subjects off, and I have six Upper School subjects off.

Cleary re Miss O'Toole, whom he knows very well. Miss O'Toole seems to be very anxious to get along and has had pretty good attendance for starting in. I have advised her as to the best method of getting around and interesting the parents in the education of their children.\n\nMiss O'Toole seems anxious to do what is right. I have advised her not to get too familiar with the Indians, while she can be kind and ladylike to the Indians to still hold her dignity as teacher of the school. Miss O'Toole seems anxious to get in line, and I am hoping that all the troubles in this school will be over now.\n\nMiss O'Toole informed me that she will take the examinations during the summer holidays for her certificate.\n\nI should state that all the stuff on the requisition is required. The teacher's house looked as if a cyclone had struck it and there was nothing left. Mrs. Hudson had been using a lot of her own stuff, and I presume that it is only reasonable that some of the other supplies would wear out in the\ncourse of usage.

It is hoped that she will meet with every success. It is noted that she intends taking the examination during the holidays, next summer, in order to obtain her certificate.\n\nAn order will be forwarded the Government Stationery Office to send to the teacher's address the classroom supplies considered necessary.

This is a new school which is being opened and the Department considered that, with your experience in Indian work, you will make a most suitable teacher for this school. It is possible that the transfer at this time of the year will cause you some inconvenience but I feel certain that you are prepared to cooperate with the Department and give your services wherever required.\n\nChristian Island is situated near Penetanguishene and the Indian Agent is Mr. John A.

She is getting along very nicely at Lower French.\n\nI have explained to Miss O'Toole that the Department has given out an order and expect that it will be carried out. She explains that her parents would not like her to go so far away from home.\n\nWould the Department please reply at their very earliest and say if they will be good enough to leave Miss O'Toole in her present position.\n\nThe consideration of the Department at their very earliest will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, October 6, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, relative to the transfer of Miss M.

This news makes me feel very badly. I am getting along very well at the Lower French School and Mr. Daly is quite satisfied with me, so I would, if at all possible, like to remain there.

I feel that I am entitled to this request for three reasons. I have almost completed my second year as a teacher for the Department of Indian Affairs and I believe my teaching record has been satisfactory.\n\nI was receiving a salary of eight hundred and fifty ($850.00) dollars per year at my last school, on the Onida Reserve, in the Caradoc...\nAgency and took a decrease of fifty ($50.00) dollars when I took over this school. I would like to have this amount returned to me.\n\nAs the reserve is quite isolated and in a northern district, the cost of living is extremely high. For this reason alone, I feel that the increase is justified.\n\nMy present salary is eight hundred ($800.00) dollars per year. I am asking for an increase of fifty ($50.00) per year.\n\nWould you please forward my request to the Department along with your recommendation, as you see fit?\n\nHoping you will consider this favourably, I remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArthur B.

Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith my resignation as teacher of the Lower French Indian Day School. The reason is that I have, very unexpectedly, been offered the position of teacher in a white school in southern Ontario. I think you will agree when I say that it has every advantage over teaching in the Indian schools at Pickwed.\n\nHowever, it is with regret that I think of leaving the more pleasant side of my life here and I sincerely remember and appreciate your co-operation.\n\nIf you desire, I could perhaps secure the names of some teachers at the University who could and would take over the position. There are nearly 900 in attendance here.\n\nBest regards from Mrs. Carruthers and myself.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nArthur B. Carruthers\nUniversity of Western Ontario\nLondon, Ont.\nJuly 27, 1937\n\nJohn M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nParry Sound\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to tender my resignation as teacher of the Lower French Indian Day School and do hereby give the required months' notice of my intention to do so. I request that my resignation be accepted and that I be notified of same as soon as possible.\n\nFor my part, my connection with the Department of Indian Affairs has been pleasant and I trust my work has been satisfactory. I request permission to refer to you for references.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nArthur B. Carruthers\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nJuly 29th, 1937\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nDept. Of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.,\n\nSir;\n\nEnclosed please find resignation of Arthur B. Carruthers from the position of teacher at the Lower French Indian Day School.\n\nOnly yesterday I sent in his application to continue teaching. Enclosed please find a letter from him stating how he came to change his mind.\n\nI wish to draw your attention to Miss O'Toole who is teaching at Christian Island. Miss O'Toole when she was transferred from this Agency to Christian Island asked me if, when the Magnetawan Indian Day School was vacant that she would get it. The day that Miss Biasucci was appointed to this School, Miss O'Toole was at my office and was very much perturbed because she did not get the opportunity. She is desirous of being near her people.\n\nI promised her that if there should happen to be a vacancy at the Lower French School, where she taught before, that I would put her name forward. This I am doing now. Miss O'Toole was quite a success in this school. She said she would take the school if she received the same salary that she is getting at Christian Island. I think she should get the same salary as she gets in Christian Island as she has the knack of making the children attend school.\nI would therefore recommend that Miss O'Toole be transferred from Christian Island School, back to her old school at Lower French.\n\nPlease reply by return mail if possible, as I expect to be up at her home in Britt next week.\n\nYour very earnest consideration in this matter will be very much appreciated, as I do not like to break my word to either the Indians or the teachers.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJMD/EK.\nEnclosure.\nDear Sir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, the resignation of Arthur B. Carruthers as teacher of the Lower French River Indian Day School is accepted.\n\nThe Department approves the transfer of Miss M. M. O'Toole from the Christian Island R. C. Indian Day School to the Lower French River Indian Day School. She will be allowed salary at the rate of $90 a teaching month and should commence duties on September 1st, 1937.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nChapeau, Quebec.\nJuly 11, 1937.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nParry Sound,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease consider me an applicant for the position of teacher in any of the schools of your agency. I hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts from Ottawa University. I have five years' teaching experience, the last three in an Indian Day School. I followed the Ontario High School Course at the University.\n\nI refer you to Mr. Z. Caza, Indian Agent, Notre-Dame-du-Nord, Que. Rev. Fr.

However I prefer Christian Island to Pickeral, and would like to remain there. Being Inlet however would still be welcome, and I do wish it could be arranged that I be transferred there.\n\nI am sorry I was\nnot able to go down or write sooner. I have been attending summer school here, and do not get home until Sunday morning.\n\nI thank you again for your great kindness to me ever since I have worked under you.\n\nKindest regards to Mrs Daly.\n\nYours truly,\nMargaret O'Toole.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nAugust 16, 1937\n\nR.

Indian Day School, Christian Island agency (Electoral District of Simeon East).\n\nIt was our intention at that time to transfer Miss M. M. O'Toole from the Christian Island R.C. Indian Day School to the Lower French River Indian Day School. We are now in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent J. M. Daly, Parry Sound, in which he states that Miss O'Toole is not prepared to move to the Lower French River School. I recommend that she be allowed to remain at her present school. This means that teachers are required to fill vacancies at Lower French River (R.C.), Shawanaga and Parry Island (Protestant).\n\nDirector.\nTo enable this file to be made available to researchers it has been necessary for IAND officials to exclude some material in accordance with Cabinet Directive No. 46 of 7 June 1973.\nIndian Affairs.\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6140)\n\nFile 403-1, part 1\nParry Sound Agency - Lower French River School - Teachers - General Administration. 1914 - 1937\n\nFile 403-3, part 1\nParry Sound Agency - Lower French River School - Teachers' Salaries. 1923 - 1937\n\nFile 403-5, part 1\nParry Sound Agency - Lower French River School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1922 - 1933\n\nFile 403-5, part 2\nParry Sound Agency - Lower French River School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1941 - 1948\n\nFile 403-8, part 1\nParry Sound Agency - Lower French River School - Teachers' Residence - Establishment - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts.

I am obliged to make a hasty business trip to the U.S.A. and soon as possible after school closes. Would it be possible to have my check mailed direct from Ottawa to Sudbury? Dr. F.G. Kelly Capital Theatre Bldg., Sudbury, Ontario? This would avoid unnecessary delay as experienced at Christmas time and Easter. I shall mail quarterly report to Mr. Daly June 29 as customary.\n\nI have also sent request through to Mr. Daly for a new ball for the children, as this comes from Ottawa. I thought maybe we could speed up.\nmatters by my writing description\nseen as the children will need these\nballs for their July 1st games.\n\nThey require an \"in-seam\" out-\nlook playground ball \u2014 would appre-\nciate very much if we could have it in\ntime.\n\nWe are busy with Examiners\nthese days, everything is running along\nsmoothly once again. Mr Bennett\nwas here and seemed very pleased with\nresults so I feel his report will be very\ngratifying.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nMiss A. M.

Our mail here is not the same as it is on the main line, it is only tri-weekly.\n\nThere has been a misunderstanding between Mrs Munson and Miss O'Meara and myself re their cheques. In Mrs. Munson's case the cheque when out the evening it arrived here, and in the case of Miss O'Meara, I knew it could not get her at Magnetawan School so I sent it forward to her home at Billings bridge.\n\nThere is not much chance of you knowing about the mail conditions here so that is the reason why I am writing.\n\nYour consideration will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It will be necessary to obtain a quit claim deed, signed by the Indian woman who owns the property, and I enclose herewith two forms for the purpose. You have not stated the name of the owner, and you should fill this in on each of the copies of the deed, giving the Christian names of the woman, in full. The other blank spaces, such as the date, etc., should be filled in, as well as the declaration regarding the ownership, and the woman's declaration taken before yourself. Both the deeds should be signed in the presence of a subscribing witness. When these deeds have been properly executed and returned to the Department, a cheque to the amount of $90 will be sent you in payment for this property. I shall be pleased if you will give this matter your early attention and arrange to have these deeds executed.\n\nIt is hoped that you can arrange to have the repairs to the building, which you were authorized to have carried out in official letter of November 24th, last, completed as soon as possible.\n\nYou should forward a requisition for the desks required, giving, if possible, the sizes and the number of each size. If you are unable to give the sizes of the desks, please state approximately the ages of the children. You will also kindly measure the wall space and state how many feet of blackboard will be required. Only a sufficient quantity of blackboard to meet the needs of the school should be asked for. As soon as we have this information regarding desks and blackboards, we will place the order here.\n\nKindly state whether it will be necessary to supply a teacher's desk and chair and a cupboard for storing school material. It may be that you can have a cupboard built locally by a carpenter and this would, no doubt, be cheaper.\n\nI may add that we would have enclosed a cheque in payment of the property, but we are not aware of the owner's name and, consequently, cannot draw a cheque in her favour until this information is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It will be necessary to obtain competitive prices, and the stove should be purchased from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nYou may also arrange for the erection of 2 outside toilets, and a porch and platform at the school building. It is noted that you estimate the cost of this work at approximately $150. The 2 toilets should be built at a sufficient distance from the school building. It is considered that separate buildings should be erected, and the approaches properly screened. If this work is done by day labour, proper time sheets should be kept. Any material required should be obtained after competitive prices are first secured. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangement you can to have the toilets erected and a porch and platform built to the school building.\n\nIt is noted that you have asked for prices on the material necessary to repair the building and have it fitted up for school purposes. On the 10th instant, we forwarded you a quit claim deed to be properly executed by the Indian woman who owns the property. As soon as this is signed by her, you should then take immediate steps to have the building placed in readiness for school purposes, as you have already been instructed.\n\nProperly certified vouchers should be forwarded covering any material purchased by you, and a memorandum should accompany your vouchers showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted by them. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should also be furnished for any labour engaged. It is expected that you will see no undue expenditure is incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

It is very nicely situated and with some repairs would make a suitable school-house. I offered the Indian who owns the building $70.00 for it subject to the approval of the Department and he will sell for that sum. The building is worth $100.00 being a pine log building built on a stone foundation. It will be necessary to build a brick chimney and the roof will have to be re-shingled also a new floor, some glass and the chinks between the logs require to be plastered up. It would also be well to whitewash the building inside and outside and believe that all these repairs can be accomplished at a cost of around $200.00. The labour can be procured on the island. The crossing can be made at all times of the year except in the fall when the river is freezing and in the spring at the break-up.\n\nNone of the officials of the Pine Lake Lumber Co. were in camp when I called so I could not take up the matter of voluntary assistance with them at this time.\n\nThe teacher could board at the boarding house or she could stay in the upper part of the school-house and board herself.\n\nI strongly recommend the purchase of this site as the school is urgently required and this building can be made suitable for school purposes within the cost designated in your letter. Trusting that this is satisfactory, I have the honour to be, Sir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find pay sheet for week ending Oct.10 being for work done on Lower French School. I should state that I reported this work finished in pay sheet for the first three days of week ending Oct.10. When paying Fall Interest payment at Pickeral the Chief told me that he thought that the men would be finished on Wednesday of week ending Oct.10 but he went out with a party and when he came back he found the men still working. They went ahead and lined the porch and the toilets and he had not taken into account the oiling of the building inside which had to be done at night so as not to interfere with the school hours. The time sheets are for all this work which was not calculated on by the Chief. I should say that I am well pleased with the work done.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to report that on a recent visit to Lower French School, on inspecting the outside of the school building, which is an old log building, I found that it is in need of repair. The window frames are so decayed that they will hardly hold the glass and in a few cases the glass is held by tacks. The inside of this building is only lately completely lined with British Columbia dressed V jointed fir with two coats boiled oil and it looks well. The log part of the building has to be lime-washed at least once a year to make it look decent. I would recommend that to modernize the lighting of the school, that a new lighting system be put in, that is that the school be lighted with the light coming over the left shoulder of the pupil and that for the preservation of the log part of the building that it be clap-boarded and given two coats of paint. Should permission for these needed repairs be granted the building would be good for school purposes for 25 or 30 years.\n\nThe enclosed is an estimated cost of material and labour for repairs as stated.\n\nTrusting that the Dept. will give this their earnest consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is an old log building. He recommends that new window frames be installed, some changes made in the position of the windows in order to have the light come over the left shoulder of the pupils, and the sides of the building clapboarded over the logs and given two coats of paint. The estimated cost of the work, including material and labour, is $551.90. He states that, should these repairs be carried out, this building would be good for school purposes for the next twenty-five or thirty years.\n\nI would add that last summer we built a teacher's residence in connection with this school, and it is desirable that the school building be repaired, painted and placed in good condition. Funds for the purpose can be provided from Band Funds. The interest to the credit of the Band at the present time amounts to $4,725.80 and to the credit of Capital Account, $48,840.16.

The interior of the building should be clapboarded and given two coats of paint. The lighting arrangements should be altered so that the light will come over the left shoulder of the pupils. New window frames should also be installed, and any other work required to place this building in good condition should be carried out.\n\nYou should arrange for the purchase of all material required after obtaining competitive prices, if possible, and you should also arrange for the labour required under the charge of a competent foreman. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept, a supply of which is enclosed herewith for the purpose. The estimate which you submitted for the material and labour to the amount of $51.90 should not be exceeded, and, if possible, it should be carried out at less expense. The Department will expect you to oversee the work and see that it is satisfactorily carried out. Should you require an advance to pay the labour, the same will be sent you upon request. You should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and time sheets, in duplicate, also properly certified, for the labour employed.\n\nPlease give the matter of these repairs your early attention in order that they can be completed before the school reopens after the present summer holidays.

Ferrier,\nSupt., Indian Education, Canada,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI have seen Miss Caspar settled in her school, and, if I am any judge of character, I think I have got a pretty fine teacher. She seems to be a student from the amount of books that she had, and it just happens that there is no place to keep books. Some of them are pretty well bound. She has asked me if she could have some shelving put up.\n\nShe is satisfied with the quarters, but I am afraid that we will have to get a couple of mattresses. You will remember that the mattresses were bought from the Pine Lake Lumber Company, and I know by remarks passed by my daughter that they must be getting pretty well through. I examined one of them. They are straw, and I would recommend that two flock mattresses would be bought as the straw is pretty well worn in the mattress there.\n\nI could get an Indian there to put up the shelving. It would only be plain inch shelving, and battens would not cost very much, with a little shellac to finish it off. I think it could be done inside of $10.00.\n\nYour early consideration will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Sup'tcy, Parry Sound\nOttawa, September 7th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th instant, I beg to say that you may incur an expenditure of approximately $10 in the erection of shelving at the Lower French River Indian Day School.\n\nYou may also purchase two mattresses for the teacher's living quarters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

INSPECTOR SCANLON,\ndated October 30th, 1928, on his in-\nspection of the LOWER FRENCH RIVER\nIndian Day School.\n\nOriginal on File 22-6-6.\n\n2 closets, should be screened and cleaned.\nThe grounds are rough and unfenced.\nOttawa, November 8, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Lower French River Indian Day School, recommends that the closets be cleaned and placed in a sanitary condition and that screened approaches be provided. He also states that the school grounds are rough and unfenced.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to have the closets thoroughly cleaned and placed in a sanitary condition before the extreme cold weather sets in. You may also arrange to have proper screened approaches erected. All costs should be kept as low as possible.\n\nWith reference to the levelling of the grounds and the fencing of same, it is considered that this matter could stand over until next spring. You should, at that time, draw the attention of the Department to this matter, giving full particulars as to the work required to be done in the levelling of the grounds, the quantity of fencing required, and the approximate cost of any work recommended by you to be carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nParry Sound, Ont.\nThe Secretary  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs,  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to yours of Nov. 8th 22-6-5 re the Separate School Inspectors report of the Lower French River Indian Day School. It would appear by the Inspector's report that the Agent was not on the job. I respectfully beg to differ with the Inspector about the sanitary condition of the closets. They were never intended to have screens on them and unless I get a direct order to put screens on, I wont do so.\n\nThe grounds of the school are very much better than the grounds of the Public School which is across the River. With all due respect to the Inspector I will do nothing to the levelling of the grounds at any time, and would suggest that Mr. Perrier the Superintendent of Indian Schools of the Department, or one of his officials would visit this school. I am proud of the fact that out of a log house, about seventy years old with the Department's help I have made a school that is fit for inspection by any inspector.\n\nThe idea of fencing the grounds or levelling them in any way is foolish in my estimation. I would like the Department to understand that I mean foolish.\n\nThe school is one of the most sanitary schools of any rural school in Ontario. I will welcome any of the Department officials to the School to come and inspect this school, grounds and toilets. Without any Inspector's advice this school was started and as stated before in my letter I am proud of this school. The children were like little rabbits when I went there, now they have been prepared and are on a fair way to receiving an education.\n\nI trust I will be understood by the Department, in these remarks, and before I am criticized I would like a member of the Department see the school and grounds before anything is done.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6140, File 403-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the report of the Separate School Inspector on his inspection of the Lower French River Indian Day School. The Department has noted your remarks regarding the sanitary condition of the closets and the erection of screened approaches, also with reference to the condition of the school grounds and the fencing of same.\n\nIn informing you of the Inspector's suggestions regarding the above, no censure of yourself in neglecting to attend to these matters was intended. It is noted you consider that conditions at the school are satisfactory. No further action need be taken regarding the Inspector's suggestions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

It would be absolutely necessary to get a boat for the purpose of the teacher ferrying over from Contin Island to the School. This boat is also used for bringing the children over to the school, from the mainland.\n\nSince my inspection, I have made enquiries about a boat owned by Mr. Graham of the Lumber and Ties Company, at Lower French. I have been in communication with him, and he informs me that he will sell his boat for $25.00. This boat, in my opinion is suitable and is a good bargain, and as it is in the storehouse at Pickeral there will be no freight to pay.\n\nI would recommend that the boat be purchased from Mr. Graham as it is absolutely necessary to have it right away. The consideration of the Department by return mail is urgently requested.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Before completing the purchase, you should see that the boat is in a good state of repair. Please prepare a voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of the boat.

M. DALY, ESQ., INDIAN AGENT,\nPARRY SOUND, ONT., DATED SEPTEMBER 26, 1931.\n\nWhile at Lower French School I looked the situation over re a boat and the dock. There is no dock there. There is a floating platform, which I must give Mrs. Munson credit for. She has had it moved down to the river. When I was there before it was high and dry. There are a lot of round boulders and the water is shallow where they have to land. As the water is low at the present time this is a good time to have this work done. I have given instructions that a place 12 feet wide be cleared and sufficiently far out in the river so that in the event of a blow coming up in the river the boat will be away from the rocks. I should explain that the river is wide here and squalls at this time of the year will come up and blow the boat away from the dock which causes it to hit these rocks. I observed that Mrs. Munson had the boat tied, bow and stern to the platform, but when the platform is floating it moves too, so you can quite easily understand how it is possible for a boat to be pounded against the rocks.\n\nI have satisfied Mrs. Munson that the boat will be seaworthy for this season, so will try to keep this expense down until next Spring, but it will be necessary to have a good boat next spring. I will make arrangements with Scotts Boat Livery for a good strong boat which has been very slightly used and that I can procure for $50.

I decided the cheapest way to build a shed here is to make a lean-to on the north side of the school, and so that all the building will be uniform it will have to be done with clapboards, no other sheeting used.\n\nAs it is so late in the season I would not attempt to paint it this year, and as I will be making application for the painting of the teacher's house for the March estimates, I think the woodshed will do all right without paint until then. Following is as close an estimate as I can get. I may be a little out in the transportation for the material from Parry Sound to Pickeral Station on the C.P.R., it will have to be trucked to the river and taken across the river. It may amount to more than $10.00 but I figure that $10.00 will cover it.\n\nMaterial.\nLumber. $65.00\nRock faced paroid roofing (green to match shingles) 10.50\nHinges, hasps and lock 6.11\n\nLabour.\n3 men for one week. 50.00\nTransportation of material 10.00\n\n141.61.\nI thought perhaps I could get along without putting up this woodshed, but I find that the Indians have been pilfering the wood, I think for use in the church and other places, and quite considerable of the wood has disappeared.\n\nI think the time is opportune to get this done now. I have taken the matter up with a young man who is living at Pickeral and understands this work, and who is unemployed at the present time. I think it would be a good chance to go ahead and get this work done now. I don't think we will ever be able to get it done as cheap as at the present time.\n\nWould the Department please let me know if we can go ahead with this work at the earliest opportunity?\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/BK.\n\nAgent.\nParry Sound, Ont., Oct. 15, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to report that after paying at the Lower French Reserve last night, a council meeting was held and the following resolutions passed.\n\nx x x\n\n(2) Moved by Adam Wickamakis\nSeconded by Ambrose Ashwasagai.\n\nThat the Department be asked to make arrangements through the Educational Department of the Department of Indian Affairs, for the caretaker of the school at Lower French Reserve, to ferry the children from the mainland to the school, on the Island. The number of children at the present time is seven, and three more are expected in the near future when they get clothes to go to school. The band think that the caretaker should get paid at the rate of $5.00 a month to ferry these children to and from the school. This was carried unanimously.\n\nIn connection with No. 2 resolution I have to state that I am very pleasantly surprised at the zeal of the parents at Lower French Reserve, to send their children to school. There are now 18 attending the school.\n\nI approve of both these resolutions.\n\nJohn M.

I examined this shed yesterday, it is finished and I am satisfied with the work done.\n\nWhile at Lower French, I had conversation with Mrs. Munson, whom I might state is getting along extraordinarily well both with the Indians and with the whites. There has been sufficient clapboards left there which would make a porch for the back door, which is on the north side of the house. This has always been a sore part with the teachers, having no protection from the north wind on that door.\n\nI would be in favour of a porch being built and as there is sufficient clapboards there to do it and we can get it done with cheap labour with the addition of flooring and roofing; this porch could be made very cheaply. Although I know that costs should be kept down, I think by doing this now we will be saving money. I think with the lumber required and the wages that the porch could be built for $85.00. I would strongly recommend that this be done.\n\nI have made arrangements for the cutting of the school wood, and will submit the bills for the wood when delivered and piled in the shed.

When she was in Ottawa during the recent Easter vacation, an officer of the Department and herself made a selection from a local firm that was on the list. Therefore, it will not be necessary for you to make any arrangements in this connection. It is understood that the boat and engine will be the property of the Department if Mrs. Munson leaves the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nOttawa, April 2, 1932.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nPursuant to 'phone conversation, I have requested you to deliver one Rosseau rowboat, painted, to Mrs. A. Munson, Pickerel, Ont. It is understood that the price will be $75.00, f. o. b. Peterboro. Your account, in duplicate, should be forwarded to Mrs. Munson, who is teacher of the Lower French River Indian Day School at Pickerel. Please attach to the account the freight receipt. Mrs. Munson, upon receipt of the boat, will certify to the account and forward it to Ottawa for payment.\n\nI have also to order one 3 horse power Johnson outboard engine, suitable for the above boat, which, I understand, you are now rebuilding. It is understood that the price will be $65.00, f. o. b. Ottawa. As soon as this engine is completed and properly tested, please ship to Mrs. Munson, as above. Your account, in duplicate, to which should be attached the freight receipt, should be forwarded to our Mr. Ferrier, 501 Booth Building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Peterboro, also one rebuilt Johnson 3 Horsepower, Outboard engine suitable for the above mentioned boat, price $65.00 f.o.b. Ottawa.\n\nThis to be shipped to Mrs. A. Munson, Pickerel, Ontario, Lower French River Indian Day School. The boat will be shipped immediately and the engine in the course of the next few days.\n\nTrusting this is in order, we remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE.C. MILLEN CO. LIMITED\n\nManager.\n\nE.C. Millen/P.M\nParry Sound, Ont.\nApril 4, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir;\n\nYours of April 1st, 22-6-5, received, re the decision of the Department, to co-operate with the teacher of the Lower French River Indian Day School, in the purchase of a boat and outboard engine.\n\nI note what the Department says that the boat and engine will be the property of the Department if Mrs. Munson leaves the school. Does that mean that the boat is not the property of the Department while Mrs. Munson is teacher? I would appreciate it very much if the Department would make this point clear.\n\nAm I to understand that there is to be an exception made, in the form of requisitioning by Mrs. Munson, the teacher at Lower French, and that she has the privilege of requisitioning either personally, by visiting the Department, or by correspondence.\n\nThe consideration of the Department will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, April 11, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your T-3537 of the 4th instant, with reference to the purchase of a boat and outboard engines for the Lower French River Indian Day School. Of course, this equipment is the property of the Department, even while the present teacher is at the school. Any equity which she may have when she leaves will be lost to her and the equipment will be entirely the Department's.\n\nRegarding the general question of requisitioning, the usual practice - and this includes the Lower French River Indian Day School - is for requisitions to be forwarded to the Indian agent. The Department makes exceptions whenever it sees fit to do so and gives whatever information is necessary to the Indian agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nParry Sound, Ont.\nApril 13, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir;\n\nYours of April 11th, 22-6-5 received for which I thank the Department very much. This puts me in a position whereby I can make arrangements with the caretaker for taking the children over from the mainland to the school in this boat.\n\nThat was the reason for my enquiring if the boat was under the jurisdiction of the Department. There was no desire on my part to question the actions of the Department. I am always ready at any time, to step to it when my superior officer gives the command.\n\nTrusting the Department will understand the meaning of my letter, it was in order to arrange for the transportation of the children from the mainland to the Lower French School, on Contint Island.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/EK.\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6140, File 403-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 25, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 3548 of the 13th instant, with reference to the new boat for the teacher at the Lower French River Indian Day School. The boat which the Department has purchased weighs only 130 pounds, and I doubt if it will be of much use for transporting children as a regular practice. Your letters of September 26th and October 15th, last, would indicate that the teacher's boat was not generally used for ferrying children. The Department's understanding is that the caretaker is paid at the rate of $5 a month for this service.\n\nThe boat which is supplied is really for the teacher at the school, but, of course, it can be used in emergencies for any legitimate departmental purpose. When making purchase, if the Department had had in mind the ferrying of the children, it would have been necessary to secure a much larger boat. As the ferrying arrangements had already been completed, it was the needs of the teacher largely that were considered when purchase was made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJohn M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\nParry Sound, Ont.\nApril 29, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to yours of April 25th, 22-6-5 re the boat for the use of the teacher at the Lower French Indian Day School, thanks very much for this information, because of arrangements made with the caretaker for the ferrying of the children at $5.00 a month for his services, I wanted to have this clear so that the caretaker would not be presuming to use this boat for that purpose.\n\nThe information contained in yours of April 25th, 22-6-5 is perfectly understood, and I will instruct the caretaker accordingly.\n\nAgain thanking you for the information as there was liable to be a little argument about this. Now there will be no argument as I will explain to the caretaker what he is to do.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher's requisition states that the stove in the classroom is very old and that the pipes are really dangerous. Your note states that the stove is satisfactory. Were you thinking of the stove in the teacher's residence by any chance? Please look into this at the first opportunity, replace the pipes and let the Department have a special report regarding the stove in the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

N. Fenn, Parry Sound, in connection with supplies for the Lower French Indian Day School, the reason for me incurring this expenditure of $1.00 for a soft ball, was because the teacher, Mrs. Munson, was very anxious to get a ball for a field day the Band were holding and there was really no time, from the time she asked me to get the ball for her, to send to the Department and receive a requisition in time, so I got the ball here to try and fulfil her requirements.\n\nThe ball was not authorized by official letter of May 13th. I realize that the playground equipment is supplied direct from the Department, and I had no intentions to, or never will, try to appropriate the rule of the Department. I intended to send a covering letter explaining all about this ball, but I have been busy, very busy, looking into relief cases and trying to straighten out a lot of the tangles in this Agency at the present time. There seems to be a lot of unrest among the Indians here which keeps me on the jump mostly all the time, so I forgot to send a covering letter.\n\nIf the Department cannot see their way clear to pay for this ball, and I would not blame them if they did, because I should have sent that covering letter, would they please drop me a little note to that effect, strike out the dollar on the form, and I will pay for it the same as I did for the swing at Moosa Deer Point. The Department has nothing\nto do with the swing because I promised that to\nthe children myself, but this ball was requested\non the bounce and was sent out on the bounce, but\nthere was no intention on my part of bouncing the\nDepartment.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/BK.\nINFORMATION\n\nDATE\n\nAMOUNT\n\nAuthorized by Dept. letter No. 82-6-5 dated July 18/32.\n\nTo materials required for fixing drain at teachers house Lower French School.\n\nTRIPPLICATE FOR FILE\n\nVoucher in duplicate detached for Accountant to pay.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 109\n\nIndian Affairs.

She made application for a reading lamp and seemed disappointed that she did not get it. I told her that the Department was cutting down expenses and I did not think she would be able to get the lamp as she apparently could get along without it. She said she would requisition for it again.\n\nShe also asked for Cod Liver Oil for the children, and she has a line of talk which apparently is quite interesting so far as her care of the children is concerned. I told her the Doctor looked after these things, but that I would notify the Department of her wishes. She also informed me that the Inspector, Mr. Bennett had been there and was delighted with her work. I was remembering the advice that I got while at the Department while talking to her, and it was just as well, because she has a line of talk that I would not put up with for five minutes. I do not know how she talks any time she has been at the Department, but if she talked to the officials of the Department the way she talks to me, I am sure they would find that they were not hardly required, she can get along without any person.\nI will appreciate it very much if the Department will have another place for this woman, at the end of the June term. She is not at all suitable for this Agency.\n\nAll arrangements have been made for the housing of the boat, and it is just possible there might be a small fee asked. There was not any fee asked, but it was hinted to me that there might be a small fee asked for the housing of the boat for the winter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\n\nJMD/EK.\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n**Date:** December 17, 1932\n\n**For:** Lower Trent River School, Barry Sound Agency\n\n**NOTE:** Teachers should secure from the Department of Education, of the Province in which the Indian School is located, a list of the text books authorized for use in the white schools.

On December 8th I wrote to Mrs. Munson sending her an order to purchase goods to the value of $4.00 for the Christmas Tree, and stated that the grant was reduced because of lack of funds.\n\nI received a letter dated Dec. 6th, from Mrs. Munson with bill enclosed for $5.00 for Case of Oranges $2.00; 1 box apples $2.00 and candy $1.00. I am still waiting for an itemized bill in triplicate for $4.00 for Christmas Tree fund.\n\nI take this opportunity of asking the Department if they do not think it advisable to refer the teacher of the Lower French School, Mrs. Munson to this office for any bills that are due her, and in that way I think she would get quicker service, because I could explain to her what is required. My experience is that she needs a lot of explaining, but I feel that I am quite capable of explaining to her. The reason for me being so particular is because of the presumption of Mrs. Munson to go ahead and make expenditures without the sanction of the Department.\nEnclosed please find copy of the bill, please note the footnote on the bill.

(RG 10, Volume 6140, File 403-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 10th, 1935.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI inspected the Parry Sound Agency on the 25th-26th ultimo and beg to submit the following report.\n\nLower French River School\n\nNeeds painting. If possible this should be done this summer. The front steps are badly worn and should be replaced. A cupboard for the classroom is needed badly. There is no accommodation whatever for school supplies.\n\nThos. Mc Cookin.\nInspector.\nOttawa, May 20, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, who recently visited the Lower French River Indian Day School, states that the school building needs painting and that, if possible, the work should be done this summer.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to a previous communication regarding the painting required at the Ryerson Indian Day School, in which you were informed the Department would have no funds to carry out any painting of school buildings during the present fiscal year.\n\nThe Inspector further reports that the front steps are badly worn and should be replaced, also that a cupboard for the classroom is required, as there is no accommodation whatever for school supplies. I would request that you forward an estimate of the cost of replacing or repairing the front steps and the installing of a cupboard in the classroom. If this work is authorized, it could be carried out during the coming summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nDear Mr. Daly,\n\nYou have asked me to keep you posted on such matters so, in your information, I wish to advise that there has been no ferrying of the children from the other side as yet this year. Moreover, the caretaker, Mr. Gailwayogai, has made no attempt to ferry the children.\n\nIn his position as Trustee, I asked him to speak to the parents about sending their respective children just as soon as their health would permit (they have had severe colds). Instead of conveying this message or speaking in a way befitting a Trustee Officer, he apparently informed them that \"there were not enough children crossing to bother about and that he was not taking so few for nothing, it didn't pay.\" He had already told me the same thing, so then I called on the families personally and told them to send the\nchildren to the point as soon as Monday morning and I would ferry them myself back and forth for as long as it was necessary.\n\nThis is not a practical thing to steady diet because the boat is too light in construction for children bouncing in and out but managing it myself, I can probably keep them from being too rough.\n\nTom has always disliked the ferrying of the children, has balked on it constantly, suggesting that the parents take the job. He has been in Bechuanon all this week so beginning Monday, I shall ferry the children for as long as necessary.\n\nWould you also please make arrangements for having the dock reinforced?\n\nAlso, how about my stove; I would like you to have a look at it, I believe it will need new gaskets as well as its new lining?\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6140, File 403-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir;\n\nEnclosed please find a letter received from Mrs. Munson, School Teacher, at Lower French Indian Day School. I cannot understand why Thomas Gakosheyongai would act in this manner because I know that he is getting goods in the store on the strength of the money that will be coming to him for ferrying.\n\nI have written to Mrs. Munson telling her that the most important part of this transaction is to get the children ferried across the river, and that if Gakosheyongai does not function it will be all right for her to look after the children.\n\nI am arranging for supplying seed to the various Bands, and as soon as I get through with that I will take a trip up to Lower French Reserve and endeavour to find out what the trouble is, when I will further inform the Department of the situation.\n\nWould the Department please say if Mr. McGookin reported about the stove. When I looked at the stove it appeared to me that it required new brick lining. Mrs. Munson thinks that it might need new grates. If the Department will grant the requisition for this, I will have the matter looked after at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/EM\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, May 23, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing a communication received from Mrs. Munson, teacher of the Lower French River Indian Day School, regarding the ferrying of the children. It is noted that, if Thomas Gallesheyongai does not attend to his duties in ferrying the children, you have instructed Mrs. Munson to arrange to perform this service.\n\nYou were written on the 20th instant regarding Mr. McGookin's report. Besides furnishing an estimate of the cost of repairing the front steps and installing a cupboard, you should also forward an estimate of the cost of the repairs required to the stove, after you have had an opportunity of examining same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir:\n\nReplying to yours of May 20th 22-6-5,\n\nre the visit of Inspector McCookin to the Lower French Indian Day School, and his recommendation re the painting of the school, teacher's house, and toilets, the Department promised to send me a list of the schools this year that would be painted, but I presumed according to the grant, that this work could not be done this year. I would like to state for the information of the officials of the Department, that it is really time that these schools were painted but we will endeavour to get along without it this year.\n\nRe the front steps at the school being in need of repair, as this is just a small platform, I will endeavour to get enough lumber around there, and get it patched up to do for the present and later on when there are more funds we will get a new platform made.\n\nRe a cupboard being required for accommodating school supplies, there is a desk in the school with drawers which is quite suitable for holding the books and can be used for that purpose. Later on when there are more funds we can have a small cupboard made from tongue and groove lumber. In the meantime, I think we can get along without any expense.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/BK.\nOttawa, May 27, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding the repairs required to the front steps of the Lower French River Indian Day School and the installing of a cupboard.\n\nIt is noted that you will arrange to have the repairs carried out to the steps and also that it will not be necessary to supply a cupboard at the present time. When the repairs have been completed to the steps, you should forward vouchers, in triplicate, properly certified, covering any expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir;\n\nReplying to yours of May 23rd, 22-6-5 re the ferrying of the children to the school at Lower French Reserve, this matter has been settled up, and I found on arriving at Lower French that the dock and all the complaints that had been made were not exactly correct, and that the teacher and the caretaker Thomas Gaikeshayongai, were co-operating to give service.\n\nRe the repairs to the step, I have to state that in mine of May 22nd, T.-5165, I reported that I had instructed the caretaker to use some lumber that is up there to fix up the step.\n\nWe can also get along without a cupboard, as stated in mine of May 22nd, T.-5165.\n\nRe the repairs, to the stove; What is required is a brick lining and a shaker handle, the total cost of which should not exceed $5.00. The merchant cannot give me the exact amount. The caretaker can take out the burned brick and replace it with the new.\n\nI am trying to the best of my ability to keep down expenses, and trust that this will be understood by the Department, and that the requisition will come through for the brick at the earliest convenience of the Department. I am ordering same from the merchant as on examination I find that the brick in the stove is burned through in a number of places.\nTrusting this will be satisfactory, as the merchant assures me that the cost will not exceed $5.00\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn McIlwain\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, May 30, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, regarding the repairs required to the stove at the Lower French River Indian Day School. It is noted that a brick lining and a shaker handle are required, at a cost of approximately $5. You may incur the expenditure necessary in having the repairs required carried out and in supplying the shaker handle. An account, in triplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the cost.\n\nIt is noted you have arranged to have the repairs required to the steps carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As you are aware a new teacher has just taken over there and naturally finds a considerable shortage of supplies. Some of the items on the requisition may not be regularly supplied by the Department and if so these may be crossed off.\n\nThe requisition sheets showing requirements for the teacher's residence are rather heavy but a great many of the articles required there had been personal property of the former teacher and were carried away by him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nNovember 4, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo you may purchase the following articles for use at the Lower French River Indian Day School:\n\n- 4 Tea towels\n- 4 Hand towels\n- 3 Yds. table oilcloth\n- 1 Butter dish\n- 2 Qts. white enamel\n- 2 Padlocks\n- 1 Alarm clock\n- 1 Axe\n- 1 Enamel double boiler\n- 1 \" saucepan\n- 1 \" pudding dish\n- 3 Table spoons\n- 6 Cups & saucers\n- 3 Soup plates\n- 3 Bowls\n- 5 Tumblers\n- 1 Teapot\n- 1 Pudding dish\n- 1 Wash tub\n- 1 Water pail\n- 1 Dust mop\n- 1 Stove lifter\n- 1 Poker\n\nWith regard to the sheets, blankets and bedspread I may say that the Department does not supply these articles for teachers' residences.

It has been suggested that the school and teacher's residence could be moved bodily across the ice during the winter. This would be an expensive job and I am not sure that it would not be just as well, if any move were considered, to erect new buildings. In the present state of public finances I do not like to recommend such an expenditure but it is a fact that the present situation of the school has a good deal to do with its poor attendance record.\n\nSamuel Devlin\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 6, 1943.\n\nEXD.\n\nMr. S. Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, in connection with the Lower French River Indian Day School. There will be no funds available in next year's appropriation for the erection of a new building.\n\nHowever, the Department is interested in the possibilities of moving the present buildings to a new site. You should make immediate inquiries and advise me at what cost you could have the two buildings moved and also the best date to move them. It is just possible that Mr. Arneil, Inspector of Indian Agencies, will have an opportunity of visiting your Agency within the next few weeks, but the information requested in the first part of this letter should be supplied immediately in order that we may discuss the matter further with Mr. Arneil before he goes to Parry Sound.\n\nR.A.

Devlin\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to your conversation with our Mr. Smith, we are prepared to undertake the job of moving the Indian Day School and teacher's residence from their present site on Contin Island to a new site to be designated by you on the mainland of the Lower French Reserve. The transfer of the buildings to be carried out by us before the ice leaves the Pikelel River this Spring. We agree to do this job for a maximum price of two hundred dollars ($200.00).\n\nYours truly,\n\nBill Clark Francis, Limited\nPer: [signature]\nBranch Manager\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nFile No. 22-6-5.\n\nReferring to your letter of January 6 with reference to a change of site for the Lower French River Indian Day School, I have been endeavouring to interest some responsible party in the job of moving the school buildings to a site on the mainland.\n\nTrottier Bros., who were in the lumbering business at that point, had been promising to undertake the job and give me an estimate of cost, but their business has recently been taken over by their principals, Hill Clark Francis Limited, as Trottier Bros. have become insolvent. I talked with their local manager, Mr. Smith, while on a visit to the Reserve yesterday and he advised me that there should be a period in their operations shortly when they would have some men and teams available and he would be glad to undertake the job of moving the school. He is of the opinion that the sum of $200.00 would cover all contingencies and I am enclosing herewith his written offer to carry out the transfer of the buildings for that sum.\n\nHowever, after talking to him, I discussed the proposed move, before leaving the Reserve, with some of the older Indians there and they advise me that the building was at least sixty years old, having been originally a log building, which had been, within comparatively recent years, renovated to serve as a schoolhouse by clapboarding on the outside and a matchboard finish on the inside. This being the case, there is a possibility that the old timbers in the\nbuilding may have decayed to such an extent that it would collapse if it were jacked up for moving. The only way we could prove this would be to start the process of jacking up the building and, if we found that it was unsafe to continue, we could let it remain on the present site.\n\nAttendance at this school has been very poor during the winter, due to the extraordinary weather conditions which have prevailed and there is no question but that if the school were on the mainland the situation would be greatly improved.\n\nI would be glad to have your further advice on this as quickly as possible, as the time during which the building could be moved across the ice is now limited.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 27, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. S. Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to changing the site of the Lower French River Indian Day School. I feel that you should immediately commence the process of jacking up the building with a view to ascertaining if it can be moved. If so, you may make arrangements with Hill Clark Francis Limited to move it. It is noted that in the event of the building being moved the total expenditure will not exceed $200.00.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT ON PARRY SOUND INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, 1943.\n\nSchool attendance has been more than usually bad during the winter, due largely to the exceptional snow fall and cold weather. I am glad to be able to note that during the month a teacher was obtained for the Ryerson day school on the Parry Island Reserve. This school had been closed since last June and as it serves a good number of pupils, I am glad to see it in action again. There is a scheme on foot also to have the school buildings on the Lower French Reserve moved from their present site on Contin Island over to the mainland, which, if we can manage it, should make an improvement in the school attendance at that point.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 3, 1943.\n\nMr. S. Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ont.\n\nOn March 27 last I wrote to you and authorized you to move the Lower French River School to a new site. On reviewing our files I do not appear to have heard anything further from you since that time. Please let me know what action you took in this matter.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nFile No. 22-6-5.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 3 with reference to moving the Lower French Reserve Day School to a new site. I had been under the impression that I had made a report on this matter some time ago but find that I have overlooked doing so and tender apologies.\n\nThe only chance of moving this school is across the ice during the winter. I had made arrangements with a lumber concern operating in the neighborhood who were the only available parties capable of doing the job, to have this carried out and they proposed to do it in the early spring, when their bush work would be completed and they would have the necessary horses and equipment available. It happened, however, that by the time they were prepared to undertake the job, ice conditions in the River made it impossible.\n\nI propose to take the matter up again at the next suitable opportunity.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI request an advance of $84.90 to pay for alterations to the Moses Missabie house on the Lower French Reserve which I have been fitting up to serve as a school house. This considerably exceeds my estimate of $50.00 for this job but a number of items developed in the course of repair work which had not been foreseen.

This building formed the sole assets of the estate of the late Moses Missable of the Heney Inlet Band, whose heirs are Lot Missable aged 20 and Grace Missable aged 17. Lot Missable is now in the Canadian Army overseas and his sister Grace was, until recently, a pupil of the Chapleau Residential School from where she was discharged last year and a situation found for her, I believe, in Ottawa.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I believe that the proper procedure would be to put this rental money in savings for these two minors until they attain their majority or wish to claim it. A savings account is already established for Grace Missable, into which her Annuity and Interest payments have been paid since her father's death.\n\nI am therefore enclosing vouchers covering the rental of the building up to the end of the fiscal year which I hope is the correct procedure.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Canada\n\nAuthority is requested for the following expenditures for the Lower French Day School:\n\n75 lin.ft. 1 x 6 Pine D4S 6.50\n300 ft. B.M. 2 x 8 Hemlock 15.00\n1 Window sash 4lt. 12 x 24 4.50\n1 Window frame 4.50\n4 Padlocks 2.00\nNails 1.50\nLabour 15.00\n\n$69.00\n\nThe school inspector has recommended that another window should be cut in this building as the lighting is bad. A bridge over a small creek in front of the school for which the 2 x 8 plank is required has been broken down by stray horses and is in a dangerous condition.\n\nSamuel Devlin\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, September 16, 1944.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ont.\n\nRe: Repairs, Lower French Day School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 9th instant, in which you submit a list of supplies which appear to be necessary for the repair of the above-noted school.\n\nIt will be acceptable to the Department if you make the best possible local arrangement for these purchases and also the planks which appear to be required for the repair of the bridge.\n\nWe appreciate very fully the difficulty experienced by our agents these days in securing the help necessary for the repair of schools. May we express the hope that these repairs will be undertaken in the future during the regular holiday period.\n\nR. A.

Re: Lower French School.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 16 and am obliged for your authority to me to make these necessary repairs.\n\nI might explain that it was not possible to have this done during the summer holidays as the only Indian at this point capable of doing the work was engaged all during the summer as a guide.

Some of these estimates may appear high but the fact is that various repairs which were put off during the war years have accumulated.\n\nThe largest amount is for the Gibson Day School, the bulk of which is for fencing the school grounds and the erection of two new toilets. Authority was granted last year for these toilets to the amount of $112.00. I was unable to proceed with the work last year due to both the shortage of material and labour. I propose, if possible, to have it done this summer but a review of the situation shows the costs to be considerably increased due to prices of both material and labour.\n\nI would be glad to have these costs for the various schools passed if at all possible but should it not be possible to pass on the amounts requested because of non-inclusion in the estimates, you might indicate what amounts would be available for expenditure on the various schools and I will have as much as possible completed this year and the balance next year.

(RG 10, Volume 6140, File 403-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI am requested to obtain transportation daily for Marion Beaucage, daughter of Mrs. Frank Missabie of the Henvey Inlet Band. The situation is that these people are living at French River and this child is attending our Indian Day school at Pickerel on the Lower French Reserve. The distance between the two points is about five miles and the girl travels down on the morning train and back in the afternoon after school.\n\nI understand that the Provincial authorities have some method of handling this in the case of white pupils and would be obliged if you could advise me as to how it might be managed in our case.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Superintendent.\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Parry Sound, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of May 17th with reference to payment of transportation of Marion Beaucage.\n\nThis is an unusual case and while the cost is probably small, we may be setting a precedent if we approve.\n\nIs she the only Indian child that finds it necessary to use train transportation to and from school daily? In what grade is she? Is there a white school closer to her home at which she could attend?\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Doctor Bennett:\n\nYour letter of May 12th was awaiting me when I returned from a recent inspection trip on Manitoulin Island.\n\nI visited the Spanish School and had a chance to talk to Harry Whiskeychan. He seems to be quite happy there and his only worry is that he be given an opportunity of visiting his parents on Hudson Bay this year. I am taking this matter up with the Indian Health Service to see if this can be arranged.\n\nI am writing to our local Agent with regard to your letter and plan about the Pickerel school. Our big problem there is that undoubtedly the Indian Affairs Committee is going to recommend that we do not in future build separate Indian schools where Provincial schools are available. This is, of course, confidential as yet but the tendency is to have the Indian children educated as much as possible along with whites with whom they are going to have to live in future years. However, each situation has to be considered as a separate problem and we will certainly do what we can at Pickerel.\n\nWe have just had our new salary schedule approved by Treasury Board. Teachers with second class certificates will have a range of from $1,440. to $1,920. Teachers with first class certificates will have a range\nof from $1,500. to $2,220. If you run across any Catholic teachers who are interested in teaching Indians, either in Ontario or in the West, I would be only too glad to have you give them my address so that I can send them application forms.\n\nWe are particularly short of Catholic teachers in British Columbia and are only too glad to have teachers with certificates granted by such a fine province as Ontario.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nJ.M. Bennett, M.A., Ph.D.,\nInspector of Separate Schools,\n47 Browning Ave.,\nToronto 6, Ontario.\n\nBFN/MGD\nSuggestions for building Indian School at least possible cost.\n\n1. One floor only.\n\n2. No cellar - concrete foundation at least 3 ft. below ground level and 1/2 ft. above with small screened air holes to keep air dry under the floor and keep animals out (mice, etc.).\n\n3. Use undressed 2\" x 6\" planks for joice about one ft. apart to assure a solid floor and braced.\n\n4. A double floor with building paper between (spruce flooring and well painted (3 coats) unless you can get hardwood or square tile which we now use in Toronto.\n\n5. (a) Studding, dressed\n   (b) Use hemlock undressed, if you wish on the studs. Then building paper and then the outside siding which could be dressed siding or imitation insul board to assure a warm room.\n\n6. The inside walls to be ten test or donnacona board and stripping over the seams, but not beaver board (which they used at Christian Island). Same for ceiling. This ten test will keep the heat in the room and will assure a cooler room in hot weather.\n\n7. Have a good brick chimney.\n\n8. A box stove will give plenty of classroom heat.\n\n9. Roofing - use asphalt squares on shiplap.\n\n10. Ordinary classroom windows will do since the attendance isn't large and it will be easier to heat. While it is an excellent idea to have the most possible window space yet that isn't necessary with a small enrolment as this school will have.\n\n11. Have space between kitchen and bed-sitting room about 7 ft. wide to assure heat in the bedroom. A good kitchen range set midway would heat both rooms.\n\n12. Build a woodshed at the same time to save cordwood from deterioration by the weather and in one corner of it build the teacher's toilet to one side of the entrance.\n**RETURN OF LABOUR** on the **Repairing School Platform and Steps** on **Lower French Reserve**\n\nfor week ending **May 15, 1948.**\n\n| NAMES          | Nature of Employment or Trade | Mon | Tues | Wed | Thurs | Fri | Sat | TOTAL | PRICE PER | AMOUNT OF WAGES | RECEIVED PAYMENT | WITNESS |\n|----------------|-------------------------------|-----|------|-----|-------|-----|-----|-------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|---------|\n| Harry McQuabbie| Labourer                      | 8   | 6    |     |       |     |     | 14     | 60        | 8 40            |                  |         |\n\n---\n\nCheque No. ...........................................

Hardwood flooring requires to be laid where the teacher's platform was taken out last year and the porch on the building needs considerable repair.\n\nAt the Lower French School the woodshed has collapsed and will require to be rebuild entirely.

The Band passed a resolution some time ago asking the Dept. to purchase a log house for the use of the teacher with about one acre of ground but since then they have decided that they want to build a house on the school grounds. I approve of this and I think that the Dept. might be able to buy rough lumber cheap as the Pine Lake Lumber Co. are going out of business.\n\nTrusting that this will meet with the approval of the Dept.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn M. Daly,\nAgent.\nOttawa, October 1, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the Resolution of the Henvey Inlet Band in which they request the Department to erect a house for the teacher of the Lower French River school at Contin Island, I beg to say that it will be necessary to furnish further particulars regarding the building desired.\n\nPlease state the size and type of the building you would recommend to be erected as a residence, the approximate cost of the material and labour.\n\nWe note that the rough lumber required may be obtained at a cheap price from the Pine Lake Lumber Co., who are retiring from business. Please state whether you could arrange for the purchase of the material and for the labour, also whether you would advise this work to be proceeded with this fall.\n\nWhen we have further information, consideration will then be given as to whether the work can be authorized or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

I have included a cellar in the building because a small pipeless furnace can be used which is the most economical for heating purposes. I would draw your attention to the fact that this District will soon be back to its original state and in my opinion, it's advisable to have a comfortable home for the teacher, to get the best results. This building, as I see it finished, will be about the same as the one at Shawanaga except that it will have a cellar which will do for storing wood and will thus do away with the necessity of having a wood-shed. There is need for a wood-shed for the school and this could be built at the same time at very little cost, as a lean-to to the school. I should state that the Band are very desirous of going ahead with the work and I am assured by the Chief and Council that they will make a Bee to help keep down the cost of labour. If they do this, the labour bill will not amount to $300.00 as quoted. I will be prepared to go ahead as soon as the Dept. says so. The members of the Band are awaiting the orders of the Dept. to start right away.\n\nTrusting that this may receive the careful consideration of the Dept. and assuring them that I will give my best to see that a good job is done at the least possible cost.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAgent.\nOctober 17, 1925.\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nThe boarding house where the teacher of the Lower French River Indian Day School has resided heretofore has been closed indefinitely, due to the cessation of the operations of a lumber company. Mr. Indian Agent Daly strongly recommends that a small residence be built for the use of the teacher. The Indians of the Band have agreed to have a bee and the Agent can secure rough lumber quite cheap. Mr. Daly is of the opinion that he can erect a suitable building for approximately $550.\n\nThis day school is not important enough to warrant the provision of a good teacher's residence; and, as it is extremely desirable that some facilities be secured without delay, I wish to recommend that he be authorized to proceed with the work. Funds can be found in the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSept. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, October 17, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your T-576 of the 12th instant, with reference to a teacher's residence at the Lower French River Indian Day School. I note that you can purchase rough lumber, the necessary hardware, cement, etc., arrange for considerable labour on the part of the Band without cost and keep the total expense down to about $600. You may proceed with the work and explain to the Indians of the Band that authority is being directed because you and they are interested in getting the residence erected. They should give their labour freely, so that no unnecessary expense will be incurred.\n\nI note that you can secure rough lumber very cheaply at Pickerel. If you are satisfied that better prices could not be secured, it will not be necessary to call for tenders in the regular way. Before purchasing cement, hardware, etc., you should secure prices locally and give the business to the firm quoting the lowest. When you are submitting certified accounts, in duplicate, attach thereto memoranda showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted. If any expert labour is required, you should so inform the Department and an accountable cheque will be directed to you, with time sheets, which should be kept in duplicate showing the receipts of the workman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

We reopened school again Monday May 18.\n\nWe are endeavouring to make up the time lost during the breaking-up of\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nMay 12, 1926.\n\nR.T. Ferrier Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nPlease find report of conditions of ice on the Pickeral River, which explains the situation fairly well. When I was paying the Spring payment, the ice was so poor that the Chief asked me to stop the Teacher from crossing over as it was dangerous. That morning the Teacher crossed and went over her rubbers, which were knee high. (I am explaining) I look for service from the teachers and I get it but in this case the teacher cannot give the proper service unless she have her own house on the Island.\n\nWhen I made arrangements with the Indians about the teacher's house, they all said that they would build it on the community or barn-raising plan. I now find that they had no intention of doing so. The material is on the ground and part of the cellar is dug and I am starting two men on Thursday to go ahead. The only way I can build it now is by day labour. I have a bad cold at present and the Doctor says I'm to stay in bed for a few days, (I am not in bed) but I am trying to get clear of it. As soon as I can get around, I intend to go up to Pickeral for a week and get them started with some vim.\n\nI would like, Mr. Ferrier, if you or some of the staff could pay us a call before this season closes or soon after the schools start in the Fall. I am persuaded that even with the good understanding and co-operation between this Agency and your Dept., that a better understanding of the difficulties to surmount in this Agency could be obtained by a visit.\n\nPlease do not think that we do not think that we don't get enough consideration. We have no complaint and are proud to serve your Dept. and would only like you or one of the staff to see the work that we are doing to further the interest of Education among the Indians under our care. Please say if I may put on a force of men and get the work started as soon as possible.\n\nTrusting that the situation will be understood from this communication.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6140, File 403-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 15, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with enclosure, concerning the difficulties at the Lower French River Indian Day School and explaining the failure of the Indians to erect the teacher's residence. It is possible that the funds to the credit of the Band would stand the labour costs; but, before authority is given, I should be grateful if you would estimate what further expenditure will be necessary.\n\nI am not sure of my plans for the summer but will bear in mind that you are desirous of a general inspection of the day schools in your agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReplying to yours of the 15th inst., 22-6-8, re-teachers' house at Lower French Reserve, I have to state that I have two men now working on the excavation for the foundation. The material, as stated in mine of recent date, is on the ground and has been there since Fall and I am anxious to have the building up before the tourist season starts as I can get the labour cheaper then.\n\nAs near as I can estimate, the labour will cost in the neighbourhood of $300.00. I can get a furnace installed for $150.00, which is remarkably cheap in this part of the country, the reason is because it was in use for a year and is being replaced by a hot water system. It's a good furnace, better than new as it has been tested. Please say if I can get it as the man wants to know as he is waiting for a man coming from Toronto who he thinks will buy it.\n\nI am going up to Pickeral this week and would be obliged if you could assist me in laying out my programme for having the building completed.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that you intend to have this work completed at an early date and that at the present time you have men working on the excavation for the foundation.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your having this building completed by day labour. I enclose herewith cheque No. 1641 for $300 to cover the cost of the labour. You should keep proper time sheets, in duplicate, for the labour employed. These sheets you should have signed by the individual workmen, and they should be certified by you. When the work is completed, you should forward the time sheets in accounting for the cheque sent you. The Department will rely on you to see that no unnecessary expenditure is incurred in the labour employed.\n\nIf you are satisfied that the furnace referred to in your letter will be satisfactory, and the amount of the purchase price to be the most advantageous, you may arrange for its purchase and installation, and forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred for the purpose.\n\nWe understand that sufficient material was laid on the ground last fall for the erection of this building.\n\nA supply of time sheets for the labour will be sent you under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The work so far is satisfactory. While inspecting the excavating, I found that we can get a good well in the basement of the building. I have given the men instructions to dig for water which they will use for mixing their cement. I purpose putting a pump in and having it in the kitchen of the house. Please say if this meets with your approval.\n\nI am arranging to send bricks for the chimney on next week's freight, as I am buying them from Nobel, second hand. I could not get them when the ice was on the River therefore transportation costs a little more. As far as possible, I will endeavour to keep down costs. Outside of the labour question, up to the present time, I have good value for the money spent.\n\nMr. Fraser, manager of the Pine Lake Lumber Co., has offered some furniture for sale. They are selling out the contents of the boarding house. I have looked at a couple of beds, springs and mattresses and a few other things, which will have to be bought. I can get them at a reasonable price and have asked him to put them aside for me, pending the approval of the Dept., which he has done.\n\nPlease say if I can buy the necessary furniture this way.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

We note that this work is well under way, also that you have instructed the men working on the building to dig a well in the basement. Your action in this matter is approved and you may arrange for the purchase and installation of a pump in the kitchen.\n\nIt is further noted that you have arranged for the forwarding of the bricks required for the building of a chimney, obtaining the same second hand.\n\nRelative to the obtaining of second hand furniture from the Pine Lake Lumber Co., I beg to say that if you are satisfied that the beds, springs, mattresses and other supplies considered by you to be necessary, are in a satisfactory condition and can be obtained at a reasonable price, you may arrange for the purchase of same.

I have cut their wages five cents an hour to try to make the appropriation of $500.00 for labour on the building, spin out, but I'm sure that they won't finish in the time they said they would.\n\nIt was expected that they would have four or five \"Bees,\" but up to the present time they haven't had any, and I'm sure they never intended to have any.

Ferrar for installation of a hot air furnace, etc., at the teacher's residence on the Lower French River Reserve, and in reply I beg to direct your attention to the following remarks, namely:\n\nThe freight charge of $1.42 on the water tank should be supported by a receipt. A receipt should be supplied also in support of the express charge of $2.20 on plumbing tools, and the item \"\u00bd of fare Parry Sound-Pickerel\" should be explained.\n\nExpenses incurred in connection with this residence are large. Your estimate made in October, 1925, of $600.00 has been much exceeded. The vouchers before the Department indicate that labour has cost $583.65, material $1,215.76, and furnishings $241.59, making a total expenditure of $2,046.00.\n\nYou should report without delay stating whether you propose to present any further accounts in connection with this building for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

I think the account should be paid less the items 1/2 fare Parry Sound to Federal and $2.20 on plumbing tools, as Mr. Ferrar did all the work on the one trip when he installed the furnace. The price of furnace included installing of same.\n\nI note you consent on the expenses of this building. I explained to Mr. Ferrar on my recent visit to Ottawa, about my worries about this building costing more than the estimate. Nevertheless, the building is there and is fit for inspection. Only by being with the Indians every day would I know for anything they could say about helping with community work. A lot of this work had to be torn down and rebuilt. I explained all this to Mr. Ferrar.\n\nAll the bills in this connection are now submitted.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

The total cost of this job is $2042.06 - $392.06 of which was paid from School Vote, and the balance $1650.00 paid from the Band fund, Account 13.\n\nAnalysis of the vouchers paid from Trust Fund shows that labour was $588.65, building material $319.76 and furnishings $241.89.\n\nWhen this building was started it was decided that the band could pay $450.00, and anything over this would be chargeable to School Vote, and I presume that the band funds can now be recouped for expenditure over that amount from the Vote for Indian Education.\n\n11th January, 1927.\nEXTRACT FROM REQUISITION OF MARCH 14TH, 1927,\nfor supplies for the Lower French River\nIndian Day School.\n\nOriginal on File 22-6-4.\n\n\"For teacher's house:-\n\n| Item                          | No. required |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| Reading lamp                  | 1            |\n| Potato steamer (3 piece)      | 1 set        |\n| Cooking Bowls (heavy glass)   | set of 5     |\n| Broom                         | 1            |\n| Garden Rake                   | 1            |\n\nIndian Affairs.

There were four feet of water\nin the cellar, before they were able to get the water\nout and there was about six inches of water in it\nwhen I examined it. It appears to me that the Indians\nmade a poor mixture of cement on the lower part or\nfirst part of the wall. The top part is good cement\nbut I can't be sure whether it was the water that did\nthe damage or not. It's a sorry looking mess and\nbefore doing anything to it, the ground, north and\neast of the foundation will have to be tiled to carry\naway the water. It appears that in building, we have\nblocked a series of springs, at least that is what the\nIndians say. In the meantime, nothing can be done\nuntil the water stops. I would suggest that it be\nleft until the repairs to the school are made in June,\nthen I could arrange to go up there with a man who\nunderstands cement work and get it fixed up.\n\nI need hardly say that I am annoyed about this\nbut it is something that I could not foresee. I sinc-\nerely trust that I am wrong about the first part of\nthe cellar being a poor mixture\u2014meantime, I have my\ndoubts. I should state that the house is built on a\nslope. The top of the north wall, being about 10\"\nabove the level of the ground, the ground gradually\nsloping until there is about 5 ft of the south wall\nabove ground.\nOttawa, March 29, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to the damage caused to the teacher's residence at the Lower French River Day School.\n\nIf there is no danger of the building collapsing, I believe that the repairs should be left until June, when, no doubt, you can arrange to have the work done at a reasonable cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Fann, Parry Sound, Ont., for Supplies for Lower French Indian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 22-6-4 dated Oct. 2, 1929, and 22-6-8 dated Sept. 28/23.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI was at Lower French school the other night, and was surprised and annoyed at the condition of the furnace in the teacher's house. Perhaps you will remember that I spoke to you about this before. This was a second hand furnace and its usefulness is now over, for this reason:\n\nWhen I went into the house there was smoke in the house, and when I asked Miss Casper what was the trouble, she said it had been smoking quite a lot recently. I went down into the cellar and examined the pipes and they seemed all right. I then came up to the sitting room and looked through the register and was quite alarmed when I saw little sparks coming out. The top of the pot is cracked, and it is not safe. I fixed it up with clay and sand.\n\nI would suggest that in your estimates that you would allow for a new furnace. I have interviewed the William Beatty Company here, and have got the price of a furnace that would be suitable and guaranteed. The cost would be $105.00 and about $30. for installing. To explain the cost of installing there would have to be two men go to Pickeral Station, and the furnace would have to be taken from the station to the school which would be about two miles. If it was to be installed now, it would be much easier as it could be hauled on a sleigh over to the school. After the break up, it would be a lot more trouble taking it over, as that would mean two forms of transportation, by land and by water, and might cost a few dollars more.\n\nYou will remember that the furnace installed was a secondhand one, and it has turned out to be more second hand than I thought it was.\n\nYour consideration at your earliest will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6140, File 403-8, part 1)\nOttawa, January 31, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th instant, relative to the condition of the furnace in the teacher's house at the Lower French River Indian Day School, and recommending that a new furnace be supplied and giving an estimate of the cost of supplying and installing same.\n\nIn reply I have to say that our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are completely assigned and, unless the matter is urgent, it will not be possible to provide for the cost of supplying and installing a new furnace at the present time. It is hoped that the furnace now in use can be made satisfactory for the balance of the present winter and that there will be no danger of fire in using same. We are making a note of the need of a new furnace for next winter's use at this school, and you will receive the necessary instructions and authority regarding the purchase and installing of same early next Summer. You might let me know if there would be any danger of fire in using the present furnace for the balance of this winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I don't think it is safe. What the teacher is afraid of is that something might happen when she is sleeping and what might happen is too awful to think of.\n\nWhat I could arrange for, is that I could get the furnace installed and the bill submitted after the estimates are passed. Please say if I can do this.\n\nYour consideration at your earliest will be appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, February 5, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, in further reference to the supplying of a new furnace for the teacher's house at the Lower French River Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, provided you can arrange that payment of the cost of supplying and installing the furnace be held over until our appropriation for the next fiscal year is available, you may purchase a new furnace of a type considered by you to be satisfactory for the heating of the teacher's house and also for the installation of same in a satisfactory manner. It is noted from your letter of the 29th ultimo that the cost of the new furnace would be approximately $105 and the installation of same about $30. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed in the installation of the furnace. You should forward an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred about the middle of April, next, when funds will be available for payment of the expenditure.\n\nIt is presumed from your letter of the 29th ultimo that the old furnace is unfit for further use, and you may dispose of same in any manner you wish.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

JOHN M. DALY, INDIAN AGENT, PARRY SOUND, DATED NOV. 14, 1931.\n\nWhile at Lower French, I had conversation with Mr. Munson, whom I might state is getting along extraordinarily well both with the Indians and with the whites. There has been sufficient clapboards left there, which would make a porch for the back door, which is on the north side of the house. This has always been a sore part with the teachers, having no protection from the north wind on that door.\n\nI would be in favour of a porch being built as there is sufficient clapboards there to do it and we can get it done with cheap labour with the addition of flooring and roofing this porch could be made very cheaply. Although I know that costs should be kept down, I think by doing this now we will be saving money. I think with the lumber required and the wages that the porch could be built for $25.00. I would strongly recommend that this be done.\nOttawa, November 19, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 14th instant regarding your recommendation that a porch be erected over the back door on the north side of the teacher's house at the Lower French River Indian Day School, I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging to have this work done. It is noted that there are sufficient clapboards on hand to make the porch and that the cost of the work, including material and labour, will not exceed approximately $25.\n\nPlease arrange to have this work carried out before the extreme cold weather sets in, and when same has been completed, you should forward certified accounts, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the cost of the labour and for any material it is found necessary to supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\nOttawa, November 21, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the requisition which you forwarded from the teacher of the Lower French River Indian Day School for window blinds, curtain material, bedding, dishes, rugs, paint, etc., for the use of the teacher's living quarters.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the various supplies as asked for by the teacher on her requisition. This requisition is returned herewith for your information and guidance as to the supplies required. Besides the window blinds required for the residence, you may purchase 6 blinds, 32\", for the school.\n\nRegarding the rag rugs, it is considered that the expenditure for this purpose should not exceed $10 in the purchase of two small rugs.\n\nPlease keep all expense in purchasing these supplies as low as possible, and when same have been delivered, you should forward an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYou are being written in a separate communication regarding the classroom supplies, etc., for the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is noted that there are about 20 children of school age who would attend, provided a school was opened.\n\nThe Department is disposed to favourably consider the request made for the opening of a school at this point, and I shall be pleased if you will ascertain whether it would be possible to purchase a building that would be suitable for the purpose. If so, please state the cost of the same and the expense that would be involved in having it fitted up as a classroom. Also state whether it will be possible for a teacher to obtain boarding accommodation in the neighborhood or whether living quarters would have to be provided. Please ascertain from the band if they would be prepared to pay the whole or any part of the cost of purchasing a building and fitting up and furnishing it for school purposes.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit, you should inquire as to what arrangements could be made, at the least expense, for the establishment of a school for the Indian children at Byng Inlet. The question of authorizing the fitting up and conducting of a school at this point will depend upon the expenditure involved. A report at your convenience, giving full particulars regarding the above, will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The studing are 2 by 6, and the building is double-sheeted and clapboard sheeting on outside. The ceiling is about nine feet high. The upstairs is all in one with a good pine floor down stairs, and upstairs.\n\nThe building was built in 1915 and is built on a rock, with commanding view, and very suitably situated for the purpose required.\n\nThe Naganesh family want $600.00 for the building and approximately 1/4 acres of ground which would be ample room for play ground.\n\nI estimate the alteration with the painting could be done for about $300.00, as I am informed that I can secure all supplies at Byng Inlet less the paint, which I can do better by buying it here in Parry Sound.\n\nI have made arrangements with members of the band to do the work in the event of the Department approving of going on with same.\n\nI might say that upstairs could be converted into two good sized rooms for use of teacher, and I propose using part of the kitchen as a leak room, leaving a good sized kitchen for use of teacher, which should be enough for any teacher who might be there. The cellar has plenty of room for storing supplies.\n\nShould the teacher desire to board, I am informed that arrangements can be made to have her board near the school.\n\nThe distance from the school to the Byng Inlet station is about 1\u00bd miles.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

They are very keen to have a school and passed the following resolutions:\n\n(1) That the Department be asked to purchase the Naganesh house, for the purpose of converting it into a school house.\n\n(2) That the band are not in a position to grant any money out of their funds and would pray that the Department consider their long-felt need and grant them the privilege of having a school on their reserve.\n\nI might say that I saw some of the children at the Council meeting, as I had made arrangements to have them present, and they are a bright lot of boys and girls, and I'm sure the Department will not regret giving these children of the band the opportunity of obtaining an education.\n\nEnclosed is a description of the building which, I believe, can be made into a comfortable little school, to suit the needs of the Band.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir:\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

The Agent states that he can purchase a house, which, with some repairs and alterations, would be suitable, and also one-half an acre of ground, for the sum of $600.

There is an upstairs that could be fitted up and used for a teacher's living quarters. The Band have not sufficient funds at their credit to pay for the building and the fitting up of the same.

You may, therefore, arrange, after the 1st of April, next, the beginning of the new fiscal year, for the purchase of the Naganesh house and approximately 1 - 1/2 acres of land in connection therewith. We understand from your description of this building, as mentioned in your letter of May 29th, 1923, that it will be, when fitted up, entirely suitable for the purposes for which it is required.\n\nAs this property is situated on the Reserve, it will be necessary to obtain a quit claim deed, properly executed, giving a description of the land. If you will furnish a description by metes and bounds, and state the exact amount which it will be necessary to pay, the document required will be prepared and forwarded to you for execution. We note you stated in May, last, that this property could be obtained for $600. It might be possible to purchase at a lower figure, and you should endeavour to make the best arrangement possible with that end in view.\n\nAs soon as this property is acquired, instructions will be given regarding the alterations and repairs required to fit up the building for school purposes. I shall be pleased to hear from you giving the particulars asked for above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReplying to yours of March 13, 22-5-17.\n\nI beg to state that I held a meeting of the Maganatowan Band on March 27. I went over the ground with an Indian who was to have done the work, measured it all, and plotted it down and had everything in readiness to forward to the Dept. when Mrs. Noganosh changed her mind and for family reasons refused to sell the house. It was not in regard to the money that she objected, but simply for family reasons and a desire to keep the place as long as she lives.\n\nI explained to the Band that the Dept. was desirous of keeping their promise of last fall to the Band, and that they should arrange to get a piece of ground for school purposes.\n\nThis, the Band is considering and it is being arranged to have the portion of land next to the Noganosh place put aside for school purposes. One part of it, I am told, belongs to the Noganosh family and I understand that they will accept $50.00 for that part. The other part would be free, or in other words, the ground can be secured for $50.00.\n\nI am not quite clear about just what to do, but should the Dept. approve, I will go ahead and build a new building after I get prices on the material. There are quite a few young children who will be gradually coming of school age each year, so that there can be no mistake about putting up a building.\n\nI am informed and have found out, that the Band have not any place for worship, and they would like to have a building which would serve both purposes. I will endeavour to figure this out as cheaply as possible, should the Dept. wish this done. There could also be a small addition added to the main building for a residence for the school teacher, at very little cost.\n\nPlease advise me as to the wishes of the Dept. at your earliest, and I will get the particulars re-the land within the next 5 days.\n\nTrusting that this will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D.

As it will cost more to erect a suitable building for school and church purposes than to purchase the Nogansh house and fit up the same, the Department is not in a position to authorize you to go ahead with the work of erecting a building until further information as to the cost involved is received. I shall, therefore, be pleased if you will furnish a sketch showing the dimensions of the building considered by you of a suitable size, also the approximate quantity of the various materials required and the cost of the same, as well as the cost of the labour involved. You should also state whether you can obtain satisfactory labour, or if a competent foreman is engaged, could the work be done by Indian labour; you to arrange for the purchase and delivery of all materials? As soon as we have full information, and it is ascertained whether funds can be provided, you will be immediately advised as to whether it is intended to proceed with the erection of a building during the present fiscal year or not, and you will also be advised regarding the purchase of the site mentioned by you.\n\nYour suggestion that a small addition be erected to the main building as a residence for the teacher is also noted.

The time has come, I believe, for the establishment of a day school on the reserve. In the past some of the children have been recruited to Indian residential schools, but these institutions in the East are filled to the limit of their accommodation.\n\nThe Indian Agent is prepared to secure a competent foreman and to erect by day labour a small day school and a teacher's residence. He has submitted a rough sketch, which has been approved by the Department Architect. The estimated cost is \u00a32,450 and I should be pleased to have your authority to instruct the Agent to proceed with the work.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nI am told that there are some white children whom their parents would like to send to our school, such as the station master's children at Byng Inlet. I presume that there will be a fee for such children. Would the Department please say if they will allow this, and if so, how much the fee would be per quarter.\n\nThe Band does not object to the white children coming to their school. I approve of it, as I have seen the children and there is no chance of them getting schooling unless we allow them to come to our school.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that I can get a teacher for Waganetawan school to start as soon as the school is finished. Her name is Mrs. Earle Taylor, and she has taught school for the past nine years. Mr. Moore the school inspector recommends her. I have had two interviews with her and she seems a solid sensible woman and I think that she will be suitable, and is very likely to stay on the job.\n\nWould the Dept. say if I could engage her for the month of June as I would like to have the school in good running order for a good fall and winter term. Please advise at your earliest, as Mrs. Taylor is waiting to hear from me. Her rating should be the same as the other teachers such as Parry Island.\n\nTrusting that the Dept. will approve of this,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D.

The fees charged for such privilege will be at the rate of $12 per child per annum, based on the average attendance. If the parents of the white children will agree to pay fees at this rate, you may inform them that their children may attend. You are to make the collection of these fees at least twice each year, which you should forward to the Department for the credit of the Receiver General. The above permission is granted on the understanding that only a few white children will attend.\n\nThe teacher is not to include the names of the white children on her quarterly return.

It will not be possible to have the furnishings installed and the classroom equipment completed until the middle or the end of June. You should submit the qualifications and experience which Mrs. Earle Taylor possesses, and, if they are satisfactory, the Department will approve of her appointment, if she decides to accept for the next school year.\n\nI have to thank you for the prompt attention which you have given to the erection and completion of this building and for the interest you have taken in the providing of educational facilities for the Maganetawan Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I understand that the salary is $38 per month.\n\nI am permitted to refer you to the following for any information you may require as to my character and ability:\n\nMr. H. A. Honeyman, Inspector of Schools,\n316 Third Ave., Ottawa, Ont.\n\nMr. J.

Mr. J. M. Daly, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, will nominate the teacher, and I would suggest that you forward your application to him, giving full particulars as to your qualifications and experience.

The Half-breeds across the river will want to come. I am not quite clear about charging fees to them. They, the Half-breeds, think that they should have the benefit of the school.\n\nWould the Dept. please advise me in this matter so that I will be able to start the school without any misunderstanding with any of the half-breeds around Maganetawan.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D.

We will, therefore, approve of the admission of any half-breed children of school age living on the reserve or in the immediate vicinity thereof. No fees will be charged for their tuition. Their names should appear on the quarterly return along with those of the Indian children. You should use your discretion as to the half-breed children whom you consider should be granted the privilege.\n\nWe note that there will only be a few white children who will attend. You were informed in our letter of the 23rd instant as to the fees that would be charged for them. Their names are to be kept separate on the return from the Indian and half-breed children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn M.

She has also attended the summer Model School at Bracebridge\u20141912-13, 14-15, passing successfully the final examinations and securing a District certificate.\n\nI have other applications for this position but think that Mrs. Taylor would be suitable as she has had experience, is married, and is likely to stay, as her husband can secure a position at the mill at Byng Inlet.\n\nTrusting these qualifications of Mrs. Taylor will be satisfactory to the Dept.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D.

If the half-breeds are living on the reserve, or in the immediate vicinity, no fees will be charged for their tuition. As stated in our letter of May 23rd, last, the fees charged for the white children will be at the rate of $12 per child per annum, based on the average attendance. You are to make a collection of these fees at least twice each year, and you should forward the same to the Department for the credit of the Receiver General. A separate return should be prepared by the teacher giving the names of the white children, the number of days attended, etc.\n\nA daily register is being sent from the Department to Mrs. Taylor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Bushey of Byng Inlet has written stating that he is unable to send his children to the Indian school at Byng Inlet owing to the tax of one dollar per child being charged for four of his children. I am sure you will agree with me that it is a hardship for a poor man to pay this amount. Considering the few children in attendance I am satisfied that it is in the interest of the Indian children to have the Bushey children attend also. If the tax could be reduced so that these children may attend I am sure it will be better for all concerned.\n\nHoping that some satisfactory arrangement may be made,\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPublic School Inspector.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find letter sent to this office by School Inspector, Mr. Moore of this District. I should state that Bushey is a poor man with a large family. They are over two miles from the nearest Public School and only across the River from our school at Maganetawan. I have been pressing for payment of fees hence Bushey taking the matter up with the Inspector.\n\nIf the Dept. would consider this matter and reduce the fees to about fifty cents per month, I think that all the children would benefit as suggested by Inspector Moore.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 24, 1925.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nI have your letter of 21st instant enclosing a communication from the Public School Inspector for the Parry Sound District relative to the tuition fees charged for the children of James Bushey who attend the Maganetawan Indian School and requesting that these fees be reduced.\n\nBefore deciding this matter, I have to request that you will state the number of white children in attendance for whom fees are being paid. If there are white children other than the Bushey children in attendance who are paying fees at the rate of $12.00 per child per annum based on the average attendance, this Department could hardly make any exception in the case of the Bushey children.\n\nWhen further information is received, the Department will be in a position to decide as to whether an exception can be made in the case referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[T.

The two Carmichael children are the only two who have been paid for. The Bushway and Bcttineau children were kept at home when it was discovered that fees had to be paid.\n\nThese people pay school rates in their section but there is no road for them to send their children to school except along the railroad. Mr. Moor has told me that before our school was built at Maganetawan, the Indian children went to school at Byng Inlet and no fees were charged. He also tells me that there are Indian children now going to school at Byng Inlet village and there is no thought of charging them fees.\n\nMr. Moor seems to think that the Dept. might allow these children to attend at Maganetawan the same as the people at Byng Inlet who allow the Indian children to attend school there, without charging them any fees. I think that the Indian children will benefit by coming in contact with the white children and would recommend that the Dept. give this letter their serious consideration, as there is room for these children in Maganetawan school.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Please ascertain the number of Indian children attending the white school at Byng Inlet, and when we have this information, further consideration will be given to the request for a remission of the fees asked for the white children who attend at Maganetawan.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You need, therefore, not collect any further tuition fees from the parents of the white children. As you were informed in official letter of May 28th, 1924, we approved of the admission of any half-breed children of school age living on the Reserve or in the immediate vicinity thereof, and no fees would be charged for their tuition. The teacher need not include the names of the white children on her quarterly return.

Don't you think something should be done whereby the Provincial Authorities would reimburse the Department for the tuition of these English and French children. The proportion of English and French being taught in our School is no comparison to the number of Indian children in the public schools in this Agency. I would be pleased to have your opinion about this at your earliest convenience.\n\nI should state that I do not think the Provincial authorities are aware of the burden that we are carrying for them. Owing to the Geographical position of our school at Magnetawan It is only reasonable to expect these French and English people to send their children there, and as you know, status of our school is on a par with the public school at Dunlop. That is another reason why the parents send their children to our school.\n\nA reply at your earliest convenience would be appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This suggests that the white community should be responsible for at least half the cost of operating the school, and I am prepared to write to the Ontario Department of Education with a view to making some arrangement. However, so that I may be thoroughly enlightened in the matter, I should be glad if you would let me know the direction and distance of the Maganetawan school from Byng Inlet station, and I should also like to know where are the homes of the twenty whites that are attending our school.

The Government road also leads to Dunlop station, which is now called Britt. The school is on this Government road.\n\nThis is the reason why the parents are anxious to send their children to our school. It is dangerous for the children to go to the Dunlop school, and the distance is too great for them to go to the Byng Inlet School.\n\nTrusting this will give you an idea of the exact situation of the case.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/3K.\nOttawa, May 21, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Maganetawan Indian Day School, near Byng Inlet, is attended largely by white children, who are, of course, not wards of the Department of Indian Affairs. The average attendance of our wards for the past year was 56.9, and in the case of white children, 14.8. This suggests that the school should be conducted as a combined white and Indian day school, and I should be grateful if you would let me know if you can take steps to this end. I am informed that it is too dangerous for the children who attend our school to go to the Dunlop White School at Britt and that they live at too great a distance to attend the Byng Inlet White School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

How was it I had to pay so much? I was the most needing of money as I am a very crippled man, and all the rest able bodied men. I was never enough to pay it. I am only asking for\nwhat fair, and have always imagined I pay too much. If it could be refunded I would much appreciate it, but don't you think $1.84 was a bigger fee for 2 children? At any rate, know what you will do about it.\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\nJ. Carmichael\n\nByng Inlet\n\nI hold receipt for same. I would not trouble you but I don't think it a fair deal for me to be only one to pay.\nOttawa, October 25th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, relative to the payment by you of tuition fees for two of your children attending an Indian school. It is presumed the school you refer to is known as the Maganetawan Indian Day School.\n\nWe have no information regarding this matter, and are requesting Mr. J. M. Daly, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, to enquire into the matter and furnish us with a report. When we have the necessary information, you will be further communicated with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. J.

Carmichael, Byng Inlet, relative to the payment by him of tuition fees for his two children, whom he states attend the Indian school. It is presumed he refers to the Maganetawan Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department has no information regarding this matter, and I shall be pleased to have a report from you. You should state whether J. Carmichael is a white man or an Indian, and why he was requested to pay taxes. We understand that the Maganetawan Indian Day School \u2014 if this is the school referred to in this case \u2014 is largely attended by white children. I shall be pleased to have your report, giving full information, as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ. M.

Carmichael Byng Inlet, I have to state the following:\nThe Department has information regarding the matter in the form of receipt No. 47386 Sept. 23, 1925, for $21.84. Carmichael is a white man, and is a cripple, he is employed by the C.P.R. as pump man, the pump house is on the Reserve. The school referred to, is Magnetawan Indian Day School. The matter of paying the fees is exactly as stated by Carmichael. He was the only white man I could get the fees out of. The other people there are not white, they are half-breeds and are called white. Because of the wretched condition in which Carmichael lived I included him in the same class, or even of poorer class than the Indians of Magnetawan Reserve.\n\nThe Department has on file the correspondence in connection with this. Carmichael was the only man in that section who received a stated salary, and I was justified in charging him, and certainly would not be in favour of him having a refund on the fees. The fees were at the rate of $2.00 per month, and we could not collect all that was coming to the Department.\n\nI have to state that as Carmichael lives on the Reserve his children are the cause of a lot of discord and I am seriously considering the advisability of communicating with Mr Wilson Supt. of the C.P.R. Sudbury Division, to see if he cannot be removed. Being a cripple one hesitates to take action in a case like this, but the peace of the Reserve is more to me than Carmichael's physical condition.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would point out that this Department is under no obligation to provide educational facilities for white children, and, in cases where we do so, a tuition fee is charged.

Scanlan regarding conditions at the Britt School and the Byng Inlet Indian Day School, before making a final communication to you on the matter. Since the white children are already resident in a School Section it is proposed by this Department that they attend the Byng Inlet Indian Day School where it is more convenient for them to do so, and be considered as non-residents. The Board of Trustees of the School would then be the body to pay over to the Indian School the pro rata cost of education for these children. The Department of Education might give assistance to the Board in the form of an Assisted School grant, if necessary.\n\nMr. Scanlan will again be asked to make report on this matter as early as possible in order that a final decision may be communicated to you as soon as possible.\n\nJ.D.

INSPECTOR SCANLON,\ndated October 31, 1928, on his inspection\nof the MAGANETAWAN Indian Day School.\n\nOriginal on File 22-8-6.\n\nThe attendance of the Indian children is fairly satisfactory. However, a number of white children do not attend regularly. These pupils interfere with the progress of the school and should be refused admittance; they would then become subject to the Ontario School Attendance Act, and the Britt School would be obliged to furnish transportation, if necessary, to enable these pupils to attend their proper school; besides the Britt authorities would then have the responsibility of seeing that they did attend.\n\nThe apparent confusion existing as to the responsibility for educating the white children is a serious handicap to the efficiency of the school. The irregularity of some of these pupils impedes the progress of the other pupils, besides giving bad example to the Indian children. I am glad to note that the attendance of the latter is satisfactory.\nOttawa, November 17, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding your suggestion that the Maganetawan Indian Day School, near Byng Inlet, be conducted in future as a combined white and Indian day school for the benefit of the Indian children on the Reserve and the white children residing in the Britt School Section.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform you that the Department has received the report of Mr. Inspector Scanlon dated the 31st ultimo on his inspection of this school. He states therein that the white children do not attend regularly; that they interfere with the progress of the school, and recommends that they be refused admittance. He states that they would then become subject to the Ontario School Attendance Act, and the Board of Trustees of the Britt School would be obliged to make the necessary arrangements to enable them to attend their proper school, and, besides, the Trustees would have the responsibility of seeing that these children did attend their own school. He further states that the apparent confusion existing as to the responsibility for educating the white children is a serious handicap to the efficiency of the Indian school, and that the irregularity of some of the white pupils is setting a bad example to the Indian children.\n\nIn view of this report, I should be glad to have a further communication from you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\nToronto,\nNovember 19th, 1928.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am directed by the Minister of Education to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of November 17th, in further reference to the white children attending the Maganetawan Indian Day School near Byng Inlet. Mr. J.L. Moore, Public School Inspector, Parry Sound, was in the office of the Chief Inspector on Saturday, November 17th, and he will make a recommendation at once to cover these cases. It would seem that an assisted school grant from this Department will be necessary and this grant will likely be paid direct to the Britt School Board. This Board will then be able to pay fees to the Maganetawan Indian Day School in behalf of the non-resident white children.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDeputy Minister of Education.\nNovember 27, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ROGERS\n\nPursuant to our telephone conversation this morning, I have to inform you that J. Carmichael, of Byng Inlet, lives on the Indian Reserve and for years his children have attended the Indian School there. Prior to 1926, the Department asked that fees be collected on account of the white children that were attending this Indian school. It is true that our local representative was able to collect from Mr. Carmichael only, who paid $21.84 for the tuition of two of his children for the academic year 1924-25. Since that date, we made a reciprocal arrangement with the neighbouring white school section. Indian children living near the white school were allowed to attend without fee, and white children living near the Indian school were accorded the same privilege. Mr. Carmichael has not been asked to pay any fees since his first and only payment.\n\nI may say our local representative reports that the Carmichael family have caused trouble on the reserve and he has seriously considered asking the Superintendent of the C. P. R. at Sudbury to have him removed. Carmichael is engaged at the railway pump house.\n\nThis Department has been in correspondence with the Provincial Deputy Minister of Education, concerning the white children attending the Indian school at this point. The Provincial authorities are about to organize the white parents into a school board and will ask them to pay fees to the Indian school. The former reciprocal arrangement will cease, as it was much too one-sided.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6140, File 404-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to the Magnetawan school and the white children attending, I have had various conversations with Mr. Moore the School Inspector for this District, who has been in communication and has made a visit to the Department in Toronto. Mr. Moore has told me that arrangements will be made with the Department and the School Board at Britt regarding these white pupils at Magnetawan school.\n\nThere are at the present time, in the Magnetawan school, twelve white pupils, that belong to the section of Britt, and I am in receipt of a letter from Ernest Bernier, secretary of the Byng Inlet Consolidated School asking me what fee we will charge the white children at Magnetawan Indian Day School.\n\nIn my conversation with Mr. Moore I told him that I thought the charge would be $2.00 per month but informed him that this was not definite until I received word from the Department. Mr. Moore informed me that on receipt of this information that I can bill the Secretary of the Byng Inlet Consolidated School for the amount, and he trusts it will not be any more than $2.00 per head, per month.\n\nWould the Department please reply at their earliest and let me know what the charge will be.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, December 1, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your T-1593 of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the payment of fees by the Byng Inlet Consolidated School Board on account of white children attending the Maganetawan Indian Day School. I regret that I am not yet able to authorize you to send an account in this connection. The Department has been in correspondence with the Deputy Minister of Education for Ontario. It appears that the Provincial Department are prepared to give an assisted school grant to the Britt School Board so that this Board will be in a position to pay fees to us for the non-resident white children attending our school. At a later date, I will write more definitely to you. When you are next writing in this connection, you might indicate if the Britt School is the same as the Byng Inlet Consolidated or if it is a separate institution. The fees, when they are determined, will commence with the beginning of the current academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nToronto, December 3rd, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am directed by the Minister of Education to state in further reference to the matter of attendance of children from Byng Inlet Consolidated School District at the Magnetewan Indian Day School, that an Assisted Grant has been approved and will be paid to the Byng Inlet Board, in order that the Board may recompense the Magnetewan Indian Day School for the education of these children. The Public School Inspector, Mr. J. L. Moore, Parry Sound, reports that the Byng Inlet Board is now negotiating, through the Magnetewan School people, and with your Department, regarding the proper fees to be paid.\n\nThis Department finds it necessary to make the grant payable directly through an organized Public School Board, which in turn has power to make arrangement with another school for the education of some or all of the children.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister of Education.\n\nJ.

You may render an account to the Secretary for the current academic year, at the rate of $20 per year per child, based on the actual attendance.

There is a furnished teacher's residence in the school building. The enrolment is 12 Indian and 20 white children. The nearest railway station is Byng Inlet, one mile distant, and the village of Byng Inlet is one and a half miles from the school. We understand that Catholic Church services are conducted at Byng Inlet. In travelling from your home to the school, the best route would be via Sudbury, Ont., as there is daily train service. The salary allowed is at the rate of $100 per teaching month.\n\nI have to request that you will reply immediately, stating whether you would accept the position as teacher of this school or not. We will only be able to hold this vacancy open until the 15th instant, after which date, if we have not had a reply, the school will be offered to another teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

She does not think that I would be satisfied with conditions there, so this closes any arrangements re. this school.\n\nAm replying to Mr. MacKenzie re his letter concerning Byng Inlet. I prefer an all-Indian school if I may have one, but in the event of that not being possible I will likely accept Byng Inlet if we can arrange about my salary.

From her description, the latter is decidedly out of the question for me. I couldn't stand such pioneering as she tells about. Byng School sounds very fine except for the fact of it being mixed. I really prefer an all Indian class. Is there any extra remuneration from those white people for teaching their children? I asked Mr. Tremier to leave my salary as it was at St. Regis because I will have to pay some person to live at the residence.\nwith me. I would not attempt,\nfor many reasons living alone.\nIf we can arrange the salary\nquestion, everything will settled.\nThanking you for advice\nre this school.\n\nI am\nVery Sincerely\n\nMargaret MacKilty.\nOttawa, July 15, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the Magametawan Indian Day School at Byng Inlet.

As I informed you in my letter of the 7th instant, the salary which can be allowed you is at the rate of $100 per teaching month. Please let me know immediately if you accept the position.

There are fourteen Indian children attending there and he thought that perhaps we might be able to put the one against the other, and do away with bookkeeping. We have 20 white children attending the Magnetawan Indian Day School, and three white children attending at Shawanaga Indian Day School. I was putting the white children at Shawanaga against the Indian children at Depot Harbour School, but the Indian children at Depot Harbour have outnumbered the white children at Shawanaga by eleven.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if the Department would state what they would advise in this case. It appears to me that the only thing to do is for the school board at Depot Harbour to submit a bill at the rate of ten cents per day for the pupils the same as the Britt School Board receives from the Department. If I had this information at the earliest convenience of the Department I would be able to discuss the matter with Inspector Moore in an intelligent manner.\n\nThe consideration of the Department at their earliest will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/EX.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We will be prepared to allow a tuition grant for the Indian children at the rate of $20 per capita per annum, based on the average attendance. Payment of the grant at this rate would be from the beginning of the present school year, viz.: September first, 1932. The grant at the above rate will be paid at the end of the present school year, viz.: June 30th, next, upon receipt of a return, in duplicate, prepared by the teacher, which should give the following information:\n\n1. The name of each Indian child who attended during the school year.\n2. The total number of days each attended.\n3. The total number of days the school was in operation during the year.\n4. The name of the Secretary-Treasurer of the School Board in whose favour the cheque in payment of the grant due should be made.\n\nYou may inform the authorities of the Depot Harbour School Board and the Public School Inspector accordingly.\n\nWith reference to payment of grant for the white children attending the Shawanaga Indian Day School, it is noted that there are only three children who attend.

Miss O'Mara has informed me that she would be leaving. I would like to teach in this school so that I would be near home because I have been away to school for six years.\n\nIn the event of the acceptance of my\napplication I can assure you of my heartiest cooperation in the educational activities at the Reserve. Please write me a letter in this regard, at your earliest convenience. With kind thanks,\n\nYours very truly,\nEdith M.

Biasucci, of Britt, Ont., applying for appointment as teacher of the Naganetawan Indian Day School. In this letter she states that she has been informed by Miss O'Meara that the latter is giving up duties.\n\nPlease interview Miss O'Meara at once; and, if she intends to leave the school, you should obtain and forward her formal resignation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Miss O'Mara the present teacher is going to resign. Thus I am writing you on behalf of one of my parishioners, Miss Edith Biasucci, who is applying for this position. She is a graduate of the Normal School at North Bay and has a first class certificate. She lives here in Britt but Byng Inlet is just across the river. Being a local girl and a parishioner I am quite anxious that she be accepted for this position. I feel certain that she would be able to handle the school in a very efficient manner.\n\nTrusting that you will give her application every consideration, I am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nP.S. I am using this information with the permission of Miss G. O'Mara. She told Sunday she was resigning.\n\nH. E. Archambault\n\nChurch of The Holy Family\nBRITT \u2014 ONTARIO June 14, 1937.\n\nMr. J. M. Bennett, M.A., Ph.D.\nInspector of Separate Schools,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Bennett:\n\nI believe you are already aware of a vacancy that will occur at the end of the school year at the Byng Inlet Reserve School. I was talking to Miss O'Mara on Sunday and she told me that she had definitely decided to resign at the end of the month. Thus I am taking this opportunity of asking you to help one of my parishioners to obtain this position. I feel that a word or two from you would mean so much. The girl I speak of is Edith Biasucci. She lives in Britt, is a graduate of St. Joseph's Academy North Bay and also the Normal School at North Bay. She is a very fine girl and I think would be able to handle the Byng Inlet School quite well. I would appreciate very much, Mr. Bennett if you will be good enough to be of whatever assistance you can in this matter.\n\nWith sincere best wishes,\n\nH. E. Archambault\nPhilip Phelan, Esquire,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nRe Teacher Position at Byng Inlet\nIndian Reserve School\nParry Sound District\n\nI understand Miss Edith Biasucci, an Italian girl from Britt (her address is Byng Inlet, just across the river) has applied for a vacant position at the Byng Inlet Indian Reserve School, because of the fact that the present teacher is shortly leaving to be married. This vacancy is in my riding and as a result of inquiries, I desire to commend Miss Biasucci most strongly for the appointment.\n\nShe has been highly educated for the last six years - holds a first class interim certificate, and has musical ability on the piano. Her character is of the highest.\n\nI should be glad if you would write me and advise whether or not the Department could give effect to my strong recommendation, which I am only too happy to make for a worthy teacher. Also please let me know as to when the vacancy will be filled.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nArthur G. Slaght\nM.P. for Parry Sound\n320 Bay Street,\nToronto 2\n17th June 1937\n\nJohn M. Daly, Esquire,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ontario,\n\nDear Mr. Daly,\n\nThis is to recommend to you as a teacher with high qualifications to fill the vacancy in the Indian School at Byng Inlet; Miss Edith Biasucci of Britt, (her address is Byng Inlet, just across the river).\n\nI have also written to Mr. Philip Palen of the Indian Department at Ottawa, strongly recommending her. I am not sure whether the vacancy will be filled from Ottawa or through your Agency, but in either event my inquiries have satisfied me that this young woman is thoroughly fitted for the position and has every qualification to be appointed.\n\nWill you kindly let me hear from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nArthur G. Slaght,\nM.P. for Parry Sound,\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nJune 19th, 1937.\n\nSir;\n\nReplying to yours of June 16th, 22-8-1 referring to letter sent by Miss Edith M. Biasucci applying for appointment as teacher of the Magnetewan Indian Day School, in which you requested me to interview Miss O'Meara at once and ascertain her intentions as to her resigning from the school,-\n\nAlthough very inconvenient to do so at the present time, I hustled around and caught the train, and interviewed Miss O'Meara. Enclosed please find her resignation. Miss O'Meara informed me that she had sent her resignation to the Department, how she came to do this I do not know, but according to her remarks I presume she had been instructed from the Department to do so. How she could be instructed to do this by the Department, I do not know.\n\nI also made a point of interviewing Miss Edith M. Biasucci and she informed me that it was the Parish Priest who had interviewed Miss O'Meara and who had told her that Miss O'Meara was resigning, and that is the reason she applied personally to the Department for the school.\n\nEnclosed please find copy of letter sent to me by Arthur G. Slaght, K.C. and Member of Parliament for Parry Sound, re this matter. The Provincial member, Dr. Armstrong is also interested in this girl getting this position, as well as the clergymen, the church, the officials of the railway, and I might state that it is an understood all around Britt that she is likely to get the appointment. I mention these facts that I found out last night so that the Department will understand that if Miss Biasucci is engaged as teacher of that school, it will be a popular appointment.\nEnclosed please find a few suggestions regarding new teachers being engaged in this Agency, which I trust the Department will seriously consider.\n\nI am still of the opinion that Miss Edith M. Biasucci will make a good teacher in Magnetawan Indian Day School.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nEnclosure.\nFerry Sound, Ont.,\nJune 29th, 1937\n\nR.
