S.\nHolloway Bros., Printers, 69 Granville Street.\n1886.\nPREFACE.\n\nOn March 23rd, 1885, word was received in Halifax that Riel had, for a second time, risen in revolt. Fifteen years ago the troops, after a toilsome march of six weeks, arrived at Fort Garry, but the rebel had vanished. Then our Dominion, just born, with discordant elements and race prejudices to overcome, had to temporize, and the foul murderer of Scott escaped justice.\n\nCanada occupied a different position a year ago. Those who in 1870 were laughing children in 1885 stood, \"the sturdy manhood of a generation,\" ready for the call. In a month five thousand of the militia, after having passed through bitter punishment from wet, cold, and hunger, stood on the prairie prepared to uphold the flag and maintain the integrity of the land.\n\nOn April 3rd, (Good Friday), an order from headquarters called into existence the Halifax Provisional Battalion, 384 strong, consisting of 84 Halifax Garrison Artillery, 100 of the 63rd Halifax Rifles, and 168 Princess Louise Fusiliers, with 32 officers. On Monday the battalion stood on parade waiting marching orders. These came four days later, and on the following morning\u2014Saturday, 11th\u2014the first regiment Nova Scotia had ever sent beyond its borders sped onward with eyes firmly fixed on the path of duty, at the end of which was\u2014what? On that day none could tell.\n\nThe Halifax Regiment has no honors to blazon on its colors. Like many a corps in the field, it had plenty of work to do\u2014work necessary and important, but galling to a good corps. Where it was ordered there it went, and those in a position to know can tell whether the Bluenose wished to get to the field or hold back.\n\nThe rebellion bears on its face nothing but sorrow and loss, yet out of it has grown a warmer attachment for the flag and the land. Provincial and party ties were forgotten; we had become one people. In our journey of seven thousand miles kindness was everywhere met, and the feelings thus created\u2014sanctified by the blood of those who fell\u2014will help in making \"This Canada of Ours\" a Nation.\n\nMany friends have a desire to see how \"The Boys\" got on while West. The following few sketches, from the many, have been put into shape to celebrate the first anniversary of the departure of the regiment.\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6, WITH CAST.\n\nThe Major-General ..................................................

The leading company of the Rifle detachment half way across the stage; the troops in fours, at \"The Trail,\" marking time; the Band of the 63rd \"Halifax\" Rifles in the right playing \"The Girl I Left Behind Me.\"\n\nVoice of the commanding officer in the right heard \"Forward.\" The companies march across, and as the rear exits band ceases.\n\n(Curtain.)\n\nACT I.\n\nSCENE 1.\u2014Interior of a car on the way to the front.\n\nScout.\u2014Let her go Smith.\n\nCharley.\u2014Say, boys, didn't old Halifax give us a good send off?\n\nWill.\u2014Many of the lads behind feel bad at being left.\n\nDeacon.\u2014You bet. Let us give the old corps another cheer. (Cheers begin.) Hold on! Take the time from me. Now, all together.\n\n(Cheers.)\n\nChicken, (waking)\u2014What are you kicking up such a racket for?\n\nDude.\u2014Why, sleepy-head, we have just been cheering the boys left home.\n\nChicken.\u2014By George! had I been awake I would have had a hand\u2014I mean a voice in that.\n\nMickey.\u2014Say, Dick, give us \"Will ye No.\"\n\nScout.\u2014Yes, strike up Dick.\n\nWill.\u2014Order for Dick's song.\n\nDude.\u2014Hold up your clatter in that corner.\n\nMickey.\u2014Go on, Dick.\n\n(Orchestra.)\nWILL YE NO COME BACK AGAIN?\n\nSUNG BY IRE. R. BLACKMORE.\n\nBonnie Charlie's now awa',\nSafely owre the friendly main,\nMony a heart will break in twa'\nShould he ne'er come back again.\n\nChorus.\u2014Will ye no come back again?\nWill ye no come back again?\nBetter lo'ed ye canna be,\nWill ye no come back again?\n\nWe watched thee in the gloaming hour,\nWe watched thee in the morning grey,\nTho' thirty thousand pounds they gie,\nOh, there is none that wad betray.\nCho.\u2014Will ye no, &c.\n\nSweet's the layrock's note and lang,\nLifting wildly up the glen,\nBut aye to me he sings ae sang,\nWill ye no come back again?\nCho.\u2014Will ye no, &c.\n\nJim.\u2014I wonder how many of us will ever see the old town again.\n\nCharley.\u2014There's no telling; but there will be many a sad heart\n\"should we no come back again.\"\n\nDude.\u2014There is no telling who will get back, boys, but \"every bullet\nhas its billet.\"\n\nMickey, (getting up.)\u2014Yes, and every billet has its bullet, or some\nother unhealthy thing. I am sore already.\n\nOmnes.\u2014\"Sit on him. Let up on that.\"\n\nWill.\u2014Why, boys, the Sleeping Beauty has slept through all the\nracket\n\nDude.\u2014Wake him up, Mac.\n\nMac, (shaking Beauty.)\u2014Hi! Hello, Beauty!\n\nBeauty.\u2014Can't you let a fellow get five minutes' sleep?\n\nDude.\u2014Why, man alive, you have been asleep for about twenty-four\nhours. You have hardly opened your eyes since we left\nMoncton, where we had that splendid meal of dirty water and\nbread and mustard sandwiches. We will remember that meal\nfor some time.\n\nBeauty.\u2014What's the matter then? Is there another meal ready?\n\nJim.\u2014Another meal! Don't you ever think of anything except\neating and sleeping?\nBeauty.\u2014Yes, smoking. Give me a match, somebody.\n\nChicken.\u2014I tell you, boys, old Halifax expects us to give a good account of ourselves. Let us remember.\n\nOmner.\u2014Hear, hear, hear him.\n\nNatty, (waking)\u2014Hello! I say, what's all the racket about\u2014the girls?\n\nBeauty.\u2014Oh, of course, the girls are always troubling you.\n\nNatty.\u2014And something to eat is always troubling you. Let us have a song; try the \"Farewell.\"\n\n(Enter rear the O. R. C.)\n\nO. R. C.\u2014Hold on a bit. Give me your letters first, got to post them at Richmond Junction. Hurry up, boys.\n\nNatty.\u2014Get out, you old fraud. You are always coming along at the last moment.\n\nO. R. C.\u2014I am always ready when I'm wanted, anyway, for it's a cold day when I get left.\n\nNatty.\u2014Well, we want you now. Join in the song, and when you are through we will have ready the letters.\n\nBeauty.\u2014What letter?\n\nO. R. C.\u2014The letters from the girls; violet ink, you know, with all the crosses.\n\nNatty.\u2014Come on with the song.\n\n(Orchestra.)\n\nTHE SOLDIER'S FAREWELL.\n\nHow can I bear to leave thee,\nOne parting kiss I give thee,\nAnd now what'ever befalls me,\nI go where duty calls me.\n\nChorus.\u2014Farewell, farewell, my own true love,\nFarewell, farewell, my own true love.\n\nPerchance no more I'll meet thee,\nOr with fond love e'er greet thee,\nThe war clouds roll before me,\nI go where duty calls me.\n\nCho.\u2014Farewell, &c.\n\nI'll think of thee with longing,\nThink thou when tears are thronging,\nAnd with my last fond sighing,\nI'll whisper soft when dying,\n\nCho.\u2014Farewell, &c.\nMickey.\u2014Ha, ha! Look here, boys! I forgot to leave the keys of the safe; there will be fun at the office.\n\n(Enter rear O. Sergt.)\n\nO. Sergt.\u2014Attention! Each man will have on a clean shirt, and have his hair cut close, and any man found cutting his toenails will be put in the cattle car.\n\n(Groans.)\n\nChicken.\u2014Is this sort of thing to be kept up the whole journey.\n\nO. R. C.\u2014For goodness sake, stop grumbling.\n\nChicken.\u2014I'm not grumbling; I was only just saying.\n\n(Bugler blows in Dumont's ear, who jumps on seat in excitement.)\n\nDumont.\u2014Fire! Box 24!\n\nBeauty.\u2014Good, Dumont.\n\nDumont.\u2014I was dreaming, and thought I heard the alarm.\n\nCharley.\u2014Hurrah for Dumont.\n\nO. Sergt.\u2014Richmond Junction, boys. Now, Beauty, another meal.\n\n(Exeunt omnes shouting.)\n\nSCENE 2.\u2014Street, with sign \"Richmond Junction.\"\n\n(Enter left running four members of the H. P. B. with tin pans, looking glasses, whistles, &c. Enter right a drunken civilian.)\n\nDude.\u2014Where's the train?\n\nCivilian.\u2014She's on the (hic) way to the (hic) front. (Party drop parcels in consternation.) Is all (hic) right boys, but (hic) she' here (hic).\n\nDude.\u2014We are left, boys.\n\nNitchie.\u2014Yes, and it's a cold day for us.\n\nPevy.\u2014We have only one thing to do.\n\nNitchie.\u2014And that is to go on.\n\nDude.\u2014Right all the time.\n\nCivilian.\u2014Shay, soldiers, (hic) I like that, (hic) she here (hic) tell you whaz, boys, (hic) shay, have (hic) somethin.\n\nBilly.\u2014That's all right, old man. Say boys, (points to goods), our little shopping expedition has cost us dear.\n\nNitchie.\u2014Yes, it's doubtful if we catch the battalion before it reaches Winnipeg.\nBilly.\u2014Then we have to do the gaps by ourselves. Have to go through mud, snow, and slush, live on what we can pick up and sleep anywhere we can find a hole to crawl into, and all for what\u2014for these, (picks up glass and whistle) for the consolation of looking at my ugly mug to see if my whisker is leaking and of playing \"Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye.\" Goodness knows I'm paying dear enough for my whistle.\n\nCivilian.\u2014Thaz waz the matter, (hic).\n\nNitchie.\u2014Dr. Johnston said that patriotism was the last refuge of a scoundrel. What terrible scoundrels we must be or else we would turn round and go home again.\n\nDude.\u2014If we did what would the boys down home say we were? But we don't intend going back for a few months, so let us see about moving West.\n\nCivilian.\u2014Shay, boys (hic) if you'll (hic) stay here, I'll (hic) keep you for six (hic) months. (Exeunt soldiers right.) Well I'm beat (hic) soldiers who won't (hic) drink (hic). Shay! Hi! Hello! (Staggers off right.)\n\nSCENE 3.\u2014Camp Desolation. A winter landscape at night.\n\nCol.-Sergt.\u2014Well, boys, here we are at the end of the first gap. My bones are sore yet from that header I took when our team upset.\n\nMickey.\u2014Oh, you needn't crow, for a box of hard-tack fell on me.\n\nSergt.-Major, (in right).\u2014Bugler!\n\nScout.\u2014Here, sir.\n\n(Exit right.)\n\nWill.\u2014Has anybody seen Jock since we arrived? I thought he was finished when their team capsized.\n\n(Bugler in right sounds \"Orderly Sergeants.\")\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014Goodness me! there's that awful Orderly Sergeants just as a fellow was getting thawed out. I wonder what's wanted now.\n\n(Exit right.)\n\nCharley.\u2014Poor old Jock! His first thought was not for himself. Did you hear him yell out, \"Are the peeps all right.\"\n\nCol.-Sergt.\u2014Yes; what a brick he is. Over sixty, and lamenting for fear he would not be allowed to come on service.\n\nCharley.\u2014He said on the day of the medical examination: \"I have been with the lads during twenty-five years of peace, and now that there is danger they want to leave me behind.\"\n\n(Enter right O.-Sergt. and Bugler.)\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014Two men for Quartermaster's fatigue.\nJim.\u2014Confound the Quartermaster's fatigue.\n\nDeacon.\u2014Who is next for duty?\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014You and Mac.\n\nMac.\u2014No you don't.\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014Yes I do, though.\n\nDeacon.\u2014I was on the last fatigue.\n\nMac.\u2014So was I.\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014No, you were not.\n\nMac, (aside).\u2014Stick to it Deacon; he hasn't his book.\n\nDeacon.\u2014Now that's a nice statement for you to make. How do you know? You have only been O.-Sergt. since morning.\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014Oh, I know you were not.\n\nMac.\u2014What a whopper!\n\nDeacon.\u2014Fight, ye mules, I hate peace\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014Now boys, you know you are only bluffing.\n\nMac.\u2014Bluffing, indeed!\n\nDeacon.\u2014If you gamble, we don't.\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014Now, I say, let up on this fooling, and come on; the Sergt.-Major is waiting.\n\nMac.\u2014Prove that it's our turn; where's your book?\n\nDeacon.\u2014Yes; trot out your book.\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014It's in my knapsack; but I say if it's not your turn go on and I'll let you off next time.\n\nDeacon.\u2014Taffy.\n\nMac.\u2014To oblige the general, Deacon.\n\nDeacon, (nudging).\u2014Ah, Mac, that's a different matter.\n\nMac.\u2014Of course. To oblige the general of course we'll go.\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014Come on, then, boys.\n\nMac.\u2014Got him again, Deacon.\n\n(Exit right.)\n\nDeacon.\u2014You bet, Mac.\n\nMac, (to party at fire).\u2014Tell the boys I'm not to blame.\nDeacon.\u2014And of me tell the girls the same.\n\n(Exeunt fatigue right.)\n\nWill.\u2014I wonder how the boys left at Richmond Junction are getting on.\n\nCharley\u2014Poor boys, they must be getting it rough, fighting their way as best they can, hunting up rations and transport.\n\nCol.-Sergt.\u2014Somebody go and hunt Jock up; coffee is nearly ready.\n\nWill.\u2014Yes, Jock must have his coffee. Oh! here he comes,\n\n(Enter left Jock with pipes.)\n\nJock.\u2014Here I am, lads, safe and sound.\n\n(Cries of \"Here you are, Jock,\" \"Sit here, Jock.\")\n\nMickey.\u2014Recline upon this snowy tree,\nAnd patient wait for hot coffee.\n\nJock.\u2014All right, lads. I am safe and sound, and so are the pipes. I see the cook is hard at it.\n\n(Enter left Orderly-Sergt. and cook with coffee.)\n\nSutty.\u2014It's a cold day when we get left boys.\n\n(All rush for canteens and cook serves out coffee. Enter Mac and Deacon right.)\n\nMac.\u2014It's a cold day when we get left.\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014Is the fatigue finished?\n\nDeacon.\u2014Well, you see the fatigue job isn't finished, but we are finished with the fatigue job, for we saw Sutty start with the coffee.\n\nSergt.-Major, (in right).\u2014Bugler!\n\nScout.\u2014Here, sir. Hang it all, I suppose it's that beastly \"Orderly Sergeants\" again.\n\nJock.\u2014We are going to have a tough night, lads.\n\n(Charley.\u2014Yes, Jock, and perhaps a tougher day to-morrow. It's away below zero now.\n\nWill.\u2014Tough night, Jock! I'm surprised at you. We will have a beautifully ventilated sleeping apartment, a flat car, with the canopy of heaven for a roof, the soft side of a plank for a mattress, and a blanket two inches thick made of ice.\n\nJock.\u2014Oh, I have seen the beautiful sleeping car, and I guess we will pull through just as lively as any of the troops who have gone on ahead.\n(Bugler in the right sounds \"Orderly Sergeants.\")\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014There it goes again. (Lays down coffee and runs right.)\n\nMac.\u2014Good-bye, general.\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014You're a gump. (Exit right.)\n\nBeauty.\u2014It's not fair that the general should be interrupted at his meal, and for fear that he might be hungry before this time to-morrow, I will eat it for him.\n\nWill.\u2014Now, look here, Beauty, that's not fair. It's not in the book, you know, and we never do anything unless it's in the book. (Exit right.)\n\nBeauty.\u2014Well, I don't know whether it's in the book or not, but (finishing coffee) I know it's in this lance-corporal.\n\n(Enter O.-Sergt. right and exit cook left.)\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014The order is that companies at once get on board the cars.\n\nOmnes.\u2014The what!\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014I beg pardon, but Col.-Sergts. are at once to get their companies on the\u2014ah\u2014transport, and, dence take it, I must go without my tea.\n\nBeauty.\u2014Don't let that trouble you, general. I ate it for you.\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014Get out, you gump.\n\nCol.-Sergt.\u2014Pick up your kits, boys; we will call the roll on board. Fall in. General, conduct us to our sleeping apartment.\n\n(Enter Will right running.)\n\nWill.\u2014Oh, boys, you ought to see our major. The colonel told him to get us on board quickly and the major was hurrying the boys up. You know that hole in the road?\n\nCharley.\u2014The deep one full of water?\n\nWill.\u2014Yes; you all know it.\n\nOmnes.\u2014Yes, yes.\n\nWill.\u2014Well, the major was rushing about, and just as he got by the hole he was calling out, \"Fall in boys,\" and in he went. (Laughter.)\n\nCharley.\u2014It's a sorry subject to laugh at, boys, but one can't help it.\nDeacon.\u2014If he can't get a change of clothing he will be stiff before morning.\n\nCol.-Sergt.\u2014Forward, boys.\n\n(As rear of company exits right cook enters left laden with tins, and moves right. Beauty enters right running and knocks cook down. Tussle. O.-Sergt. enters right and tries to separate, but is pulled down and pummelled. O.-Sergt. jumps up angry.)\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014What do you mean.\n\nBeauty, (face smutty).\u2014Why, it's the general!\n\nSutty.\u2014Why, it's the general!\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014Get out, you gumps.\n\nSutty.\u2014Beauty, what did you knock me down for?\n\nBeauty.\u2014I didn't see you, Sutty; I was looking for my pipe.\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014Come, now, no more fooling. Get on board.\n\n(Both rise; Beauty hunts for pipe, and Sutty gathers up tins.)\n\nBeauty.\u2014I've got it. Hold on, Sutty, and I'll help you.\n\nO.-Sergt.\u2014Will you get on board?\n\nBeauty.\u2014Lead on, we will follow:\nTho' my face be sore and smutty,\nI'll stick to you, and so will Sutty.\n\n(Both fall in right, turned inwards. O.-Sergt. passes between; they salute.)\n\n(Omnes exeunt right.)\n\nSCENE 4.\u2014Camp Desolation; daylight. Trolly party on trolly; four eating, one asleep.\n\nNitchie.\u2014Billy, I cry spell O. I am used up.\n\nDude.\u2014So am I.\nI'm all broke up, as you can see,\nA poor old played-out bum!\nOh, Moses! 'but I'm stiff.\n\nBilly.\u2014Let her rest a few minutes longer, boys. Give the complicated machinery of the electric motor time to cool off. I tell you, boys, we are lucky to have got this instrument, (pats trolly)\n\nDude.\u2014That was a nice old tramp we had before we reached this spot. If it had not been for the telegraph poles our name was Dennis.\nNitchie.\u2014We were not wild when told that the battalion had started four hours ahead of us.\n\nPevy.\u2014No, we weren't mad. I felt that it was indeed Desolation, but come on, Billy. Let the captain finish his nap, he was at work all night.\n\nDude.\u2014I tell you, boys, I was mighty well pleased to find on reaching Carlton Place that Capt. Curren, of the Artillery, was reported left behind. They can't punish us without going for him.\n\nBilly.\u2014Let her go, Smith.\n\n(Pevy and Billy start trolly across stage.)\n\n(Exit trolly right.)\n\n---\n\nACT II\n\nSCENE 1.\u2014Prairie. The General's Inspection. The battalion drawn up in line, at open order, standing at ease.\n\nC. O., (in right).\u2014Battalion\u2014attention\u2014shoulder arms\u2014general salute\u2014present arms.\n\n(Bugles sound.)\n\n(Enter left the General.)\n\nC. O.\u2014Shoulder arms.\n\nGeneral.\u2014Let your men order arms, sir.\n\nC. O.\u2014Order arms.\n\nGeneral.\u2014Soldiers: I need not tell you that I am pleased to meet the Halifax battalion and at finding so soldierlike a body of men representing the brigade of your native city. I was grieved on the breaking out of the rebellion, when the stern duties of a soldier's life became apparent, to read despatches of your unwillingness to defend the flag, but the proof that the militia of Halifax was sound at heart may be seen by the battalion which represents it in this campaign, a battalion proud in the knowledge that there is still left in the brigade many good men and true who were not called, yet who stand steady at their posts ready to obey when ordered. I do not intend to occupy much time, but must say that any person, be he officer, non-commissioned officer or private, who makes money or secures position by his connection with the force and refuses to take its risks\u2014refuses to do that which the meanest savage on earth will do, fight for his country\u2014should have the uniform torn off him, and be driven out of the force in disgrace. In the regular service this would be called cowardice, and would earn on the field a firing party and a wooden box. Soldiers: there is a great and glorious book by\nwhich all alike are governed\u2014you, the common soldier, and I, the mighty major-general.

Complicatabus conglomeratabus, ah yes, oh certainly, take these pills. Remedies never failing, when followed by exercise. Now I have a word to say to you. The sick have been watched for the past week, and I find that they have been acting in a very curious manner, one who had rheumatism so bad that he had to be fed with a spoon went to the river and washed his clothes. Two others paddled across the river in a dug out, and then went riding on Kiouses, and last night the whole of them took part in the foot races and base ball match. Every Hospital Sergeant can proudly proclaim the wonderful cures that have been effected by the pills and and powder used in this campaign, but there is something more than wonderful in these cures. Let me see, oh yes, certainly. Now as to diet. Do not eat turkey (sick, we wont sir) or game of any kind (si k, no sir) keep clear of puddings and pies, (sick, we will sir) brandy and limejuice (sick, rush forward, yes sir). How dare you, stand at attention (sick fall in). You surely were not simple enough to think that I was going to issue brandy, (sick sadly shake their heads). Confine yourselves strictly to the health giving diet of that delicious fat bacon,\nand the delicate hard tack. In regard to this hard tack. It was specially prepared for the troops out of wheat which had been splendidly frozen, and there is also another special feature about this hard tack. With a wonderful knowledge of your needs it was not foolishly kilndried, but was packed hot from the oven into soft wooden boxes, and this foresight has materially helped in the formation of that health giving mould which you find all through it, therefore be careful not to rub that mould off as it is very wholesome, although its properties are beyond your intellectual powers.
