On the ground floor there is a kitchen, pantry, dispensary, and dining and sitting room combined. I neglected to make any provision for the building of a chimney, so for the present stove pipe has been purchased and put in. I think, however, that a brick chimney would be better and safer, although very few houses in the village have them. I will find out the actual cost of one, and report on this later.

If it is the Council's desire that the money be used for the benefit of the band in general it seems advisable to leave it for the present to credit of the band account, and later an application can be made for expenditure in a judicious manner, so that the Indians in general may benefit from the use of the money.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRevd J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-8, part 1)\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to the Departmental letter No.157-11-S, of Feb. 22nd, 1929, I beg to say that the material mentioned in voucher No. 401 was purchased in January 1928. The Skidegate Council at that time fixed up the building so that the teacher and nurse could occupy it. Up until that time they had been boarding at the Mission House, but this arrangement was found unsatisfactory. As no other house was available at that time, the Council repaired the place with the understanding that the Department would rent it for the teacher and nurse, and the rent paid directly to the Council, which would compensate for the material and labour on the repairs. The rent however, has been paid into their Trust Fund.\n\nDepartmental letter No. 157-11-S of Dec. 29th, 1927, which confirmed a telegram contained the following, \"... You may prepare house for teacher and nurse at Skidegate...........\" The Council offered to put the house in good shape and rent it. This I thought a better plan than having it done at the Department's expense, as the idea was that it would only be a temporary residence for the teacher and nurse. There were no bills, therefore, submitted to the Department for repairs to the building, but vouchers were sent for rental, and these were paid to the Trust Fund of the Band.\n\nThere were no receipts sent in with Voucher 401 as the Council had purchased the material, and the receipts were not kept. The items in Voucher 401 were copied from the Council's books at Skidegate. Matthew Williams, the Hardware merchant, has since given me a receipt for the material which was purchased at his store. According to the Council's books the shingles and lumber was purchased from various individuals in the village and at Queen Charlotte City. No bills were secured from the different parties. The material was used in repairing the building, woodshed and toilet, and I certify to the correctness of this statement.\n\nMarch 23rd, 1929\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (PG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nRe Departmental letter 157-11-8\n\nThe Skidegate Council unanimously decided to ask the Department to reimburse them out of the Trust Fund, for the amount which they expended on the house for the teacher and nurse. I therefore recommend that Voucher No. 401 be paid out of their Trust Fund as they are at present short of funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, British Columbia\n\nQueen Charlotte AGENCY\n\nTo M.T.

It bears the endorsement of James Martin. In view of this it is not understood what Mr. Martin means by claiming the cheque was drawn for $4.00 less than the amount of his account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean.\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Martin informed me today that his bill had not been paid in full. The amount was $14.05 and was sent in as Voucher No. 405. Mr. Martin received a cheque for $10.05, numbered 7357. The bill was for material sent to the Skidegate teacher's residence in February of this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 3, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th ultimo, relative to the renovating of the house used as a residence for the teacher and nurse at Skidegate, also to the erection of a new chimney and the supplying of a quantity of furnishings.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have a brick chimney erected. We note that you estimate the cost of material and labour in the building of this chimney to be approximately $60.\n\nYou may also arrange to have the whole house given a fresh coat of kalsomine and the floors painted. It is noted that the approximate cost of the labour and material in carrying out this work will amount to $60.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery, for the residence, of the following furniture:\n\n- Small dining set, table and four chairs,\n- Two dressers for bedrooms,\n- Living room suite (7 piece),\n- 2 Congoleum rugs,\n- 1 Bed, spring and mattress,\n\nalso for the freight, cartage, setting up, etc., of same. We note that you estimate the cost, including freight, etc., to be $130.70.\n\nAfter all the above work has been carried out to your satisfaction and the furniture supplied, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn the allowance made for the renovating of the house for the use of the teacher and nurse at Skidegate, no provision was made for a brick chimney. I think it would be advisable to have one erected. Five hundred brick will be necessary. The approximate cost would be,\n\nBrick, delivered at Skidegate... $20.00\nHauling to residence............. 5.00\nLime and sand delivered......... 3.00\nLabour bricklaying............... 25.00\nLumber for foundation............ 2.00\n\n$60.00\n\nI would like to recommend also that the whole house be given a fresh coat of kalsomine, and the floors painted. The new work done last year was not kalsomined, and all the old walls needs a fresh coat. The approximate cost for labour and material for this would be $60.00.\n\nI would also recommend that the following furniture be purchased for the residence, counting on a second teacher, and also the nurse. One bureau, 2 beds etc., are already in the house.\n\nSmall dining set, table, four chairs.... $21.50\nTwo dressers for bedrooms.......... $12.00 ea. $24.00\nLiving room suite (7-piece)........... $37.50\n2 Congoleum rugs, $7.85 each........... $15.70\nOne bed, spring and mattress........... $29.00\nFreight, cartage, setting up etc. Approx. $12.00\n\n$120.70\n\nThe above were not provided for in the estimates sent in last year, as the house had not been purchased at that time by the Department. The teacher and nurse were then living in a two roomed place which did not require very much furniture. I hope, however, that the Department will give permission for the above to be provided for the teachers and nurse.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted he gives an estimate of the cost of material and labour for the purpose.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our funds this year have been considerably reduced, we are unable to authorize any painting or redecorating at Indian schools. However, the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding $110 in the purchase of shingles, nails, galvanized iron for flashings, and for the labour of removing the old shingles and putting on the new ones. I enclose Encumbrance Requisition, authorizing the expenditure required, to the above amount. You should arrange with the Agent to purchase the shingles and have the work carried out. When completed to his satisfaction, he should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. Full details should be given regarding the labour, the number of hours and the rates paid. On each copy of the voucher, please have him state that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nPrefabricated Schools and Teacherages.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department is seriously considering the use of prefabrication as a means of constructing needed schools and teacherages.\n\nOur Lands and Development Services branch have recently made a careful study of plans submitted by North American Builders, Limited, of Winnipeg, and Prefabricated Builders Limited, Vancouver. You will be particularly interested in their comments regarding \"Prefabricated Buildings Limited\":\n\n\"This company supplied blueprints of three cottages, their \"Dogwood,\" \"Laurel,\" and \"Redwood\" designs. The same general comments apply. Roof slopes, except the \"Redwood\" are dangerously flat for shingle covering. Chimney designs are better, but exterior elevations generally leave something to be desired. Also, vestibule entrances are not provided, and these are essential in most parts of Canada, except perhaps southwest British Columbia.\n\n\"This Company, however, provides construction details, including foundations. These are based on structural unit prefabrication, a system successfully used by Peerless Housing, Limited, and one which permits greater flexibility in design. This system is adaptable to custom design.\n\n\"To use the products of these firms, it would evidently be most expedient to select one of their stock designs, and then to have made the minimum alterations required for efficient and safe construction. Cost and the amount of time involved would have to be the subject of further enquiry.\n\n\"It should be noted that these firms provide only the...\"\nframe and exterior covering for a building. Plumbing, heating, electrical services, insulation, some interior finish and the foundations would have to be supplied by this Department in the usual way.\"\n\n(a) Prefabricated Schools\n\nPlease find attached the letter from this Company. It is suggested that Inspector Davy contact this company with a view to ascertaining their interest in prefabricating our standard one-room school and attached teacher's residence. Additional sets of these blueprints are available here.\n\n(b) Prefabricated Teacherages\n\nIt is recommended also that he investigate the possibility of having the teacher's residence for Skidegate built by this company. We have included the sum of $5,000.00 in our Estimates for this construction. It is presumed that the residence required will be for two teachers. Therefore, under separate cover, I am forwarding a set of the drawings for a caretaker's residence which might prove satisfactory.\n\nYou will note that Prefabricated Buildings Limited have already seen this plan (29) and have a standard house which is somewhat similar.\n\nIn addition to the above, there is the possibility that a foreman-carpenter, who could supervise the construction of this building, might be available at Skidegate.\n\nAny information which you might obtain from this company will be also referred to Miss Walton here, as she is interested from the point of view of constructing new agencies' residences.\n\nBernard F.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated.\n\nVoucher No. 290\n\nDate: June 16, 1948.\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Federal Building, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYour File: 11-11-3\nRe: Skidegate Teacherage.\n\nI have your letter of May 27th advising of the proposed erection of a Model \"F\" Multi-Flex building for use as a teacherage at Skidegate. I shall be at Skidegate later in the week and shall report in detail upon my return. However, the following pertinent facts are presented for your consideration.\n\n1. Site: The ideal site for the teacherage is the one upon which the present residence stands. This is land released by the Band for school purposes and being adjacent to the school building allows for close supervision of school and property at all times. I would strongly urge that the present residence be dismantled and the new building erected on the same site.\n\n2. Salvage: Material salvaged from present residence can be used to erect a utility room at rear of new house. Some storage space for trunks, etc. is imperative and the necessary space can be provided by such construction. New woodsheds for school fuel are needed and these can be erected from salvaged material.\n\n3. Basement: A basement is not essential. The excavation for such would perhaps be rather costly since I know that shale and rocks are to be found at the depth of ground to be excavated for a basement.\n\n4. Foundation: Either of the following should be provided.\n   (a) Concrete posts sunk to hardpan.\n   (b) Concrete curb to hardpan.\n\n5. Heating: We do not suffer from extreme weather on the Islands and the excavation of a basement to install a furnace is not necessary. It would, in any event, be an added hardship to the teachers if they\nhad to tend a furnace. I strongly urge that a circulating heater (oil) be purchased for this purpose. Such can be allowed to burn at low fire during the winter months thus keeping the house comfortable at all times. I would also advise a new oil burning kitchen range. (Queen)\n\nI shall advise you upon my return concerning cost of labour of\n\n1. Dismantling old residence.\n2. Available labour for foundation work.\n3. Cost of labour in preparing foundation.\n\nJ.A. Findley,\nSuperintendent,\nQueen Charlotte Agency.\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Federal Building, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Teacherage - Skidegate\n\nBefore leaving Skidegate I had another interview with Peter Martin regarding the dismantling of the present teachers' residence. Together we went over the house and surveyed the entire situation.\n\nPeter came to see me later and stated that he would accept the contract for $250.00. He based his estimate on the following:\n\n1. It would take at least two men (to be paid out of the contract price)\n   a. House to be completely dismantled.\n   b. Wood sheds to be removed.\n   c. As much material salvaged as possible.\n   d. Salvaged material piled at rear of lot.\n   e. Site entirely cleared in readiness for new foundation.\n2. Approximately two weeks needed to complete the contract.\n\nIn my estimation this would appear to be fair and I pointed out to him that if he was awarded the contract the work was to be done exactly as detailed above.\n\nHe is actually the only man available and I recommend that approval be given as soon as possible to this arrangement. I would also urge that the sum of $250.00 be forwarded as an accountable advance. Upon completion of the work this amount will be paid and the necessary receipt taken. I request this for two reasons:\n1. Our infrequent mail services.\n2. The delay in payment being made in submitting vouchers after such work is completed is always a reason for impatience on the part of the worker. They like to be paid as their work is finished.\n\nI would appreciate your advice in the matter as soon as possible.\n\nJ.A.F./JDC\n\nJ.A. Findlay,\nSuperintendent, Q.C. Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Teacherage - Skidegate Indian Day School\n\nI have received a copy of Departmental P.O. 24734 covering the supply of a Prefabricated Multi-Flex building for use as a teacherage at Skidegate and have requested Prefabricated Structures to delete items 3 and 4 from the Order for the reason that information recently received from Supt. Findlay indicates that due to rock outcroppings excavation of a basement is not feasible nor as a matter of fact is it necessary in view of the moderate weather at Skidegate. Supt. Findlay's letters of June 7th and 15th in connection with construction of this building are enclosed for your information. You will note that new construction will require demolition of the present teacherage which occupies the only suitable site available and that the cost of this will amount to $250.\n\nPending receipt of information from Mr. Findlay regarding labour costs will you please have an accountable advance of $250 forwarded to him to meet the cost of demolition of the present teacherage. A further advance to meet the cost of erecting the new building will be requested in due course.\n\nW. S.

Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Federal Bldg., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Teacherage - Skidegate.\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letters of June 23rd and 25th enclosing plans and blue prints for the proposed teachers residence at Skidegate. At this date I am waiting a reply to my wire to your office regarding dismantling of the old residence in order that concrete foundation may be completed as soon as possible.\n\nFollowing are arrangements made and which I hope will be approved.\n\n1. There is no experienced man available at Skidegate or Queen Charlotte City who can supervise mixing and pouring of concrete.\n\n2. There is no mixer available at the south end.\n\n3. Should all cement have to be mixed by hand, the cost would be considerable.\n\n4. A building contractor in Masset, experienced in such work has signified his willingness to do the job.\n\n5. A small portable mixer is available here.\n\n6. Details of amount of concrete:\n   Depth of excavation - 33 - 36 inches.\n   Height of concrete above ground - 2ft. 8 inches.\n   Thickness of wall - 8 inches.\n   Total height of concrete - 5ft. 8 inches.\n   Volume of concrete - 465 cu. ft.\n   Mixture - 1 to 5 (sand and gravel mixed)\n   Cement needed - 100 sacks.\n   Gravel - local.\n\nMr. Howard Phillips, the contractor mentioned, has offered to take the work on a contract basis and his price makes allowances for:\n\n1. Wages for himself and Skidegate Indian.\n2. Hire of mixer and owner who runs it.\n3. Return transportation for himself and Mr. Lindsay, owner of mixer (asset to Skidegate)\n4. Return freight on mixer.\n5. Maintenance at Skidegate.\n\nThe work involves excavation, planning, frame work, mixing and pouring of concrete, leveling etc. Mr. Phillips contracts for the above at $350.00.\n\nConsidering that there is excavation to a depth of 3 ft., all frame work to be done, and 465 cu. ft. of concrete to be poured, I consider his price a fair one. I strongly urge that this amount of $350.00 be forwarded here in order that the contractor be paid without delay at the completion of the work. I do not consider it necessary to enter into a formal written contract with him, since he has done considerable work for me on other occasions and has always been satisfactory.\n\nIt is to be noted that if this work was to be done by an inexperienced man - on day labor basis - and the concrete mixed by hand, the costs involved would be considerable. I feel that having made the above arrangements, the work is being done at minimum cost and a great deal of anxiety will be avoided by having an experienced man on the job.\n\nI may say that it was through personal friendship that I persuaded Mr. Phillips to undertake the work, since he has other contracts to fill this summer.\n\nThe plans for the house have been studied very carefully and would appear to indicate that a quite satisfactory building is being provided as a residence.\n\nHowever, the plans indicate a fireplace but no details are listed anywhere in the list of instructions or checking sheet. Thus, I presume that the supplying company does not include such in their contract. If this is the case, I would appreciate having information concerning this item. The fact that a fireplace may be installed, and provision has been made in partitioning, etc., for one, will not eliminate the need for an oil heater. Can a heatlaster be acquired for installation in the fireplace? In any event a chimney must be built and materials for this will have to be shipped in from Vancouver. This work, I believe can also be undertaken by Mr. Phillips.\n\nMaterials to be shipped from Vancouver to Skidegate:\n\n100 sacks cement. (for foundation)\n1000 bricks for chimney (double flue) and fireplace.\n30 flue linings 8\" x 6\"\n4 sacks cement.\n5 sacks lime.\nContract prices.\n\nTotal expense (less materials) involved in foundation work - $350.00\n\nBuilding chimney and fire place - $125.00\n\nThese amounts to be forwarded as accountable advance to be supported by necessary receipts.\n\nGravel for all concrete work can be obtained in the vicinity of Skidegate and since other items such as wire, bolts, nails, lumber (over material which can be salvaged from old house) will have to be purchased, plus cartage of gravel, I would request that a further sum of $200.00 be forwarded to meet any such expenses.\n\nIt is my belief that the total cost of the house should not exceed $5000.00 and I would appreciate having the necessary funds advanced for the work as requested.\n\nJ. A. Findlay,\nSuperintendent,\nQueen Charlotte Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nRe: Teacherage - Skidegate Indian Day School\n\nEnclosed herewith for your information is a copy of Supt. Findlay's letter of July 8th in connection with arrangements for the erection of the above mentioned building. You will note that Mr. Findlay has secured a tender covering completion of the foundation work and the erection of a chimney and fireplace which I believe would be desirable as there is no basement in the residence.\n\nMr. Findlay was in Vancouver recently and I discussed with him at some length the erection of this building which should be relatively simple and I feel it would be advisable for us to reserve the services of the carpenter-foreman whom the Company has agreed to supply for the erection of one of the combined teacherage-classroom buildings which is agreeable to Mr. Findlay who thinks he may be able to secure a tender covering erection of the building from Mr. Howard Phillips who has contracted to do the foundation work. Pending receipt of further advice from Mr. Findlay in this connection will you please have a further advance of $675 forwarded to him to cover labour in connection with the foundation, fireplace and incidental expenses. The total of advances requested to date is $925.00.\n\nW. S. A.

We will arrange to forward Mr. Findlay an additional advance of $675.00 for labour.\n\nWe note his remarks regarding the fireplace that he states is on the plan. We see no necessity for providing a fireplace.\n\nIt is also noted that he suggests the installation of an oil heater. In practically all parts of Canada we are having difficulty in getting a definite promise that an oil supply is assured for the coming year. We feel that it would be better to provide a Quebec heater and burn either wood or coal.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Skidegate Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of July 23rd it is intended to have Superintendent Findlay secure an oil contract before we supply an oil burning heater for the Skidegate teacherage.\n\nI might say that the cost of shipping coal to Skidegate is exorbitant and it is difficult to provide dry wood because of the extended rainy season in that district.\n\nWith regard to the fire-place, this installation was shown on the plan submitted to you and in the absence of any comments to the contrary it was presumed that it was approved. The necessary bricks and heatilator unit have already been shipped to Mr. Findlay and as the installation will not increase the cost of the building materially and in the absence of a central heating unit will contribute to the comfort of the teachers, I would recommend that Mr. Findlay be permitted to proceed with the installation.\n\nW.S.

Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Federal Building, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Teachers Residence,\nSkidegate.\n\nI have to report that all concrete work has been completed in preparation for the erection of the new residence at Skidegate. The workers were extremely fortunate in having perfect weather and should it continue the actual erection of the building should progress rapidly.\n\nI would request authority to dispose of several items from the old building for sale. There are a number of doors, windows, and a quantity of wall board which when trimmed could be put to good use. Several people have applied to purchase this and money realized would assist in paying for items needed to complete the new building.\n\nFreight charges have been enormous and although I believe the total costs involved in the actual erection of the building will not exceed $5000.00 we shall have to use every dollar to best advantage. The sale of the above articles would cover costs of necessary paint, for example, and perhaps pay for some of the labor involved.\n\nSince Skidegate Village has the only real water system on the Islands, and several of the Indians have up to date plumbing installed in their homes, I would most certainly regret it if we were unable to install proper plumbing in the teachers residence. There is plenty of pipe on hand and the following are needed:\n\n1 toilet (complete - white)\n1 wash basin (wall type)\n1 wood septic tank. (Valley lumber Yard)\n\nThe bath, which is the only item of plumbing which was in the previous house, can be used for a year and replaced at a later date.\n\nI recommend that you order the above items with fittings to be shipped to Skidegate as soon as possible.\nThe problem of new stoves should be considered now. As in previous correspondence, I strongly recommend that the present kitchen range and heater be replaced with oil burning stoves. Teachers who are in school all day are greatly inconvenienced when having to return to the house to light new fires each time. I hope the cost of these will not be a charge against the $500.00 which sum is for actual construction. If so, it will be impossible to take any action in purchasing such stoves at this time.\n\nIf it is at all possible I would urge that these be purchased and shipped as soon as possible.\n\nKitchen Range - medium sized, with Queen Oil Burner installed.\n(Note: queen burner needs no forced draft)\n\nHeater - quaker - medium sized.\n\nA review of expenditures to date is as follows. (Some of these items not yet paid.)\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Pre-fab. house                            | $2712.00 |\n| Freight                                   | $82.25  |\n| Dismantling old house (labor)             | $50.00  |\n| Concrete work (labor)                     | $50.00  |\n| Brickwork (chimney and fire place)        | $25.00  |\n| Cement, bricks, etc.                      | $58.70  |\n| Freight (approximate)                     | $0.00   |\n| Heatilator (on order)                     | $49.00  |\n| Freight (approximate)                     | $10.00  |\n| Cartage of house (Skidegate)              | $50.00  |\n| Gravel, sand and cartage                  | $5.00   |\n\n$ 4224.05\n\nI would request that the sum of $500.00 be forwarded to pay labor in the erection of the house.

Findlay,\nSuperintendent,\nQueen Charlotte Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Skidegate Teachers Residence\n\nWith reference to Supt. Findlay's letter of August 10th attached I would recommend that the Department approve the installation of inside plumbing in the above mentioned building. You will note that the bath from the old teacherage and sufficient pipe is available and that it will be necessary to purchase only a toilet complete and a wash basin. Installation of these facilities will not materially increase cost of the building.\n\nRegarding the supply of an oil burning range and heater recommended by Mr. Findlay we are enquiring with respect to prices and availability of these items.\n\nWill you please have an accountable advance of $500 forwarded to Supt. Findlay to pay the cost of labour in erecting the prefabricated building.\n\nMr. Findlay is being advised that the material salvaged from the old building may not be sold but should be turned over to the Indians for improvements to homes.\n\nW.

It is noted that it will be necessary to purchase only a toilet and a wash basin.\n\nWith regard to the bath, you may be interested to know that we are providing showers only in our two room schools and are finding it much cheaper than the installation of baths.\n\nI note that you will advise later concerning the oil burning range and heater.\n\nAn accountable advance of $500. will be forwarded to Superintendent Findlay as requested.

Phillips. Mr. Phillips' account for day labor exceeded this amount but he spent a considerable number of extra hours on the job and only rendered the above amount for his labor. He considered the work of erecting the pre-fab house as a type of experiment for himself since it was the first he had handled in that way. He also asked that money already advanced be paid to the other workers and that he would wait until a further advance was received after a review of costs was made.\nFigures as shown above indicate total cost and although in excess of the $5000.00 I do not see how it could have been done for less. A six room house built for approximately $6000.00 averages $1000.00 per room which is much less than the per room cost estimated by Vancouver contractors in house construction.\n\nI would appreciate receiving the following:\n\n1. Purchase Orders as requested.\n2. Accountable advance for $565.00 to pay labor owing and to allow for completion of plumbing work.\n\nA final accounting and report will be than submitted at the close of the fiscal year.\n\nJ.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6413, file 843-8, part 2)\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Federal Bldg., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Teacherage, Skidegate.\n\nI have just returned from Skidegate and report as follows on the construction of the new teachers residence there.\n\n1. Exterior of house completed (except small portion of siding). In this respect I may say that the exact amount as listed (8 bundles, $90) was received, but an error must have been made by the supplying company in computing the amount necessary. There was no wastage and $50 are needed to complete the exterior of the building. Siding has been given one prime coat of white paint.\n\n2. Interior completed as follows:\n\n(a) All walls lined.\n(b) Doors hung.\n(c) Window & door frames completed.\n(d) Gyproc on walls.\n(e) Cracks filled & sanded.\n(f) Flooring laid.\n(g) Cupboards completed.\n(h) Walls sized.\n\nWhen I left Skidegate, interior decorating in some of the rooms was about to be started.\n\n3. Since delay was caused by non-arrival of the heatillator, I was forced to cancel same, as it was necessary to proceed with erection of the chimney. Mr. Phillips, who has shown great interest in the work was considering construction of an ordinary brick fireplace. I did not insist on it but I shall be phoning him today and will learn what action he has taken in the matter.\n4. Review of costs.\n\nDismantling $250.00\nCost of house 2712.00\nFreight on house 352.25\nCement, bricks, etc. 153.70\nFreight (approx.) 80.00\nConcrete (labor) 350.00\nBrickwork (labor) 125.00\nCartage of materials 80.00\nSand, gravel, etc. 63.00\nLabor adv. (to be rec'd) 500.00\n\n4665.95\n\nFreight charges and unforeseen increased cost of materials may cause the total costs to slightly exceed the $5000.00. If plumbing supplies are to be purchased from this amount. To date the plumbing material ordered, including septic tank have not been received and completion of the work will be held up until it reaches Skidegate.\n\nI may say that Mr. Phillips has rushed the job and the men have voluntarily spent a number of extra hours on the work.\n\nI have not yet received the $500.00 referred to in your letter of August 18th, but expect it may arrive by next mail. I would request that an additional $300.00 be forwarded to meet labour costs.\n\nJ.A.

H. BARRY ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE SKIDEGATE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL - (Date of Inspection May 29/36).\n\nOriginal on File 157-11-6.\n\nI would recommend that more attention be given to handicrafts. Some of the older boys might well be taught to carve the black slate totem poles for which the Queen Charlotte Islands are famous and for which there is always a ready sale. There is plenty of space in the large hall of this school to fix up the necessary tables at which to work. Either James McKay, Edward Collinson, or John Cross, Indians, who are good carvers of these slate totem poles, might be willing to give instruction for a small sum. The slate would have to be purchased. The whole of the work should be under the direct supervision of the Senior Teacher and should take place in the afternoon school time on say one afternoon per week from perhaps November to March, inclusive.\n\nI also would recommend that the older girls be taught fine basket work. It is a pity to see this die out in the village. Mrs. Tulip speaks English and makes good baskets. She might possibly be given an opportunity to teach this native work on another afternoon during school hours. Space could be found for this in the school hall. Certain materials would of course be wanted.\n\nA total of perhaps $100 might well be set aside from the B.C. Special Vote for this Vocational Work which I believe would prove of the greatest possible value to the children here. I should certainly like to see Vocational Work encouraged in the Indian Day Schools, as it will be of much greater importance to the Indians than much which is taught in the Senior Grades.\n\nI have given the teacher, Miss Phillips, as much help as possible, spending the morning and afternoon sessions in her room. She will I am certain respond well to the suggestions made. The schoolroom is bright and clean. There were flowers in the windows. A small children's library has been established. There were a number of well made Reading and Number Charts. With the exception of the discipline, which I consider a little weak, I was very well pleased with all I saw. The general standing of the school may be classed as \"Good\".\nSir:\n\nMasset, B.C.\n\nI have to report as follows for the Queen Charlotte Agency for the month of November 1938.\n\nThe average attendance for the Massett Indian day school was senior class 38.00 and the Junior class 38.43 at the Skidegate School the averages were Senior Class 19.52 the Junior Class 27.32. I was successful in securing Black Slate for use in the Vocational class for the making of Totem Poles etc. I have not yet secured the services of an Instructor to teach same, but hope to get this going in the near future. Dyes were given to both schools for use in basket making, these classes are proving to be very interesting to the pupils who look forward to the above work.\n\nB.T. Phillips,\nActing Indian Agent.\nI made my usual visit to the Skidegate reserve, held Council meeting visited and inspected Day school, dispensary, interviewed Fild matron, also teacher of basketry. Basketry at this school is doing very well indeed, but at the time of my visit, the Slate Totem Carving had not started, this was taken up at the Council meeting, and was assured that they would do their best to get someone to teach the pupils, other matters were taken up beneficial to the reserve, Numerous requests for relief asked for were attended to.\n\nB. T. Phillips,\nIndian Agent.\nQueen Charlotte Agency, B.C.\nApril 5th, 1946.\n\nREPORT FOR MARCH QUARTER\n\nEDUCATIONAL:\n\nThe schools of both the Massett and Skidegate Reserves were visited several times each month. At the Skidegate school the teacher of the senior room has her class well disciplined, also in this class manual training has been introduced, and the boys have made a bookcase with doors, and shelves for their room. I have recommended that tools be purchased for their use, to encourage them in this work. At the Massett school both the teachers commenced their duties in February, and are doing very well with their classes. They are very active in social work on the Reserve, have a teenage canteen and a kindergarten for those under school age under their supervision. The junior teacher (Mrs Conroy) was taken out by plane March 17th with a throat affection to Prince Rupert, but returned to her duties March 25th. Both teachers are very well liked by the Indians of the Reserve.\n\nB. T. Phillips,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 25, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $40.00 for tools and material required for manual training at the Skidegate Indian Day School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Phillips has submitted a requisition for various tools and materials required for manual training at the Skidegate Indian Day School. These items are available in Vancouver at an approximate cost of $40.00 and I would recommend that authority be granted to purchase them.\n\nFor D. M.

D. McLear,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Bitchburn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nExtract of letter received from Archbishop N. McNeil,\nDated Vancouver, April 29, 1912. re Sechelt Boarding School\nOriginal on File 177517-5.\n\nIf a day school were started there, offering\na salary sufficient to secure the services of a good man\nwho has a practical knowledge of agriculture, some real im-\nprovement ought to result. There are over thirty school\nchildren in that settlement. A young and active priest is\nnow in charge of all the lower Fraser camps, and he is do-\ning all he can. It is quite useless to offer $60 or $70\nper month to a teacher. You can get one for that amount\nperhaps, but not one of influence upon the Indians. I\nasked the Chilliwack chief if his people would build a\nschool themselves in case a teacher were assured. He said\nthey would.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nN. McNeil\nArbp.\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 2nd, last, File No. 411846/1, dealing with a recommendation of His Grace Archbishop McNeill of Vancouver with respect to the establishment of a day school at Chilliwack, I beg to report as follows:-\n\nIn my opinion there are sufficient children of school age on the Reserve of the Catholic Faith to warrant the establishment of a day school, and a good average attendance at the same. This matter I discussed with Chief Harry Stewart of the Squah Reserve in April last, and again on my recent visit to Chilliwack. I read to him the contents of the Department's letter, and he has promised to lay the matter before the Indians to see how far they would assist in the building of the School, and how many children they will guarantee being regular attendants, and to write to me as to what conclusions they have come to. This information I will forward to the Department as soon as it is received.\n\nAs to the suggestion of His Grace the Archbishop that the teacher should have a practical knowledge of Agriculture, I do not think that it would be necessary, for he would have very little time at his disposal to\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nto devote to giving instruction in farming. I think, however, that in the event of a school being established the Department should be prepared to pay the teacher a salary equivalent to that paid by the Provincial Government to its teachers in rural schools of the same grade, which I find upon perusal of the Reports are not less than $50.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, September 26, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant in reference to the establishment of a day school at Chilliwack in your inspectorate.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will await further information respecting the erection of a building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. T. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, August 1st, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of May 1st, last, with reference to the establishment of a school on the Skeah Reserve, Chilliwack District. I beg to say that the Department has decided to proceed with this work and tenders have been called for receivable at Ottawa September 8th. Copy of the plans and specifications are being sent you. You will be good enough to return them immediately after the date above mentioned.\n\nBe good enough to take up with the Agent, Mr. Peter Byrne, the question of the site, so that when the contract is let, there will be no delay in having the work proceeded with. This site should be high and dry and there should be sufficient land in connection with the school to form a good play-ground. The question of a water supply should also be kept in mind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Ditolburn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nMay 14, 1913.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIn April 1912, His Grace Archbishop McNeill, then Archbishop of Vancouver, brought to the attention of the Department the necessity of a school at the Chilliwack district. The suggestion was that the Indians would build a school if the Department would provide the salary of the teacher. The matter has been gone into by Mr. Inspector Ditchburn, who under date of last instant reports that these Indians while expressing their desire for a school have not funds to put up a building.\n\nA school could be centrally located to serve five reserves and also two others about two miles distant. The Chief states that an average attendance of 35 children would be assured.\n\nIt would appear advisable to provide educational facilities for these reserves. The Department has a plan for a modest building to accommodate 40 pupils which might be used. And I would recommend that the work be taken as soon as possible. Funds will be available from the school vote of the current year. If you approve kindly indicate the papers in which the advertisement for tenders should appear.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are also some children on the Tzeachteen and the Yuk-kwe-kwi-oose reserve who might be able to attend the\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nthe school, though these two reserves are about two miles distant.\n\nChief Harry Stewart states that they could be sure of an average attendance of 35 children at least. The Chilliwack Indians as a rule do not leave their reserves to go to the canneries during the fishing season, but all take part in the hop-picking at Chilliwack in September and the children also go to the hop fields. The Chief is of the opinion that if a school is to be built that arrangements should be made that the holidays should be given in the month of September instead of July so that there would not be too many breaks in the school terms.\n\nI have no hesitation in saying that a day school, conducted by a competent teacher, would prove of much benefit to the Indians of Chilliwack, and that one should be established there, large enough to accommodate at least forty pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ritter\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you kindly consider my application for the post of teacher at the Indian School, Chilliwack, B.C.\n\nI was educated at Stonyhurst College, England, where I gained prizes in classics and mathematics, afterwards receiving certificates from the science and arts' department, South Kensington, London, for mining surveying, in which work I trained junior pupils.\n\nI have been resident in British Columbia for over two years, gaining a knowledge of the customs and habits both in the towns and country districts.\n\nI am married, thoroughly steady, sober & active, with every confidence of giving satisfaction if appointed.\n\nMay I be allowed to suggest that \"the salary offered is very small,\" a house with light & heat should be provided, or an allowance made for suitable rooms in the neighborhood of the school.\n\nI shall be pleased to give any further particulars, or wait upon you at your convenience.\n\nTrusting to receive a favorable reply,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nWalter H. Grimshaw\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6414, file 844-1, part 1)\nExtract from Monthly Report of Inspector R. H. Cairns on the Skwah Indian Day School, dated March 18, 1915. Original on File 411646-6.\n\nTeacher,\n\nMr. Walter Herman Grimeshaw is doing fairly good work. He is methodical and energetic, but lacking in training as a teacher. He thinks that the Department should supply him with fuel and light. His salary is Fifty dollars per month and a free house.\n\nPupils,\n\nThere were 44 pupils on the roll, and of these 20 were present on the day of my visit. The average for the quarter ended Dec. 31st, was 22.25 pupils. This is just 50% of the enrolment. This is scarcely satisfactory in order to get fair results.\n\nSgd. R. H. Cairns,\nInspector.\nOttawa, July 17, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant stating that the teacher of the Skawah Indian Day School desires permission to allow his pupils to take their holidays in two short terms, one during the month of July and the other in September.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the explanation given in your letter, this request may be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst.

As the parents of these children go to the hop-fields in the latter period, it will be difficult for him to keep up the regular attendance during that time, I would therefore respectfully recommend that the request be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 12th, 1914.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nIn the annual report of Mr. T. Wilson, Inspector of Indian Orchards, reference is made to the subject of gardening in connection with the new Chilliwack Day School where excellent land is available. I am writing this with a view to obtaining a report as to what has been done this year and I should ask you to give every encouragement to the work at this point.\n\nI may add that a general letter in reference to fruit culture in British Columbia is going forward in a day or two to yourself and other Agents.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSir,\n\nVisits have been paid from time to time to the different industrial and Boarding schools and instruction in horticultural matters given wherever possible. Many of the ex-pupils are taking kindly to Agriculture and Horticulture; one I know has been working for two years with a market gardener and florist, and he is as much at home in the greenhouse as out in the field. I gave him his first lesson in the business. A new day school has been built near Chilliwack, and there is a considerable amount of excellent land adjoining which the Indians have ploughed and harrowed, we hope later on to have the pupils do some gardening - flower and vegetable.\n\n(Sgd.) Tom Wilson,\nInspector of Indian Orchards.\nOttawa, February 20, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing an application from Mr. Walter H. Grimshaw for the position of teacher in the new school on the Skwah Reserve, Chilliwack, B.C.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will accept Mr. Grimshaw's services and will allow him a salary of $600.00 per annum.\n\nI may mention that the school material asked for by you was ordered from the Government Stationery Office on the 31st ultimo and will no doubt arrive soon.\n\nYou will be further advised in reference to the question of erecting a teacher's residence in connection with this school, which is referred to in another communication from you of the same date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B. C.\nFebruary 13th, 1914.\n\nSir:-\n\nOwing to the comparatively small salary paid to the teachers of Indian Schools in this Province, it is very difficult at times to get a competent person to take on the work. When the new school on the Skwah Indian Reserve is open we expect an attendance of from thirty-five to forty pupils and it is the intention to cultivate a field of some five or six acres in the vicinity of the building, and to instruct the boys in the growing of grain, vegetables and all kinds of small fruits.\n\nMr. T. Wilson, Inspector of Indian Orchards, has taken a great interest in this work of encouraging the Indians to cultivate the soil and grow crops to the best advantage, and I can assure the Department that the education of the Indian children along these lines will be very beneficial to them. In order to carry out the work as outlined, it would be advisable to have a man and his wife in charge of this school, and as Mr. Grimshaw states in his application, it would be desirable if the Department favourably consider the erection of a small cottage, about four rooms, where the teacher and his family could reside. I believe that the cost of such a cottage would not exceed $1,000.00, and the advantages to the Department and the Indians, in having a permanent and satisfactory teacher would be great, as the Indians study very much better under the directions of a teacher with whom they are well acquainted than they would with a stranger.\nI may add that at most of the other Indian schools, accommodation is provided for the teacher in the same building in which the classes are held, but the building at Skwah being only one story does not allow for this. I would therefore respectfully recommend that the Department favourably consider the erection of a cottage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.\nFebruary 13th, 1914.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith application received by me from Mr. Walter H. Grimshaw for the position of teacher at the new school recently erected on the Skwah Indian Reserve, Chilliwack, B.C. Most of the furniture for this school was purchased from the Chilliwack School Board, and the school will be ready just as soon as supplies are received from the Department.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that this school be open as soon as possible, as it is necessary to keep fires going daily to prevent the plaster from becoming damp.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEXTRACT\nORIGINAL ON FILE....16070-87 F....B.C.\n\nEXTRACT FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF W.H. GRINGHAM, TEACHER OF THE SKYAH DAY SCHOOL FOR YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31st, 1916.\n\nI suggest that the government instruct the Indian Agent to speak firmly to the chiefs and enforce a fine on the parents or guardians for non-attendance of children.\n\nIS THERE A TRUANT OFFICER,-NO.\nOttawa, November 25th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge that part of your letter of the 30th instant, in which you inform the Department that the Skwah day school was closed on October 18th, owing to an outbreak of measles.\n\nThe Department trusts that the spread of the disease has been checked and that the school will soon reopen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nFor the information of the Department I beg to report that on the 15th ultimo, I visited the Skwah Indian school, which was closed by order of the Medical Health Office as a result of an outbreak of measles among the children living on the Skwah reserve. From the records of the school it appears that up until the time the pupils began to get sick there was a good attendance and satisfactory progress was being made by them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPeter Byrne\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOttawa, June 30, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, and in reply I beg to say that the pupils of the Skwah Indian Day School may have their usual summer vacation during the months of August and September, instead of July and August, so that they may go with their parents during the hop picking season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nNew Westminster, B. C.\n\nJune 23rd.\n\nSir,\n\nI would respectfully ask for permission to allow the pupils of the Skwah Indian Day School, Chilliwack, B. C., to have their usual summer vacation during the months of August and September, instead of July and August; as this will enable the children to go with their parents during the hop-picking season. I may add that this request is made at the suggestion of Mr. W. H. Grimshaw, the teacher of Skwah School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 12, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant recommending that permission be granted to the teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School to allow the Indian children attending his school to have their holidays during the months of August and September, instead of during July and August.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the fact that this school was kept open during the month of July, the pupils may have their holidays during the months of August and September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nI beg to recommend that permission be granted to the teacher of the Skwash Indian Day School, Chilliwack, B.C., to allow the children attending his school to have their holidays during the months of August and September, instead of during July and August.\n\nOwing to the fact that the hop-yards are situated in the vicinity of this school, and that the children accompany their parents during the hop-picking the average attendance is very low during the month of September; and in order to raise the average for the year the teacher kept the school open during the month of July.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 41846/1 of the 9th inst., I believe that the teachers having quarters in connection with the schools where they teach, use the fuel & light provided for the school house generally, therefore I thought that the cottage provided for the teacher at above named school should be allowed wood & oil, which I suggested when applying for the position of teacher & which I was given to understand latter, the inspector would recommend, especially as I have to do my clerical work for the school, at the cottage after school hours, & on holidays. Again, the several rooms, though not in constant use, have to be kept well aired & dry in the wet season.\n\nI would like to draw your attention to the fact of my having provided all the furniture for the cottage & paid for transportation which item cost me $50.00, also having provided rooms for myself from March to August of last year & for which I have received no allowance, I would therefore most respectfully crave the careful consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nWalter H.

Grimshaw, Esq.,\nChilliwack,\nB. C.\nWith reference to the application of Walter H. Grimshaw, teacher of the Skwah Indian School, for an increase of salary and a refund for the sum of $50.00 paid by him for transporting his furniture from Vancouver, I beg to say that Mr. Grimshaw was placed in charge of this school in March, 1914, at a salary of $600.00, and in his application for the position, addressed to Mr. Agent Byrne, he stipulated for a house with light and heat or an allowance for suitable rooms in the neighbourhood of the school. It was decided to provide living quarters and a house be put up, but was not completed until August 1914, and in the meantime he and his wife had to make other arrangements.\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns reports favourably on his work, and as he was put to extra expense while waiting for the completion of the teacher's residence and in\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I beg of you to kindly consider the following. I was placed in full charge of the \"Bracken Indian Day School\" here, in March 1914, at a salary of $600 per annum. In the provision of a furnished cottage and residence, for five months I had to pay for board and residence for my wife and self, until August 14, when a cottage was completed. I had my furniture transported from Vancouver at a personal cost of $50.00, so I had made the suggestion to the Indian Agent, that my furniture was suitable for permanently furnishing the teacher's residence; however, I have not received one cent towards the salary, nor for a few additional necessary furnishings, although I have on many occasions asked Mr. Byrne, as well as Mr. Odelburn, both of whom premise more than two years back, to endeavour to secure me an increase in salary, as also did Mr. Coombs the school inspector.\n\nI most respectfully ask you to grant me a substantial war bonus, added to my present poor salary, and to have your opinion on the question of refunding the cost of furniture transportation allowance, toward the first five months' lodgings. I have helped the Indians in very many ways; I have on many occasions provided the poor Indian children with meals, when I have found they had not been provided at home; also my wife and I have distributed Christmas gifts to the school children for the past four years.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nExtract from letter from Agent Byrne dated June 12, 1917. Original on 411846/7.\n\nFor the information of the Department I beg to report that I visited the Skwah Indian Day School on the 7th ultimo, there were 10 children present, 6 in the first standard and 4 in the second. I regret to state that the attendance continues small, although I have spoken to the Chief and members of the Band, and urged upon them the necessity of giving their children an education, particularly when such a good opportunity is afforded them to do so. I believe it is impossible to force the parents to send their children to school, the only satisfactory method being persuasion and encouragement, in fact they need coaxing, as it is difficult to drive Indians. We hope, however, to have a better attendance as soon as the Indians have finished their spring planting and return to their village. Generally speaking, the health of the children is good and they are making rapid progress.\nOttawa, March 3rd, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn his annual report on the Skeah day school, the teacher, Mr. W.H. Grimes reports that the attendance is unsatisfactory.\n\nOn your next visit to this reserve, you should impress on the Indians the advantage and necessity of them sending their children to school, regularly.\n\nYou might, also, advise the Department of the name of an Indian, who would be capable to act as truant officer.\n\nIt is hoped that as a result of your interest in this matter, the attendance at this school, will improve.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nChilliwack, B.C.\nDecember 22nd 1919.\n\n530846\n\nre: \"Shuswap Indian Day School.\"\n\nSir,\n\nIn response to your letter of the 5th inst., wherein you state that \"the average attendance at your school is only twelve,\" permit me to point out the average for four years to Dec. 31st, 1917, was 17.71 and for the five years to Dec. 31st, 1918, = 16.11. In further to this, I beg to inform you that there have been a large number of deaths, since marriages & many migrations among my pupils, without a corresponding increase of children of school age, but this deficit is now beginning to be obliterated.\n\nI most respectfully claim that my qualifications for instructing the Indians & assisting in departmental work, are higher than the average Normal School trained teacher; this apart from my outside world experience, professional & commercial.\n\nI do not desire to receive more consideration than given to other Indian teachers; but certainly thought that, as the Board Service Commissioners had recommended a bonus of $420.00 per annum for heads of households, I might be allowed more than $150.00, still hoping for this & regretting any trouble caused you by this lengthy correspondence; I desire to help the department in any way possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWalter H. Grimshaw\n\nDuncan & Scott Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6414, file S44-1, part 1)\nOttawa, December 5, 1919.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, in reference to the bonus paid you for the present fiscal year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it was decided that the payment of a bonus of $150.00 would be a fair allowance to the teachers of our Indian schools, taking into consideration the salaries paid. In your case, for example, you are now paid a salary of $900.00, the highest so far as Indian schools are concerned, in the province of British Columbia, and a salary which compares favourably with that paid to teachers of rural schools in the province. Taking into consideration the fact that you have no professional qualifications and that the average attendance at your school is only twelve, it is thought that you are being fairly treated when you are allowed a bonus of $150.00, making your total salary $1,050.00 per annum, with free residence.\n\nAs intimated above, all teachers in British Columbia are being dealt with on the same basis and it is not proposed to make any exception in your case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWalter H. Grimshaw, Esq.,\nChilliwack, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. MacKenzie,\n\nMr. Walter H. Grimshaw, who claims the full bonus of $420.00, first entered the service of the Department on March 5, 1914, at the time the Skwah Day School was first started. His salary was at the rate of $600.00 per annum, which was increased on April 1st, 1918, to $750.00, and further increased to $900.00 per annum from January 1st, 1919.\n\nThere is an enrolment of 24 pupils and an average attendance of 12.\n\nHe has no teacher's certificate and, except for the five years he has been in this school, has had no experience. Mr. Inspector Cairns states that the teacher's methods and his manner do not tend to bring out the best from the pupils. The senior pupils read and spell fairly well, but they cannot do much in Arithmetic. They can do the simple rules, but fail in the application of them and it is difficult to get them to answer questions. He says the teacher seems to take particular pride in the junior pupils and wanted him to note how well they did, but he failed to see anything remarkable in their work. He further states that he is convinced that the school will not reach a high standard under Mr. Grimshaw. He states that the teacher is neat and orderly and keeps everything tidy and has many admirable characteristics.\n\nMr. Grimshaw received a bonus for the fiscal year 1918-19 of $150.00 and is being paid at the same rate for the present fiscal year.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Grimshaw's letter claiming full bonus of $420.00, I beg to say that all School Teachers were awarded a bonus of $150.00 with the exception of Miss Mary Moffitt of the Cape Croker Day School who is getting $300.00. Unless Mr. Grimshaw has some special claim for a greater bonus than the others receive I fail to see why he should receive anything further.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAccountant\n\nOttawa, December 2, 1919.\nShoah Indian Day School,\nChilliwack, B.C.,\nNovember 22, 1919.\n\nNo 411846-1.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th inst., wherein you state that the bonus allowed me for the fiscal year beginning April 1st, is $150.00; I most respectfully ask you to grant me the $420.00 per annum, as arranged by the Civil Service Commission, for both inside & outside servants\u2014heads of families\u2014receiving less than $1200.00 salary; to this increased bonus I feel I am justly entitled, especially considering the increased cost of living. I do not presume to inform you, that prices of commodities still advance. I would again bring to your notice, the fact that I have not been allowed anything for room rent, for five months in the year 1914, previous to a cottage being provided, or which I furnished entirely at my own expense.\n\nI earnestly beg you to carefully consider & grant my request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWalter H. Guinchard\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, in which you request that an increase be made in your salary as teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School, and also requesting to be informed as to the amount of the bonus in which you are entitled to receive from April 1st, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your salary was increased from $750.00 per year to $900.00 from January 1, 1919 and you have been paid at this increased rate since that date. Nine hundred dollars is the highest salary paid by the Department to teachers in any of its Indian Day Schools. Besides receiving salary at that rate you are also entitled to a bonus at the rate of $150.00 a year, payable quarterly, for the fiscal year beginning April 1st, last. You have been sent cheques for the bonus due for the quarter ending June 30th and September 30th last. The combined salary and bonus paid you amounts to $1,050.00 per year and no further increase in salary can be made at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nWalter H. Grimshaw, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSkwah Indian Day School,\nChilliwack,\nB. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wrote on August 9th, 1919, referring to your letter of July 29th, 1919, No. 510581, asking that I should be allowed a higher salary than $900.00 per annum, as some teachers in the New Westminster, B.C., district, are being paid at a higher rate for no greater service than I render to the department, and I respectfully requested that I might receive the additional pay from the date of such increase, which I believe to be April 1st, 1919.\n\nI regret that I have not received any answer to my letter, nor a cheque for a larger amount than $225.00 viz.: No. 1507, October 1919, for salary to the 30th ult.\n\nMay I ask for your kind consideration of the above matter as a remittance for the difference in salary paid to me, pending the re-consideration of teachers' salaries.\n\nWould you also inform me as to the question of bonus, decided by the Civil Service Commissioners, and if I am not entitled to such bonus, at the rate of $420.00 per annum from April 1st, or the cost of clothes, general commodities, is prohibitive for a married man receiving only $900.00 a year.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nAttorney.\n\nWalter H. Grimsley\nOttawa, May 30, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, in which you ask that you be granted an increased bonus, or failing this, a flat remuneration of $100.00 per month for your services as teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is unable to grant you any further increase in your salary at the present time. I may inform you, however, that the whole question of salaries of teachers of Indian day schools is receiving consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWalter H. Grimshaw, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSkwah Indian Day School,\nChilliwack, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ult., I beg to state that I did not ask for payment for janitor's services, as the amount you have granted, given in payment of work done by the Indians; but during the last five years, I have paid for certain services rendered by the natives, in connection with the school, that should have been charged to the Department; also having provided a certain amount of store wood, as well as cattle prices for the benefit of the children, which I trust will, in the future, be granted by the authorities.\n\nI certainly did expect a greater increase in salary than that so kindly arranged by your letter of March 27th, for which honor I am grateful; but viewing the steady increase in the cost of living, with some alarm, I respectfully ask that I may be granted an increased bonus, or failing this, a flat remuneration of $100 per month.\n\nTrusting for your favorable consideration,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWalter H. Grimsby\n\nIndian Affairs.

In addition to my salary, I would most respectfully ask you to favourably consider my request of March 17th.\n\nSince taking charge of the Shuswap Indian Day School, I have paid out over $50 in purchasing candy for the pupils who swept out and dusted the classrooms. I suggest you might have me refunded at least some portion of this sum. Should be pleased to have your instructions as to whether I can charge a weekly debt against the janitor account, for the future, or give the children cash for their little duties, such as, brushing water, window cleaning, etc. I would like it clearly understood that the $50.00 for janitor work, is not in any way payment to me, but I shall be out of pocket for several months, as I have to pay cash when the Indian women do the work, which I have already done.

The funds at its disposal are very limited and, while it is realized that the salaries paid the teachers are small, no increases can be given until the appropriation for school purposes is considerably increased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Considering the fact that you have no professional qualifications, it is considered that you are being fairly treated as regards the remuneration which you receive.\n\nI may say that the bonus for the present fiscal year is being continued to teachers at the same rate as formerly, namely, $150.00 per annum, payable quarterly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWalter H. Grimshaw, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSkwah Indian Day School,\nChilliwack, B.C.\nOttawa, May 20, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to say that Mr. R. H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools in British Columbia has made recommendation to the department to the effect that the Chehalis Indian Day school should be visited once a year by a medical man, and he has suggested that Dr. P. McCaffrey of Agassiz be instructed to make the necessary medical inspection. While Chehalis is in the New Westminster Agency and Dr. McCaffrey of Agassiz is a medical attendant on behalf of Indians of the Lytton Agency, yet he does not live far from the Chehalis School, and the Department will be glad to have you arrange to have him visit the said Indians as proposed. He should make report to the Department after having inspected the pupils and the school.\n\nMr. Cairns has also recommended that a doctor visit the Skwah school. It appears that this school is about one mile from Chilliwack where Dr. J. G. Henderson, a salaried medical officer of the Department resides. You should, therefore, request Dr. Henderson to go to the school and examine the pupils and make report thereon to the Department. Mr. Cairns has stated that very many pupils of this school die, for which reason he has suggested medical inspection. He states further that he considers that the pupils should be examined once or twice each year. When making arrangements to have Dr. Henderson visit the school, you should advise him of the statements made in this matter by Mr. Cairns.\n\nYou should arrange to have both of the above mentioned schools visited at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB.

You are at present receiving as high a remuneration as is allowed, except in one instance, in the province of British Columbia and in this case the teacher possesses special qualifications.

In the event of his being unable to continue then, I do not think I would trouble with a temporary teacher for the balance of the School year, as the Indians begin to drop off berry picking etc., and the attendance is usually very small during the greater part of the term.\n\nI will report to you again on the matter in April.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.H.

H. Grimshaw, teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School, and stating that it is essential that he have a complete rest for several months. In this connection I beg to say that the Department will allow Mr. Grimshaw leave of absence for the balance of the school year, but can only allow him payment of salary for two months. We understand that he gave up duties at the end of December, and, therefore, salary can only be continued to him until the end of the present month.\n\nIf you consider that this school should be kept open, please state what temporary arrangements you can make for the carrying on of the work during the balance of the school year to June 30th, next. Please give this question early attention, and report whether you desire the school work to be continued, and if you can obtain a temporary teacher.

This has become worse and three days previous to my visit he left for Vancouver to consult a specialist. He was to return in a week. It is feared that the complaint with which he has been stricken is either tuberculosis or cancer. The school was closed. The agent, Mr. Daunt, is in touch with the situation. I have just phoned St. Paul's Hospital. Mr. Grimshaw returned to Chilliwack yesterday January 16th.\n\nR. H.

I regret to inform you, in reply, that such an extended leave could not be arranged in the case of a teacher of an Indian day school. Arrangements have been made in the past in one or two cases for one month's sick leave with pay. In view of Mr. Grimshaw's length of service, it might be possible to arrange for a two months' leave. If such permission would be of advantage to him and he will forward a doctor's certificate relative to the necessity for his absence, favourable consideration will be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Grimshaw, teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School, in which he explains the nature of an illness he is suffering from, and requests six months leave of absence with pay.\n\nMr. Grimshaw has had charge of the Skwah School since 1914, and has discharged his duties under very unpleasant circumstances with great efficiency and credit, considering the calibre of the Indians he is dealing with, and I would recommend that any consideration or assistance it is possible for the Department to extend to him by granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.J.

I was over absent from duty from March 1924\nto June 1924.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWalter H. Grimshaw\nIndian Agent\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, March 21, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 9th instant, in which you apply for an increased salary or a continuation of the bonus.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department is not prepared to increase your salary as teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School. Your remuneration compares more than favourably with that received by other teachers of Indian schools, some of whom are highly qualified. I am pleased to inform you, however, that there is some probability that the bonus of $15 per teaching month will be continued during the fiscal year 1923-24.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am informed that Mr. Grimshaw, principal of the Chilliwack Indian Day School, has been granted leave of absence on account of ill health, till the end of July, but with half pay only until the end of March 1925.\n\nMost probably nothing has been said to you of the nature of Mr. Grimshaw's sickness, but it is general belief here that the poor man is suffering from cancer in the throat, or some other fatal disease which he may have contracted in the discharge of his many years of service among the Indians.\n\nWe consider his case to be quite hopeless and are advising him to return with his wife to England. Unfortunately his funds are very low and for this reason I now appeal to the Department to grant him his regular salary up to the end of the scholastic year. This I judge could easily be allowed as you already have the appropriation for that period, one quarter's salary is not a big amount but under the circumstances would benefit him immensely.\n\nMay I be permitted to add that the school attendance in Chilliwack is invariably small after Easter, and as Mr. Grimshaw will continue to occupy the teacher's cottage for a couple of months or more, he may reasonably be considered to be at his post until the end of the present term.\n\nIn making my urgent request I can assure you that I am not alone, in fact I feel safe in saying that every person in this Agency, who is in anyway connected with the Indian Department, will support me.\n\nLooking forward to a favorable reply,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of the distressing circumstances in his case, he has been allowed to live in the teacher's residence and has been paid his salary in full to June 30th.\n\nIt is regrettable that there is no way in which he could be allowed superannuation.

I believe that the only course open to us, if help is to be given to Mrs. Grimshaw, is to secure the authority of His Excellency in Council for a gratuity or retiring allowance. As Dr. Scott stated in his recent letter to you, it is regrettable that there is no way in which superannuation could be provided. The circumstances are so distressing that I am sure Council will view the matter in a favourable light and will give the Department authority to issue a cheque in Mrs. Grimshaw's favour for $620 - which is equivalent to 4 months' salary for her late husband.\n\nMrs. Grimshaw would be well advised to correspond with Mr. Indian Agent Daunt, of New Westminster, giving an address which will find her in two or three weeks' time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLEAM\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nE. A. Munro, Esq., M.P.,\nChilliwack,\nB.C.\nMEMO. FOR FILE.\n\nSeptember 5th, 1925.\n\nI have made a study of payments that have been made to teachers of Indian day schools upon retirement. The Department has decided that, whereas they appear to be in the class known as 'temporary Civil Servants', they are not eligible for superannuation under the 1924 Act. (See file #129-18).\n\nI have learned that in the past there have been payments of a gratuity or retiring allowance in the case of 9 teachers. (See list attached). The amounts of the payments varied from 2 to 6 months' salary. Vouchers were prepared showing that the payments were retiring allowances or gratuities. No authority was secured other than that of the Deputy Superintendent General, and on one or two occasions that of the Hon. the Minister. The Auditor General to my knowledge - and I have carefully examined the files - has never questioned these payments.\n\nIt was the Department's wish to give a gratuity in the case of the teacher of the Skawah Indian School, who suffered from ill-health during the last few months of his incumbency, and died during the summer months. Mr. Paget and Mr. MacKenzie are of the opinion that authority is necessary before any payment of more than 2 months' salary can be given. I phoned Mr. Douglas, of the Auditor General's Department, and he concurs in this opinion.\n\nOn at least three occasions (see list attached), teachers of Indian day schools, who have given long service, have been granted not only two months' gratuity but an annuity. Authority of His Excellency in Council was secured for each of these actions.\n\nRussell F.

(RG 10, Volume 6414, file 844-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have been instructed by Mr. W. E. Ditchburn, Indian Commissioner, who paid a recent visit to this office, to once more lay the case of Mrs. Grimshaw, widow of the late Mr. W. Grimshaw, teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School, before you.\n\nThe Department paid the late teacher's salary for practically six months during which he was an invalid previous to his death, and after his demise you yourself were instrumental in obtaining for the widow a compassionate grant of $420.00. It is, therefore recognized by all parties concerned that the Department has fulfilled to the utmost any obligations which it might have in the case.\n\nThis unfortunate woman is in very poor health, and has very little money left, about $300.00 to be exact, and it is desired to return her to relatives in England, who while unable to bear the cost of her transportation, have expressed their willingness to furnish her with a home if she goes there.\n\nMr. Ditchburn discussed the matter with me at some length, and we, of course, recognized that it would be quite impossible to obtain any further financial assistance for her, but we thought that it might be possible to obtain some concession from the Canadian National Railway Company and Government Steamers regarding her transportation to England from Vancouver, and I have been instructed to lay the matter before you from this angle.\n\nIf there is any manner in which the Railway Service could furnish her with transportation, as the indigent widow of a deceased servant of the Government it would greatly simplify her return to her relatives.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O'N.

I regret that this department considered the authority of His Excellency in Council to be sufficient in this case.

Such an attitude is altogether contrary to my nature, and was altogether unworthy of me.\n\nThe only explanation, (and that a poor one) is that Mrs. Moroney and I had spent two miserable days trying to keep the house warm. In spite of two big fires, every pipe in the house froze, including the sink and the toilet, and to add to our misfortunes, the pipe burst and flooded the house. But these trials were no excuse for my not being prepared for you.\n\nMrs. Moroney joins me in this apology, and trusts that you will pardon her too. We now realize the grave inconvenience you were put to, and we regret sincerely any disrespect which we may have been guilty of.\n\nTrusting that you will accept this sincere apology from us both\n\nI am, dear Captain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n\"J.J. Moroney\"\n\nCaptain G.H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nVictoria, B.C.\nExtract from Report of Mr. Inspector G.H. Barry, dated February 26th, 1931, on his inspection of the SKWAH Indian Day School.\n\nOriginal on File 153-3-6.\n\nName:- J. J. Maroney. Age:- 58.\n\nSalary:- $1050 per annum, with $50 per annum as janitor.\n\nQualifications:- High School teacher's license Melbourne; 35 years experience, 17 years of which has been in Indian Schools.\n\nHealth:- Good.\n\nSuccess:- Fair; I do not consider Mr. Maroney particularly well qualified for the teaching of young children.\n\nI am not very satisfied with this school; but as the children are clean and are learning to read and write, I am not prepared to make any special recommendation at the present time.\nOttawa, April 10, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI have your l-8-o of the 31st ultimo, concerning Mrs. Grimshaw, widow of the late teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School. As you are already aware, I am very sympathetic in this case; but I regret to state that the free issue of transportation by the railroads is no longer permissible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nIn accordance with the instructions issued to me, and in view of the fact that I am not satisfied with the work now being done at the Skwah Indian Day School by the teacher Mr. J.J. Moroney, I beg to recommend to the Department that this teacher be removed from his appointment as from the end of the present school year in June 1932.\n\nIn view of the fact that Mr. J.J. Moroney has been in the service of the Department of Indian Affairs for a number of years, and that Mrs. Moroney is at present the Field Matron on the Skwah Reserve, I wish to suggest that Mr. J.J. Moroney be given a temporary appointment as teacher of the Fort Babine Indian Day School, and that Mrs. Moroney be transferred to that point as Field Matron.\n\nI wish also to recommend that the teacher at the Fort Babine Indian Day School, and the Field Matron there, Mr. G.O. Daly and Mrs. Daly be transferred to similar appointments at the Skwah Indian Day School.\n\nMr. G.O. Daly is anxious for a transfer to some district where he may obtain better education for his daughter. He is a well qualified teacher, holding an Alberta First Class Teacher's Certificate. The reports which he has received from Alberta Provincial Inspectors are very good. I believe that he might be able to make something of the present, more or less hopeless, condition of affairs in the Skwah Day School.\n\nThe suggestion of transferring Mr. and Mrs. Moroney for a time to Fort Babine is only made in view of the past services of these people to the Department. I do not consider that he need receive much consideration in view of his actions as reported.\n\nVictoria, B.C.\nFebruary 12, 1932.\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\n[Signature]\nGerald H. Barry\nOttawa, February 17, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/24017 of the 11th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Barry's report on the Skwah Indian Day School. Your recommendation, to transfer Mr. and Mrs. Moroney to the Fort Babine Indian Day School during the summer, is approved. Mr. Moroney will receive $1100 for his services as teacher, and Mrs. Moroney, $300 as field matron. Mr. and Mrs. Daly will be moved to the Skwah School before the first of September. He will be allowed $1000 per teaching year and she will be given $480 for her services as field matron. This will be a slight increase for the Dalys' and a decrease in the case of the Moroneys' total salary. These figures may be subject to a ten per cent cut for the time being.\n\nI am writing to each Indian Agent concerned, with instructions that the teachers and field matrons be informed. Please inform Archbishop Duke of the proposed change.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, February 17, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has decided to make a change at the Skwah Indian Day School at the end of the current academic year. Please inform Mr. and Mrs. Moroney that they are to be transferred to the Fort Babine Indian Day School, in the Babine agency. Mr. Moroney will be allowed salary at $1100 for the ten teaching months and Mrs. Moroney will receive $300 per annum for her services as field matron. Please inform them and ask them for an acceptance in writing of the work at Fort Babine. The Indian Agent at Hazelton is Mr. G. C. Mortimer.\n\nTo replace these workers, Mr. and Mrs. C. O. Daly will be moved from Fort Babine to Skwah. Mr. Daly will receive $1000 for the ten teaching months, and Mrs. Daly, $480 per annum as field matron.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'H. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am herewith enclosing report of Captain Gerald Berry, District Inspector of Indian Schools, in connection with his recent visit to the Skwah Indian Day School, of the New Westminster Agency. His report is an adverse one insofar as the capabilities of the teacher, Mr. J.J. Horoney, are concerned and he has recommended that both Mr. and Mrs. Horoney should be transferred to Fort Bobine and Mr. and Mrs. C.O. Daly, of the latter place, be brought down to Chilliwack, the former as teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School and the latter as field astron. This recommendation, however, is only made in view of the fact that both Mr. and Mrs. Horoney have been in the service of the Department for a considerable number of years and I would recommend that the Department act on the school inspector's suggestion in this respect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nMarch 8, 1932\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur agent Mr. Smith, informed us today that owing to the report of Inspector Barry, the District Head had decided to transfer Mrs. Murray and myself to Fort Barrie. This information was astounding and distressing to us both. We regard it as unfortunate and disturbing to us both. We regard it as unfortunate and disturbing to us both. We regard it as unfortunate and disturbing to us both. We regard it as unfortunate and disturbing to us both.\n\nIn justice to Mrs. Murray and myself, I feel what should write to you to inquire why we should be so treated in such a manner. We charge that we have been treated unfairly and unjustly. We believe that our complaints will have always been heard, and I think they have stood well in the estimation of the officials of the Department, at least those who knew us well, seem to be a difficult question to solve.\n\nIt seems to me that we are accused of dishonesty. I feel there is one thing that we should faithfully do. The following are the facts as I know them.\n\nI met Inspector Barry on the streets of Chilliwack on Wednesday Jan. 27. After a few minutes, I asked him when we might expect him. He told me he did not know what he might be recalled to Ottawa, as the Commissioner was in the hospital dangerously ill. Later he said that it would probably only be next week. His last words were, \"Now, mind I promise nothing.\"\n\nOn Friday night a fierce north-east wind set in. The wind is the terror of the people here. It usually blows for three or four days, and, like all blizzards it's dangerous to be out in it. Our cottage, a frame building could not be got out in it. Our cottage, a frame building could not be got out in it. Our cottage, a frame building could not be got out in it. Our cottage, a frame building could not be got out in it. Our cottage, a frame building could not be got out in it. Our cottage, a frame building could not be got out in it.\n\nThe wind died down somewhat.\nDuring Sunday night but was still blowing on Monday morning. We have been three hundred cases of measles in the town and vicinity, our doctor has warned Mrs. Johnson to be extremely careful, so in addition to measles the town was threatened with smallpox which had to be put out in December and while everybody knew this disease that it would be dangerous to have the children out. Our school at Edward is probably one of the best we have. It has, however, a metal ceiling with two large ventilators in it, and a single ventilator on the roof; as a consequence, it is almost impossible to get the temperature above 35\u00b0 when the North east wind blows.\n\nWhen the Inspector came, however, he would listen to no explanation. He ordered me respectfully to go to the school, and spoke in such a harsh manner that I was astounded. We went into the school. The thermometer was 18\u00b0 - a temperature that he insisted was high enough to open school with. He spoke so angrily that I remember that I did not make any of my excuses but let him state it in such harsh terms that I thought that we were allowed to exercise some judgment in such a state of affairs. This only angered him. He then told me that I had treated him with discourtesy; that I had let him come down to the school after he had told me he was coming; that he had heard discourse, and did not expect to lie long, etc., etc. He was so much agitated that I did not say a single word, except to give him whatever satisfaction he asked for. He then left quite coolly, leaving some of his belongings which I had to mail after him. Among the contents, however, what pains me most was the following note: \"I told you last year that I was dissatisfied with the way you conducted this school, and that I would give you one more chance.\" Now the fact was, we had only a few weeks together after this brief examination. He then remarked that the tables were weak. This fact you satisfied me of, but that was a few weeks after his visit.\n\nWhen I had somewhat recovered from the doctor's meeting, I made inquiries as to why I should have been treated so harshly. It appears that at the end of the first week - Oct. 27, 1931, I had mentioned casually to him that I thought that the children would have answered better if examined about practical things. But the occasion of his first visit, he came in a little before two; by this time I had to catch the 11:30 bus, and at once distributed the books he had. There were exchanges, answers read out loud, a mean streak. This was, of course, nothing new to some of the pupils, as nearly all my work is set on the blackboard. Reading, spelling, and the writing of copy or figures furnishes the examination.\nWe have had a lot of unusual situations and the Indians displayed an\nunusual amount of time for the two.\n\nHowever, however, that Mr. Berry wanted my\u2014what he\ncalled\u2014scheme of his method of education, and spoke\u2014as I\nwas told\u2014rather harshly of me & myself, when he did not\nknow the reasons of mine. These facts I learned only recently,\nand, in my opinion, explain his behavior toward me.\n\nHe has always my aim to teach publicly along the lines\nthat will serve them best in their state of life. Since these\nIndian children are taught any arithmetic that will be to\ntheir advantage. In Chilcotin, the boys needed to change the\nlarge scales, this time also, proper bills etc. There is much\nlike, measure, counting work, so that they feel confident that\nthey are getting their due.\n\nNow Mrs. Murray and I have been eighteen years almost\nat this work,\u2014two years at the lonely Hope Reserve at\nChilcotin, nine years on the isolated Chilcotin River,\nand almost seven here in Chilliwack. Having teaching\nbeen added to the Indians, I am convinced, that my\nteaching would have to be other places to which I can find\nevidence. My own two daughters were taught at home.\nKathleen, my eldest daughter, was sent to the Indian School\nafter a few months' preparation and passed the entrance, and\nin three years matriculated well, as well as qualifying for\nthe Normal School. Instead of going to the Normal School, she\nentered the Sisters of St. Anne, and has been with them now\nfor almost five years. My second daughter was never\ninside a school until she was eleven. She too qualified\nfor the Normal School, and though about a year or around\nten minutes, passed the Normal Matriculation obtaining\nthird place in the Chilliwack High School. I mentioned\nfacts, and from vanity, but to show what the foundation\nthey laid within me was solid and lasting.\n\nIn dealing with the Indians, my policy has been to\ngain the confidence of the parents. By doing, I have attained\nan almost very close enough influence to cause them to keep\ntheir children at school. The difficulty of securing regular\nattendance in day schools was a very great, and when we\nconsider the mobility, often clandestine conditions obtaining\nin these homes, the wonder is that a teacher is able to\nget them to leave the little that many of them possess.\n\nThere is one feature in this affair that has disturbed me\nmore than any other, that is, the treatment by Mrs. Murray.\nDuring her long service she has a spirit of my many problems,\nand even in spite of the doctors, undertaken many responsibilities.\nShe has been called for by Indians or other reasons, not within her care to attend sicknesses of any kind, but she has been doing the best she could in her own way. In 1915, we were alone in the house, she was ill except for one day, and she had to work without any medicine for several days. She had to work without any help from anyone, and she did not have a complaint. This time she was working in another family, and she had none. For the last five years, she has always worked hard, and she has had the assistance of a man, who is a friend of her association with so many bands. She is scarcely a week that some of these outside Indians do not call for attention, so that she has taken on duty and of her time\u2014she will not refuse anyone. Now she has been dropped into the miserable business, and though looked at as a civil servant, for all her good work, she is refused in salary \u00a3576.28 a year, and sent to the Babine. This is the fact that disturbs me more than any other. The situation is now a matter of her rights, her absence from this place without proper compensation.\n\nNow in writing this rather long letter, I am not anticipating any favors, though it means the breaking up of our little family, the leaving away of most of our household goods, and going forth in quest of new work, we would not consent to remain, if the Department is of opinion that we are justified in our demands. It will be a great concern to us, but we have sufficient self-respect and, I hope, friend in just to face any difficulties.\n\nYou may be surprised at this letter, you are not the first officials of long standing whom we have met with. However, we hold fast what we know you. Nearly four years ago, Mr. Murray and I came to Victoria to see our daughter Kathleen, who was, after a year's separation, being received into the foster of St. John. There we met what proved to be Lady, later Mrs. Murray. She, of course, knew our friend at home, Kathleen, and after some hours with us, invited us to stay with her, she spoke of you affectionately, but we felt that you knew us of the right calibre to appreciate such a fine character. It is this feeling that makes me wish to see this matter in the right light before you, that we may avoid any further misunderstanding, and are quite satisfied to hear this dear news. I am very much obliged to you, and thank you for what you have done, and I hope you will give us all your advice in the matter.\n\nWith kind regards & greetings from us both,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. J. Murray\nApril 5, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSCARD.\n\nI have your memorandum of the 31st ultimo, with reference to Mr. J. J. Moroney, teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School, near Chilliwack, B. C. The District Inspector of Indian Schools a year ago reported that he was not very satisfied with Mr. Moroney's school; that he was not prepared to make any special recommendation at that time. In February of this year, pursuant to his inspection, he recommended that Mr. Moroney be removed from his post in June next. The Inspector also recommended, in view of Mr. Moroney's long service, that he be given the appointment of teacher of the Port Babine Indian Day School. Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn concurred in the Inspector's recommendation, and the Department arranged the transfer.\n\nIt is true that this meant a reduced salary and perhaps increased living expenses for Mr. Moroney. It is further true that Mr. Indian Agent Daunt, who supervises the work of the Skwah School, felt that Mr. Moroney should be given another chance, as he and his wife had performed useful services outside of the classroom activity. The Department wrote Mr. Ditchburn, asking if he and Inspector Barry could agree to giving Mr. Moroney another opportunity at his present post. Mr. Ditchburn replies that Mr. Moroney's services as a teacher are quite valuable to the Department. He adds that, if the Department has not already notified the teacher with whom Mr. Moroney was to be exchanged, he could agree to another year before making the move. Further, Mr. Ditchburn feels that it is not in the best interests of the work to fail to carry out the recommendations of the Inspector and himself.\n\nOn the 2nd instant, after Commissioner Ditchburn's second recommendation had been received, the Department informed Mr. Moroney that he would have to transfer his services.\n\nIn view of the representations the Minister has received, I have asked Mr. Ferrier to show you the correspondence, and, if you think wise, to discuss the matter with Mr. H. J. Barber, M. P.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMarch 31, 1932\n\nMR. WILLIAMS -\n\nMr. H.J. Barber, M.P., has written the Minister with respect to the reported transfer from Fort Babine of one Moroney, apparently an official of the Department of Indian Affairs, who has been in the service for 18 years. It is stated that the transfer is in the way of a demotion, with reduced salary and increased living expenses. The Minister would like a report.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, April 2, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has given careful thought to your letter of the 8th ultimo, protesting against your transfer to the Fort Babine Indian Day School. Further enquiries were made, but I regret to inform you that no change can be made in the decision. Will you please inform Mr. Indian Agent Daunt if you are willing to take the school in the north.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. J.

J. Moroney, of the Skwah Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency, whose services were recommended to be dispensed with by Mr. School Inspector Barry in his report on this school dated the 1st ultimo.\n\nIn reply to your inquiry if myself and Mr. Barry could agree to give the Moroneys another chance at their present work as it appears that the services outside of the school itself have been quite valuable, I beg to say it is considered that Mr. Moroney's services as a teacher are quite valuable to the Department. If, however, the Department thinks that the services Mr. and Mrs. Moroney render outside of that of teaching are more valuable than that as a teacher and field matron and wish to continue them in the service for another year we have no objection, provided that Mr. and Mrs. Daly of Fort Babine have not already been notified that they are to be brought to Chilliwack.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to say that it is not considered to be in the best interests of the Department that outside influences should be brought to bear against recommendations of this nature made by an Inspector of Schools and a Commissioner of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Representations in this connection have reached the Department, and I write now to enquire if you and Mr. Inspector Barry could agree to giving the Moroneys another chance at their present work. It appears that their services outside of the school itself have been quite valuable.\n\nWould a decision to leave the Moroneys at Skwah be subversive of good discipline among our employees?

Moroney, teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School, I have to enclose copies of Mr. Inspector Barry's letters and report, Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn's covering letter and Mr. Ditchburn's letter of the 21st ultimo, which was a reply to a communication from the Department asking if he could agree to giving the Moroneys another chance at their present work.\n\nI may say that, on February 17th, the Department notified the Indian Agent that the Moroneys' services at Skwah were to be discontinued. He was instructed to offer them a transfer to the Fort Babine Indian Day School. On the same date, the teacher of the Fort Babine Indian Day School was offered the Skwah School, and his letter of acceptance is already on file.\n\nWill you please let me have the Minister's instructions in this matter.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSpecial Recommendation attached to Report on Skwah Indian Day School.\n\nIn accordance with the instructions issued to me, and in view of the fact that I am not satisfied with the work now being done at the Skwah Indian Day School by the teacher Mr. J. J. Moroney, I beg to recommend to the Department that this teacher be removed from his appointment as from the end of the present school year in June 1932.\n\nIn view of the fact that Mr. J. J. Moroney has been in the service of the Department of Indian Affairs for a number of years, and that Mrs. Moroney is at present the Field Matron on the Skwah Reserve, I wish to suggest that Mr. J. J. Moroney be given a temporary appointment as teacher of the Fort Babine Indian Day School and that Mrs. Moroney be transferred to that point as Field Matron.\n\nI wish also to recommend that the teacher at the Fort Babine Indian Day School and the Field Matron there, Mr. C. O. Daly and Mrs. Daly, be transferred to similar appointments at the Skwah Indian Day School.\n\nMr. C. O. Daly is anxious for a transfer to some district where he may obtain better education for his daughters. He is a well qualified teacher, holding an Alberta First Class Teacher's Certificate. The reports which he has received from the Provincial Inspectors are very good. I believe that he might be able to make something of the present, more or less hopeless, condition of affairs in the Skwah Day School.\n\nThe suggestion of transferring Mr. and Mrs. Moroney for a time to Fort Babine is only made in view of the past services of these people to the Department. I do not consider that he need receive much consideration in view of his actions as reported.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H. Barry\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nVictoria, B.C.,\nFebruary 12, 1932.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nApril 23rd, 1932.\n\nMr. Williams,\n\nI am returning, herewith, the copy of a recommendation made by Mr. Gerald H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, that Mr. J.J. Moroney, teacher at the Skwah Indian Day School, be transferred to Fort Babine.\n\nYou will observe that the Minister has approved of the transfer of Mr. and Mrs. Daly from Fort Babine to the Skwah School, and that he has raised a question as to the advisability of sending Mr. Moroney to Fort Babine if he is wholly incompetent.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nHe has been an employee for years & did good work outside the classroom. This is what is most needed at Fort Babine. Here the classroom work is relatively less important.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nBefore any further action in this connection I want to see if he accepts.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

BUSKARD,\n\nI wish to refer to the second paragraph in your memorandum of the 23rd instant, concerning the proposed transfer of Mr. J. J. Moroney to the Fort Babine Indian Day School. The Minister raises the question of the advisability of sending Mr. Moroney to Fort Babine if he is wholly incompetent. The proposed transfer is recommended by Mr. Inspector Barry and Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn. The Skwah Indian Day School is in a well settled section of B. C., and the classroom activity is quite comparable to that of a rural public school. On the other hand, Fort Babine is 30 miles from a railroad in northern B. C., and there is required a teacher who is competent in \"The Three R's\" and who will take an active interest in the affairs of the Indians generally. According to the local Indian agent where Mr. Moroney is now engaged, his services outside of the classroom have been very helpful.\n\nThese facts, coupled with Mr. Moroney's long service with the Department, suggested the demotion rather than dismissal. If Mr. Moroney is willing to proceed to the Fort Babine School in the north, does the Minister approve of his appointment.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nApril 27, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

The Department has decided to dispense with their services altogether as from the 30th proximo and is so informing Mr. Indian Agent Daunt.

I HEREBY CERTIFY that all the information given by me on this Form, and in particular the information concerning the number of dependents and marital status is correct in all respects.\n\nFurther, I undertake, in accordance with the law, to promptly notify my employer by the filing of a new declaration on Form T.D.1 as soon as any change takes place in the facts above given.\n\nDate 19th Sept. 1947 Signature Frederick Charles Monaghan\n\nThere are penalties for making a false declaration\n\nEmployer must retain this completed form for inspection by officers of the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6414, file 844-1, part 3)\nINFORMATION FOR THE EMPLOYEE\n\n8. Dependents. Taxpayers may claim as dependents only:\n   (1) A person wholly dependent on the taxpayer for support and of whom the taxpayer has, or immediately before such person attained the age of twenty-one years did have, in law or in fact, the custody and control.\n   (2) Sons and daughters (including illegitimate sons and daughters) or son-in-law or daughter-in-law, brothers and sisters, brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law, and grandchildren, if under eighteen years of age, or under twenty-one and attending school, or over eighteen years of age and incapable of self-support.\n   (3) Parents, grandparents, parents-in-law, or grandparents-in-law, incapable of self-support.\n   (4) A daughter or sister under twenty-one years of age residing as a minor in a public or provisionally licensed private hospital.\n\n9. If Child Under 16 and Not Registrable for Family Allowances, the taxpayer may claim an exemption of only $100 for a wholly dependent child that was or might have been registered under the Family Allowances Act, 1944, so that an allowance under the said Act was or might have been paid in respect of the child in the month of the taxation year. With a few exceptions, every child under 16 years of age may be registered and receive payments under the Family Allowances Act. Therefore, Form T.D.1 provides that only the $100 exemption may be claimed for any dependent shown in Item 5a as having been born after April 1st, 1940. There are also limitations on the number of children under 16 years of age who are not registrable for family allowances. An employee supporting such a dependent child is entitled to claim the $300 exemption for tax deduction purposes. Therefore, employer receiving a T.D.1 form in which an employee claims the $300 exemption for a child under 16 years of age may make deductions accordingly but he must immediately refer the T.D.1 form to the District Inspector of Income Tax for confirmation, accompanied by a declaration signed by the emp., outlining the facts which substantiate his claim that he is the sole support of a child who is not eligible for registration under The Family Allowances Act.\n\n10. If Income of Spouse Is Excess Of $250. A taxpayer not entitled to claim married status if his/her spouse will have an income of more than $750 during the calendar year. If the spouse will have an income of more than $750 but not more than $750, the exemption permitted for married status shall be reduced by the amount by which the income of the spouse will exceed $250 (e.g., if the spouse\u2019s income will be $600, then the $350 would be entered in Item 6(B) (2), i.e., $300 - $250 = $250). If the spouse\u2019s own income for the calendar year will be not more than $250, Item 6(B) (2) will be left blank and the full marital exemption of $750 entered in Item 6(B) (3).\n\n11. \u201cSelf-contained Domestic Establishment\u201d means a dwelling house, apartment or other similar place of residence occupied by at least two persons in which residence amongst other things the taxpayer as a general rule sleeps and has his meals prepared and served. (See Item 10.)\n\n12. Changes in Status or Dependents. If during the year any change occurs in the status or dependents of an employee, the employee must complete and file with his employer an amended Form T.D.1.\n\n13. Effect of Change in Status on Form T.D.1. In cases where Form T.D.1 (Revised for Jan. 1947) is not completed and filed with the employer, deductions from all salaries or wages paid on or after January 1st, 1947 must be made if the employee were a single person without dependents even though the employee may have filed a previous Form T.D.1. Single persons without dependents need not file this form.\n\n14. Filing of Income Tax Return. In addition to filing this form you must file your Income Tax Return Form T.1 Special or T.1 General for the calendar year on or before 30th April of the following year.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO THE EMPLOYER\n\n15. If Form T.D.1 Not Filed By Employee. Any employee who fails to file a completed Form T.D.1 (Revised for Jan. 1947) must be regarded for tax deduction purposes as a single person without dependents and deductions made as per column 1 in the table of Income Tax Deductions (1947).\n\n16. Employer to Scrutinize Claims by Single Persons for Married Status. The definition of a \u201cSelf-contained Domestic Establishment\u201d contained in Item 10 indicates that the taxpayer is not entitled to claim Married Status by reason of supporting a dependent therein unless the dependent actually resides with the taxpayer. Therefore, employers are directed to compare the address shown under Item 4(B) or 4(D) with the taxpayer\u2019s own address in Item 2 (which should show where he is actually living at the time of receipt of the declaration) and in every case where the addresses are not the same the employer must make deductions as if the taxpayer were a single person, with or without dependents as the case may be.\n\n17. Employer\u2019s Responsibility Regarding Form T.D.1. The employer will have regard to the instructions contained in Item 16 above, will check the employee\u2019s computations of the total exemptions in Item 5, and will otherwise make certain that the form is fully completed. He will also delete as a dependent under Item 5 the name of any person whose the employee has already listed in Item 4 unless he claim for married status came within paragraph (B) thereof. If the employer has reason to believe that any of the information on this form is incorrect or false, he will notify the declarant of the error until the employee has made the appropriate confirmation or correction. In case of doubt, the matter should be referred to the District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\n18. Action upon Receipt of Amended Form T.D.1 during Currency of Year. Employees required to file an amended Form T.D.1 if any change occurs in status or dependents. The employer should give immediate effect to a change from \u201cSingle\u201d status to \u201cMarried\u201d status and an increase in the number of dependents. A change from \u201cMarried\u201d status to \u201cSingle\u201d status (e.g. if the employee becomes divorced) will not be made effective until the first pay period in the next calendar year because the employee will still be entitled to claim \u201cMarried\u201d status for the whole of the preceding year in which the divorce took place. Similarly, a decrease in the number of dependents should not generally require a change in the deductions until the following calendar year with one important exception. If, for example, a taxpayer does not claim as a dependent any person who has an income in excess of $400 during the calendar year. If, for example, a son who was previously supported as a dependent and was claimed as a dependent on Form T.D.1 takes up employment from which he will earn over $400 during the calendar year, immediate action should be given to the amended Form T.D.1 as otherwise the employee will be left with a substantial balance of tax to pay with his return on Form T.1 Special or T.1 General.\n\n19. Further Information or Forms with respect to deduction of tax may be obtained from any District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\n20. Completed Forms T.D.1 must be Kept on File by the employer in order that they may be available at all times for payroll inspection by officers of the taxation Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nTo Teachers of Indian Day Schools\n\nYou are requested to supply the following information by return mail:\n\nName in full ..................................................

As a result I sent you the following telegram:\n\n\"HE PERSONAL LETTER MAJOR MacKAY APRIL TWENTY-SECOND HE TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT TWO U. B. C.

For example, it took me some six months to get two seasonal positions established here for university students this summer. I only wanted them as clerks Grade 2 to help with the requisitions, returns, etc., but it still took a long time for the positions to be established. Therefore it was decided that the easiest way to have these welfare workers employed would be to classify them as welfare teachers on the staffs of two of our Indian day schools. I would suggest that we pay them at the rate of $175.00 a teaching month. This would give them approximately $150.00 as salary and $25.00 towards their travelling expenses. You realize of course that we cannot pay the travelling expenses of our teachers - nor in fact for other seasonal employees, unless we get an Order-in-Council. I presume that you will have one working in the Fraser Valley and the other one on Vancouver Island. If this is the case, we could have one on the staff of the Skwah Indian Day School and the other one on the staff of St. Catherine's Indian Day School.\n\nI hope that the above explains the best\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nway which we can propose for hiring these two U.B.C. students. I am letting Major MacKay see this letter, in the event that he may wish to add his own comments.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Mr. Arneil:\n\nYou will have before you Colonel Neary's airmail letter of May 4th regarding the proposal to employ two U.B.C. students on welfare work this season. The Colonel's letter came to me just when I was leaving the office to keep an appointment, and consequently I did not have time to deal with it. I find, however, that there is nothing of value that I can add other than to say that if you consider it would be more helpful to have the students work in areas other than those suggested, you should so advise Colonel Neary.\n\nPerhaps I should also add that inasmuch as they are to be employed as seasonal welfare teachers, they must in each case be assigned to the staff of an Indian Day School, and information in this regard furnished without delay to the Superintendent of Education.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD. M. MacKay\nSuperintendent, Welfare\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDMK/KF\nforwarded in care of this office.\n\n-W. D.

Will secure a Degree in Arts this year and proposes to enter School of Social Work on October of this year. He has had experience in office administration and newspaper work and will, I believe, be very useful to us.\n\nClarence Edward Honen - St. Catherine's Indian Day School\n\nThis man served with the R.C.A.F. for some time subsequent to 1942 as a pilot. Entered University in 1946 and is a candidate for graduation this year. He is studying Social Anthropology. Received First Class Honours at the Christmas examinations. Plans to do post-graduate work at New York, Columbia University.\n\nA further report will be submitted to the Department in due course with respect to the merits of employment of University students during the summer months and actually my object in writing at this time is to forward the attached questionnaires and T.D.1A forms to ensure that there is no delay in having the names of these two students placed on the payroll. While their home addresses and school addresses are given, I think it would be preferable to have their cheques...\nCROSS REFERENCE SHEET\n\nEXTRACT FROM, OR PRECIS OF, COMMUNICATION DATED\n153-3-1 dated May 6, 1948.\n\nWRITTEN BY\nMr. W.S.

I am sure you will see that I can fairly claim $150.00, which I respectfully request may be forwarded to me, without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWalter H. Grimsley\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 29, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the cheque for $90.00 recently sent you.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers there are ten teaching months in the school year, namely, one month in the September quarter and three months in each of the other quarters. In accordance with the new method of paying teachers' salaries, you were, therefore, paid 1/10 of your yearly salary, or, $90.00. The fact that you teach the school in July and take your annual holidays during August and September does not affect the payment to you.\n\nProvided the school remains open under your charge, you will receive the sum of $270.00 at the end of each of the other three quarters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nWalter H. Grimshaw, Esq.,\nChilliwack,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward you herewith a letter which I have received from Mr Walter Grimshaw, teacher at the Skwah Indian Day School, near Chilliwack.\n\nMr Grimshaw contends he is entitled to a further sum of $150.00 in respect to the school year ending September 30th, but as this is a matter for your decision, it is passed to you for reply, please.\n\nWith reference to his claim for remuneration in respect to extra work, I would point out that he now gets the usual janitor allowance paid other teachers, and does no more than the others for it.\n\nThe water question was the subject of enquiry by the Dominion Water Power Branch this summer, but I have not heard the result. I would strongly recommend that some steps be taken to improve matters in this respect, and would refer you to the report of the engineer which is no doubt on file by now in the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Assist. Deputy & Secy\n\nA. O'M.

I suppose the water question hasn't been settled yet, and I am in for another troublesome winter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWalter H. Greenberg\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6414, File 844-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, November 2, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to Mr. W. H. Grimshaw's claim for a balance of salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has already received a letter from Mr. Grimshaw and he was informed that there was no balance of salary due him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nSir:\n\nI have received your letter (No. 153-3-3) of the 29th, with reference to payment of my salary for the months of July and August. I most respectfully beg to point out, that I received notice of the new method of payment on the 22nd of September, long after I had completed my work for the calendar year; my salary at the rate of twenty-five dollars per month, from October 1st, 1922 to August 31st, 1923 amounts to $825.75. I have received $675.75 for that period, therefore claim to be entitled to a further sum of $150.00, as your new system of payment was to begin in September, and pay a salary of $975.00 for ten months to the end of June 1924; if you make the revision of payment retroactive, I should be the loser of $150.00.\n\nHad I imagined this to be possible, I would not have spent much money during vacation.\n\nI feel sure you will see the justice of my claim by forwarding a cheque for $150.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWalter W. Grimshaw\n\n[Signature]\n\nNote: To Mr. Walter W. Grimshaw, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6414, File 844-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, November 20, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to your salary as teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 29th ultimo, the Department considers that there are ten teaching months in the school year, namely, one month in the September quarter and three months in each of the other three quarters.\n\nBeginning with the September quarter of this year you started in your school year and, as you taught one month in that quarter you were paid 1/10 of your yearly salary, or, $90.00. If you remain in charge of this school you will receive at the end of each of the other three quarters $270.00. By June 30th, next, you will have received your full yearly salary of $900.00.\n\nAs regards the school year 1922-23, which began with the September quarter of 1922 and ended with the June quarter of 1923, you were paid your yearly salary of $900.00 in four quarterly instalments of $225.00, each. There is, therefore, no balance of salary due you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nWalter H. Grimshaw, Esq.,\nChilliwack,\nB. C.\nSir:\n\nRepliesing to your letter No. 153-3-3, of the 20th ult., I beg to inform you that the salary I was paid for the September quarter 1922, was for the months of July, August and September, at the rate of $75.00 per month. Therefore, at this rate, I am entitled to receive $900.00 for the twelve months, September 1st, 1922, to August 31st, 1923, and as I have only received $750.00, there is still $150.00 due to me, for which amount I hope to receive a cheque, as I am inconvenienced by not having been paid my full salary\u2014my small bank account proves my figures that I am, approximately, $150.00 short in my balance, as compared with Letter 1920, 21 and 22.\n\nI put my case before the Indian Agent, at the Inspector's, and they agreed with my contention. I quite understand how the error arose, and would now respectfully request that a cheque for $150.00 be mailed to me, if possible, next week.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWalter H.

Grimsley\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMarch 10, 1924\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to address you for consideration of the following facts: Having been in charge of the School, absent from duty for a single day, without being paid for the vacation months of July and August (by departmental instructions I have to take vacation in August and September) in the third week of last September, I received notice that the Department intended for the future, to pay salaries based on ten teaching months in the school year; at this time I had completed my scholastic year, my vacation was also over in early June, and I was entitled to the sum of $150.00 for July and August, the new method of payment commenced. Furthermore, I have applied for this amount and cannot obtain it, after putting the matter before the Indian Agent and the School Inspector, both of whom agreed with my just claim.\n\nI have been put to monetary loss and inconvenience having had to sacrifice money from a mutual victory fund which I had devised to collect into a small Dominion bank; therefore I request your assistance most respectfully.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan R.

You should inform Mr. Grimshaw that I have nothing to add to the correspondence concerning his salary payments except it will not be to his advantage if he is paid as formerly; i.e., four equal quarterly payments per annum. Either method of payment gives him $900 for the period July first, 1923, to June 30th, 1924, as follows:\n\n| Old Method | New Method |\n|------------|------------|\n| Sept. 30, 1923 | $225. | $90. |\n| Dec. 31, 1923 | $225. | $270. |\n| Mar. 31, 1924 | $225. | $270. |\n| June 30, 1924 | $225. | $270. |\n\nTotal: $900. $900.\n\nNearly 300 Indian day school teachers in Canada are being paid salary this academic year for the first time on the basis of ten teaching months and with very few exceptions their concurrence and understanding were spontaneous.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 3rd inst (with enclosure) has been received. I have not received any communication from Ottawa, since their letter of the 15th ult (your enclosure is a copy) which does not put the case correctly. In their return of salary payments, they state September quarter 1921-22 $205.00\n\nDo 1922-23 $225.00 These figures are for the months of July, August and September in the respective years, at the rate of $75.00 per month, and if this is looked into properly, it will be found that previous to Sept. 1923, every period of twelve consecutive months, paid me $900.00, whereas for the twelve months 1st Sept. 1922 to 31st August 1923 I only received $75.00 per month, up to June 30th 1923, I received $750.00 leaving me without remuneration for July-August 1923. The new system of payment started March 1923 (although I did not receive any notice until a few days before the end of the said month), the point is that, on the 1st September 1923, I was entitled to $750.00 for July-August, which I have not received, and still claim. Would you be kind enough to send a copy (or extract) of my letter to you, of the 29th ult., to Mr. D.C. Salt, respectfully asking for an adjustment of salary to 1st Sept. 1923, and have already been put to a monetary loss through the error of the Department\u2014please advise.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWalter H.

Here being four children (3 boys attending school, 1 girl baby), I should like to have instructions from you as to this & similar cases.\n\nI should like to hear whether you have applied for my salary for the months of July & August 1923, and in case you have not received a satisfactory reply from the Department, I hope you would kindly direct Mr. D.G. Scott on the matter, as it is greatly unfair and has caused real inconvenience & hardship to have one month of a year's salary withheld without any notice or just cause, receiving only $675 from October 1, 1922 to August 31, 1923 instead of $825, thus leaving a balance of $150 due to me; the new system started Sept. 1923 & will pay $900 for the year (academic) to Aug. 30, 1924 in the Department started to pay in ten months instead of twelve, as previously was the case, therefore next August three months' salary that are provided for by the increased monthly payments, stating last September.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6414, File 844-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter dated February 1st, and in obedience to the figures therein, relative to my salary, will you please note that, for the years 1921 and 1922 I received compensation for the months of July and August (by payment in September) whereas in 1923 you invoice me the said months, but start the new quarter of payment, or from December, without adjusting my salary to date, thus leaving me minus $158.75 (one hundred and fifty-eight dollars) to which I most respectfully insist I am entitled, being supported in this view by the Indian Agent and the School Inspector.\n\nI would not presume to trouble you further, nor I not convinced of my just claim.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6414, File 844-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, February 13, 1924.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing a letter from Mr. Grimshaw, teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School, with reference to his claim for a balance of salary due him.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has already received a similar letter from Mr. Grimshaw and I enclose herewith a copy of our reply to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

We understand that he gave up duties at the end of December, and, therefore, salary can only be continued to him until the end of the present month.\n\nIf you consider that this school should be kept open, please state what temporary arrangements you can make for the carrying on of the work during the balance of the school year to June 30th, next. Please give this question early attention, and report whether you desire the school work to be continued, and if you can obtain a temporary teacher. If so, you should state the name and qualifications of the teacher secured. The salary you would recommend be paid this substitute teacher, if one is obtained, should also be stated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. O'N.

H. Grimshaw, teacher of the Skawah Indian Day School, has again been brought to our attention and it has been decided to make a special arrangement in his case and to grant him salary until the end of the present school year, June 30th, next. Our action in this matter is not to form a precedent, as such cases have to be decided on their individual merit.\n\nThe Department is unable to pay him the three months salary until the end of June. We understand, however, that Mr. Grimshaw intends going to England and, if he leaves before June, it is considered that Rev. Father Welch, or some other responsible party, would be willing to advance him the amount that will be paid for his quarterly salary. In the event of him securing the money in this manner, it would be advisable for him to give the party who advances the money, a power of attorney which could be forwarded to the Department and, at the end of the June quarter, the amount due could be paid to the said party.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The Department instructed its agent at Victoria to report on the subject. He reported that there are five reserves in the Chilliwack municipality with forty-two children between the ages of six and fifteen years and that there are also some children on two reserves a couple of miles distant who might attend this school if established.\n\nHe reports that the Indians desire to have a school but cannot raise enough money to pay for the building.\n\nThe Inspector states \"I have no hesitation in saying that a day school conducted by a competent teacher would prove of much benefit to the Indians of Chilliwack and that one should be established large enough to accommodate forty pupils.\"\n\nBrooks is the only tender received.\n\nIt is proposed to put the building on the Iona Reserve as it is the most convenient.\n\nThe school would be run under the auspices of the local Catholic Church. The Indian population on the reserve in the vicinity is about 315 Roman Catholics and seventy-three Protestants.\nThe building and teacher's salary would be paid from the Vote for Indian Education (No. 302).

Mr. Agent Byrne has sent in a requisition for the needed articles, which, with the exception of the desks, will cost about $55.00.\n\nWith regard to the desks Mr. Byrne states that the Chilliwack Board of School Trustees have 40 second hand desks, which were taken out of the High School, and can be purchased for $3.00 each. These are in good condition and if they are cleaned and varnished he says they will answer the purpose. If the Department desires to purchase new desks they will cost from $3.25 to $6.75 each. By purchasing the High School desks a saving of about $100.00 would be made and I should think from Mr. Byrne's statement regarding them that they would answer the purpose very well.\n\nHe gives the names of two firms at New Westminster from whom the other purchases could be made.\nmade. One of the dealers, McCallister, is a successor to Lees Limited, who were on the patronage list. The name of the other firm, Denny and Ross, does not appear there.\n\nFrom whom should the purchase of the equipment exclusive of the desks be made? Please state also whether the High School desks are to be purchased or not.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted you recommend that the request of the teacher be complied with.\n\nI may say that insufficient particulars have been given as to the new windows required and where they should be placed. You should enquire fully into the matter of providing more light in the classroom at this school, and state where you would recommend the extra windows be installed, the size of same and the approximate cost of having the work performed. You should also state how you would recommend that the carpenter work in connection with the installing of the windows should be carried out. When we have further particulars as to what is required and the cost involved, consideration will then be given to authorizing having the work done. Your early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. O'S. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to forward you herewith an application received from Miss Mabel Boeur, teacher of the Katzie Indian Day School, for extra windows in the School house upon that Reserve.\n\nThis application I must thoroughly endorse, and would strongly recommend that it be acceded to. Her explanation I may say, that while the theory of northern lighting for school rooms is doubtless a most excellent one for average climates, it leaves a great deal to be desired in such a damp and gloomy area as the Pacific Coast is in winter time.\n\nI trust that the Department will take the necessary steps to improve conditions of this school, as requested by the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMaking application for windows in the Katzie Indian Day School.\n\nWhy are windows needed?\n\n1. Because, for most of the school year, the blackboard cannot be seen.\n2. For the same length of time the pupils sitting near the south wall are straining their eyes to see the work on their own side.\n3. Although one is continually preaching the doctrine of \"sunshine,\" never a ray enters the class-room where so much of their time is spent.\n4. This might be overlooked in a white school, but in a room where most pupils are inclined to be consumptive, sunshine is essential.\n5. The air in a room which is never brightened by sunshine becomes so oppressive that even the teacher whose lungs doctors have declared are remarkably strong feels as though she had a flat iron lodged in her chest.\nThe cause of this dullness.\n\nThe gloom which obscures the blackboard, and darkens the wall away from the windows, is due to the location of the Ratzie Reserve, and to the fact that the school is on the bank of the Fraser. Situated in the Fraser Valley, the Reserve is in the heavy rain belt. Usually the rain lasts from September to April. On those days when it does not rain, the darkness is just as bad because such heavy clouds hang low in the sky.\n\nWhen we do have frosty weather, the Reserve is close enough to the coast to get all the fog. The fog rolls up the Fraser and lies around the schoolhouse for days at a time.\nWhere are the windows needed?\n1. Not being an architect I really do not know, but I would advise putting another in the space marked X. This would throw more light on the blackboard and teacher's desk.\n2. To let in sunshine probably windows could be cut on the south wall near the western end. This would let in light but would not affect the children's eyes.\n\nHaving taught five successive years in the Katzie Indian Day School I am in a position to know that more windows are needed, and needed badly.\n\nYours truly,\nMabel Beers\nTeacher on the Katzie Indian Reserve.\nOffice of the New Westminster Indian Agency,\n\nDecember 17th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 490, amounting to $27.75 in favour of F.W.

It is noted that this requisition requested, besides other supplies, four sanitary pans to replace the present ones in the toilet. This item was overlooked when authorizing you to make the purchase locally of the various items asked for on the requisition referred to above. You may purchase and have delivered the four sanitary pans required. It is noted that these will cost, locally, $2.25 each.\n\nAfter the purchase has been made, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. O'M.

These are very necessary, as the present ones in the toilets have been in use since 1926, and are worn out. As pointed out in the Requisition, they cost locally $2.25 each, and I would recommend that authority for the purchase be given without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.H.

The school was clean and tidy and on the day of my visit there were only four children in class, out of a total of 21 on the roll. This was due to the fact that many of the Indians and their families had already left for the Canneries. The four children that were in school gave me a demonstration of reading, writing and arithmetic, and they showed themselves well up to standard, in fact, very good indeed.\n\nThis school requires three storm windows for the exposed side, during the winter. The doors also need fixing, as they have shrunk a lot. Possibly an outside storm door too, would be good. The teacher informs me, and I quite believe him, that it is impossible to keep any heat in the school during east winds. I instructed the Indian Agent to apply for these improvements.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, August 14, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Pragnell, in a report on his inspection of the Skwah Indian Day School on June 30th, last, states that three storm windows are required for the exposed side of the building during the coming winter and also that the doors need repairing, as they have shrunk considerably. He states, further, that \"possibly an outside storm door would be good\", as the teacher informed him that it was impossible to keep the building warm during east winds. Mr. Pragnell advises the Department that he instructed you to apply for these improvements.\n\nIf you consider that the above articles are necessary, please give full particulars as to cost involved. Our funds are extremely limited and only the absolutely necessary repairs, to place the building in a comfortable condition during the coming winter, should be requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

O'Neill - Assistant Agent\nIndian Agency\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose estimate from J.M. Nelson for building a new woodshed. Of four which I reviewed he was the cheapest and he can be relied upon to do a good job.\n\nThe old shed is in much worse condition now than when you saw it last as a recent windstorm stripped off more of the roofing. It leaks so badly that I cannot keep wood even tolerably dry in it any more, and, as you are aware, it is useless to think of replacing it as all the walls except one have completely rotted away so also have the ends of the spuddings that used to rest on them. In a wet climate such as this a sound woodshed is an absolute necessity.\n\nYours Truly,\nC.O. Daly.\nP.O. Box 36\nChilliwack B.C.\n14th July 1936\n\nMr. A. O'Neil, Deputy\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor dismantling the old woodshed at the school teacher's cottage on the Skowah Indian Reserve and erecting in its stead a new one 24' by 12' with 6' walls of siding and a shingled roof I would charge $55.35.\n\nShould you wish the new shed to be painted; and I should advise its being done, the extra cost would be $7.25.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJohn M. Nelson.\n\nINDIAN OFFICE\nNEW WESTMINSTER\nJULY 16 1936\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, a communication received from Mr. C.O. Daly, Teacher of the Skwah Indian Day School, in which he explains the need of a new wood-shed and submits a Tender from Mr. John M. Nelmes for $55.35 for the wood-shed, with an additional $7.25 if it is painted.\n\nI checked up with local Lumber Yards here, and the best price I received was $85.00 for the material and $15.00 for paint, so the offer of Mr. Nelmes appears reasonable.\n\nThis wood-shed was in deplorable condition when I saw it three weeks ago, and I would recommend that authority be given to replace it as indicated. The total cost including paint being $62.60.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N.

Templier----------------------------------$92.32\n\nDonald Campbell----------------------------- $98.73\n\nThese repairs were provided for in my Estimates for the last fiscal year, and I would recommend that authority be obtained to have the work undertaken by Mr. J. Templier, whose tender is not only the lower of the two but whose work for us on the Douglas Indian Reserve last Fall was highly satisfactory.\n\nThis work is urgently needed and trust will be commenced as soon as the funds are available.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclos.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 14th, regarding having Indians perform the work of repairing the school fences at Skwah Reserve, I beg to say that by the time we had purchased the material, and paid the Skwah Indians for doing this work, it would prove a very costly and dilatory experience.\n\nIt is a perfect theory, but like most theories, fails to take into account the human factor. We tried purchasing fuel for the school, in the same manner, and had to drop it.\n\nIf the fences are to be repaired at all, it will be money saved to have the work done by a satisfactory whiteman.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.O.N. Deunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith is an application received from Mr. Indian Agent Daunt of the New Westminster Agency to expend the sum of $92.32 for repairs to the teacher's cottage and school fences.\n\nMr. Daunt was requested on the 14th instant to advise me if this work could not be undertaken by Indians, as per copy attached. I enclose copy of his reply herewith, indicating that the Indians would not perform satisfactory work in this connection. Consequently, I would recommend favorable consideration of the tenders submitted if and when funds become available for this purpose.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Daly, teacher at the Skwah Indian Day School, Chilliwack, has drawn my attention to the condition of the heating stove in the school room.\n\nThis is a very old stove, but we thought it would last some time yet, and did not include its replacement in our estimates. In cleaning up this summer, the stove appears so badly burned, that its replacement is advisable, if at all possible.\n\nThis school is exposed to bitter winds off the glaciers, during winter, so heavy fires are necessary.\n\nI have obtained quotations for a suitable heater, of the Circulating type from Chilliwack sources, as under:\n\nMenzies Hardware.............$63.00\nDavies & Logan...............62.70\n\nThe stove pipes should also be taken down, checked, and it may be necessary to replace some parts, but the total expenditure would be under $70.00.\n\nI presume application should be made through the Indian Commissioner, but in view of the fact that this expenditure is not in the estimates, I should be glad if you would inform me whether it would be any use doing so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.T.M.

This was based on Tenders, received at the time. Since then, however, prices of materials have advanced, and the fences have still further deteriorated, so that the present quotation, from the previous lowest tenderer amounts to $131.60.\n\nThe main entrance steps at the School have collapsed, and must be repaired before school opens. I have obtained a quotation on this work, from Mr. Templier, and which amounts to a further $22.40. This item was not included in the estimates, as there was at the time no indication that it would be necessary.\n\nIn addition to the above, the toilet seat in the Teacher's Cottage is in a very bad state of repair, and should be replaced. At the present time, the trap door leading to the basement has no hinges or lock, and this should be remedied, as apart from any personal or private use of the basement, the Department drugs are kept down there, and the Field Nurse should have easier access to it than is the case at the present time. A water faucet is also needed in the basement to be used in connection with the washing and sterilizing of bottles.\n\nMr. Templier has also quoted on garden hose, but this would probably be a matter of separate purchase. A hose is necessary for the irrigation of the garden, and washing down outside the premises, and the one at present there is completely worn out, and impossible to repair further.\n\nI would recommend that, if possible, this work be authorized.

Daunt\nIndian Agent\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Your file 153-3-5\n\nReplying to your letter of the 8th instant with reference to developing a school garden project at Skwah Indian Day School, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Daunt's letter of the 24th ultimo, together with that of the teacher's, Mr. J. W. Burns, of the 18th ultimo.\n\nFencing would be necessary before any work could be undertaken and if the project is considered, I would recommend barbed wire fence, which Mr. Daunt states would cost $31.95. With this the approximate cost of the project would be as follows:\n\n| Item          | Cost   |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Fencing       | $31.95 |\n| Potato seed   | 16.00  |\n| 6 garden hoes | 9.00   |\n| 3 \"D\" spades  | 7.50   |\n| 2 rakes       | 3.00   |\n| **Total**     | **$68.95** |\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would kindly advise if funds are available for this expenditure.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nKT\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nYour Reference No.15/9/6069.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, Report, in duplicate, received from Mr. J.W. Burns of the Skwah Indian Day School, in connection with the proposed school garden.\n\nMr. Burns, the teacher, gives two estimates of the proper fencing of this plot as follows:-\n\nMr. J.Templier, hog wire fence,----------------$125.00\nMatthew Williams, barbed wire fence,-----------31.95\n\nThe first estimate is entirely out of the question, and I would recommend that the second estimate of $31.95 be allowed.\n\nI think Mr. Burns' suggestion of planting potatoes is a good one, as the bracken can be eliminated by hoeing during the summer, and it may be possible next year to divide the ground into plots for mixed vegetables. He asks for nine sacks of seed potatoes which would come to approximately $16.00, and if you wish to put in a row or so of carrots, we can put in a little of this seed as well at very small cost. The Indians will not eat beets.\n\nWe will also require six garden hoes, three spades and two rakes.\n\nThe great trouble with an experiment of this kind is, as I pointed out to Captain Barry, that throughout July, August and September, there will be nobody at the Reserve to look after the garden. We can probably salvage the potato crop, although the weeds which will grow during the three months will not do it any good. The Indians go berry picking, to the canneries and hop-picking during these months, so I am afraid the project will not be a success.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nA.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nSkwah Indian School,\nChilliwack, B.C.\n\nFebruary 18, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nThe plot of ground at the Skwah Indian Day School to be brought under cultivation as suggested in a letter addressed to you on January 16, by Mr. Indian Commissioner D. M. MacKay, is a little more than an acre in extent. This land has not been plowed or cultivated in the past.\n\nUntil a couple of weeks ago the greater part of this area was covered with alder and birch saplings, and, tangled patches of wild brambles. About three weeks ago I managed to interest the Indians in their spare time to clean up the place and, ten days ago I had one of them to plow it. I might mention this work was done without expense to the Department.\n\nThe plot is infested with bracken. This noxious weed in season grows here in great profusion and to a height of six and eight feet. So much moisture has been pumped or absorbed from the ground by the weed that the soil is so dry it will not pulverize in its present condition.\n\nWhen Captain Barry inspected this school in December last, we went over the ground to see if some scheme could be devised to reclaim and develop it. I was anxious something might be done - something that would give to the surroundings which run flush with the public road a more civilized aspect than it has now.\n\nMajor MacKay's suggestion to develop the plot into a vegetable garden for the use of the pupils of the school is to be highly commended. But unfortunately, the nature of the ground and the present poor condition of the soil as noted above, would be unsuitable for a vegetable crop this coming season. Until the weed is eliminated, only a thin and scanty vegetable crop can be expected, not enough to pay for the labor.\n\nI have been advised by neighbouring farmers who have kindly looked over the ground, to plant the whole of the plot in potatoes for the next two years. However, I will leave this matter to Major MacKay and yourself to decide.\nThe next item is the fencing of the ground. This should be properly done if any benefit is to be derived from it now or in future years.\n\nIt would appear that when Mr. Daly applied for fencing material a few years ago, there was no intention of cultivating the ground, and he only requested enough of barbed wire as would keep the reserve horses out of the school ground. But this is not near sufficient to keep out a horde of wandering pigs\u2014the fence is not pig-proof.\n\nI had Mr. Joe Templier and an Indian by the name of Matthew Williams go over the ground in the last week. Each has submitted an estimate as given below.\n\nMr. Templier's Estimate.\n\n(1) Hog Fence\u201436 inches high, posts, 1 wooden gate 12 feet wide and 5 feet high; labor on same.\nTotal 125.00\n\nMatthew William's Estimate.\n\n(2) 25 posts $8 each..................4.50\n3 spools of barbed wire at $4.50 each...13.50\n1 wooden gate complete 12 feet wide and 5 feet high..8.00\n17 hours labor at $35 per hr...5.95\n\nTotal 31.95\n\nIf the Department should consider the first of these two (items) estimates, I would suggest that tenders be called for.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

C., and tender and letter from Indian Agent Gillett in regard to providing fire protection for the Shuswap Indian Village, including Day School and Teacher's cottage, I would say that the Purchasing Agent is today being asked to place an order for the materials and labour with the Elk Creek Waterworks Company, Ltd.\n\nWhen the Purchasing Agent issues a Purchase Order copy will be sent to Indian Agent Gillett, and he will be asked to have the Elk Creek Waterworks, Ltd. undertake the work as quickly as possible.\n\nThe cost is being charged to Account No. 134.\n\nDirector.\nJune 20, 1946.\n\nThe Departmental Purchasing Agent,\n\nRe: Fire Protection - Similk Indian Reserve.\n\nSome years ago when water was laid on the Indian Reserve equipment for fire protection was provided. This equipment through the years has worn out and the reserve and Day School with Teacher's cottage are now without fire protection.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner for British Columbia considers in the recommendation of the Indian Agent that fire protection should be provided, and an estimate of the cost of providing the equipment required and repairing the hose house has been furnished by the Elk Creek Waterworks Company, Ltd., of Chilliwack, from whom the water is secured. This estimate is enclosed.\n\nIt is the intention to pay for the work from Band Fund Account No 13th, Interest Account.\n\nWill you kindly issue a Purchase Order in favour of the Elk Creek Waterworks Company, Ltd., for the work which they have estimated will cost $756.00, indicating on the Purchase Order that the cost is to be charged against Account No. 13th.\n\nM.W.\n\nDirector.\nMay 30, 1946\n\nSkwah Indian School\nChilliwack, B.C.\n\nJ. Gillett Esq.\nIndian Agent\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Gillett,\n\nWhen the Indians come to me for medicine and advice, I am obliged (especially during bad weather) to ask them into my own private quarters. This is not always convenient or agreeable.\n\nLast fall, the interior of teacher's cottage was only partly painted and papered, and there are still three rooms which are in a very dirty and neglected condition.\n\nIt would therefore greatly facilitate matters if a couple of these rooms could be cleaned and used as dispensary and waiting rooms for the Indians.\n\nMr. Reimer of Chilliwack, who worked on the school and cottage last year, would be pleased to do the job for about $28.00.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6414, file 844-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nFurther money allowed last year for cottage furnishings did not go very far. In the Dining Room I have only a dinette table and four chairs. As there are no cupboards in the house, the addition of an inexpensive buffet to the Dining Room set would greatly add to the appearance of the room, and to my convenience and comfort. D. Spencer & Co can supply this odd piece of furniture at $36.50.\n\nThanking you for approaching the Department on my behalf,\n\nfaithfully yours,\nCatherine E. Sinclair.\nNew Westminster, B. C.,\nJune 14th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nAttached is a letter from Miss Finan, teacher at the Skwah Indian Day School, in which she requests improvement and repairs to two rooms in the Teacher's residence for a dispensary.\n\nMr. Reimer's estimate is reasonable. The two rooms should be cleaned and kilnsmoked, and he will supply the material and labour for $28.00.\n\nI recommend that this be authorized and also the purchase of a buffet from David Spencer Limited, for $36.50, for the teacher's use.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 26, 1946.\n\nMajor D. H. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of approximately $25.00 for material and labour in repairing the teacher's residence at the Skwah Indian Day School. You may also purchase a buffet at a cost of $36.50.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter of June 14th and enclosure referred to therein in connection with the proposed expenditure of $64.50 for improvements and repairs to two rooms in the teachers' residence of the Skwah Indian Day School, and the purchase of a buffet.

Dickey and Sons of Chilliwack, B.C., in the amount of $327.44 which includes materials and cost of installation to supply 10 drop lights in the said classroom and a further five lights elsewhere.\n\nWe had requested additional tenders from other firms but no reply has been forthcoming.\n\nThe installation of electricity in the School will be beneficial to the conducting of classes during the winter months and would be of value in the event any night meetings are required by our Branch. An amount of $500.00 was placed in the 1949-50 Estimates to cover cost of electricity in the teacherage and school, of which amount $169.40 has already been expended for the installation in the teacherage.\n\nIt is recommended that this firm be given authority to proceed with this installation as soon as possible, preferably before the interior decorating job is started which will be during July this year.\n\nJ.

Original on 411846/1.\n\nIn order to carry out the work as outlined it would be advisable to have a man and his wife in charge of this school, and as Mr. Grimshaw states in his application, it would be desirable if the Department favourably consider the erection of a small cottage, about four rooms, where the teacher and his family could reside. I believe that the cost of such a cottage would not exceed $1,000.00, and the advantages to the Department and the Indians in having a permanent and satisfactory teacher would be great, as the Indians study very much better under the directions of a teacher with whom they are well acquainted than they would with a stranger.\n\nI may add that at most of the other Indian schools accommodation is provided for the teacher in the same building in which the classes are held, but the building at Skwah being only one story does not allow for this. I would therefore respectfully recommend that the Department favourably consider the erection of a cottage.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Agent Byrne recommends the erection of a cottage for the teacher on the Skwah Reserve. A new school has been built there and the services of a married teacher have been engaged. In order to retain the services of a good teacher I think that living accommodation should be provided. A suitable cottage could be built for Mr. Byrne's estimate of $1,000.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, February 26, 1914.\nOttawa, March 6, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Skwah School for the month of February in which you recommend that a cottage of about four rooms be erected for a married teacher, I beg to say that I am enclosing herewith a blueprint of a cottage of this class that was erected in connection with one of our schools in the east. I should like you to advise the Department of the probable cost of erecting such a building on the Skwah Reserve near the school. If it can be put up for anything like your estimate of $1,000.00 the Department will be prepared to erect it and you should state whether the work could be done by day labour under the supervision of a competent foreman. Kindly attend to this matter as soon as possible, so that, if it is decided to build, the material could be purchased out of this year's appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

J. Jones, Managing-Director of the Elk Creek Waterworks Company, Limited, which Company supplies water to the City of Chilliwack, B.C., and I am informed by him that his Company will extend its main from its present terminus to a point opposite the teacher's cottage. That is, from \"A\" to \"P\" as shown on the enclosed sketch, and charge the regular Meter Rates a month, with the minimum charge of $5.00 per month and three-quarter/Meter rent of 50\u00a2 per month.\n\nThe Meter Rates are as follows: Per 100 cubic feet where monthly consumptions are under 5,000 cubic feet...25\u00a2 Over 5,000 cubic feet and under 10,000 cubic feet........23\u00a2 \" 10,000 \" \" \" 20,000 \" \" .21\u00a2 \" 20,000 \" \" \" 30,000 \" \" .19\u00a2 with a proportionate reduction in prices in accordance with the amount of water used. A discount of 20% will be allowed on all Meter Rentals, if paid on or before the 10th day of the following month.\n\nThe cost of connecting the water with the teacher's cottage at the point \"P\" would not, I believe, exceed $10.00, and I think that the water could be laid in, or near the school for a similar amount, and of course the minimum charge of $5.00 per month would cover the cost of both buildings.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIn view of the fact that the city of Chilliwack, which is rapidly growing, is located about a mile from the Indian village, and the danger of the sewerage therefrom contaminating the water used by the Indians, I took up with the Chief and members of this Band the question of having the water carried into their village and school, about a year ago, in order that it might be used by them for domestic purposes, but, insomuch, as I could not get the Indians to agree to pay the regular monthly charge of $5.00 plus the Meter rent, I was compelled to withhold from the Department the submission of this matter.\n\nShould the Department decide to supply the Indian village as well as the Teacher's cottage and school, a four inch extension from \"G\" to \"H\" and from \"H\" to \"I\" will cost $670.00 with connection for hose, for fire protection. In this case the minimum charge will be $8.00 and a four-inch Meter Rent, $2.00 per month. The Meter Rates are the same as above. In this event the school-house could be connected at \"H\" and the pipe extended thence to connect the teacher's cottage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 11, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo in connection with water supply for the Teacher's residence at Chilliwack Indian Day School, (Skwah) quoting the probable cost of carrying water into the building stating also the minimum meter rates. In reply I have to say that the cost as stated is considerably greater than the Department feels justified in expending for this purpose.\n\nThe amount of water that would ordinarily be consumed in the cottage and school would not exceed 100 Imperial gallons per day, or 500 cubic feet per month, at 25\u00a2 per cubic foot is $1.25, this with a 20% discount would reduce the amount to $1.00 per month for the water actually used.\n\nThe Department taking into consideration the Company's outlay in providing mains, is prepared to meet them to the extent of paying a minimum of $2.50 per month, which includes the meter rent for the present time, providing they permit of water being carried into the residence, the school, and a hydrant on the street near the school for the use of the Indian village.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nWhen the amount of water used increases to 2000 cubic feet per month, it is understood that the charges set out in your letter of January 26th, 1915, will automatically come into force, including the rebate of 20\u00a2 for prompt payment of rates on water used.\n\nThe Department cannot at this time undertake to provide water for the Indian village other than by the putting in of a hydrant as before noted, but will be prepared to further consider the extension of their water supply at a more opportune time.\n\nIt is understood that the Department will pay the cost of carrying the water from the Company's mains to residence and school, also the putting in of the 2\" safety hydrant, providing the Elk Creek Water Company will meet the suggestions of the Department as above.\n\nIn case the Company will not provide water in accordance with this arrangement, you are requested to have an estimate made for a well near the cottage, with a force-pump and 500 gallons pneumatic pressure tank which will permit of the use of the water system in that building.\n\nThe estimate should be sent in at once so that the expenditure, if made, will come in the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMEMO for Mr. Allen:\n\nA contract was made with Mr. Brock for the erection of a school building for the Skawah Band, Chilliwack, B.C., October 27, 1913, which was duly completed. Before being completed, however, it was found advisable to build a residence for a teacher. A preliminary plan was sent to Agent Byrne and submitted to the contractor who, after consulting with him, forwarded an estimate also suggesting that provision be made for a bathroom, the estimated cost of the building being $1,325.00. The Department considered this a fair and reasonable price for the work, authorizing the erection of the buildings.\n\nNo tenders were invited or Order-in-Council passed, the work being considered as an extra to the school contracts.\n\nA copy of the plans and specifications, as well as Brock's estimate, is attached hereto.\n\nAccountant,\n\nOttawa, March 4, 1915.\nMemo. for Mr. Paget,-\n\nA contract was made with R.

On March 16th Agent Byrne wrote suggesting enlargement of building to provide a bath-room, the estimated cost as submitted by R. H. Brock being $1325.00. On April 4th the Department authorized the Agent to make contract with Brock for the erection of the building at that price. On May 12th, Agent submitted a sketch of the enlarged building prepared by Brock, which was made workable in this branch, and with specifications, returned to Schools Branch, May 15th.\n\nNo contract has been made with R. H. Brock for the carrying on of this work, or instructions issued to him directly by the Department, the Department's letter of April 4th, 1914, and letter of Agent Byrne, March 16th, with estimate of Brock, was apparently considered sufficient authority. No C.O. has been passed.\n\nThe estimate of R. H. Brock for the erection of the building is a fair and reasonable price.

April 14, 1919.\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWe enclose herewith as requested a rough sketch of proposed water system, also a list of prices covering so far as we know all that would be required to install same.\n\nWith considerable experience in windmills for all purposes on the prairie, we think that a better plan in every way would be to use gas engine power even although fuel would have to be purchased, as we have found that this item is often less than sundry repairs, etc., for wind engines, and in addition you are burning fuel only when water is needed in the tank which can be done at will without waiting for wind and without going into the cost of a suitable engine (gasoline) we are satisfied that a saving of at least ($50.00) could be made in the question of power.\n\nEven in the event of our getting an order for the supplies it would be a matter of indifference which was used. We merely make the above suggestions, believing that they would give the best results.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6414, file 844-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nIn reply to Department's letters dated Feb. 11th, and the 13th inst., I beg to submit herewith an estimate of the cost of a water system for the school and teacher's cottage on Skwah Indian Reserve, Chilliwack, B.C., together with a letter from Mr. Menzies, suggesting that it would be more economical to use a gasoline engine, with which to pump the water, instead of a wind engine. The cost of the former, as shown by the estimate, is $160.00, and a three-way pump $18.00, making a total of $178.00; while the cost of a 1\u00bd H.P. gasoline engine, pump and connections is $95.00. The cost of gasoline here, at the present time is 17\u00a2 per gal., and the expense in operating would be very little more than that of the wind-mill. In view of Mr. Menzies' letter on the subject, and the difference in cost, I would respectfully recommend that a gasoline, instead of a wind engine be used.\n\nThe Department will please note that the cost of driving a pipe down into the ground is not estimated. This amount may vary considerably in accordance with the depth which the pipe will have to be driven, in order to get the supply of water needed. I regret very much that arrangements could not be made to supply water for domestic purposes, to the Indian village, as it appears to me that it is very necessary, in order to protect them from having to use water from their wells, which is liable at any time to become unfit for use, and which is acknowledged by the Farmers to be very inferior to the water supplied by the Elk Creek Co.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6414, file 844-8, part 1)\nI am sorry that I could not forward this information sooner, but immediately on receipt of the letter from Head-quarters dated February 11th., I wrote to Mr. Grimshaw, the Teacher, asking him to see the different contractors at Chilliwack with a view to getting their figure on the work, and as the Department can see I only received this estimate after the 14th inst.\n\nI am also enclosing quotations on the articles necessary, furnished me by Messrs. Trapp & Co., this city, which appears to be cheaper than Mr. Menzies' estimate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nDepartment of Mines & Natural Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nSupplies for Skwah Indian Day School and Teacher's residence.\n\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nDAVIES & LOGAN HARDWARE\n\nHardware, Stoves, Tinware, Paints, Oils, Varnishes,\nFishing Tackle and Sporting Goods,\nElectrical Supplies, Crockery.\n\nCHILLIWACK, B.

S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner, VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nAttached is a report from Mr. Letcher on the teacher's residence at Skwah Reserve.\n\nOn June 30th I engaged Miss V. James to clean the house as it was very dirty. I offered her $8.00 which she accepted and said that she would begin on July 4th. Mr. Letcher increased it another $8.00 because the house was in such a mess after the break-in.\n\nThere is very little furniture in the building, particularly for a woman teacher. We will submit quotations after we receive tenders and a request for needed additional articles along the lines of those allowed by the Department in such cases.\n\nThe following articles are on hand, the same as on Miss Finan's departure in 1947:\n\n- 1 Chest of Drawers\n- 1 Bed Spring and mattress (worse for wear)\n- 1 Dinette Suite (5 pieces)\n- 2 Occasional chairs\n- 2 Linoleum Squares\n- 1 Mirror\n- 1 End Table\n- 3 Lamps (one for use in school)\n- 1 Breakfast Set (a number of pieces broken)\n- 1 Double Boiler\n- 1 Potato Pot\n- 1 Fry Pan\n- 1 Mixing Bowl\n- 1 Roaster\n- 1 Dish Pan\n- 1 Kitchen Stove\n- 1 Heater\n- 11 Window Blinds\n\nI will be going to Skwah tomorrow and believe it would be advisable to have the windows boarded up.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nAgency Aupt.\n\nJG:ic\nEnc.\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nJuly 4th., 1949\n\nREPORT ON BREAK-IN AT SIKAH TEACHERAGE\n\nSome person or persons unknown were reported to have entered the Sika School Teacherage on the week-end of July lst., and accordingly, in company with Constable Wicklow of B.C. Police, I called at the teacherage to investigate damages.\n\nWe found that possible entry may have been made through the front door of the building as the glass in the door had been broken. The back door of the building was also open. It would appear that the damages incurred was the work of children.\n\nCertain items of medicine, mainly cod liver oil in bottles, had been stored in a back room\u2014these had been opened and the contents poured out on the kitchen and pantry floors, also on one of the upholstered chairs. Some sort of powder was emptied all over the mattress on the only bed in the building. Pots, pans, and dishes were strewn all over the place, with the majority of the dishes being broken. Constable Wicklow will continue the investigation in an attempt to locate the culprits.\n\nI arranged with Miss Virginia James, an Indian girl who had been hired to clean up the building prior to the break-in, to start immediately to clean up the mess, with the understanding that she would receive at least $16.00 for her work.\n\nI also arranged with the Chilliwack Lumber Yards to install a new glass in the front door, and to place a padlock at the rear. It will be necessary for the Department to purchase, new dishes, pots and pans, two new occasional chairs, and a new mattress, in addition to any other purchases contemplated.\n\nJ. C.

Rock\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.\nJuly 11th, 1903.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith for your consideration copy of a letter received by me from Sliammon Indian reserve, dated the 6th instant and signed by twenty four male members of that band, wherein they state that they are Christian Indians and have been residents of Sliammon Indian Reserve for the past forty eight years, and have thirty five children of school age but no school to send them to. They therefore pray for assistance from the Indian Department to enable them to establish a school at that place to which they can send their children.\n\nIn connection with this matter I beg to state for your information that when at Sliammon recently, the question of school accommodation for these people was fully discussed and I strongly advised them, that as the Sechelt Indians were now building a large Boarding School at Sechelt, they, (the Sliammon Indians) should, at least for the present, send their children to that school.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n(sgd) R.G.

We have thirty children of school age in our Band and regret very much to see them grow up without being educated and therefore ask that the Indian Department will kindly pay a teacher the usual salary paid to teachers in day schools with the above mentioned number of pupils.\n\nThe Band hereby request,\n\nChief Charlie his mark,\nWilliam his mark,\nPierre his mark,\nSamuel his mark,\nOld George his mark,\nJim his mark,\nBob George his mark,\nFrank William his mark,\nCapt.

And if a school were established there, it is doubtful whether the parents would send their children with such regularity as is necessary for the success of a school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n(sgd) H.C.

(RG 10, Volume 6415, file 845-1, part 1)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 24th July, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Supt. Vowell forwards an application from Mr Agent McDonald made to him by the Sliammon band of Indians for the establishment of a day school on their reserve. The Agent says there are about 35 children of school age on the reserve. There is no money available for the payment of a teacher's salary or the erection of a school building at present and provision would have to be made in the Supplementary estimates if the Department decided to accede to their request. As however a number of these children could be sent to the Sechelt boarding school which is now in course of erection, I think this application might stand over until next year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6415, file 845-1, part 1)\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\nVictoria, July 14th 1903.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith for the information and consideration of the Department a copy of a letter of the 11th instant, No. 277/I, with its enclosure, today received from Mr. Agent McDonald of the Fraser Agency concerning the application made to him by the Sliammon band of Indians for a school for the education of their children. I also enclose herewith a copy of my reply to Mr. McDonald. When I receive a reply to my letter to the Agent I shall transmit a copy of it for the information of the Department. If sufficient funds are at hand to provide these Indians with a day school I would recommend that provision be made for the payment of the salary of a teacher provided one can be found to carry on the work.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\nVictoria, July 14th 1903.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, No. 277/I enclosing a communication received by you from certain of the Indians of the Sliammon band asking for a school for the children of the band, numbering, as you inform me, thirty-five of school age. No mention is made by you as to the likelihood of securing the services of a teacher for the proposed school at Sliammon. In the event of the Department making a grant for the salary of a teacher for these Indians could a teacher be secured for them. Perhaps the pastor of the village, if there be one, might consent to act in that capacity. It is noticed that there xxx is no witness to the marks of the Indians who are supposed to have written the letter to you. A matter of this kind is one that should be drawn up in your presence at a meeting of the Indians interested in the proposed school. If a school were established at\n\nR. O. McDonald, Esqre.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nat Sliammon do you think the Indians would take sufficient interest in the training of their children to send them to it.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) A. W. Vowell,\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\nBritish Columbia.\n\nP. 4. Indian Office,\n\nVictoria, January 16th, 1905.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter, dated the 13th instant, No. 156/4, received from Mr. Agent McDonald of the Fraser Agency, transmitting a resolution passed unanimously by the Sliammon band of Indians in meeting assembled on the 10th instant requesting that the Department provide the usual grant for the payment of the salary of a teacher of the Indian day school which the members of the band wish to have established at their village. It will be perceived from a perusal of the Agent's letter that the Indians have agreed to provide a suitable building for the purpose and the Reverend Father Chirouse, missionary of the district, states that he can secure the services of a competent teacher to undertake the task of instructing the children.\n\nThese Indians are most anxious to furnish their offspring with at least the education the day school affords, as is shown by their eagerness to assist the Department in\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nin the matter of effecting sundry improvements to one of\nthe buildings on the reserve to fit it for the purpose in view.\nThe Sliammon band, it may be remarked for the information of\nthe Department, is one of the most progressive in the province\nand has accomplished much in the direction of building up a\nneat and attractive village and in furnishing their houses\nwith most of the necessaries and even many of the labor-saving\ndevices of their white neighbors. The band has asked but\nlittle of the Department at any time, relying mainly on its\nown efforts for the furtherance of the many schemes devised\nfor the betterment of its condition. In the present instance\nit is felt, however, that funds are not at hand for the payment\nof the teacher's services and in view of this fact I would\nstrongly recommend that the request contained in the resolution\nbe complied with, particularly as the Agent commends the same\nto the Department's most favorable consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nJanuary 15, 1905.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to inclose herewith an application, dated the 10th instant, in duplicate, signed by a majority of the male members of the Shiammon Band of Indians of the full age of twenty-one years, in which they respectfully ask the Indian Department to establish a day school in their Village. They have purchased the building erected on the reserve by Messrs. Thulin Bros. for a store, and will use it for a school if the Department will pay the salary of the teacher. This building, with some slight improvements which the Indians will make on it, will be quite suitable for a day school, as in addition to the large front room which would be used for the school, it has another room and a kitchen at the back, and several rooms upstairs which would be useful for the teacher for his living apartments. Messrs. Thulin Bros. have kindly offered to give them free of charge, the seats and desks formerly used in the Lund Public School.\n\nThese Indians have thirty children of school age, and as they are most anxious to see them educated, I believe they would send them regularly to school as promised in their application.\n\nThe Rev. Father Chirouse, Missionary to these Indians, informs me that he can secure the services of a competent\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\n\nIndian Superintendent,\n\nVictoria, B.C.\ncompetent teacher for a school at Sliammon.\n\nAs these Indians show so much interest in the education of their children, I would recommend their application to the most favorable consideration of the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th inst., No. 558, J. S., inquiring why the arrangements made in 1905 for opening a school on the Sliammon reserve were not carried out.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that when I was at Sliammon on the 16th of January, 1906, the Indians purchased Messrs Thulin Bros. Store, with the intention of converting it into a school, and agreed to pay them with logs, but they afterwards refused to pay for the building, as they considered it would cost too much to make the necessary improvements, and informed me that they would put up a new, larger, and more suitable building; but this they have not yet been able to accomplish.\n\nI was under the impression that I had reported this matter to the Department, but on looking up the records in this office, the only reference I can find to it is in my letter of July 4th, 1906, No. 61/7, when forwarding Thulin Bros. cheque for rent on the Sliammon reserve, in which the following paragraph appears:\u2014\"In the early part of 1905, the Sliammon Indians agreed to purchase the store building from Messrs. Thulin Bros. for the purpose of converting it\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\"into a school, but they afterwards abandoned the idea\nand never paid for the building, and consequently it\nreverted back to the original owners. This is why the\nrent was not paid sooner.\"\n\nWhen I was at Sliammon reserve on the 27th\nultimo, the Indians informed me that they had not means\nwith which to purchase material for a school-house, and\nmade application for permission to expend from their\ntrust fund the sum of $600.00 in the purchase of building\nmaterial and furnishings to enable them to put up a\nsuitable school building, including living rooms for the\nteacher, (see my letter of the 20th instant, No. 625/10.).\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nMr. Agent MacDonald in his annual report on the Fraser River agency states that the Indians of the Shuswap band desire that their children should have the advantage of schooling.\n\nIn the year 1905 arrangements were made to open a school on this reserve under the charge of Andrew Phillip, and the Department would like to know why they were not carried out. Provision is made in the estimates for the salary of a teacher at this point and there appears to be no reason why a school should not be opened at once.\n\nThe Department would like to have a report from you in this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 25th ultimo, I have the honor to enclose herewith for the information of the Department a communication, dated the 23rd instant, No. 339/4, received from Mr. Agent McDonald of the Fraser Agency reporting the engagement by the Sliammon band of Indians of a native teacher to conduct the Indian day school to be established in the village under authority of your letter quoted. By the last paragraph of the Agent's letter it will be noticed that it is proposed to appoint a committee of three Indians of the band to assist the teacher in regulating the attendance at the school, which seems a good idea.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.

However the School will be opened as soon as possible.\n\nAndrew Phillip, a young Indian of Chehalis, who has received an excellent education at St. Mary's Mission School has been proposed for teacher of the Sliammon School. He is highly recommended by the Rev. Father Chirouse, and also by the Rev. Father Bedard, who had charge of his class at the time he graduated from the School, and I have no doubt but that he will be a successful teacher.\n\nHis wife was also well educated at the same institution, and as she is very proficient at plain and fancy needlework,\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\n\nIndian Superintendent,\n\nVictoria, B.C.\nneedlework, it is thought that arrangements can be made by which the Indians will pay her for teaching the girls needlework.\n\nI may add that it is also proposed to appoint a committee of three Indians of the band to assist the teacher in keeping up the best possible attendance at the school when opened.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, 28th January, 1905\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant enclosing a communication from Mr Agent McDonald, who transmits a resolution passed by the Shiamon band of Indians requesting the Department to provide the salary of a teacher for the day school they wish to establish in their village.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of your recommendation and of the efforts the Indians are making for their betterment, the Department will agree to pay the customary salary of $300.00 towards a teacher's salary when the school is opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nA.W.

If the Department will kindly grant them permission to expend the above mentioned sum from their trust fund, they will put up the building themselves.\n\nBy reference to the Auditor General's Report, part J., 1906-1907, it will be seen that the amount to the credit of this band on the 31st of March, 1907, was $475.00; and since that date, the following amounts have been\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nbeen placed to their credit, viz;\u2014 September, 1907, paid by Wilbur Johnston $100.00, Thulin Bros. $24.00; December, 1907, Merrill Bros. $100.00, May, 1908, Wilbur Johnston $100.00.\n\nIf the Department approves of this expenditure, which I recommend to its most favorable consideration, accounts in detail will be furnished when the material is purchased.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nAt a meeting of the male members of the Shuswap band of Indians held on their reserve this 27th day of May 1908, the following resolution moved by Chief Tom and seconded by Charlie was carried unanimously:\n\nThat we the undersigned, being a majority of the male members of the Shuswap band of Indians of the full age of twenty-one years, do hereby respectfully ask the Indian Department for permission to expend from our trust fund the sum of $600 in the purchase of building material and furniture to enable us to erect a school house on our reserve and furnish same as a day school.\n\nChief Tom (signature)\nChief Charlie (signature)\nWilliam (signature)\nPeter (signature)\nHarry (signature)\nTimothy (signature)\nJoe (signature)\nBob (signature)\nFelix (signature)\nFrancis (signature)\nCharlie (signature)\nFrank (signature)\nJimmy (signature)\nGeorge (signature)\nSamuel Timothy (signature)\nSanfordian (signature)\nOttawa, October 13, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIn a report just received from Mr. Inspector Green on the Sliamon School dated September 27th, last, he states that the teacher informed him that he had sent you his resignation some four weeks before that date. If this is so I would ask you why it has not been transmitted to the Department in order that it might be accepted and the necessary action taken to appoint a successor. If you have this resignation please send it at once.\n\nMr. Green recommends that a married man be engaged as teacher for this school and the Department is inclined to favour this recommendation. It is suggested that a married man would interest himself in the work of teaching the Indians agriculture. I would ask you to consult with the church authorities with a view to obtaining the services of a competent man for this position and if one with satisfactory certificates is obtained the Department will allow a liberal salary.\n\nI would also ask you to obtain an estimate of the cost of erecting two separate closets with screened approaches at the rear of the school lot.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, March 4, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Green, in his report on the Sliammon day school, states that the school ground has been cleared, fenced and cultivated and that the teacher wishes to be furnished with some trees for planting during this coming spring. The Department is prepared to supply these trees and you are hereby authorized to purchase the following: six horse chestnut, six acacia, six apple, six pear and six cherry. Care should be taken by the teacher to protect these trees while small.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. C. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, April 26, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in which you state that Mr. J. W. L. Browne, teacher of the Sliammon Indian day school, tends a small store for Thulin Brothers on the reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has no objection to Mr. Brown doing this work outside the regular school hours, but this duty must not be allowed to interfere with that of the school-room. As Mr. Browne is not the principal in this matter it will not be necessary for him to obtain a trading license and this letter is his authority to work for Thulin Brothers on the terms above mentioned. The Department reserves the right to withdraw this privilege at any time should circumstances warrant such action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nR. C. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nApril 8th, 1910.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 31st ultimo, No. 318400/1, referring me to Section 42, Chapter 61 of the Indian Act, which debars school teachers on Indian reserves from trading with any Indian or selling to him directly or indirectly any goods or supplies, I have the honor to state that J. W. L. Browne, the Teacher at Sliammon Day School tends a small store for Thulin Bros on the Sliammon Reserve where they pay ground rent for the store. The chief customers of the store are logging-camp men who are working near the reserve, and go to the store for their supplies in the evenings after the day's work is done, so that Mr. Browne's tending at the store after school hours, does not interfere with his duties as teacher, and the Indians have made no complaint in this connection. In fact it is a great convenience to the Indians themselves to have the store there.\n\nIf Mr. Browne were prohibited from tending the store, he would at once discontinue teaching, and I fear it would be very difficult to secure a teacher of his qualifications for the salary paid him, and I therefore recommend that a license be granted him, so that he may continue tending the store before and after the regular school hours.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

W. L. Browne, teacher of the Sliammon Indian Day school, has informed him that he intends to resign his position unless his salary is increased to $500.00 per annum.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the fact that Mr. Browne is a holder of a professional certificate and is evidently doing good work at this school, the Department will increase his salary to $500.00 from the first of October, last, and you will be good enough to inform Mr. Agent McDonald to this effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Please see letter from this office dated 15th inst., No. 682-R,5.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI have the honor to report that Mr. J. W. L. Browne, Teacher of Slismmon Day School, has informally notified me that, unless his salary is increased to $500.00 per annum, he intends to resign the position of teacher at the end of the current quarter.\n\nIn company with Mr. Inspector Green, I visited this school on the 18th instant, and judging from the progress the pupils have made since the opening of the school at the beginning of January last, I must say that I consider Mr. Browne a painstaking and very successful teacher.\n\nOwing to the isolated location of this school, I think that it would be impossible to secure the services of a competent teacher to succeed Mr. Browne for less than $500.00 per annum, and the closing of the school for an indefinite period would be disastrous.\n\nI therefore trust that the Department may be able to see its way clear to increasing Mr. Browne's salary to the above mentioned sum.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, October 23, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst., enclosing a communication from Mr. Agent McDonald, covering an application from Mr. J.W. Browne for the position of teacher of the Salmon Indian school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Browne may be appointed to this position at a salary of $300.00 per annum and you will be good enough to advise Mr. McDonald accordingly, in order that the school may be opened as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nH.

W. Browne, making application for the position of teacher in the said school. From his letter it will be seen that before coming to this province, he had a good many years experience in teaching, and he has, since coming here, for several years acted as clerk in Messrs. Thulin Bros. store at Powell River, near Sliammon.\n\nI have known Mr. Browne personally for some years, and am aware that he is well liked by the Indians, and feel sure that he will make a good teacher.\n\nThe Rev.

He said to tell you that he will be in New Westminster Monday or you can reach him by telegraph at P. head quarters in Vancouver.\n\nWhen I see you I will give you my reasons for resigning in full.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJW L Brown.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nOctober 24, 1911.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your favor of the 15th inst., No. 246210/1,\nI beg to enclose herewith resignation of Mr. J.W.L. Browne,\nteacher of the Sliammon Indian Day School, and would beg to\nstate that the reasons why I did not transmit this before, are\nas follows.\n\nOn receipt of Mr. Browne's resignation, I made inquiry\nfrom the Missionary to the Sliammon Indians, Father Wagner, and\nalso a number of the Indians themselves, and from the best infor-\nmation I could gather, I concluded that the whole trouble arose\nover the fact that Mr. Browne called in a Doctor from Powell\nRiver to see an old man, who was very ill with a tumor on the\nneck. This old man's son-in-law, (Joe Gallihar, who is not an\nIndian), was very much offended when asked by the teacher, Mr.\nBrowne, to look after his father-in-law. Then it appears that\nMrs. Gallihar made some slanderous statements in regard to Mr.\nBrowne, which as far as I can gather, have no foundation, in\nfact.\n\nI then wrote to Mr. Browne and asked him to be good\nenough to let his resignation stand over, until I had an oppor-\ntunity of visiting Sliammon, and investigate this matter, which\nhe agreed to do.\n\nOwing to the fact that the fishing and hop-picking\nindustry are centered in this Agency, and on account of the\nProvincial Exhibition being held, it was impossible for me to visit Sliammon until the 13th inst., on which date I arrived there accompanied by Inspector Ditchburn.\n\nI might further state in this connection that at a meeting of these Indians held on their reserve on Saturday the 14th inst., at which Inspector Ditchburn and myself were present, the Chief of this band stated publicly to the meeting, while referring to the charges made against Mr. Browne, that the charges originated amongst some of his people over a year ago, that they had then been taken up, and investigated, and he understood that they had been settled, and he was very sorry to see this trouble resurrected.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that Mr. Browne, informed Mr. Ditchburn and myself, while at the reserve, that he was willing to continue teaching until the 1st of April next, or until such time as the Department procured a successor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 15, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant with enclosure from F.

You will be good enough to continue your efforts with a view to securing the services of a suitable teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nDecember 8, 1911.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to enclose herewith letter received from Mr. F.L.T. Donroe, applicant for the position of teacher of the Sliammon Indian Day School, in which the writer states that he cannot consider accepting the position, as the salary is altogether too small.

Living as it is now in B.C., that salary ($500) merely pays one man's board and barely enough for his clothing. Where would the money come from for fare, freight and food for eleven others?\n\nWell, it does not pay for the interest of the money spent for my education. Who will pay for experience and skill? I cannot even think to stir for that money.\n\nIt would have to be nearly doubled before I could stand, and with the promise of at least three years stay in the school, under kindly and kind protection from my kindness on the part of the Indians.\n\nI merely present to you the picture of reality and it has stood and stands.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nP. T. Denner.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6415, file 845-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nTo Rev. Austin Donner,\nEditor Western Catholic,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nReverend Father:\n\nIn the issue of the Western Catholic of Oct. 27th, I notice your advertisement for a Catholic teacher, married and competent, for an Indian School.\n\nPlease allow me to offer my services, presuming I hold the desired requirements. My qualifications are First Class for this Province. We have ten children (12 of a family) and I have always been acknowledged competent as far as teaching goes.\n\nMoreover, for several years, I had the direction of a Chipewa Indian School. I have always commanded the best of salaries.\n\nWhere is the School? Is there a dwelling house with or near it? What salary is paid?\n\nHoping to receive a favorable reply,\n\nWith the profoundest feelings of respect,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nReverend Father,\n\nYour Most Devoted Servant,\n\nR.S.R. Donner\nOttawa, November 29, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant advising the Department that you have had an application from Mr. F. L. T. Donroe for the position of teacher of the Sliammon school.\n\nIn regard to the salary I may state that on the same date the Department wrote you advising that the sum of $500.00 would be paid to Mr. MacDonald provided he could supply satisfactory recommendations. These remarks will hold good for Mr. Donroe. The Department would, however, like to have definite information as to his age and whether he is married or single and the application should be accompanied by testimonials. The Department will then be able to come to a final decision with regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nNovember 20, 1911.\n\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of an application from Mr. Denree, for the position of teacher, of the Sliammon Indian Day School. Coupled with the application there is a request for information as to the amount of salary the Department is prepared to pay.

This is upon condition that Mr. MacDonald can supply satisfactory references. No mention is made by you as to his experience. The fact that he has a first-class certificate is noted. You may advise Mr. MacDonald to this effect and communicate again with the Department.\n\nYour remarks with regard to the closets are noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nNovember 10, 1913.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nWith reference to your letter dated the 3rd inst., and No. 246210/1.\n\nI beg to state that I have consulted with the church authorities with a view to obtaining a suitable person to take charge as teacher of the Sliammon Indian Day School. I have received an application for the position of teacher for the above named school, from Mr. John A. MacDonald, B.C., but his application is accompanied by a number of inquiries, such as to the location of the school, and the salary the Department is prepared to pay.\n\nI have written to Mr. MacDonald, telling him where the school is situated, and I would like the Department to be good enough to advise me as to the amount of salary they are prepared to pay to a competent teacher. Mr. MacDonald holds a \"First Class\" life certificate.\n\nWith reference to the estimate of the cost of erecting two separate closets, at the Sliammon Indian Day School, I beg to state that on receipt of instructions from the Department on this matter; I wrote at once to Powell River which is situated about one hundred and twelve miles up the coast from here, and about three or four miles from the Sliammon Indian Reserve; at which place there is a saw-mill, planer, etc., for manufacturing...\nthe necessary material.\n\nOn receipt of information from the parties to whom I have written, as to the cost of these closets; I will advise the Department at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 3, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo with explanations regarding the resignation of Mr. Browne, teacher of the Salmon Indian school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the same are satisfactory. The Department will be pleased to retain Mr. Browne, who, you state, is willing to remain until such time as a successor can be obtained.\n\nIn the meantime you should communicate with the church authorities with a view to obtaining a suitable person to take charge of the school and submit the names of any applicants together with particulars as to their qualifications to the Department.\n\nI have to call your attention to the last paragraph of the Department's letter of the 15th ultimo in which you were asked for an estimate of the cost of erecting two separate closets.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, December 16, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant enclosing an application from Mr. Basil Nicholson for the position of teacher at the Sliammon Indian Day School in place of Mr. Biggar lately resigned.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Nicholson's appointment is approved and his salary will be at the same rate as Mr. Biggar's, viz.- $600.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I may say that Mr. Nicholson, with his wife and child, went to teach at Sliammon school on the 8th of November last, and, I believe, is giving entire satisfaction to the Indians.\n\nHe informed me that his Grace, the Right Rev. Archbishop Casey, Vancouver, B.C., was to have written the department recommending his appointment to the position. Owing to the absence of his Grace from Vancouver, the letter referred to was not forwarded up to the present, but I understand from a telephone message received that it has been sent by today's mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n646 Richards St.\nVancouver B.C.\n8 Nov. 1913\n\nMr. Byrne Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHearing that you have a vacancy for a teacher at Shannan school, I respectfully apply for same. During my early years I have been a teacher. I have had considerable experience with the Northern Banking Co.

Since coming to this country in spring of last year, I held a position in the Audit Dept. of the B.C. Electric Ry.

He has been an official in the Northern Banking Co., Ireland, and for several years has held a responsible position in the Carndonagh Branch of that Company Co.

He has been employed by \"The Northern Banking Coy. Ltd.\" who have their Head Office in the City of Belfast and should be found a competent and capable young man. He is desirous of improving his position and has consequently decided to emigrate to Canada where one of his brothers has already gone. It is unnecessary for me to say that I sincerely wish him the greatest possible success in the New Country to which so many of our young men are at present turning their attention.\n\n(Sgd) Thomas Henry\nShareholder Northern Banking Coy. Ltd.\nOttawa, November 27, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant enclosing the resignation from October 31st, last, of Mr. M. L. Biggar, teacher of the Sliammon Day School, and also his return of attendance for the month of October.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that this resignation is accepted. The returns received show that Mr. Biggar taught this school twenty-two days in the September quarter and twenty-three days during the month of October, a total of forty-five days during the current school year, for which he is entitled to be paid 45/200 of his yearly salary of $600.00, or $135.00. The Department, having no knowledge of his intention to resign before the end of the school year, viz.- June 30th, next, paid him for the September quarter $150.00, one-fourth of his yearly salary. He is, therefore, overpaid $15.00 for the forty-five days he taught during the September quarter and the month of October.\n\nMr. Biggar was also the janitor of this school, for which service he was to receive $5.00 per month. He has been paid to August 1st, last, and for the three months of August, September and October he earned $15.00.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nThis amount for janitor's services will balance the $15.00 over-payment for his services as teacher. Mr. Biggar has, therefore, been paid in full to October 31st, last, as teacher and janitor at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst.

In reply beg to say that the remuneration asked for by the teacher, for this work is altogether out of the question, and even the amount suggested you, namely: $10 per month or $100 per annum would nearly double the sum paid by the Department in schools where there are furnaces to be attended which give more work. It is not considered necessary to wash the windows nor to scrub the floors so frequently. If the teacher is willing to accept $50 per annum, you may engage him on those terms, otherwise it would be better to find some reliable Indian who would do it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Edgar Biggar, teacher of the Sliammon Indian Day School, for an increase in his salary equal to the janitors work, in connection with the sweeping and cleaning etc. of the school.\n\nFormerly some of the Indian women from the village attended to the work of keeping this school clean, but owing to difficulties that arose between the Indians and Mr. Biggar's predecessors, I considered it advisable that he do this work himself.\n\nI consider that Mr. Biggar is entitled to some remuneration, and would respectfully recommend that his application receive favourable consideration, and that he be allowed $10.00 a month, instead of $20.00, for the work necessary to be done in connection with cleaning the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSliammon Indian Day School, Powell River P.O., B.C.\nMarch 1st, 1913.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince I first arrived here apart from my regular duties as teacher, I have always been in charge of the general cleaning of the school buildings and grounds, but lately owing to the increase in the number of my pupils I find that nearly all my time is taken up in the interest of the school, under these circumstances I consider myself justified in applying for an increase in my salary to cover porter's wages.\n\nThus - Sweeping and dusting daily, scrubbing floors weekly, washing windows etc., monthly, etc. - These extra duties I consider are worth $20.00 per month, accordingly I am making herewith a formal application for such.\n\nHoping you will kindly give this your considerate attention as soon as possible,\n\nI am yours truly\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher.\n\nTo Mr. Peter Byrne,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nIndian Affairs\n\nNew Westminster, BC\nJuly 8, 1912\n\nSir,\n\nMay I have your assistance in obtaining a flag for use at the Shuswap Indian Day School?

This, I may say, is the highest salary allowed by this Department in the province of British Columbia. Although Mr. Biggar has had experience in teaching it has evidently been in higher institutions and it is not stated that he holds a professional certificate; nevertheless, the Department is prepared to allow this maximum salary and, if this is satisfactory, payment will be made upon receipt of returns for the June quarter for the time that he was in charge. You will be good enough to give instructions with regard to the making out of these returns, a supply of blank forms for this purpose is being sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nJune 18, 1912.\n\nSir;-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith application of Mr. M.

I doubt if he can find any man more suited for the position. He has a white lad to look after his house, and will need a salary of at least $75 per month, and more if it can be had.

Since he took charge I have frequently visited the school as I was very anxious to see how he would fill the position, and I think we could hardly find anyone fitted more to do better work.\n\nCan you possibly arrange to have his salary back to the 27th of April, when he began.\n\nHe has been so quite an expense and is very worthy of the salary given.\n\nHoping to hear from you as soon as convenient.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.B.

As appeared in my letter to the Department dated the 24th of October last, I understood from Mr. Browne while conversing with him in his school at Sliammon, that he was willing to teach until the 1st of April, and I was quite surprised when I found that he had decided otherwise.\n\nI have instructed Chief Tom of the Sliammon band of Indians to look after the school building until such time as a successor to Mr. Browne is appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 28, 1914.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe find it necessary to direct your attention to a balance of $165.00 due us by Mr. M.L.

In June 1912 we sold him a set of Encyclopaedia Britannica for $225.00; payable at the rate of $5.00 a month and he informed us that the books were for the use of the school but that he would take charge of the payments.

In June 1912 we sold him a set of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, lith. edition valued at $225.00 payments to be made at the rate of $5.00 a month. Up to June 1913 payments were made promptly and the account was reduced to a balance of $165.00 but we have since then been unable to obtain any response from Mr. Becerra in regard to the account. It will no doubt interest you to read over the enclosed letters according to which Mr. Becerra purchased the books for the Sliammon School.\n\nWe understand that the former teacher with the Sliammon School was Mr. Edgar J. Biggar perhaps that is the man we are after although the signature on the enclosed letters does not look anything like Biggar.

I am getting the Works for my school\u2014the children co-operating with small collections monthly, so that you will understand that for convenience sake I must overlook the advantage to be gained by cash payments in full.

I will forward the payments on the 25th of each month, as you can understand by this \"system\" I have adapted, there is no bank, (of course I hold myself responsible), however if you could send me cheques to be filled in monthly, it would help me greatly.\n\nRe\u2014another matter, I hold receipt from Freight Office\u2014Vancouver, for $7.65 & that I was obliged to pay before books could\nbe forwarded on, according to the original\nideas I understood that volumes would be\nforwarded free of expense to subscribers, I\nhope this will be rectified at once.\nI enclosed you will find thanks\nfull in, and bill for five dollars being\nmy second payment.\nAmusing you,\nI am Yours truly\nM.

On comparing the letters from Mr. Becerra above referred to with communications on file from Mr. M. L. Edgar J. Biggar the handwriting is found to be very similar and I would not hesitate to say that they are written by the same person. Mr. Biggar severed his connection with this school on the 31st of October, last, and since then we have no record of his whereabouts. I may inform you, however, that he was appointed on the recommendation of His Grace the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Vancouver, the Most Rev. N.

It will not be, perhaps, amiss to tell you in confidence that there was considerable satisfaction at the departure of Mr. Nicholson on account of his drinking habits. There is at present a good woman, whose name I have forgotten for the moment, teaching in the school, and with great satisfaction to all parties concerned. I believe that Mr. Byrne, Indian Agent at New Westminster, will apply for her appointment, whether temporarily or permanent. I am sure, may be left to the good judgment of the Indian Department at Ottawa.\n\nWith much respect, I am,\n\nYours truly in Dno.\n\nArchbp. of Vancouver.\nOttawa, May 12, 1916.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,-\n\nIn reply to the letter from Your Grace of the 4th instant, with reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Sliammon Indian Day School, I beg to say that the Department will await a report from Mr. Agent Byrne concerning this matter, and it is hoped that he will be able to recommend a suitable teacher to take charge of this school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nMost Rev. T. Casey,\nArchbishop of Vancouver,\nShaughnessy Heights,\nVancouver, B. C.\nReferring to Departmental letter dated 3rd inst. No. 246210/1, re the resignation of Mr. Basil Nicholson, as teacher of the Indian Day School at Sliammon, and his successors there, Mr. & Mrs. Marsden; would say that Mr. Nicholson made up his mind rather suddenly to join the colors, and on him notifying me that he was going to leave I advised Mr. & Mrs. Marsden, who were then waiting for a reply from the Department, in regard to their application for the position of teacher and matron at Chehalis, in regard to this vacancy, stating the salary which their predecessor Mr. Nicholson was receiving, and they accepted the position at the same salary, pending the opening of the school at Chehalis.\n\nAs the present school term, until the holiday, is only about seven weeks, I do not think it will be possible for me to get a school at Chehalis, and the teachers cottage put in proper repair for occupancy in time to justify the opening of this school before the summer holidays commence. I will, however, proceed with the work as rapidly as possible, and also advise Mr. & Mrs. Marsden of the decision of the Department in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 19, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in reference to the appointment of teachers for the Sliammon and Chehalis schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if Mr. and Mrs. Marsden decide to go to Chehalis after the summer holidays you will be good enough to take the necessary steps to secure a suitable teacher for the Sliammon School. Kindly advise the Department as to what action you take in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nTO:- The Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, CANADA.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn April 1916, I left my position as Teacher of Sliammon Day School, New Westminster Agency, B.C., to join the Overseas Military Forces. At that time you were good enough to keep my situation open for me should I return after the War, a consideration which I fully appreciated.\n\nI would, however, like to bring to your notice, that other Branches of the Civil Service, notably the Post Office, as well as Provincial and Municipal Authorities, Railway Companies, and large Business Firms, such as Eaton's, besides keeping open the positions of their employees who enlisted, also carried them on the pay-roll for a certain period, for the whole or part of their salaries. I know of many such cases; I believe the C.P.R. carried their men for six months at full pay. I have met one man connected with the Law Courts in a certain Province who is having two-thirds of his pay put to his credit all the time he is on Active Service.\n\nMy object in writing is to respectfully ask the Department for some consideration on the above lines. I may say owing to the increased cost of living my Wife living in Vancouver finds it a very hard proposition to keep herself and our three children on the income she is receiving at the present time. I would thank you very much if you would kindly take this matter up and give it your favourable consideration.\n\nMy Wife and family are living at:-\n905 Howe Street,\nVancouver, B.C.\nFor reference I would refer you to Rev. Dr. O'Boyle, O.M.I., P.P., 646 Richards Street, Vancouver, and Mr. Byrne, the Agent at New Westminster, for any enquiries you might wish to make.\n\nAs I may be moving from here very shortly, expecting to be moved to the Pay Corps, London, I beg for the favour of a reply to the undernoted address.\n\nI remain,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nBasil Nicholson\n\n645259 Pte. B. Nicholson,\n5 Ashbrooke, Coleraine,\nCounty Derry, Ireland.\nOttawa, November 23, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant in regard to the salary of Mr. Marsden, teacher of the Sliammon Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to increase Mr. Marsden's salary, but Mr. Agent Byrne has been written to for a report in regard to the work done by Mrs. Marsden and informed that the Department is prepared to consider the question of paying her a small amount annually for field matron work, provided he thinks it is advisable to do so. As soon as his report is received the matter will be dealt with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n249 Hastings St., East,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, 31st November, 1916.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department desires to draw your particular attention to the case of Mr. and Mrs. Maraden who are at Sliammon. Mr. Maraden has charge of the Indian Day School and is paid salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum. In your letter of the 8th August (file 246210-1) in which you referred to the Maradens' work, you mentioned Mrs. Maraden as field matron. She is not entitled at the present time to that rank, as her appointment to that office was made in connection with her work at Chokalis. Since her removal to Sliammon she has not been recognized by the Department as a field matron.\n\nA report dated the 15th November has been received by the Department from Mr. R.H. Cairns bearing on this matter. He states that Mrs. Maraden visits the homes of the people and takes a special interest in the women and children on the reserve, particularly with regard to their physical and moral welfare, but he remarks that as there is a hospital within two miles of Sliammon where medical treatment is available, he does not recommend her appointment as a field matron.\n\nMr. Cairns recommended that Mr. Maraden's salary as teacher of the Sliammon School be increased to $720.00 per annum. The Department is not disposed to augment his salary, but at the same time recognizes that $600.00 is a small amount to pay for the work which is being done jointly by Mr. and Mrs. Maraden. It is therefore desired that you will look into the matter and make report stating your view of the case. If you are of the opinion that the services of a field matron are required at\n\nPeter Byrne Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6415, file 845-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nIf you think that Mrs. Marsden should be paid for work of that kind, you should make a definite recommendation in regard thereto. The Department is prepared to consider the question of paying a small amount annually to her for field matron work, provided you think it advisable to do so. You should lay before the Department the conditions which exist on the Slismen Reserve, and state whether the work done at the Hospital referred to by Mr. Cairns meets all the requirements of the Indians of the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n249 Hastings St. East,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nNov. 15th, 1916.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of Oct. 31st, re the salary of Mr. William Marsden, teacher of the Indian Day School at Sliammon, came to hand during my absence in the North.\n\nMr. Marsden has a good education, but no training as a teacher. He took charge of this school in April 1916.\n\nMr. Marsden is doing good work in the classroom. His work on the whole is satisfactory. He is tidy, energetic, and alert. He is kind and considerate in his treatment of the pupils.\n\nMrs. Marsden visits the homes of the people. She is taking a special interest in the women and the children of the Reserve. She evinces a keen interest in the physical and moral welfare of the people.\n\nIn view of the fact that there is a hospital within two miles of the Village, where medical treatment is available, I would not recommend a Field-Matron.\n\nI would, however, respectfully recommend, taking into account the efficient work of Mr. Marsden, and the ever increasing cost of living, that his salary be increased to $720.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.M. Cairns.\nOctober 31, 1916.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI have received an application for an increase in the salary of Mr. Marsden, Teacher at the Indian school at Sliammon, B.C., or for a grant for Mrs. Marsden as field matron.\n\nWill you please let me have a report from you with reference to the work of Mr. Marsden and let me have your opinion regarding increased emolument for them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n249 Hastings Street, East,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the application made by the Rev. J. B. McDonald for an increase in salary to Mr. Marsden, teacher of the Indian school at Sliammon, which has been sent to the Department by Mr. McKenna, I beg to say that Mr. Marsden is at present in receipt of a salary of $600.00, not $500.00 as mentioned by Father McDonald. At the time of his appointment he was aware that this was the salary he was to receive, in fact he took this position in preference to the school at Chehalis, where he and Mrs. Marsden would have received a joint salary of $900.00.\n\nThere has never been a field matron at Sliammon, although there are as many Indians there as at Chehalis, where one is provided for. If it is thought advisable to have a field matron at Sliammon the position could be given to Mrs. Marsden and this would give them a salary of $900.00 a year! It\nIt is hardly fair to make a comparison between the salaries paid at Massett and Sliammon, as there is a much larger enrolment at Massett and the cost of living is considerably higher there than in the Westminster Agency.\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns in his report on the Sliammon School reports favourably on Mr. Marsden's work and says that Mrs. Marsden visits in the homes and tries to stimulate the girls and women to keep their homes neat and tidy. She is actually doing as good work as the ordinary field matron and there is no good reason why they should not be paid as well here as at Chehalis, but as they took $600.00 in preference to $900.00 at Chehalis I do not see that the Department is in any way to blame.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6415, file 845-1, part 1)\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nThe Rev. J. B. McDonald, who was a lad when I was a senior student and whose family on P. E. Island are old friends, is now stationed at Powell River, B. C. He writes me:\n\n\"I am quite interested in the Indian school at Sliamond. It is conducted by Mr and Mrs Marsdon -- a very fine English family. But they only get $500.00 per year. Can't you arrange it with the Department so that they will have a little more to live on. Try and get at least $25.00 per month for the woman - so she can help. That is if you can't get $75.00 for Mr Marsdon. Up at Massett the teacher gets $75.00 and his wife gets $25.00. Mr. McDonald was there for a time. This is a special case and being valuable people they should be encouraged. I feel confident you will help. I am also writing to Mr Byrne, of New Westminster\".\n\nI have replied that I have really nothing to do with such matters, but that I am bringing his favourable comments and suggestions respecting the Marsdons to your attention, assuring him that you are deeply interested in Indian education and always give sympathetic consideration to the claims of teachers. I have added, however, that much depends upon the report of Mr Agent Byrne, and that you have to keep within the appropriation for education, and that these are times in which it is difficult to get increased appropriations outside of war purposes.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.-General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6415, file 845-1, part 1)\nReferring to Departmental letter dated the 29th ultimo No. 246210/1, dealing with the question of teachers for the Sliammon Indiam Day School. I beg to state, in confirmation of my letter dated the 13th July, last, that Mr. and Mrs. Marsden have decided to remain at Sliammon School as Teacher for $600.00 per annum, and Matron, instead of taking charge of the new school to be opened at Chehalis.\n\nPrevious to the date on which Mr. Marsden took over Sliammon School, the Indians seemed to express considerable dissatisfaction with the then teacher, and in fact with myself, as Indian Agent; chiefly owing to the determination of the Indians to cut and sell timber without the consent of the Department to do so, and my action of seizing a certain boom so cut and collection therefrom timber dues amounting to $500.00.\n\nI do not consider that the appointment of a truant officer will tend to increase the attendance at this school as the Indians of this band are rather difficult to control at times. I think, however, that the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Marsden on the reserve continuously will have a very beneficial effect, and I am in hopes that the attendance at school will be up to the maximum before the end of the present quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 29, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of the 19th of May, last, in which you were instructed to take the necessary steps to secure a suitable teacher for the Sliammon school, if Mr. and Mrs. Marsden decide to go to Chehalis after the summer holidays. The Department would like to know what action you have taken in regard to securing teachers for these two schools.\n\nMr. Inspector Gains, in a recent report on the Sliammon school, states that the attendance is poor, partly due to the fact that the Indians are away from home frequently and partly due to indifference on the part of some of the parents. Kindly state whether you consider a truant officer should be appointed for this school and, if so, you should give the name of a suitable Indian to act in this capacity and state what remuneration he would expect for his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The mothers of the children are very pleased with Mrs. Marsden looking after the children and wish her to stay also.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nChief Charlie X (Watchman)\nFrank William (Shannon Policeman)\n\nCharlie Charlie\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward, herewith, communication received by me from Mr. Basil Nicholson, a former teacher of the Sliammon Indian Day School, desiring to obtain the same position again at an increased salary, and also expressing a wish to have his wife appointed as Field Matron.\n\nIn this connection I beg to state that Mr. Nicholson called at this office on the 12th inst., and showed me letters received by him from the Department in regard to this matter. I informed him that the Day School at Homalco Reserve was closed for the want of a teacher but he stated to me that he did not wish to go up there, as there was no opportunity for him to educate his eldest child who is aged twelve years.\n\nI may add that the first intimation I received of Mr. Nicholson return was when he came into the office on the date above mentioned.\n\nI have not discussed this matter with Mr. Marsden nor his wife, but it is doubtful if they will want to go to Homalco, the only school available.\n\nMr. Nicholson has a wife and three children to support, Mr. Marsden has no family.\n\nI am writing to-day to Mr. Marsden telling him that Mr. Nicholson has returned and has made application for the position of teacher, which he held previous to him leaving for the Front, and stating that the position as teacher at the Homalco Indian Day School is vacant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n1459 Georgia St W\nVancouver B.C.\n13 Apr 1919\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letters 246210/1 of 25 Apr '16\n& 30 Oct '17, I beg to inform you that I returned\nhere & was discharged from the C.S. Navy but\n& am ready to take up my position as Teacher of\nthe Shuswap School.\n\nThe old salary of $50 per month, owing to the\nincreased cost of living, is now quite inadequate\nto support a family man & respectfully ask\nthat the salary be increased to $75 per month.\n\nMrs. Nicholson will be glad to act as\ninstructor to the Indians in the capacity\nof field matron at an independent salary of\n$25 per month.\n\nI cannot afford to lie around idle\n& hope you will place me on your payroll.\non receipt of this letter\n\nI forward this thro' your agent at New Westminster, Mr. Byrde, to whom I reported yesterday 12 inst.\n\nAwaiting your instructions\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nBasil Nicholson\nNovember 22, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Marsden, teacher of the Shuswap Indian Day School, in which he states that the allowance of $50.00 a year for janitor's services, which he receives, barely covers the cost of the fuel necessary to heat the school building.\n\nMr. Marsden has been informed that he is not expected to furnish the fuel for this school out of this allowance and that it should be obtained or requisitioned through you. He has also been informed that, if he has made any payment for fuel since the end of March last, the money will be refunded to him. He has been instructed to forward receipts for any money so expended to you and you will be good enough to transmit these receipts to the Department in the usual way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nNovember 22, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo applying for an increase in your salary as teacher of the Indian school on the Sliammon Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has no funds available to grant you any increase at present. You have been granted a war bonus for the current year of $150.00, $75.00 of which has already been sent you, and the balance will be paid in two quarterly instalments.\n\nWith regard to the allowance of $50.00 a year for janitor's services I beg to say that this paid for janitor's work only and you are not supposed to furnish the fuel for the school. The fuel should be obtained on requisition through the Agent.\n\nIf you have made any payment for fuel for this school since the end of March, last, the amount will be refunded to you. You should forward receipts for any money so expended to Mr. Agent Byrne for transmission to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWilliam Marsden, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSliammon Indian School,\nPowell River, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the application of Mr. William Marsden, teacher at the Indian school on the Gliammon Reserve, for an increase in salary I beg to say that Mr. Marsden is now paid at the rate of $600.00 per annum and has been in charge of this school since April, 1916.\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns reports very favourably on the work of Mr. Marsden; in fact, as far back as November, 1916, he says \"I would respectfully recommend that, taking into account the work of Mr. Marsden and the ever increasing cost of living, his salary be increased to $720.00 per annum\".\n\nMr. Marsden is an educated man, an architect by profession, and he and his wife, who is the field matron, are interested in their work and are obtaining good results.\n\nI think he is justly entitled to be paid at the rate of $700.00 per annum, which is not a high salary for British Columbia, as several of our teachers there are paid at that rate and even higher.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nMr. Marsden received the Acton award in 1915. He has been very active in the school and has been very helpful in the development of the school.\nDear Sir:\n\nI should like to draw the attention of the Dept. to the fact that I have been holding the position as Teacher here for the last two and a half years on a salary of fifty dollars a month, which I presume was the original amount paid to the first teacher some ten years ago.\n\nAs you are aware the cost of living has advanced over a hundred per cent within the last four years in this part of the country. I find my present salary quite inadequate to cover the nearest of living expenses.\n\nThere is a janitor's allowance of fifty dollars per year also, which I receive, but this barely covers the fuel necessary to heat the school buildings.\n\nContrary to the general opinion; living is much higher in a section of country like this, which is non-agricultural, than it is in town; for all provisions, even vegetables, have to be shipped in from the cities, which also entails double freight charges to these outlying places from the nearest shipping point.\n\nI should be glad if the Department could see its way to adjust my salary to meet existing conditions.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Letter to follow.\"\n\nThe Department had promised Mr. Nicholson that if he wished he would be re-instated in the Sliammon school upon his return from overseas service. It was hoped, however, that he would be willing to go to Homalco, but as he is not, there is only the one course to take.\n\nYou will be good enough to offer Mr. Marsden the position of teacher at Homalco at the same salary as he is receiving and the Department will pay his transportation to that point.\n\nAs soon as you have learned of Mr. Marsden's decision, kindly advise the Department, and if he decides to go, you should state whether any repairs are necessary to the buildings at that point.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, May 14th, 1919.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of the 12th inst., which reads as follows:\n\n- Advised by Indian Agent, New Westminster, letter received from Department offering me Homalco School, surprised promise return of Sliammon par Department's letters twenty-fifth April, nineteen sixteen, thirteenth October nineteen seventeen, file 246210/1, ignored, why prefer temporary occupants at Sliammon before a returned soldier who looked to Sliammon as a certainty when they have no children and Homalco is unsuited for education my children. Am idle awaiting confirmation of promise made; please wire answer.\n\nWhen the Department suggested that you should go to Homalco it was not aware that you had a family whose education might be interfered with, and I might also add that some of the Indians had expressed a desire to have Mr. Marsden retained. However, as the proposed change is not agreeable to you, the Department is quite willing that you should again take charge of the Sliammon school, and the agent has been so advised.\n\nIt is hoped that you will take hold of your work in earnest so that the Indians may have no ground for complaint.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBasil Nicholson, Esq.,\n1459 Georgia St.W.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, May 14, 1919.\n\nPeter Byrne,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDepartment decided to place Mr. Nicholson in charge of the Sliammon School and so advised him.

His appointment at Slismoon was only temporary to fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Nicholson's enlistment.\n\nKindly advise the Department whether Mr. Marsden agrees to go to Homalco and, in the event of his doing so, whether any repairs are needed to the teacher's quarters there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been brought to my knowledge that outside influences are at work to persuade the Indians of Sliammon, to accept the reinstatement of their previous teacher, Mr Nicholson.\n\nThe good Indians of this band realize the detriment that would ensue to their village and children, by the appointment of this man, who by his previous record and intemperate habits, proved himself totally unfit for this position.\n\nSince the possibility of his reinstatement has become known to the Indians, I have had several visits from the parents of the children attending the school, expressing their disgust at such a possibility in no uncertain language, and have begged me and my wife to stay with them, rather than their children should again be under the charge and tuition of a drunken man.\n\nWhen I volunteered for Indian work and was appointed the teacher at Sliammon, I was informed that Mr Nicholson had been given the option of resigning his position and joining the colors, or being summarily discharged and face the possibility of being sent to prison.\n\nFar be it from me to hinder this man if he wishes to make good again! But if he wants to continue in Indian work let him\nat least go where he can hope to have some influence, and not where I\ntold even the children have constantly seen him in an intoxicated\ncondition, and witnessed his being carried across the village to his own\nquarters in a helpless drunken state.\n\nIt is because we have the interest of these Indian children\nand their parents at heart, among whom we have lived and worked for\nthe last three years, that I feel it is my duty to write you on this\nmatter. If it were to make way for a couple who were at least inter-\nested in the welfare of the Indians,- we would willingly resign, if the\nDepartment so desired- but we cannot relegate these little children,\nto the contempt and neglect in which we found them three years ago,\nwithout at least making some protest on their behalf.\n\nTrusting you will give this matter your earliest consideration.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nWilliam Marsden.\nSliammon Indian Reserve,\nPowell River, B.C.\nMay 19th, 1919.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe, the undersigned members of the Sliammon Band of Indians, wish to call your attention to the fact that undue influence is being used to get us to sign a petition to ask that our present teacher be removed from his duties at once.\n\nWe wish to put on record that we protest emphatically at this procedure, as we are very proud of our teacher, and all he is doing for us in looking after our interests, much in the checking off of consignments of timber from this Reserve, along with his duties as teacher of our children. Also we are very grateful to his wife for her care for us in our sickness and the way she looks after the welfare of our girls.\n\nWe understand there is a strong movement going on to reinstate our former teacher\u2014Mr. Nicholson. In our opinion, the return of Mr. Nicholson in the capacity of teacher, would be a very bad thing for our Reserve, as he gave us much trouble, and was a very bad example through his constant drunken habits, when he was here before.\n\nWe beg to remain,\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nChief X Charlie\nChief X Williams\nFrank X Williams.\u2014Sliammon Policeman\nJohnny X Louis\nFrank X Paul\nJoe X Gallegos\nSam X Adams\nWillie John\nJoe Galle Joe\nOld X Francis\nJim Harry\nBilly Williams\nJohnny X George\nAlex X Gallegos\nBilly X Gallegos\nJimmy X Williams\nKasper X Francis\nScottie X Francis\nCharlie Charley\n\nIndian Affairs.

Letter to follow.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Nicholson enlisted he was promised that, if he wished, he would be re-instated in the Sliammon School upon his return from overseas service, and, as he was unwilling to accept the school at Homalco, the Department had no option but to fulfill its promise to him.\n\nYou have laid great stress on Mr. Nicholson's intemperate habits. I may inform you that up to the time of his enlistment the Department had never had any complaints on this score.\n\nMr. Byrne was instructed to offer you the position of teacher at Homalco at the same salary as you are receiving and to inform you that the Department will pay your transportation to that point. If you decide to accept this offer the building there is to be put in repair.\n\nI may add that your appointment at Sliammon was only during Mr. Nicholson's absence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChief Charlie,\nSliammon Indian Reserve,\nPowell River, B.C.\nSir,\n\nReferring to Departmental Letter dated the 2nd inst., No. 246210/1, I beg to state that Mr. Nicholson has gone up to take charge of the Sliammon Indian Day School.\n\nI notified Mr. Maraden in regard to Mr. Nicholson reinstatement to this position, but he would not consider my advice until he had received confirmation from the Department, hence he did not leave the premises until about the end of June.\n\nOwing to the strike it was impossible for a person to get to Sliammon, or for people from Sliammon to get to Vancouver, this condition continued for several weeks, and it was only when I had some repairs made to the gasoline launch \"Gu-Kumi\" which has been in my charge since last Spring, that I was able to reach Sliammon.\n\nI visited this Reserve and interviewed Mr. Maraden on the 24th ult., and I also took him and his wife to Churchouse on the Gasoline Boat, in order to give him an opportunity to examine the school building and meet the Indians, after which he informed me that he might possibly take the Homalco School, if certain repairs and improvements were made.\n\nI am getting particulars in regard to the repairs and improvements and will advise the Department further, as soon as possible.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIn the meantime I take it for granted that Mr. Marsden will take charge of the Homalco Indian Day School, at the end of the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nShannon Indian Day School\nPowell River P.O.\n17. 7. '19\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI arrived here on 13 June\n& took over charge of the school\nbuilding, Mr. Marston the late\nteacher having left a few days prior\nto my arrival. The school is of course\nclosed for the holidays.\n\nIn my letter of 13 April last\nto the Secretary of the Department &\nsent thro' your office, I made\napplication for my reinstatement\nas teacher of this school and also\nfor the appointment of my wife\nas Field Matron. On receiving the\nDepartment's wire of 14 May last\n(confirmed later by their letter of\nsame date) telling me to take charge\nof the school again immediately\nreported to you & you advised\nadvised me that the resident teacher would have to be given time to vacate the position & that you would further advise me when to take up my duties. In a conversation at a later date you informed me I should be ready to leave about the middle of June. On the 3rd June the recent strike spread to Vancouver lasting till about 10 days & owing to no boat service I was unable to get away. I reported to you several times during the interval.\n\nAs I informed the Dept in my letter of 13 April that I was ready to take up my duties then & they requested me to do so by their wire of 14 May & that it was their no fault of mine not being able to get here earlier, having held myself in readiness to move. I think it only reasonable to expect my salary to date from 1 May.\nI would point out that it was a matter of considerable expense & loss to me living in Vancouver during the time I was waiting to get here & certainly could not afford to be idle for so long.\n\nI will thank you to bring this matter before Ottawa at your earliest convenience & as it will be a long time or the salary for this quarter reaches me (early in November) & I have by no means sufficient funds to carry on with till then, a cheque covering the period to 30 June would be much appreciated.\n\nI would also point out that further reasons already given my wife was unable to take up her duties as Field Matron & she would be glad to know what date the Dept. propose to pay her salary from.\n\nThere is also the matter of\nOf the expense of travelling here & I would thank you to recommend transportation for myself & family.\n\nTrusting to your support & hoping for a favorable reply,\n\nI am Dear Sir\n\nYours Respectfully\n\nBasil Nicholson\n\nPte.

A cheque for $105.00, being in payment for thirty-five teaching days from May 13th to June 30th at the rate of $600.00 per annum, is being sent to you under separate cover, which you will be good enough to see that he receives.\n\nIn reference to the payment of salary to Mrs. Nicholson as field matron for the same period, I beg to say that the Department cannot make any payment to her for the period covered in paying Mr. Nicholson. You will be further advised regarding the amount of salary which she is to receive and she will be instructed as to the duties she is to perform as field matron on the Sliammon Reserve.\n\nMr. Nicholson will be paid a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

It is assumed that in the event of Mrs. Marsden taking charge of the Homalco School, Mrs. Marsden will hold office as field matron at Homalco and be paid a salary of $300.00 a year for her services, which I may say, was the salary allowed for field matron work at that School when it was previously in operation. (The School has been closed for sometime).\n\nMr. Marsden's salary as teacher at the last mentioned School will be at the rate of $600.00 a year. If Mrs. Marsden is to receive the appointment as field matron, Mr. Byrne will be advised to that effect.\n\nAgent Byrne has been given to understand that Mrs. Nicholson will be paid for field matron work at Sliammon Reserve. It is assumed that the rate of payment will be the same as has been allowed heretofore, viz. $300.00 per annum. The salary of the teacher at Sliammon School is $600.00 a year. I shall be glad to know whether payment at the rate mentioned is to be allowed Mrs. Nicholson.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAccountant.\n\nOttawa, 15th August, 1919.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Medical Health Officer resides at Powell River which is about three miles from the Indian village. He could give these pupils an examination once a year without much effort.

Original on 246210-2.\n\nThe school and contents were all destroyed by the bush fire which wiped out the village on the 27th of September, 1919.\n\n(Sgd.) Basil Nicholson,\nTeacher.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nReferring to the request of Mr. Basil Nicholson, teacher of the Shuswap Indian Day School, for an increase in salary, which request has been forwarded by Mr. R. S. Clements, M.P., I beg to say that Mr. Nicholson is returned soldier and has three years' experience in teaching before enlistment. Upon his return from overseas he was appointed teacher of this school in September, 1919, with a salary at the rate of $600 per annum and bonus of $150\u2014a combined amount of $750. He has no professional qualifications.\n\nMr. Nicholson's wife performs the duties of Field Matron, and receives a salary of $460 per annum and bonus of $150, a total of $610. He and his wife thus receive a combined salary and bonus of $1360; besides there is a 6 roomed cottage provided as a teacher's residence.\n\nThere is an enrollment of 27 pupils, with an average attendance of 14. Mr. Inspector Cairns, in his last report of inspection, states \"The pupils are making progress. All manual work is highly satisfactory. They read, spell, write and do simple number work very well. They are well instructed in letter-writing.\"\n\nRegarding the bonus to be paid to teachers during the present year, I beg to say that this has not yet been fixed. The bonus to others in the past was paid at the flat rate of $150, which was considerably lower than allowed to Civil Servants. As you are aware, there is a reduction of 25% in the bonus to the Service, but I would suggest, in view of the fact that teachers do not receive the same scale of payment, that their bonus be maintained at the same rate as formerly, viz., $150 per annum. If not, we will no doubt be called upon to make up the difference, which would lead to a further increasing difficulty in obtaining the services of teachers, in view of the fact that teachers in white schools are paid higher salaries than we pay teachers of Indian schools.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Nicholson, we might allow him an increase of $100, which would bring his salary up to the amount paid to one or two other teachers in B. C. who have the same qualifications.\n\nThe correspondence is attached herewith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHSC:MAC\n\nEnc.\nDear Sir,\n\nSome little time ago, Mr. Ross Perrys was kind enough to take up with you the matter of some correspondence in my salary. I would be glad to know what you were able to do for me. Perhaps you would also be good enough to let me know how the Indian Dept. paid our ratings in way of St. L. Bonus this year. I am sure it is unnecessary for me to point out that the cost of living has gone down very little, especially to people resident far from town & unable to take advantage of sales. I hope you will do what you can for me & am sure you will recognize that $50.00 a month could hardly be called an adequate salary even in pre-war times, as it is my salary & bonus ($750 per ann) combined does not pay the grocery bill for the family of five.

In accordance with the Department's request I have consulted with Mr. Inspector Cairns, who does not wish to recommend an increase at the present time, as he does not consider the advance or the nomadic conditions which exist in the Shilammon Band would justify him in recommending an increase. While I am inclined to view the matter in the same light as Inspector Cairns, yet I feel I should point out to the Department that any deficiency that may exist in regard to school results is more than made up by the assistance which Mr. Nicholson is able to give the Indians of the Reserve and the Indian Office in regard to the general oversight of Indian matters in the Reserve, and with this in view together with the fact that both Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson have to travel two miles to and from Powell River over an exceedingly bad road by car or else on the water by launch, either of which entails expense, in connection with their purchase of supplies and other errands in the white community, also in view of the years of service of both Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson, I am of the opinion that a small increase of salary would not be out of order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[C.C.Perry]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Nicholson furnished me with a statement of his record of service which is as follows:\n\nEntered Service November 13, 1913, and worked to Apr. 1916. Joined up with the Canadian Expeditionary Force and served in this capacity from April 1916 to May 1919. He resumed at Sliammon on May 14, 1919 and has been receiving a salary of $750.00 a year.\n\nMr. Nicholson feels that an increase would be in order on account of service and appears to be under the impression that his salary would be increased yearly under the Civil Service classification until a maximum would be reached.\n\nMr. Nicholson has been informed that his appointment was not made by the Civil Service Commission but by the Church Authorities and does not come under the Civil Service classification, as I was advised by the Department. Mr. Nicholson, however, requested that the Department be good enough to consider this matter and favour him with a reply in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.C.

No certificate, but has been in charge of this school over six years. He served here three years, then went overseas for three years and has served three years since returning.\n\nThe standard in this school is very low. The pupils are making very slow progress. With the exception of two who are using the First Reader, all other pupils are struggling with word recognition. These pupils, it seems to me, do not use any English in their homes. The teacher is trying to instruct them in the things about them, i.e., he teaches them the days of the week and the months of the year, a little local geography and the names of the food, etc. Their manual work is only fair, both writing and drawing receive attention.\n\nI would be inclined to think that the teacher has not been up to the standard himself. He has been somewhat irregular in opening and closing the school. This has had a bad influence upon the Indians and the pupils, who learn more by example than precept.\n\nI had a heart to heart talk with Mr. Nicholson concerning the management of the school. I told him that unless the pupils were looked after and urged to attend school that the time would soon come when we would have to consider whether the attendance justified the continuance of the school work.\n\nR.

Cheque in payment of the salary due the late Mr. Nicholson could, no doubt, be made payable to his wife.\n\nIt will also be necessary to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for this school for the coming school year. Mrs. Nicholson is at present field matron. Will the death of her husband necessitate her giving up this position? If she continues, the services of a teacher only will be required. Please forward, for the consideration of the Department, any applications which you receive, together with your recommendation. Full particulars should be given as to the qualifications and experience of any applicants.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C.

This year, it is necessary to reduce grants for the purchase of Christmas gifts, and the above amount is all that can be allowed for each of the schools.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the expenditure for each school, separately. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to report that in the past it has been customary to make a grant of a small amount to each of the day schools to purchase prizes, etc., for the pupils at Christmas time. I have been asked by some of the teachers to inquire whether this will be done again next Christmas. If so, it will be necessary for authority to be granted at least a month before Christmas on account of the remoteness of some of the schools. Last year an order was given for $7.00 each for the three following day schools in this Agency:\n\nSt. Paul's Day School, Mission I.R.No.1,\nSliammon Indian Day School,\nHomalco Indian Day School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 5, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, I beg to say that you may purchase a new heating stove for use in the Sliammon Indian Day School. It is noted that the cost of the stove, pipes and freight will be approximately $21.50.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise that a new heating stove is required for the Sliammon Indian Day School. The one in use is much too small on really cold days but they have carried on with it the best they could.\n\nLast winter the stove cracked in several places and can not be used again this year.\n\nA satisfactory stove can be purchased here for $17.50, the total cost with pipes and freight would be about $21.50 and I respectfully request authority to purchase same.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEnclosure:\n\nB/PM.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball).\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n## Statement\n\n**Powell River, B.C.**\n\nOct. 31st 1933\n\n**Dept. of Indian Affairs,**\nRogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n---\n\n### Powell River Company Limited\n**Department Store**\n\n| BAL.

While I realise it is still over two months before schools close for Xmas, it takes several weeks to make the necessary arrangements.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball.]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 20, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to requisition dated the 9th instant for supplies for the Sliammon Indian Day School, I beg to say that you may purchase 36 bars soap and a small quantity of sewing material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The first eight items are for cleaning the school and school grounds. The milk, sugar and cocoa is to continue supplying the pupils with hot cocoa twice a day and the continuance of this practice is earnestly recommended, especially during the cold rainy months of winter. A hasp and padlock is required for the woodshed as the teacher informs me that fire-wood has been stolen at night.\n\nWith regard to the lumber required, a few shelves are needed in the store-room, but the school inspector has recommended a strip of soft lumber about 2'6\" wide around three sides of the school-room for the purpose of attaching school work, instructional pictures, etc. At present the teacher is unable to attach anything to the walls as they are too hard. The whole cost of the lumber should not be more than four or five dollars.\n\nThis school is making good progress, and I respectfully recommend that the requests be acceded to.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nMillar & Coe Ltd.\n419 West Hastings Street\nVancouver, Canada\n\nNovember 28, 1935\n\nMrs. F J C Hall\nIndian Agent\n2036 Rogers Bldg\nVancouver BC\n\nIn Account with the Dept of Indian Affairs for\nSliammon Indian day School, Powell River BC\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| only Derek teas       | 8        | .19        | 1.52  |\n| \" Marigold \"          | 8        | .19        | 1.52  |\n| \" Springtime teas     | 8        | .19        | 1.52  |\n\nPostage: .55\n\nTotal: 5.11\n\nCash: .11\n\nTotal: 5.00\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1936   | Authority: File 167-24-5 dated Dec.11,1935                              |        |\n| Jan. 31| To lumber supplied for making shelves at Slinnman Indian Day School, as per account attached | $11.79 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 506\n\nIndian Affairs.

Beginning apparently on 1 Sept. 1923 & ending 1 Sept. 1924 I will have received in salary $750 but in fact this sum covers the period from 1 July 1923 to 1 Sept. 1924 - 14 months, so that unless an adjustment is made as preferred above, I am out $112.50. Other teachers are of course in a similar position, according to amount of their salaries.\n\nI delayed taking this matter up with the Dept. until seeing Mr. Barry Inspector. He was here today & agrees with my view.\n\nI would also respectfully point out that for the period from 1 July last to date, I have only received $75 in salary. Our quarter cheque not being expected to arrive for about a week.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nBasil Nicholson\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6415, file 845-3, part 1)\nOttawa, January 21, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the system of payment of salaries to teachers in Indian day schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers the school year to begin on September 1st and end on June 30th.\n\nYour duties began at the Slingsby Indian Day School September 1, 1919, and from that date to June 30, 1920, you were paid your annual salary in four quarterly instalments of the same amount. For the school years 1920-21, 1921-22 and 1922-23, you were paid in the same manner.\n\nBeginning September 1, 1923, you were paid $75.00 for the month of September, $225.00 for the quarter ending December 31st, and the same amount will be paid you at the end of the March and June quarters. At the end of June next, therefore, you will have received your full yearly salary.\n\nI would point out that in the payment of salaries, the annual summer holidays are not taken into account.\n\nThe Department cannot understand why you consider that you will be cut $112.50 owing to the new method of payment. As stated in paragraph three, you formerly received your annual salary of $750.00 in four equal quarterly instalments. At the present time you receive your annual salary at the rate of $1/10 for the month of September and $9/10 for each of the other three quarters. In both cases the full annual salary promised you is being paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBasil Nicholson, Esq.,\nBox 321, Powell River,\nB. C.\nShannon Bay School\nBox 321\nPowell River B.C.\n11 Nov. 1924\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of result file No. 167-24-3 but am sorry that I do not seem to have made myself clear in my letter of result. The teacher's salary is an annual one and he budgets for his expenditure to cover 12 months on it. The number of instalments or proportion of same in which the salary is paid does not affect the issue rather really does the length of the school year. For instance the salary could be paid in one or any number of payments yet it would be annual & the teacher would calculate living for 12 months on it. Beginning with the new system on 1 Sept. 1923 & ending 31 Aug. 1924, a period of 12 months, the teacher will have received a year's salary & the system works out all right for those entering the service on 1 Sept. 1923. But teachers in the service prior to that date have to live from 1 July 1923 to 31 Aug. 1924 - 14 months - on 12 months salary. They have no money wherewith to meet their expenses of living for two months & again respectfully submit that they are justly entitled to be paid two months salary for July & August 1923, this in my case is $125.00 not $125.00 as stated in error in my letter of result. If this is paid the new system works out all right.\n\nI hope the Department will recognize that the teachers have a just claim in this matter. I am really very sorry to\ntrouble the Department by writing again but am sure you will appreciate the fact of the amount involved being a considerable one to the trackers. I really have no money to meet my bills for last July & August.\n\nI entered the service of the Department on 13 Novt 1913, taking charge of this school. I re-commenced my service after the war on 14 May 1919.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nDarel Nicholson\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 20, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th instant, I beg to say that the Department has nothing further to add to our letter of the 21st ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

You might let me know if Mrs. Nicholson is in need of funds. I might add that this matter should be treated confidentially by you for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Cheque for this salary has been duly received and handed over to Mrs. Nicholson who requests me to express her appreciation for it.\n\nI sincerely hope something can be done for the family. The insurance is $700.00 which, with the salary cheque, is less than $1000.00. There are three sons, the eldest working in the Canadian Bank of Commerce in Vancouver. The second son will now leave school and I believe is to given employment by the Powell River Pulp and Paper Co.; the youngest son will continue in school.\n\nEveryone speaks in the highest terms of Basil Nicholson's integrity and I have found him to be the soul of honour in all his dealings with the Indians, who trusted him absolutely. The Nicholsons were an exceptionally happy and united family, well liked by the people of Powell River, and the three sons show the results of their home training.\n\nMrs. Nicholson will carry on as field matron, and a teacher will stay on the Reserve with her. I am sure that anything which the Department will do for them in the way of a gratuity will be deeply appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent\n\nRussell T.

When this teacher, Mr. D.J. Gallagher, was at Homalco School he held classes in the evenings for adults and was quite successful. His idea is to encourage the parents to take an interest in the school in something like a parent-teacher association. This work, of course, is voluntary on the teacher's part, and he says it gives him employment for the long winter evenings when there is nothing else to occupy his mind other than reading.\n\nOne result of these evening sessions was the big increase in attendance of the pupils, some of whom scored 100% per term.\n\nIf this lamp can be supplied, I would like to see Mr. Gallagher encouraged in his voluntary work; although I do not mention it to influence your decision, I might add that it would also be very useful to me when I hold meetings of this Band - usually I have to work by the light of a small oil lamp, the people being practically invisible in the darkness of the room. Nearly all Bands here hold their meetings in the afternoons and evenings.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(F.J.O.
