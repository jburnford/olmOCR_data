O. MAVETY\nFRIDAY, JULY 13, 1888.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the electors of the Saskatchewan District will turn out and do honor to Mr. Macdowall's representations at Ottawa. We have heard nothing from him since his departure, but we believe he has been doing good work there. Mr. Macdowall has done a great deal for this district and it is nothing but right that his political opponents as well as friends should do him honor by giving him a hearty vote.\n\nA large number of tickets have been issued, and we hope to see them all taken up; they can be had from Mr. Jas. McKay.\n\nTHE ASSEMBLY ELECTION\n\nThe final returns from the various polling divisions in Prince Albert District for the Northwest Assembly have been received and are as follows:\n\n| No. | Votes | Plaxton | Betts |\n|-----|-------|---------|-------|\n| 1   | 17    | 55      |       |\n| 2   | 15    | 17      | 28    |\n| 3   | 19    | 19      |       |\n| 4   | 16    | 10      | 28    |\n| 5   | 9     | 14      |       |\n| 6   | 12    | 10      | 28    |\n| 7   | 17    | 4       | 56    |\n| 8   | 21    | 21      |       |\n| 9   | 10    | 15      |       |\n| 10  | 11    | 6       |       |\n| 11  | 12    | 15      |       |\n\nTotal: 307\n\nThe successful candidates being Messrs. Betts and Plaxton. The official returns will be made to-morrow in the Council Chamber, and we do not think it will materially alter the foregoing statement. While we congratulate Messrs. Betts and Plaxton upon their election as representatives to the Northwest Legislature, we regret the defeat of Mr. Hughes for several reasons. Mr. Hughes is a man of undoubted ability, perseverance, and energy in anything he undertakes. He has been a faithful and trust-worthy representative of the N.W. Council for the District of Lorne during the past three years, and did all in his power to advance the interests and welfare of the district he had the honor to represent. From Mr. Hughes' thorough knowledge of the workings of the N.W.C., he would have been an excellent acquisition in the new Assembly. Had he been elected he would, no doubt, have been one of the advisers to the Lt. Governor. Mr. Hughes' defeat is attributable to two causes: first, that one that militated against him was not working himself; while the successful candidates canvassed hard for the position they attained, he did not canvass. Another cause was the lack of opportunity. Mr. Hughes was that he was a Government official, being sheriff. Had he resigned the shiryness no doubt he would have been one of the representatives of this district. Mr. Plaxton, who has resided in this district for a number of years, and is one of our best and most enterprising farmers, and we predict a very promising Northwest Assembly. Mr. Betts, whose election is attributable to the large vote he received where he was best known, is a young man; has occupied many important positions in our town since its formation. At present he is chairman of the Board of School Trustees. Mr. Betts is a good, clear, and effective speaker, and will be a great acquisition in the new legislature of the Territorial. For nearly ten years Mr. Betts has been one of our most successful business men. From his business ability, his energy, perserverance and attention to anything he undertakes, would make an able member of the Advisory Board to the Lieut.-Governor. Capt. Huey, who was also elected for the constituency, is one of the prominent citizens of this country, and is a successful and enterprising farming and will do honor to the district he represents. The contest between Messrs. Mitc- hell of Lake and Mr. Fisher of Batoche, resulted in the return of Mr. Mitchell by a majority of seventeen. Mr. Clunkaskill, the member elect for Battleford, was at the time a resident of Prince Albert when he was engaged in mercantile business, and from what we know of the gentleman, he is able to hold his own with the ablest of them.\n\nMANITOBA ELECTIONS.\n\n(By Special Telegraph.)\n\nThe election which took place on the 11th inst. in Manitoba has resulted in sustaining the Government by an overwhelming majority. Russell was returned from the constituency of Portage la Prairie, the Independent candidate.\n\nCONSTITUENCY. MEMBERS. MAJORITY.\n\nBattleford. Mitchell, 17, M'Leod, 17, 17.\nBatoche.

Body covered With Sores and Ulcers, Cured by CUTICULA Remedies.\n\nI am going to tell you of the extraordinary results obtained on me by using these remedies in about a week in April last. I suffered from severe skin eruptions of the most excoriating description, for four months at least. The pain became almost unbearable and I could hardly get up. If I got up I had to sit down again. The pain was so severe that I could hardly move my limbs or feet. Finally I went to see a doctor and he said it was a skin complaint. He prescribed some medicines which did nothing whatever. So I decided to try the Cuticula Remedies. I used them every night for about a week and then I began to feel a little better. After two weeks I felt much better. Now I am perfectly cured.
