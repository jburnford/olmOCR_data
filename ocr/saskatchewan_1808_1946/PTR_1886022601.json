Pere Foy of St. Albert, has partly recovered from a second attack of rheumatic fever, but is still far from well.\n\nThe small building between the Jasper house and A. Macdonald & Co.'s store was occupied as a station by the police patrol.\n\nJas. Macdonald and J. Kirkness are looking for timber near the river in front of their claims a few feet above the falls.\n\nJ. Kelly has delivered a portion of the machinery required for his new mill at his claim near the White Mud. He is preparing to work the limit during the coming summer.\n\nA desire for telegraphing has seized a portion of the population. As there is no telegraph line running, there is plenty of excellent places for timber and provisions situated.\n\nThe Hays have succeeded in attracting a large proportion of silver from quartz veins recently taken from his mining claim on the Hill Creek, up the river. He is now acquiring machinery with which to develop the claims.\n\nThe contract for the delivery of two telegraph poles on the line between Edmonton and Fort Saskatchewan was let on Wednesday to John Atwood at a cost of $1.50 per pole\u2014a very low rate.

Aggrey and Miss Woodward were the happy couple.\n\nRed Eagle, the wounded Indian chief captured at Fish Creek, was brought into Regina yesterday.\n\nMessrs. Martin and Bortzberger are preparing for the brick making season of '86. Last year this firm turned out upwards of a million bricks. Should it become necessary, machines exist for the manufacture of 20,000 a day.\n\nA nephew of Mr. L. C. McTavish, Government Agent, was accidentally drowned in a well fifteen miles north of Prince Albert on Monday night. Mr. McTavish and Mr. McTavish, nearly of Argyleshire, Scotland, was alone at the time, and when discovered was found to be in a state of shock.\n\nOn Saturday Dr. Collier held an inquest on the body of \"Red Bird,\" killed by a bear. It appears the bear had been suffering from a case of desperation, since the death of his hunter, about a year ago, and while in its last moments it attacked the fatal weapon used. Verdict accordingly.\n\nThe directors of the Regina & Long Lake Railway and Steamboat Co., hold a meeting on Wednesday. The company is in a precarious position.\n\nA steamboat goes on the lake in spring, and indemnities will be offered to the proprietors of Alta Vista and Battleford to adopt this as a steamer and short cut route to the C. P. R.\n\nA Lord Mayor was elected at the meeting on Thursday. Brandy Mac, sentenced to penal servitude for life, was elected mayor over his late lordship. He denies pilfering the public money, and says he cut his heart out on a trophy big bear. Great man is a sorry sight. He is about seventy years old, mongrel, palied, and completely broken up. Humanity speaks long before him more than two years.\n\nSTONEWALL.\n\nFrom the Leader.\n\nBusiness is slack and all hands are apparently waiting for the usual spring thaw.\n\nWe understand that Mayor Murdoch intends calling a meeting of the town council promptly.\n\nMessrs. Loftus and Smith are looking for premises on which to build a large store. They say their present building being too small.\n\nThat portion of township 21 of range 23 west of the third meridian, lying N.E. of Swamp Lake, has been opened for settlement.\n\nMr. Harvey, who was badly injured by a broken leg, a horse having fallen on him. There is a lack on this branch.\n\nThe Lt. Governor has added the name of Alexander Fogg Esq., Dunbow, north of High River, to the list of J.P.s, for the territory.\n\nThompson's new buildings are now completed. They are among the handsomest in town, and the offices being particularly handsome.\n\nThe following Indians\u2014Blackfoot, the Alberta, Montana, Idaho, and Oregon bands\u2014which we understand carry scalp with them, are selling in town at about an average of $5.\n\nBATTLEFORD.\n\nFrom the Herald.\n\nCapt.

JACKSON,\n\nNew shop, in the building lately occupied as a Post Office.\nThe Aberdeen papers speak highly of the exhibit of Northwest products only on view in that city until the close of March. The Prince Albert Land Company, and, as a consequence, the display attracted more than usual attention, the number of visitors the first two days being extraordinary. The interest thus created is calculated to have much greater effect than any number of pamphlets would produce, for the proof of the quality of the soil is capable of producing such specimens of grain as we perceive as we know our prairie men can boast of, is not to be gained. This is the view taken by the managers of this interesting display, and they encourage, by their timely appearance today, are to try and secure the presence of as many as possible of the agricultural communities in the adjoining country, than whom no country can furnish a more desirable class of voters.\n\n**SEED GRAIN.**\n\nA good number of seed-grain for Troy this week in hand, in good condition. The commissioners let contracts for about 200 tons of freight, but have received orders from Winnipeg that the balance of the seed will be shipped by rail direct to Fort Macdonald, and the remainder of the seed will be shipped by water. The contracts will be let at Qu'Appelle. In our last issue we stated that there appeared to be some uncertainty as to the future of the business at Qu'Appelle, and we are glad to find that confidence that such is the case. In letting the contract to some firm at Qu'Appelle there was a misunderstanding as to some kind of speculation. This was due to the fact that the commissioners were not notified to come in for contracts for freight about the 20th of February. They were informed by permanent officers. When they arrived here they only received instructions concerning what a great number came from long distances and had to retrace their steps. We are glad to hear that the confusion has been cleared up, and that the business has been brought on a proper footing. A few such precautions might have prevented this misunderstanding, which we hope will not recur again.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company is determined to give the Northwest a magnificent telegraph system. Mr. Charles R. Hooper, general manager of the Canadian Mutual Telegraph Company, who visited this district recently, Mr. Van Horne has been appointed Manager of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, with headquarters at Montreal, and will take charge on the first of next month. The company is preparing to push forward as rapidly as possible a number of important works from Montreal to Winnipeg, which when completed will be used extensively by the farmers for carrying the wheat along store lines, and also for railway use. This is the largest and consequently the best work any telegraph line in Canada, and there are but a few miles of a similar stripe across the Continent, and the general size of the wires, according to No. 6. For the purpose of comparison it may be stated that the wires now in use by Bell Telephone Company in Winnipeg are No. 14. It is expected that the company will begin to make an effort to build business from St. Boniface and other points on its line, and when completed a few weeks later it will have direct connection with Toronto and other leading cities in Ontario. If this is the spring will have a direct connection with New York and all the other important American cities.\n\n**FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1886.**\n\nThe contract to build the North-Western Central Railway from Edmonton to Battleford has been signed. Premier Norquay has returned from the east, and the Provincial government has signed a contract to build three hundred miles of the Hudson's Bay Railway from Nelson House to Nelson. This line will be completed in April.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company is determined to give the Northwest a magnificent telegraph system. Mr. Charles R.

It is said that the work will be completed within a few weeks.\n\nThe carnival at the Northern end brought out a number of prominent ladies. The ladies wore their finery, and a young lady broke her right ankle while skating on Sunday afternoon. She was promptly carried away, and will be able to walk about in a short time.\n\nA great number of people came out on Saturday afternoon, and the weather was very pleasant.\n\nThe City roller rink was opened on Saturday night, and the weather was very fine. The ice was smooth and hard.\n\n**FOR THE FRONT.**\n\nPROPOSED DEMONSTRATION IN THE BLACKFEET COUNTRY.\n\nProspects of a Fishing Camping Ground.\n\nIn the Blackfeet Country.\n\nIt is generally understood in military circles, that a fishing column will be sent among the Indians shortly. In fact, Major General Crook has been very active in this direction, and is said to be preparing for the advance. The plan proposes that the advance be made in small parties, and it is likely that they will be very successful, so long as the columns are only for the purpose of making a demonstration in the Blackfeet Country.\n\nThe proposed demonstration is not likely to be very successful, however, as the Indians are not likely to be disturbed by any such movement. They are well provided with food and ammunition, and are not likely to be disturbed by any such movement.
