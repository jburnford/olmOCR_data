Its confines include more than one-half of North America, reaching from the great lakes of the east and centre and the 49th parallel to the inhospitable shores of the trackless polar seas, whose long sought mysteries have yet to be revealed to man. In this vast domain\u2014an empire in itself\u2014are contained all the diversified elements which, upon development, are the factors of a progressive, prosperous and powerful nation, and although the strides in the march of progress, keeping pace with the advancement of nineteenth century civilization, have been marvelously rapid in this fair land, there are countless thousands of leagues of territory on which the foot of man has never trod, lying tenantless and silent, only awaiting the advent of the Anglo-Saxon race to be transformed into a prosperous and thriving country. The wealth of commerce, agriculture, mining, lumbering and fishing, latently exists in untold measure. The virgin soil, the primeval forest, and the teeming seas and lakes and rivers all possess undeveloped riches. Man alone is apparently the missing quantity, and his energy, industry and capital are the required elements in developing this young, but sturdy Dominion into the Greater Britain of the West\u2014the worthy scion of the grand old Motherland across the seas, whose pride is in the colonial gems which adorn the imperial diadem, of which Canada is one of the brightest and most valued jewels.\n\nTo give briefly and succinctly a sketch of this New Wonderland\u2014not aspiring to the pretensions of a history\u2014is the object of this work, presenting, beside an historical review, authentic statistics of its present condition, the remarkable advancement of the western portion, and pointing out its great advantages, its boundless resources, its wonderful development, and its manifest destiny in occupying, in the near future, a foremost place amongst the great nations of the world.\n## CONTENTS\n\n### PORT ARTHUR, ONT.\n\n| Name | Page |\n|------|------|\n| Algoma House, Merrill & Hodder, Props. | 26 |\n| Bishop & Co., Wm., Wholesale and Retail Groceries | 26 |\n| Clarke, W.

Extending 3,500 miles from east to west, 1,400 miles from north to south, within this area is a population approximating five millions, which by natural increase and immigration is rapidly augmenting; and this increase, as years roll past, will be even greater and in a more marked degree, with the extension of railway facilities and the clearing away of the prevailing misty misapprehensions respecting its unoccupied portions. Large tracts of this vast territory are cultivable, and those not cultivable, are rich in mineral wealth; but the arable land in Canada is as large, if not larger than that in the United States. Canada has, however, the largest extent of land yet open for free settlement adapted to the growth of cereals and other productions of the temperate zone of any country in the world. There are thousands of square miles of the finest forests in America, and large areas of the most fertile and productive prairie lands. There are fisheries of almost boundless extent, both on its Pacific and Atlantic Coasts, which are not surpassed or surpassable. There are coal fields on the Atlantic and on the Pacific, and large deposits beneath the surface of the prairie lands east of the Rocky Mountains. Canada has also iron, gold, silver, copper, lead, and other mines of great richness, including petroleum and salt; together with almost every description of stone and granite and other valuable building materials.\n\nIt enjoys great variety of climates, from the arctic to that of almost the most southern of the temperate zones. The climates of the settled portions of the Dominion, and of the lands open for settlement are healthy and invigorating and favorable to the highest development of human energy. The variations of the climate, too, are less than in many countries of lesser extent; but throughout, it is characterized by greater heat in summer and a lower temperature in winter than in corresponding European latitudes. Degrees of latitude, however, are only a partial guide to the actual nature of the climate of Canada, as compared with that of European countries, and any comparison of the mean temperature of them is subsequently misleading and deceptive. Even the severity of winter, as tested by the thermometer, leads to a very exaggerated impression of Canadian experiences. Owing to the dry, clear, bracing atmosphere which generally prevails, the sense of discomfort produced by the raw easterly winds and damp fogs of an English spring suggests an idea of cold such as is rarely thought of in a Canadian winter. There are, indeed, every winter, days of intense cold, as in the summer there are brief periods of equally intense heat, when the thermometer ascends, or descends, through a scale unknown in the more equable English climate. But throughout the greater\npart of the winter season in Canada, the sky is bright and clear and the weather thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the southern frontier of Manitoba and the North-West Territory, if extended across the Atlantic Ocean, would strike the continent of Europe a little below the latitude of Paris; while the southern point of the Province of Ontario is as far south as the latitude of Rome. Canada is therefore the physical equivalent on the continent of America of the great empires and kingdoms of Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, the British Islands, Russia in Europe and Sweden.\n\nOne of the remarkable physical features of Canada is its lakes and rivers. This long line of water system furnishes important facilities for communication; and the course of the St. Lawrence is in the line of the shortest sailing circle across the Atlantic. The same favorable condition prevails on the west coast, from the terminus of the Pacific Railway across the Pacific Ocean to the markets of China, Japan, and also to Australia. Coupled with these important commercial conditions, there is the fact that the Canadian Pacific Railway is the shortest of the many transcontinental routes, and crosses the Rockies on immensely more favorable conditions, both as respects grades and curves, than its rivals which reach the Pacific at San Francisco.\n\nFrom its earliest discovery, Canada has been esteemed for its valuable fur-bearing animals, and for over two centuries has been the trapping and hunting ground for the still-existing Hudson's Bay Co., and its rivals. Not only a vast tract of unoccupied territory in which for decades the hunter and the trapper will find his wealth-producing prey, still remains, but the regions around the Hudson's Bay, and stretching westward to Alaska and northward to the pole, must ever remain a shelter for fur-bearing animals and a resort of the hunter. All the furs collected for the great fur company are shipped to London; in part from their factories of York Fort and Moose River, on the Hudson's Bay, which are visited by a ship from England every year, and in part from Montreal, Victoria and Winnipeg.\n\nAs a country for the husbandman, however; Canada stands pre-eminent; but to the lumberman, the miner, the fisherman, the manufacturer, and the artizan, there are openings offering, which if taken, lead on to independence and wealth. Canada is a land for the capitalist seeking investment, and for the energetic poor man\u2014not the poverty-stricken loiterer\u2014seeking a home.\n\nIN THE EARLY DAYS.\n\nThere is, amongst the many interesting legends of the ancient Norsemen, one of the discovery by some of their intrepid voyagers, of a nameless land in the, to them, western ocean. Nearly one thousand years have elapsed since the first European, Lief, son of the powerful Eric, the Red, first coasted along the rocky shores of Labrador in his staunch Norse Galley, and the intervening years, witnessing the rise and fall of potentates and empires the world over, have brought but little change to the bleak dreary coast of this North Land, against whose rocks the restless waters of the Atlantic fret and fume, or to the dense trackless forests of fir, stretching for leagues inland, which are still the abiding-place of the unhunted wild animal. Still\nbetter defined, the Icelanders have handed down from generation to generation well authenticated tales of the landing, on what is now America, of their daring seafaring forefathers, and in the little sea-girt isle \u2014 now being so rapidly depopulated \u2014 the legend is accepted as authentic history to this day. Another theory is, that hordes from Asia poured over the intervening narrow straits of Behring in the early days of Mother Earth, and were the first occupants of the new world in the dim and misty past. Then there were the Mound-builders of pre-historic times, traces of whose existence are still to be found from the Gulf of Mexico to the shores of Lake Winnipeg, but whose history is largely based on mere conjecture. The race has vanished, leaving relics of its existence puzzling to the mind of those versed in archeological lore. The earth works they left are overgrown with large trees, the hieroglyphics obliterated by age, the places of defence or abode have crumbled away, and only the outline of their original shape is traceable amidst the ruins of this curious and mysterious something of ancient origin, which no living being can now unravel or explain. The Indians have no traditions at all regarding this extinct and almost forgotten race. The earliest visitors to the continent give no account of them. But their sepulchral mounds, their skeletons, their pottery and their shells tell the tale of their existence\u2014and nothing more. Whence came these quiet sleepers, who, with fleshless palms, crossed as in mute expectancy, might have slumbered on till the morn of resurrection, but for the love of adventure of our ancestors, whose descendants have rudely disturbed their rest? What the fate of this great mound-building race which from the shadow of the Andes to the far north have traversed the continent? Wrapped in a veil of mystery which may never be uplifted until that supreme hour when all things shall be revealed.\n\nBut whatever element of truth there may be in these traditions and theories and speculations, the honor of discovering America is, amongst the masses, now commonly accorded to Christopher Columbus, who started out on his voyage of discovery nearly four centuries ago. A few years later, in 1497\u2014two years after the discoveries of Columbus became known in England\u2014two Italian navigators, John and Sebastian Cabot, father and son, set sail for the little known-west with a royal commission to discover a north-west passage to China or the Indies of the East. Reaching the coast of Labrador, which they erroneously believe to be that of the Indian continent, they took possession, in the name of King Henry VII, and returned home. From their excusable error, the name \"Indian\" was bestowed upon the red race that inhabited the country, which appellation adheres to them to the present time. Although the Cabots first reached Canada, it was Jacques Cartier, the descendants of whom afterwards became amongst the most illustrious of Canadian statesmen, who first penetrated the interior of this country. Having sailed from sunny France in 1534, he entered the Gulf of St. Lawrence and landed at Gasp\u00e9 Bay where the fleur-de-lis was floated to the breeze, and a huge cross, with a shield bearing the arms of France, erected. After eight years spent in exploring, Cartier returned home, where he shortly afterwards died, and over half a century elapsed before any further attention was paid to the vast terra incognita over which his sovereign held undisputed sway. In 1603, Champlain, a noted discoverer, a knightly soldier who fought under the white plumes of Navarre, set out on a fruitless expedition, returning the same year. In the following year, he accompanied a second expedition, under the command of Sieur de Monts, which reached the Bay of Fundy.\nMisfortune beset the daring explorers, and the hardship of an eastern winter were followed by dire disease, which led to an abandonment of the attempt to settle Acadia, and proceeding up the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the decimated little band, twenty-eight all told, landed at the rock which guards the portals to the western waters\u2014Quebec. This was on the 3rd July, 1608, from which date commences the foundation of the city of Quebec, and the actual establishment of French rule in Canada. The infant settlement progressed slowly, notwithstanding Champlain\u2019s wise administration, until 1635, when death struck it a heavy blow in claiming the father of the colony. During the four years following, the Jesuits and Ursuline Nuns, important factors in the religion and education of the country, arrived and founded their institutions; but it was not until 1665, that a Royal Government was established under Louis XIV. Then commenced an area of marked progress. But that progress was attended and hindered by the horrors of war. The French found bitter foes in the New Englanders, but they had faithful and powerful allies in the Indians. The Treaty of Utrecht, which ceded the Hudson\u2019s Bay Territories, New Foundland and Acadia to Great Britain and retained Canada and Cape Breton for France, was signed in 1713. A gradual progress in commerce, arts, agriculture and manufactures marked the ensuing years, although the settlements were more of a military than a colonizing characteristic. Under French domination, in brief, the settlements were merely links in one long chain of barracks. The British, then the occupants of the United States, were more progressive\u2014the plough, the hoe and the axe, instead of the sword and the bayonet, being the weapons utilized there in the battle of life. Casting envious eyes on this fair northern land, English statesmen determined to obtain it in the way possessions were obtained in these days\u2014by conquest. Quebec was attacked, and impregnable as its battlements apparently were, the gallant Wolfe, whose life blood abed warm in the hour of triumph, added another to the long list of glorious victories, of which, Englishmen the world over can pardonably boast. The white emblem of la belle France, which for a century and a half had floated over the Gibraltar of the western seas, was replaced by the blood-red cross of St. George. Then commenced English rule in Canada.\n\nIt is not within the province of this unpretentious book to detail the many stirring incidents of ensuing years. As time rolled on, settlement, in obedience to the irresistible law of nature, advanced westwardly. Montreal\u2014the Hochelaga of the red man\u2014instead of being an outpost environed by hostile Indians, became, gradually, but surely, the centre of a group of provinces, which twenty-one years ago, were formed into one Confederation. A memorable day\u2014July 1st, 1867\u2014gave birth to the Dominion of Canada\u2014a Sisterhood of Provinces bound together by the ties of blood, of common ancestry, of united interests, and mutual hopes and aspirations. Year by year, provinces were added to the Dominion, until now in 1888, the disunited struggling communities of two decades ago are gathered into one undivided and indivisible Federation, stretching from ocean to ocean, all bearing their share in the great work of building up a nation, and all happy and contented and prosperous under the protecting \u00e6gis of the mother-country.\n\nCanadian statesmen, in preparing the scheme of confederation, had a warning before them in the civil war, which, from 1861 to 1865 fiercely raged between the Northern and Southern States of the American Union, and they eliminated, as far as possible, all danger which might arise from weakness of the federal authority. They\nprovided for a National government which would protect the rights of the weaker provinces; but Home Rule was given the different provincial governments in a broad sense. Each province had full power to make laws for the education of the rising generations, for the ownership of property, for the development of resources and for the raising of revenue for local purposes. But no individual province was permitted, without federal authority, to own or maintain troops, control navigation, build railways beyond its own boundaries, or levy export or import duties. Representation in the Senate and House of Commons was given each province on the basis of population, Quebec being the pivotal province. To that province is allotted sixty-five members in the popular branch of parliament, and the others are given representation in the proportion their population bears to it. There is constitutional government in its widest and fullest meaning\u2014government of the people, for the people, by the people. The Governor-General, usually of the brightest of British noblemen, is a constitutional ruler, giving a loyal support to the Ministry representing the majority in the House of Commons. And these rulers, appointed by the imperial government, are selected not merely to reward them for services to the state, but as an honor conferred upon those pre-eminently fitted for the high position, and who can faithfully and loyally and wisely represent Her Majesty in her western dependency. The names of Dufferin, Lorne and Lansdowne, especially, will be handed down to future generations as able statesmen who ruled wisely and well, while the present Governor-General, Lord Stanley of Preston, the descendant of one of the most illustrious of England's oldest nobility, has entered upon a career which, it is safe to assume, will place him on a plane with his honored and revered predecessors.\n\nAlthough nearly three centuries have elapsed since the chivalrous Champlain sailed up the broad waters of the St. Lawrence, the actual development of the western portion of the country east of Lake Huron did not commence until a comparatively recent period, while that westerly of Superior's pellucid waters lay dormant and still until the troublous times of 1869-70\u2014of which the executed chieftain, Louis Riel, was the central figure\u2014brought it prominently to the notice of the outer world, and revealed in all their richness and fertility the countless acres of virgin prairie soil which reaches from the valley of the Red River of the North to the base of the far-off Rocky Mountains. Beyond this, an old colony of Britain had already sprung up on the golden shores of the Pacific\u2014and all this great domain to-day is happy and prospering under the meteoric flag which for a thousand years has proclaimed British supremacy.\n\nTo the transcontinental traveller, passing through the thickly settled provinces of the east, the dense pine wilderness and broad plains of the centre, and the snow-crested mountains of the further west, the thought must naturally occur, as he gazes on the varied elements of wealth, that the 'old Spaniards, to whom are attributed the commonly-accepted origin of the name of Canada\u2014\"A Canada,\" signifying \"Here is nothing\"\u2014must have been sadly mistaken, and leads one to believe that Charlevoix's derivation of the name\u2014from the Indian word \"Kannata\": a collection of huts\u2014is perhaps after all the more probable one. Even if the former is the correct genesis of the country's name, how wonder-stricken would be those adventurous sons of Spain were they to return from the unknown world and visit the \"A Canada\" of which the Maritime provinces, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Keewatin, the Northwest Territories and British Columbia are now component parts\nInstead of \"A Canada,\" it may easily be conjectured, the departed Spaniards would stare in amazed astonishment, as they beheld the wealth and prosperity of the land, ejaculate \"El Dorado,\" and seek to substitute that euphonious title for the one they, according to Castilian tradition, unwittingly and erroneously bestowed upon it.\n\nCANADIAN PROGRESS.\n\nThe development of Canada during the past twenty years has been remarkable. The country's progress is clearly and intelligibly illustrated in \"Graphic Statistics,\" and presented in such a comprehensive and comprehensible manner, that no apology is needed for quoting from the excellent compilation. The author, Mr. George Johnson, Dominion statistician, has collected a fund of information in diagrammatic form to illustrate the changes and the developments which Canada has experienced since the various Provinces joined hands, and it is not without reason that Mr. Johnson, in presenting this first instalment, hopes \"that, encouraged by the substantial progress which marks the years of the childhood of the Dominion, the Canadian people will be strengthened in their determination to make the manhood of their country even better in fulfilment of its destiny than the early period has been bountiful in promise.\"\n\nThe diagrams, eighty in number, deal with almost every imaginable phase of the commercial life of Canada. First come the statistics relating to the federal debt, and the exports and imports, taking the country as a whole, then taking the Provinces separately, and then considering each principal commodity, the whole occupying twenty-five diagrams. Perhaps the most instructive of these twenty-five diagrams are those which compare Canada's trade with Great Britain on the one hand, and with the United States on the other. Great Britain's cattle purchases from Canada, for instance, have continued, with the single exception of the years 1885-86, to mount up from the paltry value of some $400,000, in 1887, to the present value, $5,400,000; while United States purchases have taken the most erratic of courses, starting from $250,000 in 1887, reaching $2,000,000 in 1881, then falling to $500,000 in 1882, up again to $1,750,000 in 1885, and now down to $1,000,000. Or take the wheat and flour trade. With the single exception again of 1886, Canada's exports to Great Britain have mounted from 1,500,000 bushels in 1868 to 6,800,000 in 1887; while the exports to the United States were 1,700,000 bushels in 1868, rose to 2,100,000 in 1872, and have since steadily declined, until they now stand at the paltry total of 364,983 bushels. The cheese trade is no less remarkable. The exports to Great Britain show a continued and unvarying increase year by year, from $600,000 in 1868 to $7,000,000 in 1887; whereas the exports to the United States were $159,000 in 1868, and have ranged between $300,000 and $12,000 ever since. The trade in green fruit, in peas, butter, and other natural products, tells the same tale; and, bearing in mind that no preference is shown British over United States purchasers, it may be deduced from these records that the United Kingdom is a far better market for Canada's natural products than the United States is, or has ever been.\n\nThe next series of diagrams deals with Canada's banking record. The proportion of overdue notes and debts to the total amount borrowed from the chartered\nbanks is now at its lowest point since Confederation, namely, 1\u00b761 per cent. The highest percentage in the last decade was 4\u00b790 in 1879; and in this decade 4\u00b724 in 1880. The bank notes in circulation show a steady growth during the last four years, though the record for 1887 is still somewhat behind that of the highest year, 1883. The bank deposit diagrams are most gratifying. In each case the record for 1887 far surpasses that of any previous year. The growth, indeed, in every instance is remarkably steady and substantial. The same may be said of the record of the operations of the money order system, of the use of letters and postcards, and of the general postal system. In this group is also classed the record of business failures since 1874. In 1887, Canada unhappily made a considerable advance upon 1886 and 1885 in this respect, but still the figures $16,300,000 are below those for 1884 ($19,000,000), while it is noteworthy that in no year, under the present protective tariff, has the total amount of failures reached that of any one of the revenue tariff years, when from $24,000,000 to $29,000,000, was the range of the failure records.\n\nThe next series of diagrams is exceedingly curious. One act indicates the liquor consumption of the Dominion, with the aid of a variety of gaudily-colored tankards and glasses. It appears from this that Ontario drinks three times more beer than spirits; Quebec nearly as much spirits as beer; and New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island more spirits than beer. In 1874, the people of Canada drank two gallons of spirits per head, but in 1887 they drank less than one gallon per head. On the other hand, the consumption of beer has gone up from two to three gallons per head since 1878. The next diagram relates to tobacco, and the smoking propensities of the people of each Province are shown by clouds of smoke rising from well-filled pipes and cigars. British Columbians, it appears, are the most persistent smokers, though the people of Manitoba and the North-West, and of Quebec, follow them hard in the race. New Brunswickers come next, and Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island follow in order. As a whole, Canadians use on an average three lbs. of tobacco per annum; whether that is a good or a bad record depends upon the point of view from which one regards the use of the fragrant weed.\n\nThere is next shown by a series of diagrams, the advances which railways have made in Canada during the past ten years. The number of miles has exactly doubled. The number of passenger carried per inhabitants has increased 40 per cent.; total number carried, nearly 60 per cent.; tons of freights carried per inhabitants, 97 per cent.; total number carried, 107 per cent.; receipts from passengers, 86 per cent.; and from freights, over 87 per cent.; while the total receipts from all sources have increased nearly 90 per cent., and the expenses nearly 72 per cent. The comparisons made in this series of statistics are most instructive. The cost per mile of railways in Canada is $61,000, and the population per mile is 491 persons. In the United States the cost has been the same as in Canada, but the population per mile is 417. In Great Britain the cost per mile is $206,500 (more than treble that of Canada), and the population per mile 1,930. The number of train miles run by each locomotive in Canada is 20,094, against 22,583 in the United States and 18,395 in Great Britain. The average charge per ton mile is stated to be considerably less in Canada than in any other country; while the percentage of gross receipts expended in working the railways is less in Canada than in France, but higher than in most other countries\u2014a state of things\u2014which is explained by the fact that the Intercolonial, being a Government work, is run, not for profit, but to develop the country.\nThe extent of the shipping employed in the Canadian sea and lake trades is next illustrated, and a sound progressive record is shown. It is a noteworthy feature of this session that the trade in British bottoms has maintained its preponderance in each year during the last decade. In 1883, 1884, 1885, and 1886 the trade in United States bottoms came second, but last year, the Canadian record forced its way ahead to the position it held prior to 1883, next to the British record. The coasting trade of Canada shows a healthy growth, especially that of Nova Scotia. Following these shipping returns comes a series illustrative of Canada's export to the United States of wheat, oats, barley, potatoes, provisions, fish, coal, furs, &c. Looked at as a whole, they cannot be said to denote the same development as those relating to Canadian trade with Britain. In most cases the present volume of trade is little more than that of twenty years ago\u2014in flour, rye, wheat, and provisions it is even less\u2014though in the treaty years, 1855-1867, there was, of course, a fillip in nearly all cases. The wood, fur, and hide records are, however, an exception to the general rule; the volume of trade in each of these articles has, on the whole, shown a decided tendency to increase since 1884, the date at which the whole of this series of statistics commences. Of the remaining diagrams, one of the most striking is perhaps that illustrating the course of the Nova Scotia coal trade. The total sales have gradually risen since 1868 from 450,000 to 1,550,000 tons. This remarkable increase has been made up principally of sales to other Provinces, though the sales in Nova Scotia itself have also shown a gradual growth. The exports to foreign countries are as low now as ever they were\u2014a fact not to be wondered at or deplored, in view of development in other directions.\n\nThe last diagram in the remaining series deals with the prices of Canadian securities in London. The record is most gratifying. Canada started in 1867 with a credit in this market indicated by the fact that her 5 per cents. were at 86\u00bd. From 1867 to 1873 the rise was steady and sure, until the stock touched 108. Then for a few years it remained practically at a standstill, until 1878 and 1879, when the upward movement was resumed, and with minor depressions in the period between 1883 and 1887 these 5 per cents. have continued to increase in value, until in March, 1888\u2014the date of the compilation\u2014they stood at the unprecedented figure of 118. The rise has been equally marked in the 4 per cents., which started at 92 in 1875, and were placed in March at 116. The only depression in the 4 per cents. occurred in the years 1882-83. With the 3\u00bd per cents. the record of growth from 92 in 1885 to 110 is unbroken.\n\nTHE OLDER PROVINCES.\n\nWhile this volume is more particularly intended to be devoted to the western half of Canada, it would not be complete without paying notice of the eastern provinces, but no pretensions are made to more than brief descriptions.\n\nTHE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO.\n\nThis province, formerly known as Upper Canada or Canada West, consists of that region lying north of the great chain of lakes\u2014the largest bodies of fresh water\nknown\u2014and extending to James' Bay, the southern extremity of the great Hudson's Bay. It is divided from Quebec by the Ottawa River and a line running due north from Lake Temiscaming, and extends westward to the Manitoba line near the Lake of the Woods. Within these limits are an area of 197,000 square miles and a population of over 2,000,000, about one-third being urban and two-thirds rural. There are 20,000,000 acres occupied, three-fifths of which are cultivated for grain, hay or root crops, and another fifth is in gardens and orchards. Wheat, barley, oats, peas, corn, flax, tobacco, sugar and root crops are the principal agricultural products. Dairy farming is extensively carried on and large quantities of cheese are made. Beef cattle are reared and exported to England in great numbers, although there are no large grazing areas, root crops being largely depended upon.\n\nThe educational system of Ontario is an excellent one and is the model upon which those of other provinces are based. Its higher institutions are Upper Canada College, University of Toronto, University College and Trinity College, at Toronto; Victoria College, Cobourg; Queen's College, Kingston, Western University, London. There are also many private and denominational schools besides the public schools, and normal schools for the instruction of teachers exist at Toronto and Ottawa. There are over 100 institutes and high schools, over 5000 public schools and about 200 separate Roman Catholic schools drawing revenue from the educational fund.\n\nThe capital of the province is Toronto, on Lake Ontario, a city of about 120,000 people, and a very important interior seaport and railroad centre. The city is finely laid out, the streets crossing each other at right angles, and contains several fine parks and many handsome buildings. Toronto is the literary centre of the Dominion. The city's commerce is considerable, reaching $25,000,000 annually in exports and imports, and the annual value of manufactures is nearly as great. The second city in size and importance is Hamilton, situated on Burlington Bay, at the head of Lake Ontario. It contains a population of 40,000, has a considerable commerce and does much manufacturing, especially in iron work. The streets are well laid out, lined with shade trees, and are adorned with many handsome edifices. Ottawa, the seat of government of the Dominion of Canada, is the third city in size in the Province of Ontario, and has a population of 35,000. It is situated on the south bank of Ottawa River, which forms the boundary between Ontario and Quebec, ninety miles above its junction with the St. Lawrence, and 120 miles from Montreal. Besides being the centre of the lumber trade, with saw mills and match factories, it manufactures flour, ironware, etc. Boats ply down the river to Montreal and up the stream 200 miles, also through the Rideau Canal to Kingston. This canal was constructed in 1827, at a cost of $2,500,000, to afford a water-way for gunboats and shipping between the lower river and the lakes without passing up the St. Lawrence above Montreal. The site of Ottawa is picturesque, extending for two miles along the river from the beautiful Chaudi\u00e8re Falls to the Falls of the Rideau River. About midway, Parliament Hill and Major's Hill rise to a height of 160 feet and front the river in bold bluffs, the canal passing between them. Beyond Rideau River is the village of New Edinburgh, in which is Rideau, the official residence of the Governor General, and across the Ottawa is the lumbering city of Hull, connected with the capital by a suspension bridge. The national buildings, which rank amongst the finest specimens of architecture on the continent, stand on Parliament Hill, on the banks of the Ottawa. They are of the Italian-Gothic style of the thirteenth century, the material\nbeing cream-colored Potsdam stone. Their cost was $4,000,000. The corner-stone was laid by the Prince of Wales, heir apparent to the British throne, in 1860, and five years afterwards, the first session of Parliament was held in them. They consist of a main building 473 feet long, with a tower 184 feet in height, and a nearly circular library building in rear, 90 feet in diameter, the depth from the front to the rear of the library being 370 feet. The library building alone cost $350,000, and contains over 120,000 volumes. There are also two departmental buildings, known as the Macdonald and Mackenzie blocks\u2014after the leaders of the two great political parties of the day\u2014and sometimes styled the Western and Eastern blocks. Ottawa is a city of modern growth, being of little importance when chosen by Her Majesty\u2014to whom the selection was referred\u2014as the seat of Government, exactly thirty years ago. There are several other large centres of population in this Province.\n\nLondon, like the other and greater London, lies on the Thames, midway between Lakes Erie and Huron, and its local nomenclature is freely copied from the city of which it aims to be the prototype. Oil refining, wood and iron working, and other manufacturing are carried on very extensively. It has a population of about 30,000. Kingston, with a population of 15,000, is situated at the north-easterly extremity of Lake Ontario, and is the termination of the Rideau canal. It is an important naval station, and is engaged largely in shipbuilding and manufacturing. From 1841 to 1844, it was the capital of Canada. Guelph, a railroad centre in Wellington County; St. Catharines, on the Welland Canal; Brantford, Belleville, St. Thomas, Stratford, Chatham, Brockville, Peterborough, Port Hope, Woodstock, Galt, Lindsay, Whitby, Napanee, Oshawa, Cornwall, and Cobourg, are all important, commercial and manufacturing cities, with populations relatively from 5,000 to 20,000. On the river, dividing Ontario from the State of New-York are the celebrated Falls of Niagara, one of the natural wonders of the world.\n\nTHE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\n\nThe Province of Quebec\u2014before Confederation known as Canada East or Lower Canada\u2014is the second in population of the provinces of the Dominion. It has an area of about 210,000 square miles, and extends from Ontario on the east to Labrador on the west, and lies on both sides of the St. Lawrence river, bordering on the States of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, and the Province of New Brunswick. Three-fourths of this area consist of Crown lands, which are sold to settlers on easy terms, or the timber on which can be purchased by lumbermen. The province is divided into sixty-four counties, and contains the two large cities of Montreal and Quebec. The climate is severe in the long winter and warm in summer, except on the Lower St. Lawrence, where the summers are cool. In a number of localities, the climate is much more moderate, especially in the Saguenay Valley and in south-eastern counties. Wheat, oats, barley, potatoes, buckwheat, fruit, wool and dairy products are extensively raised, and great numbers of horses and cattle are exported. In some sections, Indian corn does well. The exports are very great, consisting of manufactured forest products, fish, oil, stock, wool, furs, grain, flour and metals. Shipbuilding is an important industry.\n\nThe population is about 1,500,000, the great majority being of French descent.\nand of the Roman Catholic religion. It was this fact which led to the original decision of Canada into two provinces, since Ontario is chiefly settled by people of British origin. Public schools are maintained by tax, and small municipalities receive Government aid. Separate schools are maintained for Protestant children whenever desired by parents. Besides three normal schools supported by the Government, there are a score of universities and colleges, some of them denominational, and chiefly Roman Catholic.\n\nThe capital of the province, Quebec, lies on the north bank of the St. Lawrence, at its confluence with the St. Charles, 250 miles from the Gulf. It is the oldest city in Canada, claiming an age of 280 years. The population is 65,000, of which four-fifths are French-Canadians. Quebec is one of the very few walled cities of America, and is perhaps the strongest fortress on the continent. The leading industry is shipbuilding, and it is an important seaport, the annual arrival of sea-going vessels averaging over 1,500. Montreal is not only the largest city in the province, but the metropolis of the Dominion\u2014the principal port of entry and the chief centre of commerce. Located upon an island formed by the St. Lawrence and Ottawa, 160 miles above Quebec and almost a thousand from the Atlantic, it is the point where ocean navigation connects with the carrying trade of the great inland water system. The city covers an area of eight square miles and is most substantially built of stone, brick and wood. In rear rises up majestically Mount Royal, from which the city takes its name. The St. Lawrence at this point is nearly two miles wide, and solidly-built wharves, basins, and locks extend for nearly the same distance along the city front. Near the upper end, the stream narrows to about half-a-mile, and the waters of Lake Ontario rushing through with fierce impetuosity form the celebrated Lachine Rapids, which can be descended but not ascended by steamers. To overcome this obstacle, a canal nine miles long was built around them. Just below the rapids is the famous Victoria Bridge, at its construction supposed to be the climax of engineering skill. It is an iron structure of twenty-four spans, resting on abutments of stone masonry, is 9,184 feet in length, and cost $6,500,000. Montreal is the chief seat of learning, as well as of commerce, in the Dominion, and possesses a large number of denominational and secular educational institutions. Amongst the many handsome edifices, is St. Peter's Cathedral, an exact reproduction on one-fourth scale, of the great Cathedral in the Eternal city. The population is about 200,000. There are other thriving places\u2014Sherbrooke, Three Rivers, Hull, etc.\n\nTHE PROVINCE OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\n\nNew Brunswick, with an area of 27,177 square miles, lies south of the province of Quebec and east of the State of Maine. On the east, it borders the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and on the south is separated from Nova Scotia by the Bay of Fundy. The country is undulating and hilly, the higher elevations being in the north, where the hills are covered with thick forests. The soil is fertile on both sides of the St. John River, and many lovely valleys, dotted with cornfields, are found in the eastern part. The St. John is the main waterway; it rises in Maine and flows south-easterly across the province to the Bay of Fundy, into which it empties. It is an important highway for the lumber traffic and is navigable for about 150 miles. The Resti-\ngouche, on the north, the St. Croix and the Petitcodiac are also navigable streams. The coast line, which abounds in magnificent bays and harbors, is bold, rocky and picturesque. The winters are severe, and there are heavy snowfalls in the north, but in the southern portion the winters are milder. The climate is healthy and epidemics rarely appear. Considerable portions of the country are admirably adapted for agriculture, the soil being fertile and vegetation rapid. Enormous quantities of hay are grown on the extensive lowlands, and the other products are wheat, oats, rye, barley, buckwheat, flax, hemp, potatoes, etc. Fruits and berries of the harder varieties are largely produced and very profitably exported. Agriculture is not prospected to the extent it could or should be; there being but 900,000 acres under crop and 400,000 in pasture. Cattle, sheep, wool, dairy-products and honey are important items of commerce. The greatest resources are the wealth of fine timber and the food fishes with which the adjacent waters teem. Lumbering and fishing are the leading occupations of the people, and products of these industries form the greater portion of the $20,000,000 of annual manufactures. Shipbuilding has always been an important industry.\n\nThe chief commercial city is St. John, situated on the river of the same name, where it flows into the Bay of Fundy. It has one of the finest harbors on the Atlantic Coast, is engaged largely in fishing, shipbuilding and manufacturing of ironware, paper, cotton goods, rope, hats, furniture, etc. Connected with St. John by street cars is Providence, formerly considered a suburb, but now an incorporated city of 20,000 people. Many steam saw mills are located there. Fredericton, the capital, is located on St. John River, at the head of navigation for large steamers. It has a population of 7,000. The other cities of importance are Moncton, Shediac, Dorchester, Chatham, Sackville, Bathurst and Richibucto, with populations ranging from 4,500 to 7,000.\n\nTHE PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA.\n\nThe Acadia of the early French settlers\u2014the land of the Blue Noses of the present day\u2014is the peninsula lying south of the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of St. Lawrence, and between them, separated from New Brunswick by the Bay Verte Canal, forms, with the adjacent large island of Cape Breton, the Province of Nova Scotia. It has an extreme length of 350 miles and breadth of 120 miles, the total area being 20,907 square miles. Its long sea coast is indented with a multitude of bays and inlets, and there are numerous large and secure harbors. The highest elevation is 1,100 feet, the general surface being undulating. There are extensive tracts of arable land lying on either side of the ridge of highlands running across the peninsula from east to west. Further to the southwest lies the Valley of the Annapolis, the garden of the province. The climate is somewhat similar to that of New Brunswick, though about 15 deg. milder in winter.\n\nIt is an agricultural country, the arable lands being extensive and rich. Wheat, oats, rye, buck-wheat, barley, corn, potatoes, vegetables and fruits grow in abundance. Grapes and peaches thrive in some localities. Live stock and dairy products are a large element of wealth. The forests are extensive, and lumbering is an important industry. Nova Scotia ranks second only to Newfoundland in the extent and value of its fishing enterprises. About 20,000 men are employed in the fisheries, and the\nexports of the industry amount to $5,000,000 annually. Other industries are sugar refineries, cotton mills, woollen mills, carpet factories, tanneries, paper mills, and factories for the production of paper, machinery, nails, shoes, flour, woodenware, etc. The province has a population of 450,000 and contains upwards of 600 miles of railways. Commerce is also aided by two canals and numerous short rivers, navigable for a number of miles by coasting vessels.\n\nThe capital, as well as the principal seaport and chief commercial city, is Halifax, which lies on Halifax harbor, on the southern coast of the peninsula, and is one of the important seaports of the Atlantic Coast of America. It has a population of 40,000, and is the seat of an extensive fishing industry. It carries on a large commerce with Great Britain and her colonies and the United States. It is the winter port for the Dominion, since the Gulf of St. Lawrence is closed with ice at that season, and is connected with the interior by the Intercolonial Railway. Manufacturing is carried on quite extensively, and it is also a British military post. The other chief towns of the province are Windsor, Pictou, Yarmouth, Liverpool, Lunenburg, Sydney, North Sydney, New Glasgow and Annapolis.\n\nTHE PROVINCE OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND:\n\nThe Island Province of Prince Edward is the smallest one in the union, it having only a total area of 2,133 square miles and a population of about 125,000. It lies in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and immediately north of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, from which it is separated by Northumberland Strait. The climate is much milder than that of the adjacent provinces, being neither so cold in winter nor warm in summer. Vegetation develops rapidly, and agriculture is extensively prosecuted. The cereals, vegetables and hardier fruits and berries produce prolifically. Beef cattle, mutton, wool, honey, dairy products and maple sugar are among the chief productions: The once extensive forests have become thinned by the lumbermen and forest fires, although lumbering still remains an important industry. Shipbuilding is carried on, though not with the activity of former years. Manufactured products include woollen goods, tools, saddlery goods, lumber and building material, starch, leather and many others, chiefly for domestic use. The fisheries are exceedingly valuable. Trade is facilitated by good roads and two hundred miles of railway, traversing the island from end to end and branching off to every town of importance.\n\nThe capital and chief commercial city is Charlottetown, which has a population of 12,000, and is settled on the north bank of Hillsborough River, at its junction with River. The river is navigable by large vessels, and the city possesses a good harbor. Grain, potatoes, fish and pork are exported. Considerable manufacturing and shipbuilding are carried on. Summerside, Georgetown, Princeton, Rustico, Tignish, Alberton, Souris, Mount Stewart, Kensington, Montague, Breadalbane and Crepaud are also prosperous places.\n\nWith this brief outline of the Canada of the East, the reader is asked to accompany the writer on the western trail which leads\n\n\"To the doorways of the West-wind,\n\"To the portals of the sunset.\"\nNORTH-WESTERN ONTARIO.\n\nFollowing the course of the hardy voyageurs of a century ago, on the great waterways; one passes through the tortuous channels of the north shore of Lake Huron, and entering the river and smaller lake of George, finds himself at Sault Ste. Marie, where the Dominion and the Republic are only separated by the beautiful rapids, whose white-capped waters do not rush so fiercely and impetuously as those of the Lachine or the far-away grand rapids of the Saskatchewan. They are an easy \"shoot\" for the Indian's birch-bark\u2014and murmur like the lullaby of a child rather than with the roar and tumult of a mad torrent. The rapids are crossed\u2014the two great nations are joined, as at Niagara\u2014by a handsome cantilever bridge, over which the Canadian Pacific Railway carries long wheat-laden trains from the Northwestern States to the seaboard, successfully competing with rival American roads. Above are aptly-named Superior's broad waters, stretching 400 miles westerly. Sailing over this great inland sea towards the setting sun which leaves on the glistening waters a golden trail as if leading to the place of the gods, the traveller is entranced with the pleasures of the voyage; and the enchantment gives way to awe when Thunder Cape, standing out boldly at the rocky entrance to the same named bay, safely guarded by islands, is reached. On Thunder Cape lies the huge Sleeping Giant, who for ages has been gazed upon with wonder-stricken eyes by the untutored red man, and around whom the romance of tradition still lingers. Cycles ago the old giant, becoming drowsy with the nectar which gods imbibe, fell prone and helpless in a drunken stupor, and to this day he remains, silent and undisturbed, a warning to the wine-drinker. Nestling at the foot of the bay, on natural terraces sloping down to the waters' edge, lies Port Arthur, which has been named the half-way house between the old and the new Canada. The bay itself is a magnificent sheet of water, thirty miles in length and sixteen wide, and it is claimed for it that it resembles the famed Bay of Naples. The entrance to this natural harbor, as stated, is guarded by Thunder Cape and Pie Island, so called from its similarity in shape to an enormous pork pie, six miles distant, midway between which, two leagues from the mainland, lie the group of Welcome Islands\u2014so named from the welcome sight they were to the dusky pioneers who were the freighters of Hudson's Bay furs in the early days. This entrance is, in the poetic language of the Highland Laddie when Governor-General, \"the silver gateway to a northern inland San Francisco.\" The bay itself is usually calm and placid, with no squally tendencies, and forms one of the finest and safest harbors imaginable. Near at hand on the mainland, is Mount McKay, which rises to a height of nine hundred and fifty feet above the level of the Kaministiquia River, which winds its way to the lake along its base. Its almost perpendicular sides can be scaled with comparative ease in one or two places. Isle Royale, at one time a part of the British American provinces, latterly ceded to the United States, and now included in the State of Michigan, lies across the mouth of Thunder Bay in a north-easterly and south-westerly direction, thirty-five miles distant from Port Arthur. It is about forty miles in extreme length, with an average breadth of eight miles. It is noted for its scenery, its many islands and beautiful harbors, its splendid trout streams, its ancient miners' diggings and its abandoned modern mines. The extinct race\u2014perchance the mound-builders\u2014have left here quaint and curious and interesting specimens of the tools and implements\nthey used in forgotten ages. Here also are found\u2014the only place in the world\u2014small beautiful green stones called chlorastrolytes. The island is uninhabited, save temporarily, by American fishermen, and, being out of the regular course of travel, is not generally visited, as it would otherwise be. Forty miles from Port Arthur, on the Pigeon river, which forms the dividing line between Canada and the United States, are Pigeon Falls, which tumble over a ledge of rock ninety feet high, into a stone basin below. Ten miles further along the coast is located the Grand Portage, over which in the fur-trading days the supplies of the traders were taken to the interior ports, and it is the only place in the United States where British goods can be taken through without bonding or customs regulations, the river and the portage being common to the people of both countries. Fifteen miles from Port Arthur, up the tortuous Kaministiquia, are the Kakabeka Falls, one hundred and thirty feet high and two hundred feet wide\u2014one of the most magnificent pieces of natural scenery the eye of poet or painter ever dwelt upon. The Kaministiquia River empties into Thunder Bay three miles from Port Arthur. Its rich sounding Indian-name, interpreted, signifies the River of Many Mouths, as there is a delta formed at its mouth which divides its dark, quiet waters into two streams. The river is navigable for nine miles\u2014the latter five for light draught steamers only\u2014to Point de Meuron, which still retains the name of the German soldier whose career was so intimately identified with the Northwest. On the verdure-clad banks of this noble river are Fort William, Neebing\u2014of political fame\u2014and the curious old Jesuit Mission. The village of Fort William, now a hustling, thriving place, was originally the principal post of the Hudson's Bay Company on Lake Superior, and, although the post has been abandoned and deserted for some years, the quaint old houses remain a landmark tinged with the romance of primitive greatness, of old-time gatherings, of days of royal feastings, of profitable ventures from which the west contributed to the coffers of the east, and of cruel strife and bloodshed. The bustling days of primitive commerce have passed away, and another era of commercial greatness has set in. The great \"Company,\" whose operations extended over the continent from ocean to ocean, and from the Missouri to the ramparts on the Arctic seas, has been succeeded by an equally gigantic, but not so exclusive, corporation\u2014the Canadian Pacific Railway, the shrill whistles of whose fast-speeding locomotives rudely disturb the solitude of the forests and rocks, as, years ago, did the blood-curdling war cry of the red man and the merry French song of the passing voyageur. Fort William is now a \"smart\" town with a rapidly increasing population. Here are located the mammoth coal docks and the huge elevators of the Canadian Pacific, with a capacity of several millions of bushels\u2014one of the elevators being the largest on the continent.\n\nPORT ARTHUR.\n\nRecently known to Canadians as Prince Arthur's Landing, from the fact that a son of Her Majesty landed here\u2014is a rapidly growing and progressive town, with a population of between 5,000 and 6,000. Although until the opening of the great transcontinental road, it was entirely cut off during the winter months from the outside world, it now has communication all the year round. It possesses\nall the facilities and social advantages of a much larger place, having Episcopal, Roman Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian and Baptist Churches, good public schools, Roman Catholic separate school, a Convent, and a general hospital. It is the terminus of both the Eastern, or Lake Superior Division, and the Western, or Prairie Division of the Canadian Pacific Railway. It is the head-quarters of the grain elevator and grain inspection system of the Canadian North-West, having, in addition to its elevator, large and commodious railway and private wharves, and a Government break-water, which, when completed, will be five thousand two hundred and eighty feet in length, making the inner and outer harbors of a capacity seldom equalled. It is the district town or capital of the Thunder Bay portion of the great Algoma District, which has an area of at least fifty thousand square miles, and is consequently the seat of the various law courts, as well as having all the public buildings of the District; it is the divisional head-quarters of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the chief customs port, head office of the collector of inland revenue and agency of the Dominion Indian department and of the Provincial department of crown lands, besides having large and extensive wholesale and retail business houses.\n\nThe secret societies, number amongst them a lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, a Royal Arch Chapter, Knight Templars Encampment, and a society of the Independent Order of Oddfellows. It has a Mechanics' Institute, two snow-shoe clubs, a rifle company, Philharmonic society, volunteer fire brigade, yacht, rowing and canoe clubs, two banks, and a board of trade, incorporated under the laws of the Dominion of Canada, saw and planing mills, lumber and coal yards, machine shops and foundry, two roller skating rinks, and is the distributing point for the North-Western coal and lumber trade. It boasts of having daily, weekly, and mining newspapers, and its hotel accommodation is unsurpassed.\n\nThe rich silver and gold mines in the district contiguous to Port Arthur give promise of great development. The Laurentian Mountains, enclosing the basin of Lake Superior are ascertained to be as rich in mineral as the Marquette, Outanagan and Vermilion mines of Wisconsin and Minnesota, while in the same formation, extending south-westwardly from Port Arthur to the intermediate boundary, no fewer than eight silver mines have proved remunerative. The exports of silver ore to the United States alone last year was $250,000. And yet this silver district has only recently been discovered, and its development has been delayed by the want of railway communication with Port Arthur, a want which will likely be overcome by the construction of the Thunder Bay Colonization Railway. The mining laws of the Province of Ontario, are very liberal, and any one, whether a citizen or not, may own and operate mining lands, which may be purchased from the Crown at $2 per acre, and there are no restrictions as to the quantity any one may purchase. The gold district is a little farther to the west, its development likewise has been retarded by the want of railway communication. In addition to gold and silver, copper, iron, lead, zinc, bismuth, antimony, mica, marble, red and white sandstone, and many other minerals and stones, are known to exist in paying quantities. To the north and east lies Silver Islet\u2014a little dot in Superior, from which millions of wealth have been extracted. The climate of the North Shore is very invigorating. The winters are cold, clear, calm and embracing, and although the thermometer will range low for very many days at a time, it has no bad effect on the health of the inhabitants, who are singularly free from lung troubles. The sum-\nmer months are particularly delightful, bright, clear sunny days, quite warm enough to be pleasant, with cool nights. To the tourist, the country offers a series of delights. Game is plentiful, trout streams are numerous, from the widely known Nepigon, the King of trout streams, down to the Mackenzie, the Carp, the Blende, the Current, the McIntyre, Six-Mile Creek and McVicar's. The bay is a magnificent sheet for sailing, rowing and canoeing; the scenery is grand and impressive\u2014and it is no wonder that summer after summer many are attracted to this romantic elysium.\n\nThe country west is a dense wilderness of rock, morass and forest, but rich in mineral wealth. To the south, on the American boundary, is the fertile Rainy River region, which is fairly settled, and capable of the production of cereals and vegetables in large quantities. At Fort Frances are the remains of the celebrated locks which, before the needs and the capabilities of the fertile west were understood, were contemplated as improvements to the waterways which were to form a part of the great transcontinental route. Hereabouts are valuable forests of pine and spruce, soon to be utilized for the benefit of man by the construction of a railway. The Lake of the Woods, a lovely sheet of water, the northern part of which is a labyrinth of islands, is of historical interest, from the fact that it has been the starting point for the international boundary line in every treaty between the United States and Great Britain; and it was on its shores and islets that Verendrye built forts which were maintained as the base of his journeys across the great plains. It was on one of the numerous islets, too, that one of his sons, with a priest and twenty-one voyageurs, were massacred by the Sioux. The lake opens out to the south-west into a wide traverse, but in the north it is completely dotted with islands which possess a store of mineral richness now on the eve of being developed. On the one hand, for a thousand miles, there are dense forests, and muskegs, and Laurentian rocks; for a thousand miles on the other there is a fertile alluvial plain. Just above Rat Portage it empties into the Winnipeg river, and, foaming and spuming, passes over the Winnipeg Falls, and in erratic course flows to Lake Winnipeg, and thence to Hudson's Bay. The scenery of the lake is picturesque, charming to the eye, and the surroundings are delightful. At the falls are located the mammoth mills of the Lake of the Woods Milling Co., believed to be the largest in America. The mill is 110x50 feet, and there is a warehouse of the same dimensions, with an elevator with a capacity for 250,000 bushels, and another is to be erected with a capacity for three quarters of a million of bushels. The mill, which is built of native granite, quarried on an island in close proximity, has a capacity of twelve hundred barrels of flour per day, and cost over a quarter of a million of dollars. The water-power is unsurpassed, and, doubtless, in the near future, another gigantic mill will be erected, and make this one of the greatest milling centres of Canada. The barrels used are made on the spot from poplar wood, and altogether about 300 persons find employment in the place. In the vicinity are six extensive saw-mills, whose output annually is five hundred thousand feet.\nPRINCIPAL BUSINESS PLACES OF PORT ARTHUR.\n\nAlgoma House, Merrill & Holder, Proprietors\nCumberland street, Port Arthur.\u2014Prominent among the hotels of Port Arthur, and ranking in the list of the finest in the country, is the Algoma House, which is centrally and pleasantly situated on Cumberland street, between Arthur and Park streets. It is a three storey brick building, having a frontage of 56 feet, and extending back 84 feet, and is one of the finest appearing hotel structures in the city or Northwest.

The Algoma can be heartily recommended to all visitors to the Northwest.\n\nWilliam Bishop & Co., Retail Grocers and Dealers in China and Glassware, South Water street, Port Arthur.\u2014Previous to the year 1887, this had been the business of Thomas Marks & Co., for whom Mr. Bishop, for several years, was general manager, and then purchased the stock. It was not to be apprehended that such a change of ownership would injure the worth and popularity of the old establishment. Neither did it Mr. Bishop's genius still presides; and naturally he is not less active in the interests of customers and his own. The stock rates in value at $10,000\u2014the annual product, $50,000. Mr. Bishop's long residence in Port Arthur has made him intimately acquainted with the locality at large, its inhabitants, resources, and general prospects. He came originally from Ottawa.\n\nThe firm makes a specialty of supplying parties visiting Port Arthur or vicinity for the purpose of fishing; also exploring parties will find it to their advantage by calling at the above mentioned place.

The stock carried is valued at $45,000, and the annual business reaches the enormous sum of $150,000 to $160,000. It includes a full and complete assortment of staple and fancy goods, teas, coffees, canned goods, hardware (heavy and shelf), boots and shoes, liquors, cigars and tobaccos; also full lines in miners' supplies.\n\nOnly the best and purest goods are handled, and the reputation of the house in this respect is established beyond the requirements of praise. The facilities of the firm for transacting business are of an unusually adequate character, enabling it to offer special advantages to customers and to fill all orders in the promptest and most satisfactory manner. Two travelling men are constantly kept on the road as far east as Sudbury Junction, and west as far as Rat Portage, stopping at all mining and lumbering towns and lake ports. The firm is a direct importer of teas from China and Japan, also importers of all classes of goods from the old country, enabling it to compete with Toronto, Montreal and Winnipeg houses. Mr. Isbester personally is one of the most popular business men in Port Arthur, and is well entitled to the esteem that energy and reliability always inspire. The firm are also heavy importers of fishermen's tackle, such as nets, lines, rods, flies, hooks, and goods in this line of all description. Parties coming to Port Arthur on fishing excursions will do well by calling at the above mentioned place.\n\nW. J. Clarke, Wholesale and Retail Druggist and Chemist, corner of Arthur and Cumberland streets.\u2014At the corner of Arthur and Cumberland streets, the handsome and attractive pharmacy of W. J. Clarke is located, and is stocked with the finest and most complete stock of\npure goods and medicines, perfumeries, fancy goods, toilet articles, and everything pertaining to a well regulated establishment of this kind, in endless variety and the finest quality to be found in the city. The store is large and spacious, and the goods are arranged and displayed in an extraordinarily attractive manner. This is one of the most noted and elegant parts of the city, and Mr. Clarke enjoys a reputation of which Mr. Clarke has a right to be proud. The business, which was founded by Mr. Clarke in 1871, with small capital, has grown into its handsome proportions through the untiring energy and enterprise of its proprietor, who is a highly popular gentleman, possessing the confidence of the business community, and enjoying the respect and patronage of an appreciative public. Mr. Clarke is an experienced pharmacist, and pays special attention to compounding physicians' prescriptions in a careful and accurate manner, using only the best and purest ingredients. In connection with the drug business, the firm handles paints, oils, stationery, fancy goods and cigars, commanding an extensive trade along the north shore of Lake Superior and the mining districts.\n\nBodega Hotel and Restaurant, W. G. Johnston, Proprietor, corner Park and Cumberland streets, Port Arthur.\u2014Mr. Johnston has been so long and favorably known as a hotel-keeper to the people of Port Arthur and the travelling public, that it is unnecessary to enter a word of praise in reference to a house conducted by him. Mr. Johnston came to Port Arthur in 1884, and has been continuously engaged in the hotel business ever since that date, being proprietor of the old Bodega which was burned to the ground in the great fire of 1886, but Phoenix-like has risen from the ashes once more, is proprietor of one of the most comfortable hotels in the city. It is a handsome two-story brick building, 120 x 50 feet in size, situated on the corner of Park and Cumberland streets, enjoying an advantageous position. Its close proximity to the C. P. R. and steamboat landings must commend it to travellers. The hotel contains twenty neatly furnished sleeping rooms, comfortably warmed during cold weather, and has also in connection the only first-class restaurant to be found in the city. The bar is stocked with the best wines, liquors and cigars in the market. Fifteen employees are required in the various departments of the hotel.

Mr. Johnston being a gentleman of lengthy experience in the hotel business, the Bodega is now run in a strictly first-class manner, and is the recipient of a large and increasing public patronage.\n\nFrancis Witherspoon, Wholesale and Retail Harness Manufactory, Arthur street, Port Arthur.\u2014An industrial variety of this enterprising city would be far from complete which omitted prominent mention of the old established house which is made the subject of the present sketch. The business was founded by Mr. Witherspoon some five years ago. The premises occupied are eligibly situated and admirably arranged and equipped with the most improved machinery and appliances, employment being given to none but skilled workmen. Among the products of the factory are harness, saddles, halters, bridles, fly-nets, robes, blankets, whips and brushes. These goods are unequalled for superiority of workmanship and finish. They are made from the best materials and in the most skilful manner, and have a standard reputation in the trade. The facilities of the firm for transacting business are of a strictly first-class character, enabling it to offer special advantages to customers and to execute all orders in the promptest and most satisfactory manner. Mr. Witherspoon came here from Winnipeg, and his career bears evidence of his sterling personal worth and ability. He also deals largely in trunks and valises.\n\nMatthews & Fraser, Wholesale and Retail Dry Goods and Gent's Furnishings, Port Arthur.\u2014One of the best known and most popular dry goods establishments in the city is that conducted by Messrs. Matthews & Fraser, splendidly situated on Cumberland street. The business was started some fourteen years ago by M. Street & Brother, the present firm buying out the establishment in 1887. Messrs. Matthews & Fraser are both wholesale and retail dealers in dry goods and gent's furnishings. The store is filled from end to end with as large, varied and attractive a line of goods as any one could desire, and the stock is kept supplied with frequent invoices of all the latest novelties and newest patterns. The beautiful manner in which the goods are displayed, the perfect neatness in which everything in the establishment is kept\u2014not a speck of dust allowed to accumulate anywhere, as is too frequently the case in many large establishments\u2014demands volumes for the good taste and the high appreciation of the advantages to be derived from an attractive and pleasant place in which to greet customers of Messrs. Matthews & Fraser, the popular proprietors, who take much pride in this as well as in all other features of the business. The new stock of dry goods, carpets, silks, mantles and fur goods just received by this firm, is the largest in the city, and offers to patrons a great variety of styles and designs. They have on hand an especially fine assortment of dress goods in every style and shade. The large stock carried by this firm amounts to about $25,000, while the annual business is from $40,000 to $50,000. The members of the firm are J. L. Matthews and J. H. Fraser. Both gentlemen are widely known, and the establishment is favorably mentioned on all hands.\n\nThe Bazaar, J. L. Meikle, Cumberland street, Port Arthur, Wholesale and Retail Fancy Goods.\u2014Webster gives the meaning of the word \"bazaar\" as \"a spacious hall, a suit of rooms, fitted up with counters or stands for the sale of goods.\" A visit to the Bazaar on Cumberland street shows not only the internal arrangements given by our American lexicographer, but also that the \"rooms\" and \"stands\" are overspread with choice quantities of fancy goods of all descriptions, musical instruments, stationery, confectionery, etc., etc., the extent of the stock at large being almost incredible, and, according to the testimony of many tourists, not likely to be found in any city of the Dominion. The building in which this establishment is to be seen is in itself remarkable and well worthy of description\u201435 x 85 feet; two stories in height with a fifteen feet ceiling. There are eight plate glass windows, 7 x 11 feet, and two 3 feet 6 inches by 11 feet each. The interior is divided into eleven departments. Four carved and massive iron pillars support the roof; twenty chandeliers, the light from which upon the many mirrors and elegant goods makes a charming scene. There are thirteen (13) different counters, with show-eases, encircling the room, and seven in the centre. Each of the departments referred to has its own description of goods. On entering the first, books are the attraction, from those of the youngest child to the boy and girl of the best bookworms; miscellaneous periodicals and newspapers being also represented. Blank books, legal and commercial, and a fine stock of fancy paper and envelopes are to be seen in the next, or second department, while the third is remark-\nable for its tempting array of confectionery, ranging from the child's favorite bull's-eye and sugar-stick to those higher varieties which the ladies so much enjoy. Next we have a scene specially for the fair sex, consisting of fancy wools, silks, ladies' embroideries, infants' clothes, suits for young boys and girls, slipper patterns, Berlin wools, dressmaking patterns, toilet and ornamental articles. The greater portion of this choice stock comes direct from England and Germany, all the latest designs are kept in stock, and the new and pleasing can always be seen. The musician will also be gratified in the Bazaar, where he will find musical instruments in variety\u2014violins, banjos, guitars, concertinas, harps, flutes, etc.; also organs and pianos, imported and of domestic manufacture, ranging in value from $300 to $500. There are also artistic articles in ladies' companions and writing sets, albums up to $20, in plush, Russian leather and vellum. There are, also, on the premises, a fine stock of silver table plate. In addition to all this, and much more of a most valuable and extensive stock, could be described a large assortment of wall papers, trunks, valises and children's carriages. The store is further adorned by a varied assortment of cut glass goods, artificial flowers, statuary in bronze; brises and white marble, fine chronos and engravings.\n\nMr. Meikle is also agent for the Wanzer sewing machine, of which he has already sold, in the immediate district, several hundreds. The business, of which we have given an imperfect sketch, commenced in 1882. Its operations may be said to be bounded on the one side by Winnipeg and on the other by Ottawa, not infrequently meeting customers from each of these cities, and while some may conjecture that the stock carried is heavy\u2014more than $35,000 for the section of the country\u2014Mr. Meikle finds it to be profitable and of daily increasing value. The increase of business during the month exceeded $2,000 over the similar period since it commenced. Mr. Meikle does a considerable wholesale trade in many lines throughout this district, and has all confidence in the growth and prosperity of Port Arthur.\n\nC. O. Lalonde, Wholesale and Retail Boots and Shoes, Trunks and Valises, Port Arthur.\u2014The leading boot, shoe and rubber house, at the corner of Arthur and Cumberland streets, is one of the finest and best arranged stores on the entire street, with one of the largest, most complete and varied stock of boots and shoes in the city. Mr. Lalonde will be found ever ready to greet with a pleasant reception any number of friends and patrons to his well known establishment. The business was started two years ago; since then Mr. Lalonde, through his enterprise and ability, has been doing a very large and steadily increasing business. No establishment enjoys a higher degree of popularity or is doing a better or more prosperous business, the popularity of the proprietor and the high esteem in which the house is held being generally acknowledged. The stock of ready made goods comprises every imaginable article in footwear, and is selected with great care and judgment. J. D. King & Co.'s fine boots and other makes are always kept in stock, embracing the most desirable and most reliable goods for men, women, boys, misses or children.

Mr. Lalonde is a man of sterling integrity and enjoys the esteem and confidence of a large circle of friends and patrons.\n\nP. Labby & Co., Wholesale and Retail Groceries, Provisions and Crockery, Cumberland street, Port Arthur.\u2014This is a branch of business which cannot be overlooked by any family, and in a careful, detailed examination or review of the various commercial interests that have given Port Arthur the celebrity that it enjoys, it is pleasing to notice that the grocery trade takes such a prominent position as it does. One of the best known and most universally patronized grocery establishments in the city is that conducted by P. Labby & Co., eligibly situated on Cumberland street. The premises occupied by the firm are large and commodious, admirably arranged and fitted up with every facility and convenience for the successful carrying on of the business.

C. Vivian, Wholesale and Retail Clothing and Gent's Furnishings, Cumberland street, next to the Bazaar, Port Arthur.\u2014In detailing the various interests which have made Port Arthur the great metropolis of the Canadian lake ports of the Northwest, the clothing trade deserves special mention. The number of houses engaged in this business probably exceeds those in any other branch, except groceries, and next to what we eat, we must always consider what we shall wear. Clothing may be truly said to be one of the necessities of life. Among the many establishments in this city devoted to retail clothing and gent's furnishings, that of Mr. Vivian, on Cumberland street, deserves special mention, and for this reason, that Mr. Vivian has built up at his stand a business which ever shows increasing signs of assuming large dimensions, while his present trade is of most respectable proportions. His prosperity in business has been the merited result of push and determination, enterprise and energy, when backed up with good business capabilities and judgment in the buying of stock, will always win success. The amount of stock carried is about $10,000, while the annual business foots up to the handsome figure of $35,000 to $40,000. Mr. Vivian occupies a prominent position among the general public, and is regarded as a man of sterling integrity and honest straightforward business methods. This firm makes a specialty of boys' and children's clothing, a perfect fit guaranteed.\n\nH. Nicholson, Merchant Tailor, corner South Water and Park streets, Port Arthur.\u2014Prominent among the leading and most successful merchant tailors in Port Arthur is Nicholson, whose establishment is at above mentioned corner. He is a native of Ontario, and came here about ten years ago from Bruce Mines. Nine years ago he established himself in this line of business. It is in the midst of the best line of business centre, and is admirably arranged for the purpose. The stock carried is extensive and well assorted, and embracing the finest imported and Canadian fabrics in all the latest and most fashionable shades, colors and designs.

It is within a generation that this was a land of which little was known\u2014cut off from the whirl and bustle of the outer world. It was a country of itself, a community by itself\u2014unheeding and unheedful of the world outside. The Red River Valley had been vaguely heard of as the home of the buffalo and the Indian\u2014the land of cold and snow and ice, where Arctic winter reigned supreme and perpetual. It was thought to be a land of desolation, given over almost entirely to fur-bearing animals and those who hunted them, unfit for habitation by white men. From Superior's broad waters to the great barrier of rocks, one thousand miles away towards the setting sun, and from the rapid-rolling Missouri to the Arctic circle\u2014a vast area\u2014was almost universally held to be an arid desert, the shadowy home of savages, doomed forever to be the symbol and synonym of desolation and solitude. But the world is sometimes wrong, and in this instance it was radically so. Venturesome travellers of repute, in search of new fields of adventure, visited the country and brought back what seemed to be incredible tales of a wonderful land, whose fertile soil was unequalled, whose climate was invigorating, whose possibilities were illimitable, and whose destiny was to be the happy home of a thriving and contented people. But still the world was sceptical, and this magnificent land lay fallow and unoccupied, except by its aboriginal owners, until later, through the impulsive restlessness which pervades the human race, and irresistibly urges man adventurously onward to the great Occident, its hidden wealth and wonderful resources were discovered, and even the most prejudiced, oft-times reluctantly, were compelled to concede that what was then called the Great Lone Land might possibly after all really become the future granary of the world. To-day, although its settlement is only fairly commencing, and its resources are yet in an incipient stage of\ndevelopment, there is no attempt at denial of the just claim to that proud title, and there is no other country under the sun which offers the grand inducements this one does to the overcrowded population of the east in quest of that home, and health and happy contentment which, no matter how ceaselessly they may struggle and toil, they are unable to obtain in their own native land across the Atlantic. It would seem as if Providence had made this a huge reserve for the overgrown families of the Old World, and its free homes are generously offered to the overcrowded East to participate in the enjoyment of all the blessings of its free government and free institutions.\n\nNearly sixty years ago, when all the wide stretch of northland lying from halfway between Atlantic's storm-beaten coast and the mighty Rockies was a terra incognita, the great historian of Europe wrote:\u2014\"The gradual and continuous progress of the European race toward the Rocky Mountains has the solemnity of a providential event; it is like a deluge of men rising unabatedly and daily driven onward by the hand of God.\" When this was written, the great States of Illinois and Iowa were the uttermost west; Wisconsin a wilderness; Minnesota a preserve of the wild Indian; Dakota and Manitoba nameless and unknown. But the historian's prophetic eye penetrated the future, and but little over half a century has lapsed ere the human wave is found washing over the ocean of verdure, and approaching the eternal sentinels which guard the western portals of this immense fertile land.\n\nIn the few years that the Canadian North-West has been in a position to offer the settler any means of communication save the primitive ox-cart and the pioneer river craft, the progress that has been made is marvellous, the development wonderful, and the prosperity beyond belief. The work of pioneering is ended, and the newcomer now finds awaiting him a home surrounded by nearly all the adjuncts of civilization, within easy reach of postal and telegraphic facilities, rail communication, schools and places of worship. Between the easterly limits of the famous grain-growing valley of the Red River of the North and the base of the Rockies there are millions of acres of rich land for the landless; there are free homes for the homeless; there is a land great in extent, wonderful in climate, grand in its exuberant fertility, magnificent in its natural beauty and sublimity. It is the land for the husbandman, for the merchant, for the hunter, for the lumberman, for the miner, for the tourist\u2014for all; lacking nothing but energetic and industrious tillers of the soil to aid in working out its manifest destiny. This central Canada of the West, in itself, solves a deeply vexed question: it can relieve the overflowing population of the East, whose very poverty and distress are caused by their vast numbers, by giving these people homes where the fullest measure of prosperity is due to lack of population; and so, in a double sense, it can effect beneficial results both to the Old World and the New. It was of this domain that the King of the Gatineau, in eloquent words which rang through the nation's council chamber, said:\u2014\"It is a land inhabited by a people in the very flower of manhood, the very flower of the Canadian people; a land where the weather is at times exceedingly cold, but at the same time bracing and healthy; whose inhabitants bear upon their countenance the impress of its healthfulness, whose women are noted for their lovely and rosy complexions, and whose men are pictures of ruddiness and manhood. I told them I thought in that healthy and bracing climate they had discovered the fountain of perpetual youth which Ponce de Leon sought so long in vain. It is a land where a man of moderate means and courage\nand perseverance can obtain an honest independence on the cheapest and easiest terms, where the toilers of the world can stand erect and call no man master. I would advise everyone who wishes to escape from the sorceries of this western enchantress not to enter within her borders; she casts a glamour upon all who do so, and makes them perpetually her slaves. It was said of the Norman nobles who were sent to conquer Ireland that they became so enchanted with the beauty of the green isle, the loveliness of the women, and the bravery of the men, that they became more Irish than the Irish themselves. So I think it will be with all who enter our western domain.\"\n\nTHE PROVINCE OF MANITOBA.\n\nThe region known as the Red River Settlements was created a province in 1870 and admitted to the Confederation. At that time its limits were contracted, having an area of only 13,500 square miles, and with a sparse population of about 12,000, was not inappropriately called the \"Baby Province.\" So small was it, that on the map it resembled a postage stamp on the wrapper of a newspaper; but in 1881 its bounds were extended on all sides but the south, to embrace a tract 264 miles by 300, an area covering 123,200 square miles. Manitoba extends from the United States boundary north to latitude 52\u00b0 50', and from the western boundary of Ontario, near the Lake of the Woods, west to 101\u00b0 20'. The province embraces a large portion of Lakes Winnipeg, Manitoba, Winnipegoosis, and several lesser bodies of water, and is traversed from south to north by the Red River, which takes its rise in the height of land of Minnesota, almost within sight of the fountain-head of the Mississippi, which, taking a contrary course, flows through the great States of the Union, and empties into the Gulf of Mexico. Besides the Red, the Assiniboine River traverses the western portion of the province, and at the confluence of the two streams is the city of Winnipeg. Both streams are navigable for long distances, but the flat-bottomed stern-wheelers, which did noble service in the early days, have been superseded by the speedier iron horse. Navigation of the Red River between Winnipeg and Selkirk and on Lake Winnipeg is still prosperous, and contributes towards making Winnipeg the base of supplies for the country on the Saskatchewan and beyond. Manitoba is the commencement of the three great plateaus between the Lake of the Woods and Rockies. Its surface is mainly level, though rising in places to ranges of small hills. A prairie country, with treeless plains extending from five to thirty miles, covered in summer with a luxuriant growth of grass, its river banks are fringed with trees, and in places the timber belt broadens into belts which are worthy the name of forests.\n\nThe early history of Manitoba is an interesting one. As early as 1736, writes one author, a party of French adventurers from Quebec, under the command of La Verendrye, who had authority from the French authorities to penetrate into the interior of the country to the west of Lake Superior, arrived at the mouth of the Assiniboine, where it merges its waters with that of the Red River. The Assiniboine, so named from the tribe of Indians of that name living in its vicinity, was rechristened the St. Charles, and afterwards the Upper Red River. At the junction of the two rivers a post was established, with the name of Fort Rouge, and, according\nto an eye-witness, the ruins of such a post were plainly discernible in 1800 on the point where the Hudson's Bay Company's mill now stands. So we may say that La Verendrye was the first real estate owner in Winnipeg, after the aboriginal inhabitants. In 1763 occurred the conquest of Canada by Great Britain, and some fifteen or twenty years after fur traders from Canada began to seek the North-West for trade with the Indians. In 1783 a powerful company of fur traders was formed in Montreal, consolidating the interests of several small private concerns who had been struggling with each other for some time. This company bore the title of the North-West Fur Company, and it soon began to push its operations inland to even the Athabasca and McKenzie Rivers. The trade of the Red River seems to have been, for some unaccountable reason, quite neglected, and it was only towards the very close of the last century that we find mention made of the establishment of posts on the upper waters of what we now call the Red River. The point between the Red and Assiniboine Rivers was known to the fur traders at that time, and for fully twenty-five years after, as \"The Forks,\" so that the second name given to this site was recorded. The Hudson's Bay Company had long confined their trade to the neighborhood of Hudson's Bay\u2014indeed, from 1670 to 1774, they had not established posts on the banks of the streams flowing into Lake Winnipeg. It is most likely that their first post on the Red River was established as late as 1796. For some years \"The Forks\" was resorted to simply as a camping place for the boat brigades passing up the Assiniboine River, whereon numerous forts were erected by the North-West Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, and a new body of traders who styled themselves the X Y Company. The last company was short-lived, amalgamating with the North-West Company in 1804. About 1803 Alexander Henry, of the North-West Company, who was in charge of the Red River district, sent a party of his men to build at \"The Forks\" the post afterwards named Fort Gibraltar, which at first probably only consisted of one or two buildings, for there is a record later on of a more extensive establishment than existed at this time. That a post of the North-West Company was maintained at \"The Forks\" in 1803 and 1804 is settled by the journal of Alexander Henry, which is still in manuscript. The writer extracted from that journal, amongst other items, the following statement of the trade of \"The Forks\" establishment during the winters of 1803 and 1804:\u2014356 beavers, 10 black bears, 1 brown bear, 76 wolves, 8 foxes, 25 raccoons, 36 fishers, 26 otters, 20 martens, 13 minks, 3 wolverines, 15 lynxes, 6 moose skins, etc., 22 parchments, etc. As trading posts existed at Rousseau River and Pembina the same year, it may be accepted that the above furs were obtained from animals killed in the vicinity of Winnipeg. By the erection of Gibraltar, the foundation of the future commercial greatness of the town was laid in 1803 as well, for ever since that date mercantile business has flourished within what are now the limits of the city of Winnipeg. The old Fort Gibraltar had both parks and natural farms eighty years ago. Henry informs us incidentally, on two or three occasions, that he visited \"The Forks\" to enjoy himself. After describing the heavy woods which covered the country south from the Assiniboine, near \"The Forks,\" to the Salle River, he says he caught a number of whitefish, sturgeon and goldeyes, while the women gathered hazel nuts, red and choke cherries, Pembina berries, three kinds of plums, and wild grapes, the men going out on the prairie \"towards little Stony Mountain\" and returning with the carcasses of cow buffalos, which they had killed, varying this amusement by\nbringing in red deer and bears, which were here in great abundance. Wild fowl in great numbers frequented the mouth of the Assiniboine, and the rapids at St. Andrew's was a favorite resort of pelicans. Nature evidently boomed the wild animal, waterfowl and fruit features of Winnipeg at that early date. That the present site of Winnipeg was early recognized as a central one for the distribution of supplies is shown by the custom pursued by the traders of landing here to assort and re-pack the outfits for distribution to the posts south and west. The Ojibway and Snake Indians, who frequented the country bordering about the mouth of the Assiniboine during the first part of the present century, at least on one occasion entrenched themselves in pits at \"The Forks\" on account of a threatened attack of the Sioux, which is the first military operation recorded in the history of Winnipeg. The Hudson's Bay Company began to push up to the Red River about 1796, and during the next decade had placed trading posts in the vicinity of those of the North-West Company, with the exception of at \"The Forks.\" In 1811 Lord Selkirk, after controlling a large share of the stock of the Hudson's Bay Company, secured from it a grant of land along the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, covering an area of some 116,000 square miles, under the claim of that company that their charter gave them control of the country described, which claim was contested by the Canadian fur traders. Lord Selkirk issued a most glowing description of the land, climate and general advantages to be gained by persons joining with him in settling in this tract of country, and induced a number of persons in Scotland and Ireland to avail themselves of what a writer in 1817 describes as the benefits of \"liberty of conscience, freedom from taxes and tithes, and all the temptations of a land of promise painted in most glowing colors.\" The party sailed in the spring of 1811 for York Factory, but on arriving there found the season too far advanced to proceed on their journey to Red River. They accordingly wintered at York Factory, and suffered severely before they arrived at the Red River during the next year. Miles Macdonell was in charge of the party, and on their arrival in the vicinity of \"The Forks\" he paraded them, and exhibited his commission as governor of the colony, which apparently was the first occasion of such an official making his debut in this district. Other parties were sent out in 1813 and 1814 to augment the number of the first arrivals. The latter behaved in an arbitrary manner to the North-West company's people, which was at once resented by them, as they viewed the settling of the country and claims of Lord Selkirk as illegal and unjustified, claiming that they had taken possession of the Red River country as traders from Canada half a century before the people of the Hudson's Bay Company had ventured into it. A struggle for supremacy at once began between the rival companies and resulted in bloodshed on more than one occasion, and the total destruction of the property of the Selkirk settlers, who were generally simply onlookers. On March 17, 1816, the Hudson's Bay Company people, who had a fort at Point Douglas, about three-quarters of a mile below \"The Forks,\" attacked Fort Gibraltar, of the North-West Company, at the mouth of the Assiniboine, captured the inmates, ransacked their stores, and finally razed the buildings to the ground, carrying away the timbers to Fort Douglas to use for their own purposes. Five days later they attacked the North-West Company's fort at Pembina and destroyed it also. In the following spring the employees of the North-West Company came into collision with the Hudson's Bay Company's people, under Governor Semple, at Seven Oaks, a few miles north of the present city limits, and it resulted in\nthe death of Governor Semple and about twenty of his men, while only one Indian on the side of the North-Westers was killed. Then matters were in a very disturbed state until the coalition of these two powerful companies in 1820-21, when the Hudson's Bay Company established themselves at \"The Forks\" and opened stores to supply the settlers, traders and Indians with goods; so another era in the trade of Winnipeg was entered on. The people who from time to time came to the country, settled along the banks of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, those of the same nationalities generally settling in localities by themselves. The Hudson's Bay Company had re-purchased in 1836 all Lord Selkirk's rights in the settlement for the sum of \u00a325,000, and, according to Sir George Simpson, afterwards sold land to settlers for seven shillings and sixpence, or five shillings an acre, according to location. The land was conveyed under lease for 999 years, and the holder agreed not to traffic in furs, violate any of the chartered privileges of the company, evade any of the restrictions governing the laws relating to the distillation of spirits, etc.\n\nThere it was that many of the noted clansmen of the famous Scottish chiefs, whose fortunes were lost at the memorable battle of Culloden, in 1746, which extinguished the hopes of the house of Stuart, afterwards came to Canada. They had participated in that bloody engagement, and having lost all, and to avoid the fierce persecutions which followed, they fled to this country of refuge. They were distinguished for heroic courage and daring enterprise. Coming to Canada they at once sought employment in the adventurous schemes of the fur traders of the North-West. This bold blood gave new vigor and additional energy to the affairs of the traders. These men and their descendants were the intrepid voyageurs who pushed their fortunes to the Saskatchewan and the Athabasca one hundred years ago. The blood which flowed in the bands of Culloden is the blood of those fearless Scotsmen who dared warring tribes and frozen regions and unknown hardships, who discovered the Mackenzie River, who first crossed the Rocky Mountains, and first planted the British flag on the Arctic seas. In the veins of many Bois br\u00fbl\u00e9s and M\u00e9tis girls on the Red River flow the blood of the men who fought with Lochiel near Inverness on the 15th April, 1746. The vast region of British America is full of the unwritten traditions of the daring exploits of these men through a wilderness of territory larger than all Europe, and it only needs the glamour of the glittering pen of a Scott to weave these wild annals as fascinating as Waverley, and as charming as the wonderful romances of Fennimore Cooper. In olden journals can be read how the great Cardinal Richelieu headed \"The Company of the Hundred Partners,\" in 1637, engaged in the fur trade in Canada, which company continued for thirty-six years, and which has had successors continuously, till finally merged in the great Hudson's Bay Company, which carries on its extensive operations at the present time. So that the Red River, the Saskatchewan and the far-off Athabasca are linked back to the days of Louis XIV. in France, and to the great chiefs and clans of Scotland who fought at Culloden, where the flag of the Stuarts went down forever.\n\nOwing to dissatisfaction in the settlement and to American intrigues, a body of British regular troops was sent out from England to Fort Garry in 1846, under command of Col. J. F. Crofton, consisting of 383 persons, covering detachments from the Sixth Foot, Royal Artillery and Civil Engineers. Of these, twenty men remained in the country. These troops returned to England in 1848, and in that year were succeeded by a corps of fifty-six pensioners, under the command of Lieut. Col.\nCaldwell, many of whom afterwards settled in the country, with Lieut. Col. Caldwell as governor of the colony. Again, in the year 1857, 100 men of the Royal Canadian Rifles were sent round by the Hudson's Bay, like the others, leaving Canada for that purpose, and were likewise quartered at Fort Garry. It is not known, to most people at least, that three different expeditions of troops were sent to Fort Garry before the Riel rebellion of 1869-70, when what is called the first Red River expedition, composed of regular troops and Canadian volunteers, was dispatched from Ontario and Quebec, and arrived here in August 1870, to find that Riel had fled. It was from this date that Winnipeg, as a place distinct from the Hudson's Bay company's Fort Garry, became known. On the arrival of the troops in 1870, the village consisted of a collection of about twenty-seven houses, centering about the present site of the post-office, the population only numbering about one hundred or one hundred and fifty souls.\n\nThe Council of Assiniboia having been abolished on the entrance of the province into Confederation, the first Cabinet of Manitoba was formed in January, 1871, and consisted of Hon. (now Senator) M. A. Girard, Provincial Treasurer; Hon. Alfred Boyd, Provincial Secretary; Hon. H. J. Clarke, Attorney-General; and Hon. Thomas Howard, Minister of Public Works and Agriculture. Lacking adequate buildings for legislative purposes, the residence of Mr. A. G. B. Bannatyne, then immediately in rear of the stationery store of R. D. Richardson (corner of Main and Owen streets and opposite the new post-office) was leased, and in the March following, the first opening of the Legislature took place. It was attended with a great deal of pomp and display. The Lieut.-Governor, Hon. Mr. Archibald, was accompanied by a guard of 100 men of the Ontario Rifles; the Parliament House was elaborately decorated, and the usher of the Black Rod and sergeant-at-arms fairly shone in the Oriental splendour of their court uniforms. A local paper, alluding to the event, said: \"It could not be in any respect so grand or costly a display or on so large a scale as the capital of the Dominion can boast on such an occasion, but it had a completeness and dignity which were creditable to our young province.\" In December, 1873, the building was burned down, and with it, many valuable books and papers. It was generally supposed to have been destroyed through incendiaryism, but at the investigation held, nothing was elicited to substantiate the public belief. Afterwards the courthouse which had been erected in the centre of the town was utilized for holding the sessions of the legislature, and the chamber was generally decorated with bunting of many hues, which gave a fantastic\u2014if not an appropriate\u2014appearance to the meeting place of the Provincial Solons. The old courthouse was used in this way until the Government erected a new brick one on the Fort Osborne reserve, when the sessions were held there. And then, on the erection of suitable parliamentary buildings in 1883, the Government, which had in the meanwhile had its offices in an old barracks on Lombard street, and afterwards in the small structure now used as educational offices, moved the departments into the new buildings, which in design and appearance compare favourably with similar buildings in the other provinces.\n\nIt is unnecessary here to refer to the Riel rebellion of 1869-70, or its results. History has already placed the facts on record. When in August, 1870, Wolseley and his men arrived and occupied Fort Garry, which had been held by Riel since the previous winter, a new state of affairs came into existence. The reign of terror-\nwas ended. An era of prosperity ensued. The rush of people was chiefly from Ontario, although Quebec and the Maritime Provinces were not without their representatives. Then was a busy time, and as the town progressed, money became more plentiful, wages were high, land cheap and the outlook was as bright as any city could possibly hope for. But it was not all plain sailing. Just as the resources of the country were becoming known and appreciated by eastern people, a scourge of grasshoppers devastated it. The crops were destroyed\u2014the inhabitants discouraged. The hoppers remained until the fall of 1875, when, after saving the farmers the trouble of harvesting their crops, they suddenly disappeared and have never since been seen. The settlement of the country since is the best evidence that this plague will never visit it again. With their departure, hope once more buoyed up the citizen and the agriculturist. But enough of history for the present. Let us come down to the present time and condition of affairs.\n\nThe system of survey or of laying out the land in Manitoba and the Northwest is most simple. Every township is six miles square, and is divided into sections of one mile square (or 640 acres) each, that is, as nearly as it is possible to make mile squares on the surface of a globe, the scarcely appreciable difference from this exact area being the result of the convergence or divergence of the meridians forming the eastern and western boundaries, as the township is north or south of one of the standard base lines of survey. These sections are again subdivided into half sections of 320 acres and quarter sections of 160 acres, and further into half quarters, which terms are legal or statutory definitions of the divisions and subdivisions of land in Manitoba and the North-West Territories of the Dominion. The townships are laid out upon certain \"base lines,\" about twenty-four miles apart, running east and west, to the depth of two townships, both to the north and to the south, upon each. The lines upon which adjacent townships, surveyed from different base lines, abut, are termed \"correction lines,\" and upon these all discrepancies of survey are adjusted. The townships are arranged in tiers running from south to north, and starting from the southern frontier, which is the international boundary line. These tiers are marked on the map with ordinary numerals, thus: 1, 2, 3, etc., township 1 being on the International boundary or province frontier, which is \"the first base line;\" township 2 would be six miles further north; township 3 again six miles north, etc. The townships are further numbered in what are called \"ranges\" east and west, from lines called \"principal meridians.\" These numbers are marked on the map in Roman characters, thus: I., II., III., IV., etc. The first principal meridian starts from a point on the International boundary line about eleven miles west of Emerson. The west \"ranges\" run in regular numbers to the left or west of that meridian; and the east \"ranges\" to the right or east of that meridian. Thus, Township 3, Range III., west, would be three townships north of the boundary line, and three townships west of the principal meridian; or, Township 3, Range III., east, would be, in the same way, three townships north to the east of the principal meridian. Any one with this simple direction could put his finger on any township in Manitoba or any other part of the North-West Territory, of which the number north of the International boundary or first base line might be given, with the number of the range or tiers of townships east or west of the first or any of the principal meridians on the map. Any section of a township can be found by its number on the diagram of the map; and the reader, by looking at this and seeing the way in which the numbers run,\ncan instantly put his finger on any section of any township marked on the map. The boundaries of these sections being all laid out on the cardinal points of the compass, east, west, north and south, the section is divided into east half and west half, or north half and south half, whichever way the dividing line is run. These half sections are again divided into quarter sections, such as north-east quarter, north-west quarter, south-east quarter, south-west quarter; these quarters may again be divided in the same way; and these terms, as before stated, are legal or statutory definitions of land in Manitoba or the North-West Territory. In Canada the sections of a township are numbered from the south-east corner; in the United States from the north-east corner.\n\nConcerning no one thing in this world are the current conceptions observed more utterly wide of the mark, fallacious and absurd, than they are respecting the climate of this country. In the early past, it was looked upon with horror, and some parts of the civilized world still regards it as a land where the thermometer sometimes rises\u2014not falls\u2014to zero. A writer in the St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer-Press, in writing of the Northwest, dispels this illusion effectually. He says:\n\n\"The pictorial papers have ever illustrated Canada by winter sketches, ice palaces, snowshoe exhibitions and other like scenes, making very charming pictures, but all suggestive of arctic regions and an intense degree of cold, so that Canada, particularly Manitoba and the Northwest, is ever associated with frost and snow and vigorous winter. Whereas, for six months in the year along the chain of the Canadian Pacific railway, from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean, the boundaries of this vast dominion stretch millions of acres where the artist's pencil can find innumerable scenes of sylvan beauty, wood and waterfall, which, faithfully portrayed, would give a more correct idea of Canada when limned in a temperature of semi-tropical warmth. Two months of what in other countries would be denominated bracing weather, when the whole face of nature presents a phantasmagoria of bewildering beauty, when the roads and prairies are gorgeous with the varying hues of nature's decay\u2014a scene which sight can alone realize, for the words of the poet, the pen of the traveler or the brush of the artist must fall short in depicting, describing and portraying the glorious beauty, the innumerable blended tints of vegetable decay present. Then comes four months of undoubted winter; no rain; snow falling principally at night; days of bright sunshine, when the rays of \"old Sol\" make themselves gratefully felt through an atmosphere registering 30 degrees and reaching 50 degrees below zero, then during the midday hours, not unpleasantly cold, for this low temperature is attended by almost real stillness, and the absence of all superfluous moisture in the surrounding atmosphere renders the cold far less penetrating than that of a foggy day in New England in November, or a damp day in Chicago. No doubt there are a few days in winter when the elements are masters of the situation, and to defy them is to court destruction; but where is the climate and where is the country to be found entirely enjoyable throughout the year and free from all drawbacks? All countries have some points unfavourable; there is no perfect climate under the sun. But the climate of Manitoba is, above all other countries, the most favorable for transplanting the Saxon race and perpetuating that stalwart physique for which that race is remarkable. It is in its hygienic sense that the climate of Manitoba excels, and, if it were better understood, physicians would gladly avail themselves of adding another field to those already known where climate influence\nis chiefly depended upon for the arrest of disease and the repairment of its ravages. That the climate of Manitoba exercises a most salutary effect on the incipient stage of chest troubles is a well-established fact, demonstrable by hundreds of cases. The pine forests of the Engadine have been for a long time a favorable resort for the phthisical patients, and the mild climate of Alg\u00e9rie, which as winter quarters, must always hold its own. But it is probable that, in no part of the world will climatic influences do more for the arrest and removal of lung trouble in the early stages than this climate for at least five months, viz.: from the middle of April to the middle of September. Scattered throughout the Northwest are groves and belts of gigantic coniferae, in comparison with which the Engadine firs would sink into insignificance; so that if the vicinity of this timber exercises a prophylactic influence, one's hut may be pitched in pine groves overhanging magnificent lakes abounding in fish, and amidst scenery of sylvan beauty, on ground rarely trodden by the foot of man. Through such a country the tourist may wander for hundreds of miles, and for the first time realize the feeling of absolute freedom.\"\n\nThere is one fact in connection with the climate which has not been distinctly noticed by writers, and yet is a big stone in the foundation of an agricultural nation\u2014that is, while in the East the spring rains usually fall during ploughing and seed time\u2014April and May\u2014succeeded by the long parching days and blazing suns, and chirping grasshoppers, and finger-length cereals of June and July, riveted in bricks, and lying down at last in despair, here all this is reversed. April and May, dry; June, moist. That settles the whole question. No hindrance to work. No sowing in mortar and reaping off rubble and bricks. The seed, got in early, lies in a warm dry soil germinating and coming forth to meet the tepid rains of June, when the plants shoot up like arrows, and halt not till they bend their golden heads to the blade of the executioner. This one fact is worth untold millions. It ensures the future of this land beyond a peradventure. As to the late and early frosts they are no more peculiar to this country than to New York, California, Ontario or England. Indeed, from the nature of both winter and summer, these frosts will be found by-and-by to be of very rare occurrence. The bound from the long, solid winter is short and sharp; from summer to winter, ditto. When farming is well-established, the seasons' better understood, the low lands drained, and the work of fall and spring prompt and expeditious, we shall hear the last of 'frozen wheat.' The old Selkirk settlers laugh at the idea. Late arrival, dilatory management, inefficient appliances would freeze wheat anywhere. Besides freezing the ground solid and thus contributing to its pulverization in the spring, winter makes locomotion easy. There is no thaw from beginning to end, nor midwinter exposure of tender roots by destructive 'January thaws,' no slush, no blinding sleets, and but few blizzards. The blizzard is rare indeed, and the cyclone almost unknown, snow drifts are trifling compared with other countries. There is no hiding in caves of the earth, to escape the death track of the desolating tornado, as in Dakota and Minnesota in summer; no remaining in doors at the approach of a storm, for fear of being lost and frozen in its bewildering fierceness in winter. The average snowfall is light, but excellent frozen snow, mantled roads make locomotion easy during the winter months.\n\nThe climate here, considered either, with reference to personal comfort or agricultural purposes, is very far ahead of that of any of the Eastern Provinces. When farms and farm-houses have been surrounded with trees, which they will be\nin the near future, it will be still better\u2014not to mention the enhanced beauty of the landscape.\n\nThe soil of this western land is, without doubt, the richest in the world, even surpassing the famous valley of the Nile. And rich it ought to be. It was deposited during the prehistoric ages at the bottom of a mysterious inland sea, which rushed off to the ocean by way of Hudson's Bay, when its beneficent mission was accomplished, the glacier relaxing its grip and falling back to its native country. Each succeeding year has added to its fatness, so that manure is unnecessary, and its yield is thirty, forty, fifty and, in exceptional cases sixty, bushels of hard wheat to the acre\u2014wheat often weighing 65 lbs. to the bushel, and esteemed the very best in the world. The soil of Manitoba resembles that of the far-famed Platte Valley of Nebraska, but it is much more productive and durable. In quality of produce there is no comparison whatever. Prof. Tanner, one of the most eminent agricultural authorities of Great Britain, writes: \"Here it is that the champion soils of the world are to be found, and we may rejoice that they are located within the British empire. Take, as an illustration of their powers of fertility, the simple fact that on the Kilodonan farm near Winnipeg, on which land I saw their fiftieth crop of wheat growing\u2014crops which followed each other year after year and had maintained their full yield from first to last, without the soil losing any portion of its productive power. Year by year had the winter frost renovated that soil with fresh stores of fertility from its rich preserves, and thus the land became better prepared than ever for its work.\"\n\nThis demonstrates that Manitoba is the garden of America, and a country, with the North-West Territories added, capable of maintaining a population of millions. And yet there are over 1,150 acres of unoccupied land to each person in the province, and over 29,000 acres to every individual in the territories. As the country is rapidly being settled, however\u2014large as is this proportion\u2014in a comparatively few years it will be considerably diminished. Already the story of the progress of Manitoba is told by the census returns of 1881 and 1886, which record a marvellous advance during those five years. In '81 there were only 2,384,337 acres occupied, 250,416 cultivated, and 230,264 under crop. In five years the occupied area had increased to 4,171,224 acres, the cultivated to 751,571, and that under crop to 591,994\u2014an increase of over 79,300 and 257 per cent. respectively. In 1881, the wheat crop amounted to 1,033,623 bushels; in 1886 to 6,711,186, and in 1887 to over 14,000,000, or an average of thirty bushels to the acre\u2014a yield unprecedented in the history of the world\u2014a yield sufficiently large to supply all the wants of the province, and to leave a surplus of nearly 12,000,000 bushels for export. A comparison of the yield of grain in Manitoba and Dakota\u2014the banner wheat-producing territory of the United States\u2014will convince the unbeliever as to the superior productiveness of Canadian soil. Dakota, with a population of 135,000, had a total wheat crop of 2,830,289 bushels, while Manitoba, with a population of 110,000 (25,000 less) had more than five times that quantity. The contrast is still more striking, when it is learned that 90 per cent. of the population of Dakota is rural, while Manitoba is only 72 per cent. At the same time, and with the same population, Dakota produced only 2,217,000 bushels of oats, 227,000 bushels of barley, and 664,000 bushels of potatoes, while Manitoba, with a much smaller population and smaller percentage of farmers, raised over two and a half millions of bushels of potatoes, about two millions of barley, and over seven millions of oats.\nWe may go further, and compare the yearly yield, per acre, of Manitoba with the United States, from which the superiority of the soil of the former can be deduced. In 1880, the average yield per acre in the United States was 13.1 bushels; in '81 only 10.1; in '82, 13.6; in '83, 11.6; in '84, 13; in '85, only 10.4 bushels. In the latter year, the average yield per acre in the following States was:\u2014Oregon, 15.9; Dakota, 12.8; Wisconsin, 11.5; Iowa and Nebraska, 11.3; Minnesota, 11.1; Kansas and Indiana, 10.6; Ohio, 10.2; California, 9.4; Illinois, 8.5; Missouri, 7.4.\n\nIn the same year Manitoba's was 18.4\u2014larger than all competitors. This difference is made even more apparent in 1887, when Dakota's average had increased to 16 bushels per acre and Manitoba's to over 32 bushels. In 1887, Manitoba raised more wheat than did all the following States of the Union combined in the previous year:\u2014Massachusetts, Connecticut, Wyoming, Nevada, New Hampshire, Mississippi, Arizona, Vermont, Maine, New Mexico, South Carolina, Idaho, Delaware, Montana, Alabama, Utah, Georgia, Arkansas.\n\nIn 1887, Manitoba raised more wheat than any of the following States in 1886:\n\n| State          | Bushels |\n|----------------|---------|\n| Massachusetts   | 17,000  |\n| Connecticut     | 36,000  |\n| Wyoming         | 63,000  |\n| Nevada          | 72,000  |\n| New Hampshire   | 169,000 |\n| Mississippi     | 173,000 |\n| Arizona         | 297,000 |\n| Vermont         | 410,000 |\n| Maine           | 600,000 |\n| New Mexico      | 921,000 |\n| South Carolina  | 936,000 |\n| Idaho           | 1,039,000|\n| Delaware        | 1,177,000|\n| Montana         | 1,509,800|\n| Alabama         | 1,529,000|\n| **Manitoba**    | **14,000,000**|\n\nIn a report to the Winnipeg Board of Trade, respecting the disposal of the crop of 1887, it is shown that the acreage under wheat crop was 432,000, as per returns received by the Department of Agriculture from 350 reporters. The Board, in September, assuming that the average yield would be 28 bushels per acre, estimated the crop at 12,000,000, but within a month they decided that the crop actually reached between 13,000,000 and 14,000,000, as threshing showed the yield to be greater. This crop is accounted for as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Bushels |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Wheat exported to Eastern Canada and Europe      | 8,500,000|\n| Converted into flour in Manitoba                 | 2,800,000|\n| Used as seed, 520,000 acres                      | 1,100,000|\n| In hands of millers and shippers and of farmers for close marketing | 1,200,000|\n| **Total**                                        | **13,400,000**|\n\nTo these figures may be added an amount (equal to a sum sufficient to make a grand total of 14,000,000 bushels) to cover the wheat used as feed on farms and what is still unbushed, or at such remote points from railroads that it will not go into this year's business. The amount of actual wheat exported has been arrived at\nby careful investigation and checked by totalling the Grain Inspector's records, after allowing for all reinspected shipments. To obtain the sum total of wheat converted into flour of the 1887 crop, letters of request were mailed to each mill in the province, asking for a confidential return. Answers were promptly sent in from every mill of consequence, so that the figures stated are accurate. On the basis used by American statisticians, it requires five bushels of wheat, in flour, to feed each unit of the population. Supposing our people to number 130,000, we will consume 650,000 bushels, leaving 1,950,000 of that ground to be exported. A considerable part of our flour is shipped west to the Territories, British Columbia and Asia, and the balance to Eastern Canada.\n\nThe census of Manitoba, taken in 1886, shows that 16,000 farmers were in Manitoba that year,\u2014and it may be accepted as a fact that these farmers raised the crop of 14,000,000 bushels of wheat in 1887, having an average each of 875 bushels. With a wheat crop of 14,000,000 bushels grown on 432,000 acres, the average yield per acre was 32.4 bushels. Returns received by the Winnipeg Grain Exchange of the increased area under wheat crop of this year over last, indicate that about 20 per cent. more area has been sown, making a total for this year of 520,000 acres. It is difficult to obtain complete returns of the total amount of barley exported of the 1887 crop. About 350,000 bushels were sent east and south. The crop was very heavy on the 56,000 acres cultivated, but as heretofore, practically, no barley was exported; farmers paid scant attention to properly harvesting it, and the great bulk of what was grown was used in the province for feed. Returns show an increased acreage of from 20 per cent. to 30 per cent. over that of last year, or a total of about 70,000 acres. The export of oats, so far as can be determined, reached fully 1,000,000 bushels. The increased area under cultivation this year is not less than 10 per cent. Last year, the total acreage, according to the Government returns, was 155,176. Grain dealers report a large quantity of oats still held in the province, but the actual quantity cannot be determined.\n\n**VALUE OF EXPORTS.**\n\n| Item                          | Value     |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|\n| Wheat                         | $4,675,000|\n| Flour and bran                 | 1,250,000 |\n| Flax, and its products         | 120,000   |\n| Barley                        | 140,000   |\n| Oats and oatmeal               | 280,000   |\n| Dairy products, eggs, potatoes, vegetables, wool, hides, fish, etc. | 600,000 |\n| **Total**                     | **$7,065,000** |\n\n*Note.\u2014The value of Manitoba furs is not included in this statement.*\n\nMr. Bell, who prepared the report, gives some apt picture-lessons of facts connected with the rise and value of last season's crops:\u2014\"The estimate is made on the basis of last year's wheat crop, which was 14,000,000 bushels. A few years ago, when Red River carts were the only mode of conveyance, an average load was estimated at between 800 and 900 pounds. If we were dependent on this conveyance to-day, it would take 1,000,000 carts to carry out the crop of wheat. They would extend in a straight line 5,000,000 yards, or 2841 miles, which is practically the distance of the Canadian Pacific Railway from Vancouver to Montreal. The wheat crop would make 550,000,000 pounds of flour, and would weigh about 840,000,000 pounds. Transporting it in carloads of 650 bushels, weighing 39,000 pounds each, it would\nrequire 21,538 cars, making up a train 796,906 feet, 265,635 yards, or 151 miles in length, or it would load 466 vessels with 30,000 bushels each. Supposing a farmer's sleigh or wagon load to be one and a half tons, it would require 233,333 wagons to carry the wheat. Supposing the average distance of the farmers from market to be eight miles, in going and coming, to deliver the wheat of the province, our farmers would travel 3,733,328 miles. This wheat would feed, according to the adopted amount laid down per head of population, 2,800,000 people for one year, and would feed the present population of Manitoba for 21\u00bd years. It would seed 7,000,000 acres at two bushels to the acre, or 10,907 square miles. It would seed a mile in depth along the Grand Trunk Railway from Toronto to Montreal 33 times over, or a strip two-thirds of a mile wide around the world in this latitude. The acreage under wheat last year in Manitoba equals a strip of land two miles wide extending from Toronto to Montreal.\n\nThe best idea of Manitoba's trade can, perhaps, be learned from the excellent and comprehensive reports of Hon. J. W. Taylor, U.S. Consul, who is not only an able and efficient official, but whose long experience has made him a standard and oft-quoted authority on the Great Northwest. From the Consul's reports, it is learned that the foreign-importations of the Winnipeg district since 1880 are as follows:\n\n| Year | Dutiable | Free | Total |\n|------|----------|------|-------|\n| 1880 | $784,865 | $49,118 | $833,983 |\n| 1881 | 1,381,683 | 115,303 | 1,496,986 |\n| 1882 | 3,699,349 | 807,571 | 4,506,920 |\n| 1883 | 6,368,849 | 1,868,380 | 8,237,209 |\n| 1884 | 2,825,375 | 1,860,856 | 4,686,251 |\n| 1885 | 2,763,445 | 858,369 | 3,661,814 |\n| 1886 | 1,861,638 | 500,645 | 2,362,283 |\n| 1887 | 1,995,318 | 739,822 | 2,735,140 |\n\nThe diminution of foreign trade is the result of the opening up of interprovincial communication and the consequent expansion of Canadian trade and traffic. The declared exports from the Winnipeg Consulate for 1887 were $448,353 to the United States, against $232,109 in 1885; to Great Britain, $632,058 against $895,232\u2014the falling off being in furs, to Eastern Canada (estimated) $600,000, against $1,500,000 two years previous. The trade with British Columbia rose from almost nothing to an aggregate of $250,000, chiefly shipments of flour, oats, barley and dairy products, with an importation of lumber and fish valued at $50,000.\n\nConsular records at Winnipeg exhibit an exportation of fish\u2014the catch of Lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba\u2014amounting to 1,488,330 lbs., in 1887, with invoice value of $61,359. These shipments were made to Buffalo, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Omaha, Kansas City and Chicago.\n\nThe supplies of wheat of 1887 are placed at 10,000,000 bushels, valued at $5,200,000, against 4,530,000, valued at $2,778,000, in 1885; 2,200,000 in 1884; 1,000,000 in 1883; and 500,000 in 1882. Speaking of the yield in 1887, the Consul says:\u2014\n\n\"Such a harvest, particularly of wheat, is without precedent in the annals of American agriculture.\"\nA general statement of the trade of this Consular district is as follows:\n\n| Countries          | Imports   | Exports   | Total    |\n|--------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Eastern Canada     | $5,450,280| $6,000,000| $11,450,280|\n| United States      | 2,735,140 | 540,798   | 3,275,938 |\n| Great Britain      | 841,751   | 650,043   | 1,491,794 |\n| British Columbia   | 50,000    | 250,000   | 300,000  |\n| Japan              | 28,925    | 1,200     | 30,125   |\n| France             | 13,164    |           | 13,164   |\n| Belgium            | 8,044     |           | 8,044    |\n| Germany            | 6,516     | 170       | 6,686    |\n| Spain              | 6,202     |           | 6,202    |\n| China              | 4,813     |           | 4,813    |\n| Spanish W.

The development of the interprovincial trade is most marked\u2014increasing from $7,824,566 in '86 to $11,750,280 last year.\n\nIn the cause of education, Manitoba has set a noble example. Its system is founded on that of Ontario and is similar to that of the western states in some particulars; it follows settlement rapidly and plants a school house wherever ten school children can be found in a neighborhood within a radius of three miles, and provides for its operation by a system of government grants and municipal taxation by which the burden is equally distributed and the sparse, poor settlements aided. Great care is bestowed upon the preparation of teachers, and no licenses are given to teach, except from the provincial board. There is a normal school which teachers are compelled to attend if they continue teaching over one year, and in this way the majority of the teachers have received some training for their work. But this remark refers only to Protestant schools, and it is necessarily supplemented by the explanation that in one way the system is unique, there being complete and separate control of the management of Catholic and Protestant schools by a Catholic and Protestant board of education respectively, and a corresponding division of public funds for their aid. But this does not necessarily imply denominational or religious teaching in what are called the Protestant schools, for a visitor to one of these in the city of Winnipeg or in the rural districts would see no material departure from the\ncurriculum of studies in force in the best eastern schools. The progress made in education in the provinces has kept pace well with settlement, and every neighborhood, however small and remote, has its neat, substantial school house. In 1871, when public schools were first organized in Manitoba, there were 16 Protestant and 17 Catholic schools; in 1881 there were 128 Protestant and about 50 Catholic schools, and in 1887 the respective numbers were 522 Protestant and 70 Catholic schools. As nearly all the Catholic schools are attended by French pupils and are taught in that language, the dual system of control has worked very well so far. Manitobans justly pride themselves on the superiority of their rural schools to those of the Western states, and the pains taken to provide them with trained teachers is pointed out as the means by which this excellence is attained. Out of the 529 teachers employed in the Protestant schools in 1887, 310 are stated to have received instruction in the art of teaching at the Provincial Normal school, at which is an institution in which professional training alone is given, the academic instruction being left to the high and intermediate schools. One high school (or collegiate schools) is located at Winnipeg and the other in the city of Brandon. These schools prepare students for the provincial university and for the two higher classes of teachers' certificates. They are taught by university graduates and their curriculum of studies is as high as many of our colleges. There are intermediate schools situated in the principal towns of the province, those at Birtle, Minnedosa, Virden, Selkirk and Stonewall, being provided with two teachers each, Morden with three, Carberry and Pilot Mound being about to establish themselves on the same footing. These schools supply a link between the elementary and the high schools and prepare students for the third class teachers' examinations. The schools of the city of Winnipeg are attended by over 3,000 pupils, who are taught by fifty-one teachers, and in their accommodation and the instruction given they are on a par with the schools of any Western city. Brandon and Portage la Prairie, with 500 pupils and seven teachers, each keep well in line with their sister city and are not ready to admit any inferiority in the character of their schools.\n\nThe Manitoba University is the highest department in education in Manitoba, and is unique in its institution. The Anglican Church College of St. John, the Presbyterian College of St. John and the Catholic College of St. Boniface united in forming this university, and the medical college since came in. It was established to promote higher education in the province, and whatever colleges may hereafter be organized may join the university, the degrees being conferred on the students by the various colleges after a thorough examination by the board of professors chosen by the various colleges, as well as the provincial educational board. It is not a teaching body; it is an examining body, and confers degrees. The council of the university is composed of representatives of the different colleges, of the sections of the board of education and a certain number of graduates.\n\nGreat as has been the work accomplished in education, it has been equalled by the Christianizing influences of religion, and in Winnipeg and Manitoba\u2014as in Canada as a whole\u2014the Sabbath is observed strictly. Business is suspended, traffic ceases and divine services are held in church and chapel. The Church of Rome pioneered religion here, as so often it has elsewhere, dating back to 1818; but it was not until near the close of the fifties that any great strides were made. Then the Church of England followed, and Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, Congregational, Jew, and\nlater, the Quakers and Salvation Army helped to spread the divine teachings. Not only is Winnipeg and vicinity supplied with cathedrals and churches, but the servants of Christ have carried the Word afar off into the recesses of the North and East and West, and reclaimed from the darkness of Paganism hundreds of the heathen redmen whose forefathers, in their superstition and ignorance, \"bowed down to wood and stone.\" Winnipeg itself is, notwithstanding that, but the other day, it was a mere \"border town,\" largely peopled by church-goers, and its numerous edifices are always well filled by devout congregations.\n\nThe railway development of the province has been remarkable. In 1877, there was not a single mile of railroad completed. To-day, there are nearly twelve hundred miles, and the work of construction is being vigorously prosecuted. The Canadian Pacific, alone, has 751\u00bd miles\u2014315 of which is the trunk line, and the remainder, branches to Stonewall, Selkirk, Emerson, Deloraine, Gretna and Glenboro. The Manitoba & Northwestern, whose objective point is Prince Albert\u2014the eastern terminus being Portage la Prairie\u2014has 217 miles in operation, 26 miles being branch lines. The Red River Valley, constructed by the Local Government, is 67 miles, running from West Lynn\u00e9 to Winnipeg, and is being extended to Portage la Prairie, both lines being controlled by the Northern Pacific, which has entered into an agreement with the province to build another branch to Brandon and to the Souris coal-fields within two years. The Great Northwest Central, running from Brandon northwesterly to Battleford, has 50 miles nearly completed, and there are 40 miles of the Hudson's Bay Railway built, but not operated at present, although the promoters are confident of extending the line at an early day. This makes an aggregate of 1,170 miles. Besides this, the Southeastern, running towards the Lake of the Woods southeasterly, and connecting with Duluth, is being promoted, and may possibly be built next year.\n\nThe Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba is Hon. John C. Schultz, one of the oldest residents of the province, and who has been inseparably connected with its progress and development for many years. The Government consists of Hon. Thomas Grignonway, Premier and Minister of Agriculture; Hon. Joseph Martin, Attorney-General and Railway Commissioner; Hon. Lyman M. Jones, Treasurer; Hon. James Smart, Minister of Public Works; and Hon. James E. Prendergast, Provincial Secretary. Great attention is being paid by the Government to the agricultural and railway development of the province.\n\nTHE CITY OF WINNIPEG.\n\nIt may be truly said that Manitoba is the beginning of a vast grassy sea of virgin wealth\u2014of a boundless prairie of untold fertility. And at the outer rim of this wonderland sits, queen-like and majestic, young, but strong and lusty and prosperous\u2014outstripping all its rivals, rapidly increasing in importance\u2014an adolescent giant, whose yet untired strength is indication of a sturdy manhood. In this place, midway between the two great oceans, Winnipeg has sprung up as if by magic, as if in this latter day the genii of Aladdin's lamp had created a city in an incredibly short space of time. For sudden growth, combined with solidity, the world has never\nseen its counterpart. In fifteen years it has risen from a hamlet to a metropolis. There is no flimsiness about its buildings\u2014no mere temporary makeshifts of structures, as in many of the mushroom towns which have risen on the western wilds. The first surprise excited in a stranger on visiting Winnipeg is in its broad, paved streets, the substantiality and magnificence of the public buildings, the neatness and taste of the private residences, and the possession of all the accompaniments of metropolitan life. To-day it can, with pardonable pride, claim a development unparalleled in the history of Canada, and boast that its name, synonymous with all that is progressive and prosperous, is more widely and familiarly known in every quarter of the civilized globe than that of other cities of greater age and pretensions. The Winnipeg of to-day is far different from the Winnipeg of 1870, when, through the Riel rebellion, it was first brought prominently before the world's attention. From that date, the birth of Winnipeg may be reckoned, although it was not till a few years later that its growth was worthy of particular attention. Then it was a long, scattered settlement, with a few rudely constructed dwellings and business places, having no sidewalks, but possessing almost impassable muddy highways.\n\nMost prominent among the institutions of Winnipeg is Fort Garry\u2014now but little more than a tradition. There only remain a few scattered stones and a castellated gateway as evidences of its once proud position, but this is a utilitarian age, when the glamour of romance and the glory of bygone grandeur and power must give way to the demands and the necessities of our time. Its title to be termed a \"fort\" has, for many a year, only been a matter of courtesy, and the last vestige of its claim to be a stronghold was swept away during the boom, when the main highway which circled around its walls in the olden time was run directly through this historic spot. It is not so many years ago since cannon frowned from the ramparts of the fort\u2014not such dangerous weapons to an enemy as they must have been to those firing them off. The ramparts, long before their demolition, had outlasted their usefulness. They were more defense in appearance than in reality, and were in those days of modern warfare about as unwarlike as the old flint guns and muskets which were stored away in out-of-the-way corners of the buildings within the enclosure. But this Fort Garry\u2014now dismantled\u2014was a famous place in its day, and has a history extending far back to the era when the first adventurous white man came from the East in search of furs. It is associated with many notable events. It is the cradle of the history of the Red River country. The site of the fort is a short distance from the north banks of the Assiniboine, about 400 yards from its mouth, where it enters the Red River, where a similar structure on a smaller scale had preceded it. In 1835, the new Fort Garry was erected\u2014the largest and most substantial fort yet built. It is thus described by Mr. Alexander Ross in his work on the Red River Settlement. In his day it was \"nearly square, being about 280 feet...\"\nfrom east to west, and 240 feet from north to south, with a stone wall fifteen feet high and of considerable thickness, having two large gates on the north and south sides, and four round towers or block-houses at each corner, with port and loopholes for cannon and musketry.\" \"In the inside of the walls,\" he adds, \"is a gallery which runs around the front, and which affords a pleasant walk and an extensive view of the surrounding country. The principal dwelling-house, a large and commodious building, occupies the centre of the square, behind which and near the northern gate stand the flagstaff and the belfry. There are also houses within the walls for the accommodation of the officers and men attached to the fort, together with stores and granaries and\u2014would it were not necessary to add\u2014a gaol and courthouse for the colony. Fort Garry, although still in a terra incognita, was gradually becoming more and more the centre of activity for the little colony of Assiniboia, then flourishing in the very heart of a wilderness. Here that most patriarchal of governments, the Governor and Council of Assiniboia, met regularly and disposed of the business coming before them without indulging in any of that wire-pulling and log-rolling which seems to be a necessary concomitant of most legislative assemblies now-a-days. The councillors, with their modest allowance of ten shillings per diem\u2014it was \u00a3, s. and d. then\u2014aided without even the shadow of a shade of politics to aid them in their solemn deliberations, did famously, never occupying the time of a session by slangwhanging each other furiously. The brethren dwelt in peaceful unity. Perhaps the presence at these assemblies of a couple of bishops, an archdeacon, and sometimes a priest or so, may account to some extent for the kindly, practical nature of their deliberations\u2014so very different from the established order of things in older and (it is to be presumed) wiser communities. There were some failures in justice, but as a rule the councillors ruled the country wisely and well. The courts were presided over by men learned in the law, eloquent and admirably qualified for the position\u2014men whose names are still revered by the older residents: Thom, Johnson, Black and Burns, and their administration of justice gave general satisfaction. The court-house at Fort Garry, besides being utilized as the council chamber and palace of justice, was also used for public gatherings of all kinds\u2014religious, political or general. It was also a place of worship, and the four denominations that occupied the field here then exclusively each had the use of it in turn. The gaol, a sombre-looking building, has also its story to tell. It had been broken into twice by angry settlers with arms in their hands, and there were several gaol deliveries not in strict accordance with the several legal formalities. Later on came the still darker day of revolutionary uprising, with bloody eventualities, unhinging the feelings of cordiality and amity which had made Red River a sort of Happy Valley. It was from this fort that Scott was taken and shot just outside of the eastern wall; it was here that Louis Riel reigned and ruled in 1869-70, it was here that Wolseley made his name; it was here that the Hudson's Bay Company, with its ramifications from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from Minnesota to the far-away Northern Ramparts, had its headquarters; it was here that lived men whose names have since become household words\u2014millionaires, governors and politicians. But Fort Garry has lost all its prestige, all its simple grandeur, all its glory, and naught remains but a few scattered foundations and a crumbling gateway to tell the passing stranger that this place, now razed to the ground, was once famous, and about it were enacted nearly all the scenes that make up the early history of the country.\nIt was in 1872 that the first steps towards the incorporation of Winnipeg were taken at a public meeting held in February. Resolutions were carried affirming the desirability of incorporating the town, and the boundaries suggested were lot No. 222 on the north, Colony Creek on the west, one-half mile south of the Assiniboine on the south, and three-quarters of a mile beyond Red River on the east. The effort, however, was abortive, and the Local Legislature refused to pass the bill. In December of the same year, other meetings were held, and when the bill, which was materially altered, so as to make the limits of the town the Assiniboine on the south and the Red River on the east, was ruled put of order by the Speaker. It was at this time attempted to give the name \"Garry\" or \"Selkirk\" to the town, but it failed. An indignation mass meeting was held\u2014those were the halcyon days of mass meetings\u2014and a deputation was appointed to remonstrate with the powers that be for not permitting incorporation. The Legislature was interviewed, but the bill was thrown out, notwithstanding, and the Speaker of the House was in consequence treated to a coat of tar and feathers, so great was the feeling of indignation. The following year the subject of incorporation was once more taken up by the people, and in November, at the session of the Legislature, the bill, which had been thrown out the previous year, was passed, and Winnipeg blossomed out as a full-fledged city. It was then like the nucleus of a town, but it had the stamp of the Legislature that it was a city; and it had the people, the resources, the pluck, the energy, and the power to make itself a metropolis. The population of Winnipeg in 1870 was, exclusive of the military, only 215. About 500 were added in '71, and 700 more in the following year. In 1874 it was estimated at about 2,000. In '75 it had increased to 5,000 (3,031 being the number assessed), and there being an estimated floating population of about 2,000. In '76 the figures showed the population to be 5,522; in '77, to over 6,000; from '78 to '80 there was a steady influx of people, and in '81-'82 the population was estimated at 25,000, but this was undoubtedly an exaggerated estimate. In 1883 the records show it to have increased, and it is now about 23,000, not including the large floating or transient population. The city's population is cosmopolitan, and it includes nearly every nationality under the sun, from the highest type of European and American civilization to the pagan Indian and heathen Chinese. The residents include the most enterprising of their different countries\u2014men of purpose and determination, of perseverance, of intelligence and of public spirit, and notwithstanding the minor local differences that exist in all communities, when the welfare or interests of Winnipeg are at stake, they unite as one in its behalf.\n\nBut not only is the material progress of the city demonstrated by its ever-increasing population, the assessment rolls also conclusively tell the story of its prosperity. In 1874 the total assessment was $2,676,018; in 1875, $2,635,805; in 1876, $3,031,685; in 1887, $3,097,824; in 1878, $2,216,980; in 1879, $3,415,065; in 1880, $4,000,000; in 1881, $9,196,435: in 1882 (the boom), $30,303,270; in 1883, $33,000,000; in 1884, $30,325,000; in 1885 and 1886 still further reductions took place, although values did not depreciate. The decrease in the assessment after 1883 was owing to the fictitious boom, figures being dropped gradually to a basis approaching their actual value, and not from the apparent large depreciation in property. The present figures may be safely assumed to represent the fair value of the taxable property, but to this should be added the church, city, school, railway and\nSOUTHERN MANITOBA\u2014THE GARDEN OF THE PROVINCE\u2014The lands along the Line of the Manitoba and Southwestern R'y, leased by the Canadian Pacific, and comprised within the uncol\ngovernment properties, which are exempt from taxation, and those manufacturing industries on which the taxes are remitted by way of a bonus.\n\nThe history of the commercial progress of Winnipeg is a remarkable one, as is shown in the following facts and figures carefully gathered from reliable sources:\u2014\n\nIn 1870 there were about fifteen small mercantile institutions [of all kinds], exclusive of the Hudson Bay post, in existence, and the total number of buildings outside the fort was only twenty-eight. The manufacturing industries were confined to a small tannery and a harness shop. The imports during the year ending 30th June, 1872, amounted to $1,122,820, of which Great Britain sent $652,016; Canada, $112,104; the United States, $32,300; and France, Holland, Spain, Portugal, China and the West Indies the balance. The exports, which were chiefly furs, amounted to $85,541. Before this there was a duty of 4 per cent. on imported goods, which was collected by the Hudson Bay Company. The following fiscal year the imports amounted to $918,336, and the exports to $246,983. A gradual increase was noticeable in 1873, and in 1874 there were over 900 buildings\u2014some, of course, of not any great value\u2014in the city's limits, and over 100 business places. In 1875, the imports, not including Canadian goods, amounted to $1,248,309, and the exports to $588,958. Greater progress was made in 1876. Mercantile houses increased to over 200, a number of dwellings was erected, and two flouring mills came into existence; and in the following year the same steady pace was kept up. The amount of duties collected for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1876, was $254,045, against $171,430 in 1875, and $67,472 in 1874. In 1877 the same steady advancement in buildings was shown, many fine and costly structures being erected\u2014in all about 800; and in 1878 the city progressed even more rapidly, there being an addition of over 100 new buildings. Up to 1870, the only communication with the outer world was the cart brigade, which for years had brought the needed supplies, first from St. Paul, and then from St. Cloud, in Minnesota. One or two trips had been made by the primitively constructed stern-wheel steamers of that day, but in 1871 there was an irregular river service in summer and a stage line to Minnesota in winter. It was not till the end of 1878 that rail communication was afforded, and this gave an impetus to the growth of the city in the following year,\u2014and in the ensuing summer (1881) there were over 400 business institutions, including several wholesale houses, five banks, and a large number of manufacturing industries, which gave employment to about 600 workmen. It was in this year that the great boom in real estate set in\u2014an inflation which sent people crazy in their desire to dabble in land\u2014an era in gambling in which all, men and women, preacher and layman, rich and poor, speculated, and colossal fortunes (on paper) were made daily. The people were carried away by the excitement of the day. Men talked in \"thousands\" as glibly as they now do of \"hundreds,\" lots were quoted at fabulous sums per front foot, land in the suburbs\u2014two, three, four and five miles from the business centre\u2014was surveyed into lots, and eagerly purchased at boom figures; champagne flowed like water\u2014every one was flush. It was a fool's paradise. Gradually the excitement spread to the surrounding villages and towns, reaching as far west as Edmonton, 900 miles away. That was the limit. The second day it was on the market, realizing absurdly fictitious values, buyers began to unload. Then the reaction set in, and the bubble burst. Then everyone got down to hard pan, and, after a year or two of depression, Winnipeg commenced once more to assert itself, confidence\u2014not alto-\ngether lost\u2014was fully restored, and, in a quiet, business-like manner, the city began to prosper again on a solid foundation.\n\nThe site of the city is a very eligible one for commerce, being, as stated, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, the two principal streams of the province. Through the medium of the first, communication is had with Lake Winnipeg, and all rivers having an outlet into that large body of fresh water. These rivers and lakes give Winnipeg a system of inland navigation possessed by few other cities in either the dominion or the neighboring republic. With slight improvements to them and other connecting bodies of water, Winnipeg will become the entrep\u00f4t of probably one of the largest mercantile districts on the continent. In addition to the facilities afforded for inland navigation, railway enterprises in operation and others projected give every indication of Winnipeg becoming, very shortly, a railway centre. The city does not depend on agriculture alone, great as that is, but has the vast coal fields of the West, the auriferous deposits of the Saskatchewan and Rocky Mountains, together with mineral and forest resources of the North and East, already paying homage to the commercial shrine of the Prairie City. Being the capital of the province, it has, therefore, become the headquarters of the provincial government. The residence of the lieutenant governor, parliament house and public departments of the province are stationed here. It is besides the judicial centre of the province. The Dominion Government, too, has made this city the headquarters for locally transacting business in Manitoba and the Northwest. Among the offices located here are the customs, inland revenue, immigration, dominion lands, receiver general, crown timber, Canadian Pacific railway, fishery, Indian and post office departments. The city is not as regularly laid out as many of the new cities on the other side of the forty-ninth parallel, owing to the original owners having become possessed of their lands by measuring from the river front, thus giving various angles and breadths. The city shows this now. The part laid out by the Hudson Bay company and contiguous to old Fort Garry has been most regularly laid out at right angles, crossing Main street. Main street has scarcely a counterpart on this continent. It was laid out by the government of Assinaboia in 1835, and was originally a colonist road, extending from West Lynne on the international boundary near Pembina to Lake Winnipeg, and had an established width of 132 feet. This great highway has never been allowed to be encroached upon. It follows the windings of the river at a pretty regular distance, or rather the Indian trail. As a consequence the road is winding, and the result is that Main street is far from straight. But herein lies its beauty. For two and a half miles it has been paved with block pavement, with eighteen-foot walks at each side, with only enough rise from a perfect level to drain itself. On either side are palatial warehouses and stores, and, the architecture being so varied, the changes are certainly unique. One thinks he is coming to the end of the street, when lo! another and a finer view opens out; and this change is more than once or twice. Portage Avenue is another colonist road, extending from Main street west to Portage la Prairie, of the same width as Main street, and following the windings of the Assinaboine river. The principal residence portion of the city is south of this avenue, and is near the parliament and other public building, although Fort Rouge, as the part of the city south of the Assinaboine is called, holds its own with any part of the city for elegant residences and pleasant drives. The main street River Avenue, in this part is also paved, and\nis a favorite driving boulevard. The river banks are heavily wooded, and extend some distance from the river, and every advantage is taken of these eligible building sites.\n\nThe enterprise and energy of the press of Winnipeg is perhaps unsurpassed in the Dominion. Notwithstanding the comparatively small constituency, which necessarily limits the circulation of the different newspapers, and the great expense connected with the publication, all the journals are very creditable productions and compare more than favorably with the press of other cities of the same size. There are three dailies, the Free Press (Reform) and Call (Conservative) published in the morning, and the Sun (Independent) issued in the evening. Full telegraphic reports of the world's doings are given, and the locals columns demonstrate the activity of the ubiquitous reporter. These dailies have also weekly editions, and besides these are the Commercial, whose name indicates its mission; Siftings, (humourous), Northwest Review (Catholic), The Colonist, Northwest Farmer and several church and educational papers.\n\nWinnipeg has been fortunate in possessing energetic councils, the present one being composed of Hon. L. M. Jones, mayor; Ald. Mulvey, Baker; A. Macdonald, Riley, Calloway, Fletcher, Ryan, Hutchings, Grundy, Black, D. Macdonald and Polson (resigned).\n\nOpposite Winnipeg\u2014on the east bank of the Red River,\u2014is situated St. Boniface, which is chiefly populated by people of French extraction. Here is the fountain head of Roman Catholicism in the Northwest; the home of Archbishop Tach\u00e9, whose name is revered by Protestant and Catholic alike; the Cathedral of St. Boniface, whose bells \"on turret twain\" were immortalized by Whittier; the schools and colleges and hospitals of the catholic church. The town has a population of about 2,000; contains a number of good stores, hotels, a newspaper, etc., and is connected with Winnipeg by an iron toll bridge.\n\nSELKIRK.\n\nThe busy little town of Selkirk is situated on the banks of the Red River about twenty-two miles, in a northerly direction, and midway between the metropolis of the province of Manitoba and Lake Winnipeg. The population is between 700 and 800 souls and as they are all fired with a more than ordinary amount of ambition and are confident that some day, not far in the dim future, they are destined to become the head quarters for Manitoba and the North West, and look upon themselves as a rival to Winnipeg. It was at Selkirk the government at one time proposed to span the Red River with a bridge and make that the crossing for the C. P. R. and indeed not only was the river surveyed but a railway track was laid to the water's edge and it was proposed to commence work on the east end of the bridge. The idea was, however, abandoned and when the news reached Selkirk the dismay which the people felt was very great at getting, what they termed, the \"go by.\" Feeling that railway communication was absolutely necessary for the welfare of the town negotiations were entered into, a few years later, and completed; with the municipality of St. Andrews, whereby the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was bonused to the extent of $70,000, and a branch line was built, the driving of the last spike of which, by the Hon. Premier of the Province, Hon. John Norquay, being an event in the\nhistory of the town which will go down to coming generations. Selkirk is the lumber depot for Manitoba, its natural location at the head of deep water peculiarly fitting it for such, by giving it command of the entire Lake Winnipeg trade, which is very extensive, and is increasing by immense proportions year by year. Selkirk is also a popular summer resort and is visited each summer by large numbers of people it being unequalled for healthfulness in the province. One of its most attractive spots is the fern grove, which is studded with beautiful elm, oak and many other varieties of trees, showing that nature intended it as recreative point for those who desired to spend a pleasant holiday. The fishing industry as well as the lumber trade is also an important factor in the development of the town, upwards of sixty men being engaged in it at this point, large buildings are erected for the freezing and storing of the finny tribe, hundreds of tons of which are brought in from Lake Winnipeg by steamers and fishing smacks during the summer. Selkirk also possesses a large number of mercantile establishments of different kinds, all of which report business in a flourishing state. There are also churches of the different denominations, and a good public school.\n\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF SELKIRK.\n\nMerchants Hotel, Wm Bullock, proprietor, West Selkirk.\u2014As the social and moral qualities of men and women are rated according to the company they keep, the pretensions of a city are generally judged by the character of her hotels. Comfortable quarters and generous fare are indicative of good humor, liberality and fair dealing. A good hotel, well kept, most comfortably furnished, thoroughly ventilated and in a central locality, actually amounts to thousands of dollars to the business men of a city where such a hotel is located. All travellers use hotels for their special purpose\u2014shelter, sleeping and eating. Such a one is the Merchants' Hotel. It is not only centrally located, but enjoys a beautiful view of the Red River.\n\nThe sleeping rooms and parlors are neatly furnished and well adapted for the comfort of the guests. The table is set with the best the market and seasons afford, and is cooked in such a manner as to leave no room for other than congratulations. The bar is stocked with the best wines, liquors and cigars. None but the best and purest goods are handled.\n\nR. Bullock, Wholesale and Retail Dry Goods, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Groceries, etc., West Selkirk.\u2014The importance of Selkirk as a distributing point for the lumbering and lake ports can scarcely be overestimated, as the increasing of the annual transactions at this place abundantly demonstrates. Prominent among the leading houses in this line is that of Bullock. This business was established in 1875, being one of the oldest established houses in the country, and since its inception has enjoyed a prosperous career. The premises occupied are large and commodious, well arranged, and heavily stocked with a fine assortment of the choicest imported and domestic dry goods, including silks, linens, dress goods, hosiery, clothing, boots and shoes, staple and fancy groceries. The goods are always fresh from frequent importations. The facilities of the firm for transacting business are of an unusually complete character, enabling him to offer special advantages to customers and to fill all orders in the promptest and most satisfactory manner. Mr. Bullock has ever given his hearty support to all measures best calculated to advance Selkirk's prosperity, and is a most active and enterprising business man.\n\nR. H. Gilhuly, Druggist, West Selkirk.\u2014This is a business which is a necessity in every town and city in the country. The premises occupied are commodious, admirably arranged and equipped with every facility for the accommodation of a valuable stock, embracing a fine assortment of drugs, medicines, toilet articles, and druggists' sundries. Special attention is given to the careful compounding of physicians' prescriptions, which department is under the personal supervision of Mr. Gilhuly. He is a gentleman of vast practical experience, having been in business several years, purchasing the establishment from the former owner, Mr. Colclough, two years ago. Mr. Gilhuly is assistant postmaster for this place, and is widely known and highly esteemed in pharmaceutical circles as an energetic, clear-headed business man.\n\nG. F. Pearson, Butcher and Livery Stable, West Selkirk.\u2014Among the prominent business houses of West Selkirk, none is perhaps better known than that of G. F. Pearson, whose establishment is situated in the centre of the business portion of the town. Mr. Pearson came to this place in 1878, and through his ability and enterprise he has established himself in a business which is constantly increasing. Mr. Pearson handles none but the best of meats, and at reasonable prices. Game and vegetables are always kept on hand in season. Mr. Pearson is also proprietor of a livery stable, where parties can get good comfortable rigs at any time and at moderate rates. There is also in connection with the livery business a bus which meets all trains on both sides of the river. Mr. Pearson is known by everybody in the country, and the establishment is favorably mentioned on all hands.\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF GRETNA.\n\nE. Penner & Co., Wholesale and Retail Dry Goods, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Hardware, Groceries and Provisions, Main street, Gretna, Man.\u2014An important branch of commercial activity and one deserving of prominent mention, in this historical review of the Great Northwest leading industries, is the general merchants trade, and in this connection it is a pleasure to speak of that enterprising and successful concern of E. Penner & Co., dealers in silks, woollens, linens, hosiery, clothing, gents' furnishings, hats, caps, hardware, groceries, provisions, etc. Employment is given to twenty-eight people. The premises occupied are large and commodious, being 26 x 75 feet in size, and well adapted for the trade, situated on Main street, in the centre of the business portion of the city. The business was established some thirteen years ago at Niverville, Man. Being thoroughly conversant with the country and its future prosperity, they moved to this place in 1883, being one of the oldest firms located here, and since its inception has enjoyed a prosperous career. The members of the firm are E. Penner, Otto Schulz and H. P. Hansen. Mr. Penner is a member of the Municipal Council and treasurer of the School Board, while Mr. Schulz is Justice of the Peace. The firm have a branch at Reinland. The members of this firm are well known in commercial circles as honorable, conscientious business men, and merit the esteem and respect in which they are held.\n\nQueen's Hotel, John N. Braun, proprietor, Gretna, Man.\u2014The travelling public cannot find a better conducted or more popular hotel at which to stop in Gretna than the Queen's. The proprietor of this popular hotel came to this town about four years ago. Previous to this time Mr. Braun was proprietor of the Sherman House at Winnipeg. The Queen's is situated in the centre of the business portion of the town, and is large and commodious, being two stories in height. On the first floor is the office, bar, dining-room and sample rooms. On the second floor are the parlors and fourteen handsomely furnished sleeping rooms, all large, airy chambers. The dining-room is a very spacious one, and the table is always provided with the very best the market affords and all delicacies in season. The billiard-room is the most commodious in the town, while the bar is stocked with the best wines, liquors and cigars. A free bus and a porter meet all trains, and every assistance is rendered to guests on arrival at the station.\n\nSTONEWALL.\n\nThe village of Stonewall is so called from the plentitude of stone to be found in the neighborhood. There are three stone quarries here, two of which are being worked at the present time. The town has many monuments of the use and beauty of the stone in the homes of the inhabitants. Lumber is also to be had at a very reasonable figure, and a desire to beautify their homes on the part of the farmers is very noticeable in the surrounding country. On every side are small bluffs, which are of great use in breaking the severity of the winter winds. Good water is to be had at a distance of 30 to 40 feet. Every farm house is supplied with a stone cellar which keeps the milk cream and butter in a delicious state. Wood is plentiful and cheap. A line-kiln is in connection with the quarries, and good brick clay is found in abundance in the vicinity. The penitentiary is five miles distant, and is the centre of a thriving village which brings quite a little trade to Stonewall. There is\u2014a cheese factory, which proves a great blessing to farmer's wives, and manufactures excellent cheese; a flour mill with capacity 150 bbls. per day; 2 good hotels, 3 hardware shops, 2 blacksmith shops, 3 general stores, furniture store, butcher shop and milliner's shop which is conducted by two genial young ladies, with whom it is a pleasure to do business. The town supports a weekly paper, The Stonewall News, which contains a good epitome of the world's doings. The town is 20 miles distant from Winnipeg, being the terminus of the Stonewall branch. The train runs between the two places, every second day. It is the county town of Rockwood, and the market town of Brant, Balmoral, Grassmere and Shoal Lake. Bee-culture is becoming a favorite occupation among the residents. The population of the town is between three and four hundred. The boom of 1882 did not benefit Stonewall, but its evil effects are being rapidly and successfully swept out of existence. Two doctors prac-\ntice here and both receive encomiums from their separate admirers. With these industries at their doors, and with a Baptist, English, Methodist and Presbyterian church, two public schools with satisfactory teachers, the people of Stonewall will no doubt continue in ways of prosperity and their faces and homes will still reflect their well-known hospitality.\n\nMORDEN.\n\nThe town of Morden, which derives its name from one of the pioneer settlers of Southern Manitoba, Mr. Alvoe Morden, is situated on the Pembina branch of the Manitoba Southwestern Ry., 80 miles S.W. of Winnipeg. This busy little town sprang into existence within the last four years, and has, to-day, many costly and comfortable residences, as well as a large number of commodious places of business. Morden is situated in the heart of the Garden of Manitoba, as in every direction from it, as far as the eye can reach, are to be seen smiling fields of grain and the most valuable soils for the production of cereals and nutritious grasses, and the lands are occupied by experienced farmers from all parts of Ontario, as well as from the \"Old Sod.\" With all these advantages, the establishment of a substantial town naturally followed. The place is fully supplied with stores well stocked with goods required by a mixed community. There is also a private bank here, and there is also an excellent field for a chartered bank. A feeling of contentment beams from the countenances of all the residents, a very large number of whom are building comfortable houses, being satisfied with the choice of location they have made, and thoroughly convinced that they are settled in a portion of the country which possesses a preponderance of the natural advantages to be found in a good live community. In ecclesiastical as well as educational matters, Morden is also well supplied, having churches of four denominations, and a Salvation Army barracks. It also makes a proud boast of having one of the best schools in the province, outside of Winnipeg. To show the amount of business done here, the following statement or exports from September 1st, 1887, to Nov. 31st, 1888, are given:\n\n| Crop     | Quantity |\n|----------|----------|\n| Wheat    | 550,000 bushels |\n| Flax     | 28,000   |\n| Oats     | 5,400    |\n| Barley   | 6,250    |\n\nMorden has also one roller-process flour mill, and one grist mill, with three run of stones, two large elevators and the building of a third is in contemplation, carriage factories, pump factory, three hotels, two wholesale liquor stores, two hardware stores, a saddlery establish, cordwainer, tonsorial artists, lumber yards, machine shops and all the learned professions are well represented. The volume of business done is simply amazing and it is increasing daily, which fact cannot be wondered at when the pushing nature of the merchants is taken into consideration.\nE. Penner & Co., H.

Gordon, Wholesale and Retail Lumber, Sash, Doors, etc., Grain Buyer and Stock Dealer, office, Railway Street, Pilot Mound, Man.\u2014In a historical review of the manufacturing and business interests of the North-West, the establishment of J. T. Gordon, whose office, warehouse and yards are located on Railway Street, is deserving of special mention and a prominent position. This business was established in 1886. Mr. Gordon is one of the heavy grain buyers and shippers of live stock in this part of the country.

Among these firms is James Stewart. The business was established eight years ago, and from a small beginning has attained proportions of considerable magnitude. Eight or ten employees are now given constant employment by this concern, which enjoys the reputation of being the leading manufactory of the kind in the town. Having a thorough practical knowledge of the business and from a lengthy experience, well understanding the special requirements of this country, Mr. Stewart is able to turn out work unsurpassed in workmanship, finish and durability. He is held in high regard for his honorable business methods and sterling integrity.\nKILLARNEY.\n\nAs the old geography says of the famous Killarney of Ireland: \"many a day may be spent among the most beautiful scenery\", so do we say of its god-child\u2014the Killarney of Manitoba. Situated as it is on the shore of a beautiful lake, about four miles in length, by three quarters in breadth, with very irregular boundaries; the spot, no doubt, reminded the first settler of his dear old home across the sea. But the resemblance goes no farther than outward appearance. Southern Manitoba is acknowledged to be the garden of the North-West. It is from here that the great surplus of wheat, oats and barley come, and Killarney is situated right in the heart of this fertile belt. The Little Pembina Mountain is at no great distance, and its rolling slopes are dotted with the happy homes of the prosperous and contented farmers. The mountain and lake combined render this a great country for sport. As the duck season approaches, many eyes turn wistfully in this direction; and when the proclamation goes forth that the close season has expired, from north, south, east and west may be heard the crack, crack of the \"sportsman's engine\", and the oft repeated splash, as another victim falls, to be brought to shore by the faithful water-dog, which is always in attendance. When the shooting is good and many fowl are \"bagged\", they are shipped to Winnipeg, where some are sold to the ready customer and others are packed in ice for winter use. The South-Western skirts the town, and thus ample facilities are provided for the exportation of grain and garden produce, of which there is more than \"enough and to spare.\" The town is well supplied with general stores, in which one can find anything from a needle to an anchor\u2014no, hardly, for the hardware line is well represented and patronized as an exclusive business. The dryness of the atmosphere, combined with the delights of boating, fishing and swimming, combine to make Killarney the frequented summer resort that it is. If cheerful faces and genial hosts tend to make life worth living, in Killarney, and its adjoining homesteads these blessings may be found in abundance.\n\nPRIMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF KILLARNEY.\n\nT. J. Lawlor, Dry Goods, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Groceries, Crockery, etc., Killarney, Man.\u2014The heavy business now transacted here was founded by Mr. Lawlor in the year 1886, and as the oldest in Killarney, is worthy of special mention in this historical review. Mr. Lawlor travelled through this country years ago, when the site on which Killarney now stands was a wilderness. He foresaw, however, a bright future before the place, and no one has done more than he to help to build up Killarney as a centre for trade. Mr. Lawlor was the first person to erect a building here, and his public-spirited progressive course has met with the esteem and commendation of his fellow-citizens, while his house is to-day one of the most popular in the country. The business is most centrally located in the two-story and basement building, corner Main and Railway streets, 24x50 feet in dimensions, and handsomely fitted up in the most substantial manner. The stock is as superior as it is extensive, and has ever commanded the finest class of trade. Mr. Lawlor handles only the purest and best of every grade, and is a direct importer of the most desirable lines of dry goods, embracing dress goods, hosiery, fancy goods, linens, silks, etc., also clothing, boots and shoes, groceries and provisions. Mr. Lawlor is a progressive business man of energy and enterprise, prompt, reliable and straightforward in all his transactions with the trade and the community.\n**A. Ashdown, Hardware, Stores, Tinware, etc., Main Street, Killarney, Man.\u2014Among the leading houses in this line is that of A.

His establishment is large and commodious, and is divided into two departments, the front portion being occupied as a saleroom, while in the rear is the workshop, where all kinds of tinware is manufactured. Mr. Ashdown, besides manufacturing tinware, does roofing, spouting and general job work to order, employing none but the best workmen. The stock of hardware comprises a complete line of shelf and heavy hardware, house-furnishing goods, ranges, stoves, grates, etc., including all the most popular makes and styles, keeping desirable goods and selling at low figures. He has worked up a good established trade, to which he gives close attention. Mr. Ashdown is an enterprising and energetic business man, and enjoys the confidence and esteem of all who know him. Mr. Ashdown is agent for the Watson Manufacturing Co., handling all kinds of farming implements, Watson Deering binder, John Able steam thrasher, seeders, mowers, rakes, fanning mills, plows, etc.**\n\n**Grand Central Hotel, M. Gouldie, Proprietor, Killarney, Man.\u2014No person can have visited Killarney within the last few years and not be familiar with the name of the above house, and many a traveller in bygone years has found it an oasis in the desert of weary travel. This house is at the corner of Main and Railway streets, almost opposite the railway depot, and is thus conveniently located. The building is two stories in height, constructed with a view to solidity and comfort. On the street floor are the office, dining-room, bar, billiard hall and sample rooms; on the second floor are eighteen handsomely furnished and well-heated sleeping rooms, also large and well fitted up parlors for the accommodation of guests. The table is supplied with the best the market affords, and game in season.**\n\n**C. W. Williams, Dry Goods, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Groceries, etc., Killarney, Man.\u2014One of those representative concerns which so convincingly demonstrate Manitoba's mercantile supremacy in the Northwest is the general store of Mr. C. W. Williams, situated on Main street. The business was established at Wakopa, fourteen miles southwest of this place, in 1880, by the present proprietor. The railroad reaching Killarney in 1886, Mr. Williams moved to his present location the same year, being one of the first business houses starting here, since which time he has built up a large and lucrative trade, which extends to all parts of the surrounding country. The premises occupied are commodious and well arranged. Here will be found a heavy stock of dry goods, dress goods, hosiery, fancy goods, clothing, boots and shoes, staple and fancy groceries, etc. Mr. Williams is United States Consular Agent for this district, and is held in the highest estimation in commercial life for his many sterling qualities and strict integrity.**\n\n---\n\n**BOISSEVAIN.**\n\n\"Man hath no part in all this glorious work.\nThe Hand that built the firmament hath heaved\nAnd moved these verdant swells; sown their slopes with herbage,\nPlanted them with island groves, and hedged them round with forests.\nFitting floor for this magnificent temple of the sky,\nWith flowers whose glory and whose multitude\nRival the constellations.\"\n\nBryant's \"Prairie\" aptly describes this portion of southern Manitoba. Situated as it is in the centre of a well-settled section of country, Boissevain bids fair to become a prosperous town. The Turtle mountain is observable at the south of the town, and thus forms a diversion for the eye, which becomes habituated to a \"vast tract of level country,\" after a few years' residence in almost any other portion of Manitoba. Good hotel accommodation is procurable at any of the hotels, and plenty of room is warranted, as the Hotels will accommodate several hundred guests, and this in a country where some ten years ago a man must either carry his bed or sleep on his \"mother earth.\" Spiritual and educational matters are well provided for, there being three churches\u2014Episcopal, Presbyterian and Methodist. The public school established last November is under the efficient management of Mr. McKay. Almost every line of business is represented in Boissevain. The town is to be congratulated upon its capacious elevators and warerooms. All the free government grants have been already taken up, and only the odd-numbered sections are open for settlement. But the old adage says, \"There's luck in odd numbers.\" The first building was\nerected in 1886. During the two succeeding years, churches, schools, elevators, hotels, general stores, bookstore, bakery, etc., have all been supplied. By the way, the bakery is an innovation to the orthodox run of pioneer establishments, and will, we suppose, be a bait to some intending settler, though we must say that the person who cannot make good bread from Manitoba flour is not much of a cook. The shooting around Boissevain is good, and during the late fall and early winter a large supply of ducks, partridges, prairie chicken, rabbits and wild goose may be secured to make the lightsome change for the diet of the family.\n\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF BOISSEVAIN.\n\nA. C. McEown, Dry Goods, Fancy Goods, Fur Goods, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Groceries, etc., corner Railway and Broadway streets, Boissevain, Man.\u2014Among the enterprises which thrive and prosper in this country, that of the general store merchant must not be overlooked in a work of this character. Many are engaged in this industry, and none have been more successful in it, or are entitled to greater praise than Mr. A. C. McEown. He has been engaged in this business since 1886, at which time the title of the firm was McEown & Cockburn. Early in 1887 Mr. McEown bought out the interests of Mr. Cockburn, and by his attention to the demands of customers, his promptness and fair dealing, has succeeded in building up a patronage of which anyone might well feel proud. The premises occupied are large and commodious, and stocked with a full and complete line of dress goods, linens, woollens, clothing, fur coats, boots and shoes, groceries, provisions, etc. Mr. McEown is an enterprising, energetic and strictly reliable and upright gentleman, and esteemed by all.\n\nRyan House, C. Ryan, Proprietor, Railway street, Boissevain, Man.\u2014Boissevain has good hotels, as a rule, and there is no better conducted or more comfortable house in town than the well known and popular Ryan House, situated on Railway street, in close proximity to the railway station. The house is of large dimensions, embracing two stories in height, and is one of the best constructed hotel buildings in the country. It was recently built and has been furnished in the neatest and most comfortable manner.

Wright, Drugs, Toilet Articles, Fancy Goods, Books and Stationery, Railway street, Boissevain, Man.\u2014This very competent druggist has but recently commenced business (1886), but in a way that plainly indicates his intention of remaining in it. The premises are commodious and are complete in all details of arrangement, evincing in every part the taste and culture of the proprietor. The establishment contains a full and complete stock of pure drugs, chemicals, toilet articles, books and stationery. Mr. Wright is a thoroughly educated pharmacist, and devotes special attention to the careful preparation of family recipes and physicians' prescriptions.

Mr. Wright possesses that thorough knowledge of his business which is so indispensable to accurate and reliable druggists.\n\nA. McKnight, Dry Goods, Boots and Shoes, Clothing, Groceries, etc., Railway Street, Boissevain, Man.\u2014Since the commencement of this business in 1885 its increase has been a subject of public notice, as indicating good and effective management on the part of the proprietor and the excellent quality of goods furnished. Mr. McKnight exhibits to customers a fine stock of goods, embracing a large and complete assortment of the best qualities of dry goods, clothing, boots and shoes, groceries, etc. The goods are all new and fresh, an important matter to customers.

The activity and high character of the proprietor must tend to an early enlargement of his now prosperous business. Mr. McKnight is postmaster at this place, the post-office being located in the above store.\n\nQueen's Hotel, J. W. Kinttel, Proprietor, Railway Street, Boissevain, Man.\u2014This establishment is one of the most recent additions to the hotel accommodations of this town, and although a new house, it is conducted by an old hotel man of many years' experience. It is located on Railway street, in close proximity to the railway station, a two-story frame building erected specially for the purpose, and while it is conveniently located in the business centre of the town, its arrangements are of the most perfect description. On the street floor is the office, dining-room, sample rooms, bar and billiard room, while on the second floor are the parlors and twelve handsomely-furnished and well-heated sleeping-rooms. The dining-room is spacious, while the table is furnished with the best in the market. Game in season. The bar is stocked with the choicest and best brands of wines, liquors and cigars. Mr. Kinttel is a genial, considerate host, and very popular throughout the country. Livery and feed stable in connection with the house.\nDELORAINE.\n\nThe town of Deloraine, which is the terminus of the Canadian Pacific South-western Railway, is destined to eclipse, both in size and prosperity, any other town in that portion of the province. The village of old Deloraine was founded in 1881, when Messrs. Cavers & Steuart opened up a general store there, and at that time there were scarcely any settlers in the district, but soon after they came pouring in, and by 1882, it had increased to such a size, that a large flour mill was erected by Sheppard Bros., which, notwithstanding the fact that it was nearly seventy miles from a railroad, did a very large gristing business. Old Deloraine possessed also the Dominion Lands Office, registry office, Methodist and Presbyterian churches, a lawyer, doctor, general store, and many private houses. When the railway was extended into the village in the fall of 1886, it gave birth to quite a little boom, and there were many very extensive sales of land made to intending settlers; a large number of carpenters and others engaged in the building business were engaged during the entire winter putting up new structures, while the old town, with the exception of Sheppard Bros.' mill and McTavish's hotel, was moved up bodily to its present location. The railroad service at this time was nothing like it is at the present day, and could not bring in lumber fast enough to supply the demands, and it was no uncommon sight to see a string of teams on the trails from Brandon and Boissevain hauling in building material, even long after the railway track had been laid. Wheat came pouring in, and many of the farmers, who had emigrated from the east but shortly before in anything but a good financial position, immediately woke up to a pleasant realization of the fact that they had reached the land which, it might truthfully be said, \"flowed with milk and honey.\" At the present time, Deloraine has no fewer than five first-class hotels, five implement firms, one weekly newspaper, about twenty-five stores, boarding-houses, three or four lumber-yards, and six firms are engaged in the grain business. It also possesses good public schools, without which institutions no town is complete; there is also a bank there. Cordwood can be purchased at $2.50 per cord, and those who know, say Deloraine is an excellent spot for some enterprising man to start a roller flour mill with a capacity of 100 to 180 barrels. The district tributary to Deloraine extends for thirty miles north, near Plum Creek, to the boundary line, and from about ten miles eastward as far as the Souris coal fields in the west. Several seams of coal have already been discovered in the Turtle Mountain district. There is abundant evidence on all sides that the country in the Turtle Mountain and Souris districts is underlaid by rich coal deposits, in proof of which it is only necessary to refer to the now well known Souris coal fields, situated about eighty miles west of Deloraine; the coal discovered on many farms in Turtle Mountain, and the recent discovery of natural gas just across the boundary line, on the Manitoba road. Deloraine suffered for some time, on account of the limited supply of water, and to inefficient postal communication with the country north, but these grievances have been remedied by the Government, a large artesian well having been bored, and stages placed on the different routes. If the state of religion and education is any indication of the welfare of a town, Deloraine has abundant reason to congratulate itself on its present prosperity and future prospects. The residents of the village and vicinity are of a very sociable turn, and there is no lack of amusements, there being a large hall in which entertainments and\npublic meetings are held. The soil in the district is of a phenomenally fertile nature, and the settlers may be ranked among the thriftiest that ever came to Manitoba, as a peep at their different farms during the busy season will convince anyone who may doubt the statement.\n\nAt the boundary are the \"Four Corners\"\u2014Emerson, West Lynne, Pembina and St. Vincent\u2014the two latter being on American soil. Emerson at one time boasted of a population of about 3,000, but latterly it has dwindled down probably one half. It is, however, recovering from the severe blow it received during the boom, and a thriving trade is done; the town possessing several good stores, excellent hotels, two newspapers, churches, schools, etc. West Lynne, formerly Hudson's Bay trading post, developed into a town rapidly, and as quickly sunk into a deserted village, presenting the appearance of severe dilapidation expressed by the phrase \"rack and ruin.\" With the construction of the Red River Valley Railway, however, West Lynne will probably regain some of its former prosperity.\n\nThere are several other villages worthy of extended mention\u2014Dominion city, a thriving place on the Emerson branch, 56 miles from Winnipeg and ten from Emerson; Holland and Glenboro on the Manitoba South Western, Pilot Mound, where a \"knob\" rises up from the level prairie, Gretna, a thriving village on the boundary, twenty miles west of Red River, Morris, almost mid-way between the boundary and Winnipeg, Oak Lake, on the C. P. R., 33 miles west of Brandon, and other places of lesser importance; but which have aspirations of becoming thriving western \"cities.\"\n\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF DELORAIN.\n\nCavers & Stuart, Dry Goods, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Groceries, Provisions, Crockery, etc., corner Broadway and Railway avenue, Deloraine, Man.\u2014This is the oldest general store in this part of the country, having been established as far back as 1882, at what is called the old town, before there was any Railway communication with this part of the Northwest.

It is situated on the corner of Railway and Broadway streets, directly opposite the Railway station and is, consequently, in the town's very centre. The Revere House is a modern structure, having been opened first in the winter of 1886 by its present proprietor.

It is in the centre of a well-developed and prosperous farming region, the country all around it being checkered with fields of grain and dotted far into the distance with farm houses and numerous grain stacks, and not only is it surrounded by an excellent agricultural district, but it possesses within its limits natural advantages which must, ere long, make it one of the leading manufacturing places of Manitoba. As well as being a prospective railway centre, it has excellent water power, and building material is plentiful and cheap, the timber growing around there being of an exceedingly superior grade. During the boom of 1880-82, Portage lots were sold in all parts of the Dominion and brought very high prices, and a large number of excellent residences were erected. The town suffered seriously from the effects of the inflation of the boom, and afterwards went into bankruptcy, but is now recovering and on the highway to prosperity. It possesses excellent hotels, two good newspapers, churches, schools, and is the county town of the central judicial district of the province. Historically, Portage la Prairie is very interesting, and with it is connected many leading events of the pioneer days. It was originally inhabited by Indians, who portaged from Lake Manitoba down the Assiniboine. In 1863, the fort known as Fort La Seine was established, by some of the pioneer travellers and traders, on the shore of Lake Manitoba, about twenty miles from the present town site. Towards the close of the seventeenth century, the Roman Catholics established a mission on a high piece of land, fifteen acres in extent, partly surrounded by the river, which has since changed its course and left its bed, to be an offensive slough. Researches, made many years ago, show that about half an acre gave evidence of having been once inhabited by civilized beings. On it were found pits, which might have been used for cellars, and there were also other evidences which led to this conclusion. Half a mile distant, on the bank of the river, is the old Indian cemetery. Part of it was washed away by the river some years ago, and human skulls and other remains have been exposed; In later years, forts were erected by the Hudson's Bay Company, and its rival, the Northwest Fur Company, both of which carried on a thriving trade with the red man. The name,\nPortage la Prairie, had its origin in the route of transportation that was followed in by-gone days in trading northward. In the early days, freight on the Assiniboine had to be carried from there through Manitoba and the Northwest. In 1859-60, Portage la Prairie was selected as a suitable settlement by Archdeacon Cochrane, who succeeded, after some difficulty, in purchasing from the Solteaus, for a small consideration in goods, a large tract of land, divided into narrow strips and running back two miles. The earliest settlers, after the Indians, were their brothers, the Metis. In 1865, a church and parsonage was erected. In 1861, an Ontario emigrant, John McLean, pitched his tent here, and found a settlement of about 200 half-breeds within a few miles of the place. He was not given a very warm reception by the Metis and Indians, who did not care for the advent of the white man, but he stayed and purchased a piece of land for $50, which, twenty years afterwards, he sold for $30,000. The first settler established here was John Garrison. The Hudson's Bay Company established a regular trading post in 1861, and Mr. House followed with a store and a hotel. During the trouble of 1869-70, by which time the settlement had become a village with about fifty Ontario farmers, it was greatly excited. They were Loyalists to a man, and a number of them paid the penalty of their patriotism by being incarcerated within the walls of Fort Garry. The town progressed slowly until 1871, when a steam flour mill and several stores were started, and the Presbyterians established a mission. Then postal facilities were afforded, and a semi-weekly mail organized between Portage and Winnipeg. Previous to the rebellion, Portage la Prairie was the capitol of the republic of Assiniboia, under the presidency of Thomas Spence, with whom the Imperial authorities had a long correspondence. The republic was short-lived. In 1872 the population was about 300; in 1881 it was about 1,000, and in 1883, 4,000, which number dwindled down again about one-half. Portage la Prairie possesses excellent schools, four churches, and a large number of well-filled stores,\u2014and its large grain elevators and flour mills, its busy streets and substantial houses tell their own story. From here a new railway, the Manitoba & Northwestern, reaches away 200 miles to the northwest, making more land accessible (if more be needed) and bringing down grain and cattle, and, before long, to bring down petroleum, etc. That the future of Portage is bright, but faintly expresses what it is to be.\nProminent Business Houses of Portage la Prairie.\n\nT. & W. Miller, Hardware, Tinware, etc., Saskatchewan Avenue, Portage la Prairie, Man.\u2014Prominent among the extensive business establishments which have given Manitoba its supremacy of the North-west, is that of T. & W.

The Church of England has a place of worship, and the Presbyterians have lately erected a new church and secured a very efficient pastor in the person of the Rev. David Anderson, a graduate of Manitoba College, and for some time a member of Knox College, Edinburgh, Scotland. The residents of Carberry and the adjoining country also enjoy the blessing of a good school. The country to the north, known as the Big Plains, needs no \"gush\" to recommend it. Actions speak louder than words, and last year, half a million bushels of grain were marketed in Carberry, and this is a country where mixed farming prevails. Perhaps the secret of this success is that the settlers of ten years ago are the residents of today; people who take pride in their homes, and think that they at last have found the pot on earth \"where mortals weep no more.\" The grist-mill is a great convenience to the farmer, and does a brisk business. This season already it has handled 223,700 bushels of grain. Its chief market is Winnipeg, but during this year it has made shipments to Montreal, Victoria, B.C.; Antwerp, London, Eng., Japan and China. There is a large sheep ranch in the vicinity, which is a very prosperous enterprise. The cost of keeping the sheep during the winter has been very light, and a good price has been obtained for the lambs and rams from prospective sheep-raisers in other parts of the province. Driving is the chief pastime in the holiday season, and the dry, level, smooth road renders this a great pleasure. Carberry has five hundred inhabitants, and boasts of three general merchant stores, two good hotels, two hardware stores, one merchant tailor, one carriage manufactory, one jewellery store, two drug stores, one furniture store, one harness store, one boot and shoe store, one millinery, two butchers, two livery stables, one lumber-yard, three grain elevators, three churches (Methodist, Presbyterian and English), one flour-mill with 11 set of rollers, capacity 200 barrels per day.\n\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF CARBERRY.\n\nM. A. Henderson, General Merchant, Main-street, Carberry, Man.\u2014Every business venture that evinces in its conduct genuine enterprise and energy, is entitled to due consideration in a work of this character. A well located, well arranged general store is of especial interest to the people, inspiring them, as it does, with confidence that they will be furnished with choice goods and fresh articles for family consumption. The establishment of M. A. Henderson is pre-eminently one of this class. This business was started in 1885, with ample capital, and the proprietor, being a live and energetic man, thoroughly acquainted with his business and its requirements, soon obtained a good paying and growing business. His location is one of the best in the town, and he has for his customers the best class of citizens. His business is carried on with untiring diligence and excellent management. The stock is full and complete, embracing dry goods, clothing, boots and shoes, gents' furnishings, hats and caps, crockery and glassware, and the freshest and choicest quality of groceries to be found in the market; his prices are as reasonable as any first-class establishment in the town, and he is always prepared to fill any order from the town or country. Mr. Henderson is well known as a business man, and enjoys a high reputation as a straightforward and honorable dealer, and to this fact is due the flourishing trade he has built up.\n\nN. Dickie, Notary Public, Conveyancer, Insurance,\nLoan and Real Estate Office, Carberry, Man.\u2014Among the best known and popular firms engaged in this line in the town, may be mentioned that of N. Dickie, insurance, loan and real estate offices, than whom no one in Carberry has been more fortunate in establishing and maintaining a high reputation for upright and honorable dealing, and few enjoy a larger measure of public favor, well deserved. This business was established several years ago and has grown into large proportions. Mr. Dickie represents the following companies, viz.: Trust and Loan Co., London and Ontario Loan Co., Manitoba Mortgage and Investment Co., Credit Foncier Loan Co. and Commercial Union Fire Insurance Co. These companies are of the highest reputation and solidity, being among the most substantial companies represented in this country. These are companies which have stood the test of time and are too widely known in the commercial world to need description here. Mr. Dickie's facilities for transacting business are of an unusually complete character, enabling him to offer special advantages to patrons. He also transacts a general real estate business and negotiates loans. The close attention devoted to the interests of all persons entrusting business to his charge, his strict integrity and honorable methods, and the uniform satisfaction rendered to his patrons, has enabled Mr. Dickie to build up the large and prosperous patronage he now enjoys.\n\nDufferin House, A. McKenzie, Proprietor, Carberry, Man.\u2014The Dufferin House is conveniently located, corner of Main and Railway streets, in close proximity to the railway station and within a minutes walk of any of the leading business houses of the town. It is a fine two storey building and constructed with an eye to outward appearances as well as inner comforts. On the street floor are located the office, dining-room, bar and sample rooms, on the second floor are the parlors and sixteen handsomely furnished sleeping rooms. The house is furnished throughout entirely with only a desire to secure the comforts of the guests. The present proprietor of the Dufferin House well how to cater for the wants of the travelling public, and has already made a good record in his present-house. He aims to make his hotel a home for guests, and as a family house it is probably unsurpassed by any in this section of the country. There is also a good livery and feed stable in connection with this house, where a turnout can be had any time at moderate rates.\n\nALONG THE M. & N.W. RAILWAY.\n\nThe Manitoba & Northwestern Railway, starting at Portage la Prairie and running north-west, passes through a varied and extremely fertile country. This road has a large and fast increasing traffic, and is now becoming widely known as a well-managed and paying line, running through a country exceedingly rich in varied products. Its chief stockholders are the Messrs. Allan, of the familiar steamship line, Mr. Andrew Allan being president, Mr. F. H. Brydges, of Winnipeg, vice-president; Mr. W. R. Baker, of Portage la Prairie, General Superintendent; and Mr. A. F. Eden, Land Commissioner, Winnipeg. Westerners know these gentlemen as active workers for their own and country's interests, attentive to its wants and those of the people settling along the line, and whose welfare is made a personal matter. This line forms the band and buckle of the Fertile Belt, crossing it from south-east to north-west, and though at present its eastern connection is with the C. P. R., yet it is destined for wide life. Its present length with branches is over two hundred miles, and it is now stretching out its western end for the Prince Albert country and the Saskatchewan Valley.\n\nThe stations and distances from Winnipeg are here given:\u2014Portage la Prairie, 56 miles; Macdonald, 66; Westbourne, 73; Woodside, 83; Gladstone, 91; Midway, 99; Arden, 108; Neepawn, 117; Bridge Creek, 126; Minnedosa, 135; Rapid City (via S. & W.), 150; Basswood, 145; Newdale, 153; Strathclair, 162; Shoal Lake, 171; Kelloe, 179; Solsgirth, 186; Birtle, 195; Fox Warren, 202; Binscarth, 212; Russell (on branch line), 223; Harrowby, 225; Langenburg, 237.\n\nAfter leaving Portage la Prairie, the railway runs through Westbourne, Woodside and Gladstone. The district is well settled, but a great deal of good land is still open for homesteading. Lake Manitoba forms the eastern boundary, and in this lake, fish are very plentiful and the fish industry has now assumed large proportions, but as yet only partially developed, there being now ten main fishing stations. At the south end, pike and pickerel are the most plentiful varieties, while\nat Fairford and the narrows, white-fish entirely are caught, and at Lake St. Martins one of the finest whitefish spawning beds is found, the whitefish from Lake Winnipeg ascending the Little Saskatchewan for that purpose. There are two other important spawning grounds, viz., at Water Hen Lake and Swan Lake, inlets of Winnipegosis. The opening of the Manitoba & Northwestern railway with proper protection to the fishing industry will give a fresh impetus, and lift it to one of our most important resources. There are about a dozen principal traders in the business in this district, employing about 100 boats, and about 1,200 gill nets, the whole worth about $25,000, the catch last year amounting to about 900,000 pounds.\n\nThe town of Gladstone is a place of some importance, with a population of 300. It supports a newspaper, the Gladstone Age. It has English, Presbyterian and Methodist churches, a public school, grist mill, two grain storehouses, general stores and hotels.\n\nBeyond Gladstone are Midway and Arden stations. The character of the neighboring country is rolling prairie, well wooded, and there is a good quantity of hay and some very good grain-growing land in the district. Some gravel ridges run in a northerly direction across the township. Mekiw in township has become celebrated for its vegetables and farm produce. A visit to the district will demonstrate to any practical agriculturist the stock-raising capabilities. In every part of the municipality may be found hay of good quality, the townships to the north being almost entirely devoted to cattle.\n\nNeepawa is situated in an excellent grain growing district. The municipality of which it is the centre, is well watered by the White Mud River, well wooded and has good hay lands. The town itself is beautifully situated, and the traveller by train forms a very high opinion of it as viewed from the station. The population is about 400, and gradually increasing. There are several general stores, a drug and stationary store, furniture shop, good hotels, an excellent public school and Methodist, Episcopal and Presbyterian churches. The Salvation Army have erected barracks here. The town is a first class market for produce. Three grain warehouses are situated at the station, and in 1888, it is expected that a roller flour mill and elevator will be built at that point. At present Hamilton's grist mill is turning out a good sample of flour. A weekly newspaper, the Neepawa Register, is published here. The White Mud River, a stream of good water, traverses the northerly tier of sections. Besides the churches in the town there is an English church and a Presbyterian church in Tp. 14, Rge. 19.\n\nAdjoining Neepawa is the municipality of Rosedale with Bridge Creek Station on the southwest corner, and Neepawa as its market town. Rosedale contains three post offices and four school houses. The southern portion of the municipality is well settled. The northern portion runs through the Riding Mountain up to and beyond Lake Dauphin. The soil ranges from sandy to black loam with clay subsoil. Township sixteen is situated at the eastern base of the Riding Mountain, taking in a considerable portion of the mountain in the northwest, heavily wooded with large maple and poplar, fit for all building purposes, with large grey willow and a few tamarac and stunted oak. These woods are make almost impenetrable by wild hop, ivy and grape vines, raspberry bushes, etc. The township generally, is covered with a dense growth of hazel, willow, rosebush and cherry. Vetches abound. It is well watered by many small brooks, affording the best of water, which can also be obtained almost anywhere with very little digging.\nThe next station is Minnedosa, called \"the Beautiful,\" from its charming situation. It is situated in the valley of the Little Saskatchewan, and presents a most picturesque appearance to the approaching traveller as the train winds down the hillside. This is the county town, has about 800 population, has two saw mills, one flour mill, with a capacity of 100 barrels per day (Hungarian roller process); Episcopal, Presbyterian and Methodist churches and public school, two elevators, with a capacity of 80,000 bushels; telegraph and post office. The Minnedosa Tribune is published every week. The town is well supplied with butchers, bakers and general stores, and a brewery. The Dominion Lands Office for the Little Saskatchewan District is stationed here, and the Government have erected an immigrant house. The Saskatchewan & Western Railway starts from this point, and runs to Rapid City. Minnedosa was the terminal point of the Manitoba & Northwestern Railway during the winter of 1884-85, and derived great benefit from that circumstance, taking away a considerable share of the trade of the northwest portion of the province, which had previously gone to Brandon on the Canadian Pacific Railway. It was also the chief supply depot, for a long time afterwards, while the railway was being constructed westward. The town, unfortunately, bonused the railway beyond a proper figure, and, as a consequence, has been somewhat crippled since. An investigation is shortly to be held in regard to its financial position. The inhabitants are, however, a pushing and go-ahead people, and will doubtless come out all right. The country surrounding the town is equally well adapted for mixed husbandry or for grain-raising, and offers good inducements to settlers. Minnedosa is one of the most important towns west of Portage la Prairie, and its relative importance will probably remain as a possession, for it has advantages which will cause it to go on prospering with the filling up of the country around.\n\nClanwilliam is situated about five miles from Minnedosa, north of the railway. The region is well watered and well wooded, and the southern portion is well settled. The northern is being rapidly settled by Scandinavians. The road to the Lake Dauphin country passes through the centre of the municipality. At Scandinavia, there is a saw mill which is turning out good lumber. There are three post offices and three school houses in the municipality, and a Presbyterian church and English church. Petroleum has recently been bored for and found in the Lake Dauphin district, and promises to be very valuable. The country is generally well drained, naturally, by shallow coulees or depressions, and one feature is the number of living springs of good water. Otter lake is quite a water stretch, and receives the Rolling River.\n\nLeaving Minnedosa and going down on the Saskatchewan and Western Railway Rapid City is reached. It is a town of about 500 people, and has a good school, several stores and hotels, and is a good market for grain. There is a first-class grist mill with elevator, a cheese factory and a woollen mill in the town. The newspapers are published weekly. This municipality contains five post offices and seven school houses, and is a well settled district. It is well known for its sheep-raising and grain-growing qualities, and the land in this district will soon become valuable. The Little Saskatchewan River, flowing through it, has a rapid current and is well adapted for mill sites. Fish are plentiful in its waters. The valley of the river is about one mile in width, enclosed by hills nearly 100 feet high. The Saskatchewan & Western Railways runs down the valley. The soil is largely a rich, black, sandy loam, ten to twenty inches deep, on clay subsoil. These lands will no doubt be much sought after. There are several small lakes, also two of considerable sizes. The country\nfrom Rapid City to Minnedosa is a succession of beautiful valleys and prairie openings, where many a comfortable home is seen and Rolston's Valley, about half way, is a typical vale of charm and fertility.\n\nOn the N. & N. W. beyond Minnedosa are Newdale and Strathclair, each of them the centre of good agricultural districts and doing quite a shipping trade. There are two general stores in each and fairly good hotels; also a school house on each, in which religious services are held on Sundays. The character of the country is undulating prairie. At Strathclair there is a Hudson's Bay Company's post and a saw and grist mill. The Little Saskatchewan runs a short distance from the station. The Riding Mountains to the North take their rise from the river and are heavily timbered. The hills rise from 150 to 200 feet.\n\nShoal Lake is the next station. It is situated on the banks of a beautiful sheet of water and is a flourishing town. It has been completely built up since the advent of the railway, the old settlement of the name having been at the south end of the lake, and was in the early days the headquarters of a large detachment of mounted police. This place promises to become a favorite resort on account of boating, fishing, shooting, picturesque scenery and an atmosphere as healthy as any in the world. On the lake shore, about half a mile from the town, a cheese factory is situated and is doing a good business. Shoal Lake has three general stores, one of which is the Hudson's Bay store, a tin and hardware establishment, a drug store, two blacksmith shops, a pump factory, five hotels, a law office, two places of worship and a public school, an excellent and successful cheese factory, a wagon shop, three machine agencies, two grain buyers, and a very fine roller-process flour-mill of a capacity of one hundred and twenty-five barrels. The mill is at present so busy that it work eighteen hours a day. In connection with the mill there is an elevator of 20,000 bushels capacity.\n\nBeyond Shoal Lake is Kellise station, at which some shipping is done; and further west, on the bank of the Bird Tail creek, is Solsgirth, a settlement of considerable importance with two stores, two hotels, a public hall and several residences.\n\nThe railway runs through the centre of Birtle municipality, a district long and favorably known. The town of Birtle is situated in the valley of the Bird Tail, and rivals Minnedosa in the beauty of the site. It was founded in 1879 by J. H. Wood, of Woodstock, Ont., and the town, as well as the surrounding district, is occupied largely by people from the counties of Oxford and Perth. Birtle is the county town for Shoal Lake and Russell counties. Its population is about 500. It has several general stores, book and stationery store, two doctors, tin and hardware store, furniture shop, two bakeries, grist-mill, telegraph and express office, several hotels, livery stables, Episcopal, Presbyterian and Methodist churches, and a public school. The building for the latter is of stone and cost $8,000. The British Observer is published here weekly. The Dominion Lands office for the Birtle district is stationed here, and the Government has built an immigration house. This rising young town is nearly 200 miles north-west of Winnipeg. It lies in a beautiful valley sloping to the Bird Tail, down which spruce and tamarac timber of excellent quality is floated from the Riding Mountains, thirty to forty miles distant. The chief dependence is agriculture, a district of from forty to sixty miles north and south being tributary to the town, and containing a thousand farmers or over. The river affords several good water-powers, and the Birtle grist-mill is run by a forty-horse power Leffel wheel, and works up about 350 bushels daily on three run of stones, being kept steadily busy,\nand having a plentiful supply of wheat. There is also a saw, shingle and lath mill, with a daily cutting capacity of about 10,000 feet, used locally, and selling from $16 to $30 a thousand. The town has lately raised $10,000 for improvements. Town lots sell from $100 to $500 from 25 to 50 feet wide by 100 deep. It has the county official buildings, and has four resident clergymen.\n\nThis municipality contains six post offices and nine school-houses, and is well settled. The Bird Tail Creek runs from north to south, and the district generally is well wooded and well watered. The farmers of the district will average six years of settlement, and are chiefly engaged in mixed farming. They are of the best class, are chiefly from Ontario, with a few English people, and a Scotch colony included. There are three large and fine farms, the Binscarth, the Sharman and Power, each of 3,000 acres, and having large herds of pure bred splendid horned stock.\n\nThe next district is Russell, in the county of Russell, with the railway through the south-east corner, the stations of Binscarth and Harrowby within its boundaries. From Binscarth a branch line runs to Russell, in the northern portion of the municipality. Binscarth is a thriving village, and contains good stores, hotels, etc., school and post office. Binscarth farm is situated on Silver Creek, about four miles north of this village. Operations on the farm were practically commenced in 1883, and during that season some 500 acres were brought under cultivation, and the following buildings erected:\u2014Bank barn, 50ft. by 250ft., standing on the edge of the valley and capable of accommodating over 200 head of cattle, besides storing 300 tons of hay and from 8,000 to 10,000 bushels of grain; bank barn, 40 by 50; pigery, 16 by 48; implement shed and sheep-house, 30 by 90; carpenter shop, 16 by 20; storehouse, 14 by 18; blacksmith\u2019s shop, 16 by 20; store and hotel, one building, 40 by 50, with addition, 16 by 24; farm-house, 20 by 30; hall, 24 by 42, in which services are held on Sundays.\n\nRussell village is on the terminus of the branch railroad from Binscarth, has good stores, hotel, school, etc., and is becoming a good market point for the surrounding country. Dr. Barnardo\u2019s Home for Boys is about three miles west of this point. The Home is a training school for boys, where they will be taught farming in all its branches, and enabled to start making their own living. The boys are carefully selected and tested in England, and upon finishing their education in Manitoba, will receive thirty acres of land, and thirty more if they deserve it. Fitting premises have been built, and a most capable manager chosen in Mr. A. E. Struthers, formerly of the Canadian Pacific Railway. A cheese factory will be established, and it is in contemplation to build a cannery, to utilize the fruits which the country so freely produces. Other lads will go out as farm servants, if they like, or they will be free to take up a homestead of Government land. This new development of Dr. Barnardo\u2019s philanthropy appears to contain the elements of success, and certainly deserves to be well supported.\n\nBeyond Russell, and off the line of railway, is Shellmouth, pleasantly and beautifully situated at the side of the river, in the valley of the Assiniboine, where a swing bridge, costing over $13,000, crosses the river. The village possesses a store, school, hotels and post office, with mail communication twice each week. Great numbers of cattle, horses and sheep are raised and grazed in the vicinity. Assissippi is very picturesquely situated in the valley of the Shell River, and enjoys unrivalled advantages in respect to water power, already utilized for gristing and sawing purposes. The roller process flour mill has a capacity of 50 barrels daily.\nThe main line of the M. & N. W. R. proceeds westward from Binscarth. Langenburg has for the past year or two been the western terminus of the road, but this year, about twenty miles of track are being laid beyond this station. At Langenburg, a comfortable house for the free reception of immigrants has been erected by the railway company. There are good stores at this point, and the district is fast becoming settled. The soil ranges from a dark loose loam to a light sandy one; mixed farming can be carried on profitably, pretty generally, grass and hay meadows being common and bearing rich varied grasses, much of it four and five feet high. In some places there are numbers of large stones of various sizes upon the lower lying lands. The timber is balm of gilead, poplar, oak, maple, birch, a few pines and large willow. Some of the trees are from twelve to eighteen inches diameter, and would supply good lumber, and there is also plenty of wood in most sections to furnish fencing and fuel.\n\nThe continuation of the M. & N. W. Railway will probably be from Langenburg to Yorkton, thence along the north branch of the White Land River, thence to the Pasquia Hills, and direct to Prince Albert.\n\nThe country between Langenburg and Yorkton is slightly undulating and of generally good soil, well suited for grain and cattle raising, and of pretty much the same character as that we have already passed over. Numerous bluffs of poplar and willow, and abundant ponds of water vary the scenery and afford shelter, feed, and fencing for the settler.\n\nYorkton district extends from townships 22 to 30, ranges 1 to 6 west of second initial meridian. The railway is projected to run through this district. It contains five post offices, and is being rapidly settled up, and is well watered by the White Sand River and tributaries, and Leach, Crescent and Devil's Lakes. It is well wooded, and the soil is of excellent quality. The Commercial colony is situated in townships 23 and 24, range 1, principally Scotchmen. The rest of the district is fairly settled by the York Farmers and Crescent Lake colonies. Yorkton village is situated on the White Sand River, section 13, township 26, range 4, and contains a grist mill, store, hotel, etc.\n\nBRANDON.\n\nThe province of Manitoba can boast of no more promising, or at present, thriving city than Brandon, which is one of the many wonderful creations growing out of the wonderfully rapid development of the Canadian North-West. Brandon is the second largest city in Manitoba and is located on the main line of the C. P. R. at the crossing of the Assiniboine, 132 miles west of Winnipeg, and though but a few years of age, is making gigantic strides in the direction of prosperity. It is a peculiarly favoured district and the great number of settlers who homesteaded in the early days still occupy the land as early as 1879-80, Ontario and English immigrants poured in. The great fertility of the soil in the region upon which these pioneers settled speaks volumes for their intelligence, and leaves no doubt in the mind that they understood what farming meant ere they immigrated. The splendid farms and dwellings, good school houses and churches, give the country around the city a long settled appearance and their lands cannot be purchased for less than from $10 to $20 an acre. Out of one hundred townships lying adjacent to the city of Brandon, contain-\nMASONIC HALL, BRANDON.\ning nearly 280,000 acres, or about 33 per cent of that area of land was under cultivation during last season, and the quantity of cultivated land has been largely increased this year. Brandon also possesses a large grain storage capacity, the different mills elevators, and warehouses with a capacity of over 200,000 bushels. The grain market presents just after harvest a very animated scene and there is great competition in the purchase and sale of the products of the soil, the different dealers throughout the province being represented. The citizens of Brandon take a vast amount of pride in their fine city, and are more than confident of its future, relying on the unrivalled position, superior advantages and steady growth of the place in every direction and line of business. Another great advantage to the city and its surroundings is the fact that the Provincial Experimental Farm is situated just north of the river, being selected by Prof. Saunders, of Ottawa, as the most eligible in the province. This is evidence beyond dispute that nature has done her share to make Brandon the home of a prosperous and contented community. The chief requisite in such a site was a diversity of soil and other producing capabilities that every possible product of the province may be tested to the best advantage and that the Brandon section has these in such a marked degree is the best assurance an intending settler can expect to have in seeking for himself a future home. Besides knowing in locating in this vicinity that this section has these advantages, he is also assured he can at leisure have ocular demonstration of how successful farming is accomplished, by watching the result of experiments on the Provincial farm, and this without any expense in travelling, and the information that can be thus easily obtained must in the future be greatly advantageous to him. Another advantage which Brandon possesses is its extensive transport facilities, and the assurance that these will be very largely augmented in the near future. Here is soil of the richest kind, producing in more than abundance, crops of every kind, well watered, and close to a market; good roads, and, in fact, everything to make a desirable location for the largely over-populated countries of the world, and those who wish to go into stock-raising, should visit this section and see some of the mammoth stock farms of the best blooded cattle, and be convinced that the Brandon situation has no equal in this whole region. For dairying, it is also unsurpassed, and here capitalists can find profitable investment for money.\n\nBrandon takes a live interest in its public schools, and is determined to be second to no city in the province in the matter of education. There are five primary schools, and a collegiate department doing work of a higher kind, including the preparation of students for matriculation in Arts and Medicine and for the passing of Teachers' Examinations. Though at present the school building is not such as might be desired, steps are being taken to secure ample and proper accommodation for all the pupils. A resident inspector has lately been appointed, and this will tend to secure even better results than in the past. Brandon is also possessed of a fine convent, the teaching in which is highly commended by the citizens. Brandon is the seat of justice for the western judicial district. The court house and gaol are situated on a beautiful spot a short distance from the business portion of the city. These institutions are the best managed and neatest of the kind to be found in the province. Fortunately, crime is not very prevalent in the district, and the capacity of the gaol is never overtaxed. Criminal and civil assizes are held twice a year, in March and October, presided over by one of the judges of the Court of Queen's Bench. The county judge is Hon. D. M. Walker, who is resident in the city. The legal and\nmedical professions are well represented here by men of more than ordinary ability. A recent return of the census commissioner shows the population to be slightly over 3000. The civic officials are:\u2014Mayor: A. C. Fraser. Aldermen: A. Kelly and James Russell, Ward 1; T. T. Atkinson and T. Kelly, Ward 2; N. J. Halpin and D. McKelvie, Ward 3; James Paisley and G. R. Caldwell, Ward 4. City Clerk: John C. Kean. Treasurer: D. M. McMillen. Chief of Police: P. C. Duncan. Brandon has a board of trade, which holds monthly meetings. The executive is\u2014President: J. C. Robinson. Vice-President: E. B. Smith. Secretary-Treasurer: C. A. Larkin.\n\nIn 1887, 875,000 bushels of wheat were marketed, besides a very large quantity of oats, barley, flax, etc.; and the present year's crop is now, beyond all question, sure to be incomparably heavier than that of the previous year, as well as being of a superior grade. It is also estimated that at least 650,000 bushels of 1887 wheat was not sold, which speaks volumes for the success which has attended the labors of the farmers, they being in such a good financial position as to be able to carry this amount over for a year. Among the business institutions of the city may be mentioned the following:\u2014One flour and oatmeal mill, which was built in 1881, and has flour capacity of 160 barrels per day and fifty barrels of oatmeal (this institution possesses all the latest improvements in machinery for the performance of the work which it does, in the shape of steam power, roller process, etc., and is kept running constantly night and day); one machine shop, one planing mill, one brewing manufactory of ales and porter, two wholesale grocery houses, two banks, four large grain elevators; good hotels; eleven general stores and dry-goods, eight grocery stores, four stove and tinware stores, three hardware stores, five lumber yards, three merchant tailors, two carriage and blacksmith shops, six livery, sale and boarding stables, five restaurants, one stationery store, two jewelry stores, two furniture stores, three wholesale liquor stores, three boot and shoe stores, three drug stores, two harness stores, three millinery stores, two pump manufactories, three flour and feed stores, two photographic studios, two paint and decorative stores; coal and wood yards; one pork-packing establishment, three butcher shops, one employment bureau, three newspapers\u2014Sun, Times, and Mail. There are also a number of real estate offices, which report business very brisk, many sales having been made during the present season of farm properties. Brandon is also to be the terminus of the Northwest Central Railway, which is to run through many hundred miles of the best portions of the Northwest Territories,\u2014and in opening up, as it will, this vast agricultural country, the results must be beneficial to this point, and already good results are being felt in a very tangible form.\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF BRANDON.\n\nSomerville & Co., Dry Goods, Clothing, Gent's Furnishings, etc., and Fur Goods, Rosser Ave., between Ninth and Tenth Streets, Brandon, Man.\u2014The popular establishment of Somerville & Co. ranks among the leading enterprises of the kind in the entire city, and merits liberal mention in this work. No house in any part of the city offers greater inducements to the purchasers than this, and no establishment in Brandon is more widely known or enjoys a better trade. The popularity of the firm is due to the liberal policy and prompt business habits of the proprietors, and the courteous and cordial manner in which every one visiting their store is treated by themselves and their employees, as well as the general excellence of their stock and the complete and choice assortment that is at all times displayed, and the low and popular prices at which their goods are sold. The house was established in 1885, and with their energy, enterprise and active business habits has largely increased.

This house was founded in 1881 by the present manager, Wm. M. Rose, who is thoroughly conversant with every detail of the business, and has obtained a liberal and influential patronage.

There is probably no man in the city who so thoroughly understands the retail trade of this section as Mr. Story. We know that none enjoy a larger portion of it than does this gentleman. In his store-room will be found a full and complete stock of stoves, ranges, heaters, tin and copper ware of all descriptions. Mr. Story makes a specialty of repair work; none but first-class workmen are employed. Buying and selling for cash, he is prepared to compete with any similar establishment here or elsewhere.

He possesses not only the confidence of our business men, but also that of his customers, to which may in fact be ascribed his success. Mr. Story makes a specialty of putting in heaters and furnaces for heating buildings with hot air or steam, also ventilators.\n\nGrand View Hotel, A. F. Boisseau, Proprietor, Brandon, Man.\u2014This is one of the leading hotels in Manitoba, in all that pertains to a strictly first-class house. Constructed within the past few years\u2014being built in 1882\u2014it has achieved a position in the consideration of the public that ranks it equal to any contemporaneous establishment in Canada, reflecting credit upon the enterprise that designed it and the ability that conducts it.

In everything that pertains to the comfort and well-being of its guests, this house is unequalled. In the matter of sumptuous, elegant furniture, heating and ventilating arrangements, spacious ordinaries, airy hallways, prompt and polite attention, with confessedly the best menu in this section, the popularity and reputation of the Grand View, in the light of these advantages, is not surprising. The building fronts on both Pacific Avenue and 9th Street, directly opposite the C.P.R.

The Grand View is officered, from host down, by considerate, genial gentlemen, never neglecting the comfort of guests, but always promoting their ease and enjoyment, adding to the esteem they richly merit and possess of the public.\n\nBrandon Flour and Oatmeal Mills, Brandon, Man.\u2014Among the great and most needed industries of the Great Northwest is our flour and oatmeal mills, and we take great pleasure in mentioning the Brandon Flour and Oatmeal Mills. The mill contains the newest and most improved patent machinery for converting the grain as it comes from the thresher into the purest flour and oatmeal. The flour and oatmeal have already established itself for its excellence, and it requires the full capacity of the mill (flour 160, oatmeal 50, barrels per day) to meet the demand which its superiority has created. Messrs. W. M. Alexander, A. Kelly, J. S. Maxwell and D. N. Russell, the proprietors, are to be congratulated on the fact that they have, within the short space of a few years, so managed the mill that its products are in as great demand as those of older and longer established repute. The elevator attached to the mill has a capacity of 34,000 bushels, while the new elevator at the railway track has a capacity of 38,000 bushels of grain, making a total carrying capacity of 72,000 bushels of grain.\n\nFraser Bros., Dry Goods, Clothing, Gents' Furnishings, Groceries, etc., Rossar avenue, corner 10th street, Brandon, Man.\u2014The first in rank and in point of prominence is the retail dry goods trade of this city. This trade, considered as a branch of commerce, is the most important of any now existing within the city limits. It controls an immense amount of capital, employs a small army of people, and distributes a greater amount of commodities than any other branch of mercantile pursuits. Our dry goods houses are among the handsomest edifices of the city, that of Fraser Bros. taking special rank\u2014the Maude building. A cursory glance through its various departments is hardly sufficient to give a correct idea of their contents and the seemingly endless variety there displayed. Here one sees articles composed of cotton, wool, silk and flax, foreign and domestic goods. Here the eye rests on silks, cloths, cashmere, satins, Kerseys, tweeds, tickings, checks, plaids, alpacas, ginghams, prints, muslins, drills, and every variety and pattern of dress goods, together with endless designs of laces, bonnet trimmings, ribbons, braids, and numerous manufactures assimilating in character.

Attention is properly directed to those firms, to whose energy and enterprise may be ascribed the vitality that has characterized this business. The firm of Forbes & Stirrett may properly be assigned a first place among such firms, on account of their extensive operations and the superior excellence of their productions. This well known firm was founded in 1886. They manufacture every description of sashes, doors, frames, blinds, shutters, mouldings and inside and outside finish. The planing mill is supplied with the latest and most approved machinery for the various purposes required, saws, moulding, planing and matching machines, and all the appliances and inventions of the present day.

Kelly, Livers, Feed and Sale Stable, 9th street, Brandon, Man.\u2014If there is one thing for which Brandon is noted more than another, it is the number and excellence of the livery stables of the city. It is always remarked by strangers that Brandon has, in proportion to its size, a greater number of speedy horses than any other city in the Dominion, and the excellence of the animals kept at the livery has been the subject of favorable comment. One of the largest jivery stables in Manitoba is that conducted by Mr. T. E. Kelly, of this place. It is a most complete establishment in every particular, and will rank among the best of the kind in the Dominion. The main building is 48x100 feet and the annex is 40x50 feet in size, and affords ample accommodation for 100 head of horses.

That it is an institution which has filled a long felt want in this city has been evidenced during its career since its inception, 1886. Success has attended it from the very start, and its business is now of large proportions and constantly increasing. Messrs. Dickinson and Murry have been residents of Brandon for the past five years, and have during that time made a host of friends and acquaintances in the city and surrounding country who largely patronize their establishment. The firm's long experience in the grocery business enables them to offer special advantages to customers, as they know where to buy the best goods at the lowest rates, and are thus able to give their patrons the benefit of their experience. They also make a specialty of keeping only the best qualities and freshest lines of goods in stock, while they also import the best makes of canned goods, biscuits, also teas, coffees, spices, etc., and a fine assorted stock of crockery, glassware, etc. Mr. John Dickinson originally started business here in 1881, being one of the pioneer merchants of Brandon.\n\nTom Booth, Restaurant, Confectionery and Tobaccos, Rosser avenue, between 9th and 10th streets, Brandon, Man.\u2014One of the oldest established restaurants in the city is that kept by Mr. Tom Booth on Rosser avenue. Mr. Booth has been in business here since 1886. When he began business his capital was small, but by careful attention to business, and having thorough knowledge of how to run a restaurant, he has prospered rapidly, and his business has grown with the development and advance of the city. Success in this line of trade can only be gained by those who properly understand its many details, and the result is that Mr. Booth's establishment remains solid, prosperous and popular. He deals extensively in confectionery, and has always in stock everything in that line, from the common kind of candy to the choicest delicacies manufactured.

A clear and well established example of this is afforded by the history of this widely and favorably known house, which has become one of the business landmarks of the city. They carry a very large and complete stock of choice family groceries, coffees, teas, sugars, syrups, spices, fish, soaps, fruits, woodenware, canned goods, goods in glass, cigars, tobaccos, pipes, etc.\u2014in fact, every article usually found in a first-class, well regulated establishment of this description.

Cassels, brokers and dealers in confectionery. Theirs is the leading establishment in this section, and mentorously enjoy the patronage of the best class of citizens. The store they occupy is in a prominent business locality. They opened here in 1886, coming from Portage La Prairie, where they still own and run an establishment of this kind. Since the start here they have received a very encouraging support. They started with moderate capital, which their energy, industry and practical ability soon increased, and secured them a steadily growing trade. They carry a stock embracing every desirable article, fresh and pure, in their line, for family consumption. They produce and furnish to their large custom, from select flour, the choicest bread, cakes, rolls, crackers, etc., in the market, and besides giving them credit for keeping one of the best and most attractive stores in the city, we are satisfied that they possess the proper business qualifications, tact and energy to succeed.

This business was established nearly two years ago, and, like all concerns intimately connected with the grain trade during that period, has prospered greatly, and is constantly increasing its proportions. They transact a wholesale and retail business in the choicest brands of family flour, also oats, baled hay, chops, mill feed, produce of all kinds, etc., and deliver to all parts of the city. Messrs.

Although but started in this line in the spring of 1887, both gentlemen have been engaged in business in the city since its commencement. The new firm have by close application and push succeeded in building up a fine and prosperous trade, and the community in which they reside, as well as those with whom they have done business, speak well of their integrity and ability. Their present building not being commodious enough for the amount of business done, they have determined to add largely to its capacity this ensuing spring. Their facilities for buying and selling the above goods are unsurpassed, as they either purchase direct from manufacturers or dealers, thereby saving any commission to middlemen. They have a number of horses\u2014all reliable, speedy animals\u2014and a full line of carriages, barouches, phaetons, buggies, etc., for hire and sale.

A. Reesor, Watches, Jewelry and Silverware, Rosser Avenue, between 3rd and 9th streets, Brandon, Man.\u2014The prominence which has been given to the trade in articles of adornment for the person, as well as of elegant objects of virtue for household use and display, in this city in the past few years is something remarkable. Any merchant or manufacturer who can produce something that will please the eye and at the same time render it of use to his fellow citizen, is a public benefactor. This is true in any branch of business, but more especially in the jewelry business. Mr. Reesor, the gentleman whose name heads this article, comes often under the head of a public benefactor. He has been the means of laying before the citizens and the surrounding section of the country, some of the most elegant works of art in clocks, watches, diamonds, silverware and jewelry that the eye has delightfully rested on, and he has met with corresponding reward. This business was established by the present proprietor in 1882, and from its inception it has steadily grown until at the present time he has a large and prosperous trade.\n\nMeumeyer & Pares, Brandon Brewery, Brewers of Ales and Porter, Brandon, Man.\u2014The reputation of Brandon beer is growing and extending into every quarter that our commerce is known in, and at present the malt liquors made in Brandon take precedence in every place where introduced. The qualities for which Brandon ales and porter is most distinguished are purity, brilliancy of color, richness of flavor, and non-liability to deterioration in this climate; qualities, the result of excellent water, intelligent care and experience of our brewers, conjoined to the use of apparatus possessing all the best modern improvements, made in this country and elsewhere, and the superior standard of both quantity and quality of the ingredients used. The process of making this highly popular healthful beverage is most interesting, but space precludes its admission here. The business was established in 1885, the present firm coming into possession in 1887. The senior member of the present firm was one of the original founders of this establishment. The firm comprise Mr. J. Meumeyer and W. H. Pares. So universal are the good qualities of this famous ale and porter, especially for purity and such health-giving and preserving qualities they possess, that there is scarce a family, no matter how temperate, that has not at some time experienced its pleasant and beneficial effects. Messrs. Meumeyer & Pares, who are the sole proprietors, have reason to congratulate themselves upon the fact that they have at last found an article that they can recommend to their patrons for its pure and healthy qualities.\n\nW. G. Evans, Livery, Feed and Sale Stable, 11th street, Brandon, Man.\u2014There is no livery stable proprietor in Brandon more generally or more favorably known than Mr. G. W. Evans, whose stables are located on 11th street. This establishment is so well known that any extended reference to it must appear unnecessary. The business was originally started by F. Torrance, in 1882, Mr. Evans coming into possession in 1885, and has ever since done a large and prosperous trade. His premises are of large dimensions and have accommodation for 48 horses. Mr. Evans does a livery, feed and sale business, and has some fine horses in his barn at the present time, while his stock of buggies, cutters, etc., is unsurpassed by any other establishment. Indeed, if you want a stylish and fine appearing rig, this is the place to secure it, and at most reasonable prices. The livery business transacted by Mr. Evans amounts to a very large sum annually, and is constantly on the increase. He is well known and highly esteemed, being one of the most popular men in this business in the city, and his honorable, straightforward business methods have gained for him the confidence and regard of all.\n\nJ. C. Cameron, Carriage Manufacturing and Blacksmithing, 12th street, Brandon, Man.\u2014This gentleman is located on 12th street, where he carries on business in horse-shoeing, general blacksmithing, wagon, carriage and sleigh building and repairing. He attends to all kinds of repair work, and the excellence of his workmanship is attested by the large and constantly increasing patronage bestowed upon his establishment. Mr. Cameron has none but thoroughly experienced and strictly first-class horse-shoers, a fact which those who own valuable horses can thoroughly appreciate. He has gained a high reputation in this respect for superior work, shoes being made to order, and horses shod as may be desired. His establishment in this business here dates from 1881, since which time he has built up a valuable trade, which is steadily increasing. He is himself a practical mechanic of many years experience, personally superintending all work done on his premises, and with his evidently good commercial ability and enterprise, added to his mechanical skill, bids fair to advance to a front rank among the manufacturers of this city.\nTrotter & Trotter, Livery, Feed and Sale Stable, South 6th street, Brandon, Man.\u2014This is one of the finest livery, boarding and sale stables in Brandon. It was built in 1883, and contains every modern improvement. The interior arrangements are perfect, no expense having been spared in equipping it with every convenience and facility. On the ground floor is located the carriage repository, office, and fitted up with stalls affording ample accommodation for 100 head of horses. The ventilation and sanitary arrangements are perfect, and the welfare of the stock is carefully attended to by experienced grooms. Messrs. B. Trotter and A. Trotter, the proprietors, have some of the finest and most stylish equipages to be seen in Brandon, and a stock of the thoroughbred driving horses, which can be hired for business or pleasure, day or night, on moderate terms. They take horsefairs board, and on sale, and their facilities for the care of the same are of a strictly first-class character. They are active competitors for legitimate business, energetic, honorable and fair in all dealings, and are very popular throughout the city. They make a speciality of buying and selling horses, handling about the largest stock of horses in this country. They have a large supply of horses continually arriving from all points of Canada, United States and Northwest, for sale, and upon receipt of telegram or letter, horses will be met at the stock yards or railway depots. All horses using the stables have the privilege of training on the race course, which is one of the best tracks in the province. Correspondence invited with all who have horses to buy or sell, as well as importers and exporters of horses. They have also a first-class hotel adjoining the stables, which has been built especially for farmers and horsemen.\n\nJ. Laplont, Shaving and Hairdressing Parlor, Rosser Avenue, between 9th and 10th streets, Brandon, Man.\u2014There is nothing that a man more delights to find than a place where he can obtain a good shave, and this great desideratum is found in this city at the above mentioned number. Mr. Laplont is one of the pioneer men of Brandon, coming here in 1881, and by energy and a thorough knowledge of business he has built up a large and prosperous business. He is a man who, believing in the prosperity of this country, has made several important investments, not as a speculator, but with the intention of improving with the country. Mr. Laplont is owner of a good business block on Rosser Avenue, a fine residence, and is also possessor of one of the finest farms in the country. He is doing a large and prosperous business, which is the just reward of his energy, push and enterprise.\n\nVIRDEN.\n\nVirden is the county town of Dennis, and lays a just claim to being one of the most flourishing towns in the province. It is located on the main line of the C. P. R., 182 miles west of Winnipeg, and it is unlike many other towns in that it does not owe its existence to the boom 1881-2, never became, as may be termed, the prey of real estate speculation, being born after the boom subsided, and its trade has been of legitimate growth, and everything that has been put in the town has remained there for its own welfare. The population is over 500 permanents resident, the floating population being very small. There are six general stores and the stocks in all lines, kept for intending settlers, are such as experience teaches them will fill all their requirements. There are situated here two elevators with a combined capacity for 8,000 bushels, and a third one is being erected, the capacity of which will be 30,000 bushels, and will be provided with all the latest roller-process machinery which will turn out 125 barrels a day; though it was at first thought this would be too large, it has just been discovered that the requirements of to-day are such as to demand a great deal more capacity in every way, and arrangements are in process of completion for the erection of a mill with double the capacity of the last mentioned, and which will be completed in time to receive the present season's crop. In fact it can truthfully be said of Virden that it possesses all the requirements for a modern town. There are several churches here and a good public school; and also a good cheese factory which turns out an excellent quality of the material, and for which there is great demand in the east to which no less than 60 tons were shipped last fall. Virden also has a pork curing establishment, which though only run on a small scale at present, will in a short time be considerably enlarged so as to cope with the demands of the country around for hams, bacon, etc. Geologists say that the aspect of the surrounding county is most favourable to the discovery of coal,\nand without doubt, workable seams will be found ere long. Limestone is also to be found here in abundance, and hard building stone also. No less than 700,000 bushels of wheat passed through the elevators here last winter, as well as a large quantity of barley and oats. There is plenty of water here, and with all these natural advantages, Virden is bound to become the first manufacturing centre and distributing point of Western Manitoba. Virden has 6 general stores, 4 hotels, 2 hardware shops, 2 drug stores, 2 lumber yards, harness shop, furniture store, carriage manufactory, millinery store and a bank. Limestone is abundant, and hard building stone can be procured in quantities. The public school is built of native stone, and is noted for its architectural beauty.\n\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF VIRDEN.\n\nVirden Roller Flour Mill, Koester, Craig & Co., proprietors, Virden, Man.\u2014The flour trade of Canada has attained such magnitude that it now forms one of the most important factors in Canadian industrial and financial circles, and has enlisted in every branch of business the best trained talent of the commercial world. One of the leading and most influential concerns engaged in the milling business is the Virden Roller Flouring Mill, of which Messrs. Koester, Craig & Co. are the proprietors. This company is too widely known in commercial circles to need extended mention here. Suffice it to say that its facilities and connections are absolutely unequalled, and they have gone on developing a steady, high-class trade, until they have attained proportions of the greatest magnitude. The mill is substantially built, having a capacity of 100 bbls. per day, which is now run to its fullest capacity. The motive power is furnished by a 65 horse-power engine, and the machinery is unsurpassed for perfection of design and utility by that of any similar establishment in Manitoba. They buy nothing but first-class wheat, which they are ready to purchase at all times at highest market prices. These mills are a credit to the country, and among its representative establishments and deserving of all the commendation we can give.\n\nVirden House, Elliott & Trumbell, proprietors, Virden, Man.\u2014The travelling public cannot find a better conducted or more popular hotel at which to stop in Virden than the Virden House. The building is one of the largest devoted to the hotel business in the town. It is two stories in height, and all the rooms are large and commodious. In addition to the parlor, there are eighteen sleeping rooms in the house, all large, airy rooms, and all neatly furnished. The dining-room is a very spacious one, and the table is always provided with the very best the market affords, and all delicacies in season. The bar is stocked with the best foreign and domestic wines, liquors and cigars in the market. More genial or considerate hosts than Messrs. W. Elliott and R. E. Trumbell it would be hard to find, and they are justly popular with the travelling public and the residents of the town and country.\n\nELKHORN.\n\nThis thriving little town, 196 miles west of Winnipeg, although of recent birth, already possesses over 200 inhabitants, and boasts of three general stores, a grain elevator, three hotels, a lumber yard, a blacksmith shop, and there are good openings for a flouring mill, hardware store, harness shop, and other industries. The village has an excellent school, and an Episcopal church and a Presbyterian church. Located in a section famed for the fertility of its soil, and with the best water on the line of railway, Elkhorn offers superior inducements to the settler and business man. The site is an eligible one in every respect, and, with its apparent advantages, doubtless Elkhorn will take a front rank amongst the rising towns of Manitoba.\nGeo. H. Rowsell, Dry Goods, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Groceries, Hardware, etc., Richhill Avenue, Elkhorn, Man.\u2014Of those engaged in the general store trade in this town, it is entirely safe to assert that none occupy a position more entitled to consideration in a work of this description than that of Geo. H. Rowsell, both with reference to high standard, upon which its operations are conducted, and the extent of business transacted. This business was established in 1889 at Beulah, a town some twenty-five miles north of this place, he being one of the first merchants to venture in this far west. In 1887 he moved to his present quarters in this town, but he still retains his business at Beulah. This house has always been a favorite one, appropriating its share of the trade transacted in this country. The facilities, so far as regards the premises occupied, for the successful operation of the business, are all that could be desired. He carries a full and complete line of dry goods, clothing, boots and shoes, groceries, hardware, stoves, paints, oils, harness, crockery, furniture, sewing machines, coal, etc., etc. Cordially commending this house to the public, and it may be properly added that, ranking among the first, the establishment of Mr. Geo. H. Rowsell is of that class which commands the respect of the trade and the consideration of the community at large. Mr. Rowsell sustains an excellent reputation for honorable dealing and strict integrity, and he well merits the esteem and respect in which he is held. He makes a speciality of farmers' produce; also is agent for the Canada Northwest Railway Co., and Commissioner. Mr. Rowsell is proprietor of the mail and stage line running from here to Beulah and Birtle, making the round trip twice a week.\n\nWilliam M. Cushing, General Merchant, Loan and Fire Insurance Agent, Rich Hill avenue, Elkhorn, Man.\u2014Among the best known and most deservedly successful merchants in this town Mr. Cushing is prominent. He commenced business here in 1884, and since that time he has persevered with an energy and determination that could not fail to command success. He occupies a handsome two story building, fitted up and furnished with an especial view to the requirements of a first-class general store. Energy and a thorough adaptation to, and a knowledge of, his business has secured him a liberal patronage among the best class of citizens, and a steady and gradual increase in trade has been the gratifying result. His storeroom is stocked with a full and complete assortment of foreign and domestic dry goods, clothing, boots and shoes, and a full line of fresh and pure groceries. His stock, which he keeps in excellent order and condition, and he is almost daily receiving fresh goods, thus keeping it thoroughly replenished with the freshest and best class of articles. Mr. Cushing is also agent for the Canadian Permanent Trust and Loan Co. and the Commercial Union Fire Insurance Co., two of the best companies in the country. Mr. Cushing has established an enviable business reputation and is justly entitled to the high position in which he is held by the community at large.\n\nCavanagh Hotel, T. D. Cavanagh, Proprietor, Richhill avenue, Elkhorn, Man.\u2014In a review of Elkhorn as a commercial centre, there is, perhaps, no line of houses more appropriate for special mention or affording more interest to those engaged in all branches of business who are called on to visit the town than the accommodations for the travelling public. In this regard, this town will be found capable of maintaining a reputation equal to any other of the same size in the possession of hostleries unsurpassed in their appointments and the excellence of their management. In support of these assertions it is only necessary to refer to the Cavanagh Hotel, this being the leading hotel of the town, thoroughly fitted up and arranged for the comfort and convenience of guests. It is centrally located and contains sixteen sleeping rooms, all large and well furnished, while the dining-room is spacious and the table is at all times supplied with the best the market affords. Mr. Cavanagh is a host highly appreciated and esteemed by the travelling public and the community at large.\n\nW J. Dixon, Livery, Feed and Sale Stable, Elkhorn, Man.\u2014Few men in the livery business are more widely or favorably known than Mr. W J. Dixon. He gives his undivided attention to the business in all its branches, having a capacity for stabling forty head of stock\u2014clean, comfortable stalls. He keeps several horses for his business, all of the best description and character, and everything about the establishment is kept in the most perfect order. His success and prosperity is due to the prompt and careful manner of doing business, his care of all matters entrusted to him, and his upright and honorable dealings. His stock is noted for its speed and good appearance, his carriages and buggies for neatness, beauty and comfort, and his charges are moderate. This is the largest livery barn in this part of the country. Parties availing themselves of the good offices of this firm can feel confident of being provided with safe and reliable teams and outfits.\nTHE GREAT NORTH-WEST.\n\nA land illimitable and with illimitable possibilities is the North-West Territories of Canada\u2014the Great Lone Land of the Past, the Great Home Land of the Future. It is a land whose wide extent is almost beyond the ordinary conception of man, whose magnitude can scarcely be comprehended, and fullness of whose resources, now only in the early stage of development, are hardly conceivable. Its broad plains, traversed by noble rivers and purling streams, which find outlets in lakes of magnificent proportions, have risen from the ocean depths in which they were submerged ages ago; to be, the stamping ground of the aborigines and the bison, and\u2014these rapidly receding and vanishing before the advance of civilization\u2014then to become the great granary of the world. The metamorphosis is gradually taking place, and the Indian, once wild and savage, has substituted the spade for the scalping-knife, and left the warpath for the farm; while the noble monarchs of the plains, under whose tread the very earth quivered, have almost utterly passed away, until now only insignificantly small straggling remnants of scattered bands remain, with \"buffalo runs\" and trails to tell of the vast hordes of animals which once blackened the prairies with their presence, and furnished food, raiment, fuel and habitation for the Cree and the Blackfoot, and their dusky half-brother, the Metis. The North-West of to-day is a wonderful contrast to what it was even ten years ago. Villages and towns now dot the plains, tilled farms, with their neat home-like dwellings, and large fields of waving golden grain, enhance the beauty of the landscape, and relieve it of its monotony; then it was merely an abiding place for the nomadic savage. Young in years, as we count time, the North-West has an unwritten history of the deepest interest, handed down from generation to generation in the legends of the Red Man, whose traditions take one back to the early ages of Mother Earth. There is no country on the face of God's footstool that is without the story of the flood, and while many widely differ in minor details, they all point to and prove, if proof were needed of the active occurrence of that great Biblical event. Nay, more, according to the traditions of these untutored Indians, the central location of the drowning of earth was in the ancient homes of their ancestors. Nor would it be difficult, from Indian tradition, to show that the original Garden of Eden existed in the North-West; but while Canadians are not eager to establish this pretension, they are anxious to demonstrate that its destiny is to be the Garden of Eden of the future.\n\nHow were these great plains formed? After the disappearance of the waters that engulfed them in the long ago, according to geologists, they were covered with dense forests, which were destroyed by fire, and, denuded of the trees, were converted into prairies. \"Whatever may have been,\" writes Dr. Selwyn, \"the effect of those disastrous conflagrations on this region from a hygometric point of view, it is beyond doubt that at different epochs, nearly every superficial mile of the region comprised between the Red River and the Rocky Mountains has been subjected to the action of fire, and that hundreds of square miles of forests have been thus converted into prairies nearly stripped of trees.\" Dr. Dawson, another member of the geological staff, has stated the same fact respecting the valley of the Peace River. \"Whatever may be,\" he says, \"the theory adopted, or that anyone has been able to propose, as an explanation of the origin of the great prairies of the western part of America situated more to the south, the origin of the Peace River prairies is suffi-\nciently evident. There cannot be a doubt that they have been produced and are preserved by fires. In its nature, this is a forest country, and the young trees grow rapidly in places where the fire has not passed for several years. These fires it is reasonable to think, are the work of men, and it is clear that before it was inhabited by the savages, this country was everywhere covered with dense forests.\n\nThat the origin of the prairie zones actually existing goes back to a distant date, is clearly demonstrated by the appearance of these prairies, especially by the fact that they are everywhere in furrows, cut by the old paths representing the tracks of the buffaloes, and also by the fact that in all favorable localities are found hollows of saucer-like form, in which the buffaloes have lain and taken their sport.\n\nIn the primitive state, this region was probably covered with large and tall forests of conifers, principally spruce, with, in some places, dwarf pines, aspens and poplars. These forests having been destroyed by fire, a second growth, principally of aspens, but containing in some places much birch, and everywhere a certain proportion of conifers, generally spruce, replaced the primitive forest. The aspen being a tree which does not live long, while the spruce attains a great age and large dimensions when let alone, the natural course of time would bring back the restoration of the ancient forests of spruce. The natural vegetation of these prairies is truly marvelous; it indicates not only the fertility of the soil, but also the existence of a sufficient quantity of humidity and of rain.\n\nThe prairies of the United States were largely formed, owing to the extreme aridity of the soil, great areas being covered with saline deposits, and to the excessive dryness of the atmosphere. These combined, prevented the growth of wood, which found neither in the soil nor in the climate that degree of humidity requisite to start and develop it. Vastly different, as has been stated, is the origin of the rich prairies of the Canadian Northwest, whose existence is caused neither by barrenness of soil nor climatic reasons. This well-founded theory of the origin of prairie land is of the highest import, and demonstrates the superiority of Canadian soil over that of the neighboring republic. A remarkable feature of this great extent of territory is its division, along lines running generally northwest and southeast, into three distinct prairie steppes. The first of these is known as the Red River Valley and Lake Winnipeg Plateau. The width at the boundary line is about fifty-two miles, and the average height about 800 feet above the sea; at the boundary line it is about 1000 feet. This first plateau lies entirely within the Province of Manitoba, and is estimated to contain about 7000 square miles of the best wheat-growing land on the continent or in the world. The second plateau has an average altitude of 1600 feet, having a width of about 250 miles on the international boundary line, and an area of about 105,000 square miles. The rich, undulating, park-like country lies in this region. This section is specially favorable for settlement, and includes the Assiniboine and Qu'Appelle districts. The third plateau begins on the boundary line at the 104th meridian, where it has an elevation of about 2000 feet, and extends west for 465 miles to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, where it has an altitude of about 4200 feet, making an average height above the sea of about 3000 feet. Generally speaking, the first two steppes are those which are most favorable for agriculture, and the third for grazing. Settlement is proceeding in the first two at a very rapid rate; and in the third plateau it is beginning, while numerous and prosperous cattle ranches have been established.\nGenerally speaking, a line drawn from the southeast corner of the Lake of the Woods, and running northwest to the height of land, divides this territory into two nearly equal portions, and for the most part follows the course of the isothermal lines. A diagonal line thus drawn also roughly separates two geological formations, the southern half being generally available for agricultural purposes. The portion north of this line comprises the wooded portion of the Northwest. It is rich in mineral and other resources, and undoubtedly, as the country comes to be more thickly settled, will be cultivated in parts.\n\nThere are magnificent lakes and rivers in the territories. The Mackenzie, which empties into the Arctic Ocean, is one of the longest in the world, its estimated length being about 2500 miles, including the Slave River, which is a part of its system. This river is generally navigable, except at the base of the Rocky Mountains, where it is interrupted by cascades. The Peace, another great river of the Northwest, has an estimated length of 1100 miles, draining a country containing vast agricultural and mineral resources. Another great river, if not the largest at least the most familiarly known, is the Saskatchewan, whose two branches take their rise in the Rockies, and, uniting at \"The Forks\" below Prince Albert, empty into Lake Winnipeg at Grand Rapids. This river is navigable from its mouth to Edmonton, on the North Branch, and for a short season from Medicine Hat on the South Branch.\n\nNelson River drains the waters of Lake Winnipeg into Hudson Bay; and the extent of its discharge may be imagined from the fact that this lake receives the waters of the Red River of the North, as well as of the River Winnipeg, the Saskatchewan and others. The mouth of the Nelson River is nearer to Liverpool than is New-York, and the navigation, it is believed, is continuously open for over four months in the year. Efforts are, therefore, already being made to render available this near communication from the very centre of the continent with the port of Liverpool. The Churchill River, which takes its rise near the base of the Rocky Mountains, and flows into Hudson Bay, is likely to become, in the near future, of great importance, as opening up the immense wheat and cattle raising areas of the Peace River region, connecting them with Hudson Bay navigation. At the mouth of the Churchill River is found one of the best harbours in the world and either this place or at York Factory, will arise, in the completion of the Hudson's Bay Railway, the New Archangel of the West.\n\nThe larger sized bodies of water are the Great Bear Lake, the Great Slave Lake, the Athabasca, Lake Winnipeg, and others. The Great Bear Lake contains an area of 14,000 square miles. The Great Slave Lake has a length from east to west of 300 miles, its greatest breadth having, however, a very much greater width in some places. Lake Winnipeg has a length of 280 miles, with a breadth of 55 miles, but its shape is very irregular. There are numerous other lakes of large size in the North West.\n\nThis vast territory is divided into four provisional districts: Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Athabasca, which are represented in the Dominion Senate and Commons and possess in common a council, elected by popular vote, which legislates on local questions; and at the head of its affairs.\nTHE DISTRICT OF SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nThe district of Saskatchewan, lying north of Assiniboia and east of Alberta, comprises 114,000 square miles. Owing to lack of railway communication, this district has not been so rapidly settled as Assiniboia and Alberta; but it is expected that before another year rolls round this will be provided and the development of the district quickly follow. The district is named after the great river whose name it bears, and whose two branches traverse it. It was here were enacted the scenes of the rebellion of '85, when the Canadian volunteers and Mounted Police dispersed and defeated the Metis and Indian insurgents who were mislead into following the erratic Louis Riel. Engagements took place at Duck Lake, Fish Creek, Batoche, Cut Knife and Frenchmen's Butte, and while with their peculiar mode of warfare, the rebels possessed a decided advantage over the troops, this was more than counterbalanced by inferiority of numbers, want of munitions of war and supplies, and lack of a leader competent to direct the brave if misguided Metis. After Batoche, the uprising came to an inglorious ending, and the leader paid the penalty of his disloyalty on the scaffold at Regina. At Batoche, the first \"naval engagement\" on the inland waters of the west occurred, when the steamer Northcote ran the gauntlet of rebel bullets, and narrowly escaped being captured. At Frog Lake, north of Fort Pitt, a horrible massacre of priests and white men took place, and Fort Pitt itself was captured by the Indians. Happily, peace is restored, and the horrors of war neither disturb the security nor prosperity of this beautiful park-like country. The district has immense resources which only await development. With a scattered population of about 11,000 it contains two flourishing towns\u2014Prince Albert and Battleford\u2014and several smaller villages which only await the advent of the iron horse to attain a greater degree of prosperity.\n\nTHE DISTRICT OF ASSINIBOIA.\n\nThe district of Assiniboia lies immediately west of Manitoba, adjoining the international boundary, and contains 95,000 square miles. This is the most thickly settled district in the Territories, and the one that is being more rapidly peopled than any other. It is pre-eminently an agricultural country, and in it are located several extensive colonies, which are prosperous and thriving. Amongst these are the Crofters from the Hebrides of Scotland, who, driven by hunger from the land of rock and bog, are founding for themselves, in this new country, a home with comforts which they never dared hope to enjoy in their former one. Here, too, is a London colony, transplanted from the very heart of the great mart of the world to the centre of this new land, and different as are the surroundings from the whirl and bustle of London to the peaceful calm of farm life in the North-West, the Cockney colonists find the change a pleasant one, for it brings them health and contentment and plenty, and hopes and aspirations never before indulged in. In Assiniboia, there are many English gentlemen\u2014scions of England's nobility, officers of the army who have retired, descendants of some of the oldest families of the Motherland\u2014who prefer a free western life, less trammelled as they are by the conventionalities of society than they would be in the Old Country, and who glory in the title of \"pioneer settler.\"\nIn this district lies the Valley of Qu'Appelle, so unique in its character, so beautiful in its features, that it will be, in the days unborn and yet not far away, sung in song and story; be made one of the Meccas of tourists, a happy valley beyond that of Rasselas', for its portals will ever be open, and the tide of life in no stinted stream flow through, enrich and rest upon its borders. Coming directly from the vast monotony of the Great Plains that clip it in, and you stand suddenly upon the massive bluffs that form its solid ramparts through the long and winding reaches of its entire length, and gaze with a strange feeling of wonder and delight upon a scene that, if it cannot be couched in words, holds yet within it a charm that is a spell to the eye and thrills the sense through every pleasure-giving fibre of your frame. Here are no rent and pinnacled cliff, no silvery cascades, foaming down the rocky crests that yields to the pen a color and a form\u2014but silence brooding over vast features that speak of a hidden world, a consecration of repose, a seclusion and a nook caught away from the reaching vistas swept so far by every eye, and so near at hand. Signs of life these are\u2014of life departed\u2014gone hence, never to return; the bones, ever and anon, of the vast herds that have left the deep furrows of their footprints in ordered spirals climbing to the apex of the mighty guards that fence in the fair valley beneath. Here, in days of yore they tossed their black sharp horns, and with wide-open, fearless eyes, gazed upon, as they paused on the summit, the wealth of water, wood and shelter that made their royal haunt; their huge frames, great chests and steely muscles vibrant with full life, days rounding to the full circle of existence that knew not want; unplagued with fear of the yet to come\u2014that baleful dreg at the bottom of every cup of cultured man.\n\nThese footprints of the lordly bison are the only \"handwriting on the wall\" of the rolling barricades\u2014are the only and the fit history of Qu'Appelle, whose chain of lakes and stealing, noiseless little river, glossing all of life that sought the valley\u2014were as evanescent of record as the fleeting shadows on their banks that shortened or lengthened apace with the daily march of the sun.\n\nFrom the rim highest to us that fringes the silence of ages, we gather only that a family or band of Crees called the \"Yelling River Indians\" made this particular locality their home. It is worth the mention only from the almost similar name given to it by the earliest French voyageurs who penetrated to this country, and who, surprised at the odd noises that greeted their ears at the night camp, responded, \"Qu'Appelle?\" (who calls?); the same being Anglicized by the early English into \"The Calling Lakes.\" Certain it is, however, that in the winter season only\u2014not in summer\u2014that strange, subaqueous sounds are heard, most likely from the contraction and expansion of the heavy ice. The Indians do not attach any supernatural meaning to these noises, prone as they are to people wonderland, but attribute them to the cause already stated. The lakes adverted to, of which there is a regular chain, are of great beauty, clear as crystal, large and deep enough to carry gallantly their fleet of white caps in a gale of wind, or, when calm, mirroring with extraordinary fidelity the verdant heights that overhang and press closely upon them. As the buffalo retreated before the cloud of hunters that pressed them relentlessly and foolishly to the further west, Qu'Appelle became a settled rendezvous for many of the hunters, and was prettily called \"The Gateway to the Plains\"\u2014a point of trade, with its mission (Roman Catholic) chapel, an oasis of permanent habitable dwellings, where one could in no wise conveniently \"fold up his tent and steal away.\" The women and old men in\nresting place of restless nomads, found in the absence of the hunters an unfailing potage in the great numbers of fine white fish that thronged the waters at their doors, cultivating also small patches of corn and potatoes, both for winter and summer use, which were keenly appreciated by their wandering kinsfolk on their return from continually recurring feasts on meat alone. We are speaking of the Qu'Appelle of the past, before the weird silence that rests upon its hills had been broken by even a chapel bell, and are reminded of a fray that has ever since the time when man was man tinged with its red and fatal color the fairest scenes, burst open the gates of brooding silence with a cry that hushes only as the soul re-enters them again forever. It is nearly a hundred years ago, at the time when the Indians alone followed the sinuous windings of the valley stream of Qu'Appelle, that a party of Crees, debouching from the Plains at a point where the road plunges steeply, even dangerously, to the valley, were stricken sorely by an ambushed enemy. The Crees, a hundred or more old men, women and children\u2014the hunters and warriors being all absent\u2014had gotten safely into the valley, when they were set upon by unseen foes. Hastily seeking shelter, they turned for their lines\u2014weak combatants as they were\u2014the boys, the old men and the women, fighting with a tenacity that cost not a few of their foes their lives. There could be, however, but one issue: the greater part were slain outright and scalped, or left for dead on the field. Quite a number of these children mostly recovered from the hatchet blows, one of the women living years after to tell of the loss of her scalp by the onset of their pitiless enemies, whom she said hasted but slew as they went.\n\nHow often, in the days of yore, the fair valley has been the scene of wild foray, can only be surmised\u2014perhaps not as often as might be supposed, the place affording too many opportunities for espial and ambush to make it a safe and favorite resort by people exposed to continual incursion. The Qu'Appelle, however, is not the only winsome spot in the country. There are others less entrancing, perhaps, but yet beautiful. Assiniboia contains some thriving towns which aspire to the dignity of \"cities,\" and in western exaggeration are entitled to rank in a higher class than Liverpool, Manchester, and other English \"towns.\"\n\nMOOSOMIN.\n\nProf. Saunders, of the Experimental Farm, Ottawa, in his official visit through the country last fall, describes the Moosomin district 'as the garden of the Northwest. His decision is corroborated by the grain statistics of last year. The fall of 1882 saw the nucleus of Moosomin in a few tents; now, in the spring of '88, the census is reckoned at 700. During these six years of its infancy, Moosomin has attained proportions of which it may be justly proud. A grain elevator has been erected capable of holding 45,000 bushels, and a roller mill which turns out 150 barrels a day. It is estimated that during the season of 1887-88, 400,000 bushels of grain will pass through the elevator. The growth of Moosomin has been steady and sure, it having never suffered the disastrous results consequent to a \"bubble.\" Native stone is found in large quantities, and is already obtaining great favor in the eyes of prospective builders. Some of the residents have already erected substantial houses for themselves. The town is noted for a spirit of brotherly kindness, contentment, peace, piety and\nprosperity. The Government has promised a court house, gaol and barracks to the town, which it justly merits, and which will be the first piece of public patronage Moosomin has yet received. A port of entry should follow, as the town occupies the most easterly point of importance in Assiniboia. The public school established about two years ago has a seating capacity of 250, and already 100 names appear on the roll. Being almost on the boundary between Manitoba and the Northwest, its central position was soon taken advantage of by Messrs. Smith & Lafferty, who have established a branch of their bank here, and affirm that their business is in a very flourishing condition. They are gentlemen well versed in the banking business, having branch houses in all the most prosperous towns of the Northwest, and their choice of Moosomin speaks well for its increasing advancement. The Canada Northwest Land Company intend erecting a large building for their offices. It is to be situated on Broadway avenue, and expected to be completed this fall. Over $1000 of stamps were sold at the Moosomin post office during the last six months of 1887, 6891 registered letters, and money orders to the amount of $10,234.\n\nMoosomin is the market town for several colonies of Assiniboia, prominent among them being that of the Crofters, a canny, plodding set of people, who are having the universal success which, with all their thrift, they could not secure in the heather-clad hills of their native land. They were settled here through the exertions of Lady Cathcart Gordon, who cannot but feel highly repaid when she learns the amount of good they are both receiving and giving in this fertile belt of our Great Lone Land. The land about Moosomin is well suited to mixed farming, which, after all, is the most profitable in the Northwest. The farmers have been enabled to supplant their log huts by substantial frame buildings, a large tract of country is under cultivation, and the live stock has increased so surprising that Moosomin supplies large quantities of meat for the western districts. A. Harris, Son & Co., of Brantford, Ont., have a branch house here, and report to be doing a good business in the farm implement line. The town has several general stores, churches, bakery, groceries, fruit and confectionery, hardware, millinery and dress-making. A photographer also flourishes, and many take advantage of this fact to send home to their friends in distant lands representations of their adopted country.\n\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF MOOSOMIN:\n\nR. D. McNaughton, Dry Goods, Clothing, Hardware, Boots and Shoes, Groceries, Flour and Feed, etc., South Front street, Moosomin, Assiniboia \u2014This popular establishment ranks as one of the leading and reliable enterprises of the kind in the Northwest, and merits liberal mention in this book. No house in any line of trade offers such superior inducements to the purchaser, and no establishment is more widely recognized for the excellence of its goods. Its popularity is due to the liberal policy and prompt business habits of the proprietor, and the courteous and cordial manner with which everyone visiting his store is treated; and the choice and complete assortment of goods that is at all times displayed, as well as the low and liberal prices at which his goods are sold. This is one of the bon ton establishments of the town, and it has for customers the best class of our citizens. Mr. McNaughton began business here in 1882, being the first merchant to locate at this place. In 1888 he finished a very fine stone building, 54 x 40 feet in size, having a separate department for the following lines: dry goods, hardware, groceries, clothing, boots and shoes, carpets and general merchandise. He also has a very large and well arranged cellar. By strict attention and a careful selection of stock, he having a nice and discriminating knowledge of the wants and fancies of his customers, has more than doubted itself. He keeps in stock everything pertaining to dry goods, clothing, hardware, groceries, boots and shoes, etc. Everything late, new or nobby, will be found in his\nstock, which is being constantly replenished. He is a merchant of industry, energy and ability, and an upright and honorable gentleman, having the confidence and respect of his customers and the community at large.\n\nJohn McCurdy, Carriage Manufacturing and Blacksmithing, South Front street, Moosomin, Assiniboia.\u2014Few industries have made more rapid progress and improvement during recent years than that of carriage building. The attention that has been given to this trade has demonstrated that Canadian inventive genius and mechanical skill are quite as successful in this line as they have proved in many others. Prominent among the leading representatives of the trade in this town is the widely known and old established house of John McCurdy. This business was started in 1882 by Mr. McCurdy. The premises occupied at the above named address are spacious and commodious, admirably arranged and equipped with every facility and convenience for the transaction of business. The carriages, buggies, wagons, sleighs, etc., manufactured by this house are unequalled for originality of design and superiority of workmanship and finish. They are made from the best materials available, and in the most skillful manner, and both in quality and price will compare most favorably with anything the market affords. McCurdy & Tucker have just completed a large stone building 30x50 feet in size, and two stories in height, which will be utilized as a machine shop, supplied with all the latest and most improved machinery, and the motive power is run by a 40 horse power engine. Such enterprising men as Messrs. John McCurdy and J. Tucker, with their push and energy, will always succeed.\n\nInglis & Smith, Butchers and Cattle Dealers, Main street, Moosomin, Assiniboia.\u2014A notice of all important branches of business of this country of the present day, is of interest to all, and essential to a complete history of the progress and growth of the community for the information and instruction of the present as well as the coming generations. The slaughtering of cattle and packing of hogs being one of the most important industries of Manitoba and the Northwest, as well as one of the largest, a brief sketch of some of the firms engaged will be of interest to our readers. Prominent among these is the house of Messrs. James Inglis and H. Smith, which is deserving of copious mention at our hands. Four years ago this firm commenced business on moderate capital, which has increased from year to year, until now they do a very large and prosperous business. They make a speciality of buying and selling cattle. The business in all its various details of management is conducted upon principles of pure mercantile integrity, and it is to these merits that the credit, reputation and confidence of the house owes its success.\n\nW. H. Maulson & Co., Groceries, Dry Goods, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Hardware, Crockery, Lumber, Sash Doors and Builders' Supplies, Grain, Flour and Feed, Main street, corner South Front street, Moosomin, Assiniboia.\u2014In every city or community there are individual examples of men whose long connections with its business pursuits, whose prominence in all matters of public enterprise, and whose record for unflinching integrity, undaunted energy and untiring industry make them objects of special note, not alone in their homes, but wherever exalted commercial reputation is recognised and respected. There are few men now engaged in business in this town who have been longer associated with its mercantile interests than W. H. Maulson. There is no house in the trade that carries a more ample stock, nor any whose facilities in the general store trade surpasses that of this establishment for supplying the trade with first-class goods at lowest quotations. They carry a full and complete assortment of dry goods, clothing, hardware, boots and shoes, groceries, crockery, builders' supplies, etc. They are proprietors of a large lumber yard, where all kinds of lumber, laths, shingles, sashes, doors, blinds, etc., are always kept on hand. This business was founded in 1882, by Carroll Maulson & Co., the present firm assuming charge in 1886. Actual merit and continued fair dealing have assured their success, and the reputation of the house is established on a firm basis, and ranks as one of the solid institutions of Moosomin. Public spirited, energetic and liberal, Messrs. W. H. Maulson & Co. are highly respected and honored citizens in all the various walks of life, and under their able and judicious management their house has become celebrated as one of the most enterprising and complete establishments in the Northwest.\n\nAssiniboia Roller Flouring Mills, Theodore Fletcher, Proprietor, Moosomin, Assiniboia.\u2014Among the many business enterprises contributing to the credit of the Northwest as a manufacturing and business centre, there undoubtedly is beyond question no single establishment of any kind that has contributed more by its capable management, practical skill and business ability to bring about this result than Mr. Theodore Fletcher. The many improvements that have been made in the last ten or fifteen years in the manufacture of flour have nowhere been so pronounced as in this country; and the fact has been fully established that Moosomin produces flour not only superior in quality, but of such marked excellence and fineness as to make her stand second to none in Canada. Mr. Fletcher has taken the lead in adopting all improvements, ranking among the most prominent establishments in his line in this country. This widely known mill was built in 1887; it is a three story and basement building 40 x 85 feet in size, and has five double stands of rollers and two run of four feet stones, making 130 barrels of flour per day. The mills are supplied with all the latest improved machinery, drawn by an engine of 75 horse power. The finest grades of family flour, including Pride of the West, are made a specialty of at these mills, all first quality flour, unsurpassed by any brand in the country for fineness and freedom from mixtures, prime favorites wherever known. Mr. Fletcher is a gentleman of experience in his business, and is an active, enterprising and reliable business man. These mills are a credit to the country and among its representative establishments, and deserving of all the commendation we can give.\n\nRichard Tees, Dry Goods, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Groceries, etc., Main street, Moosomin, Assiniboia.\u2014This concern was established three years ago, and from the start was a positive and permanent success; the superior stock of goods, the general satisfaction rendered to patrons and purchasers, and the foresight and enterprise displayed in the management of the business, being the chief elements contributing to the prosperity Mr. Tees to-day deservedly enjoys. The premises occupied are spacious and commodious and handsomely fitted up, and an elegant and extensive stock is carried on hand to meet the large and constantly increasing trade. A full assortment of goods is carried, embracing dry goods, clothing, boots and shoes, groceries, etc. Mr. Tees is a man of push and enterprise, and it is only a natural consequence that he should have attained the large measure of success he now enjoys.\nT. B. McAlpine, Groceries, Fruits, Confectionery and Bakery, South Front street and Broadway avenue, Moosomin, Assiniboia.\u2014One of the most enterprising and reliable houses which it is our province to mention in connection with the industries and business of this town is that of Mr. T. B. McAlpine, dealer in staple and fancy groceries, provisions, fruits and confectionery. This concern was started in 1883, with moderate capital, but with energy and thorough and practical adaptation to his business, soon gave him a liberal patronage among the best class of citizens, and a steady and gradual increase in trade has been the result. He carries a large stock, which is kept in excellent order, and he is almost in daily receipt of fresh goods, thus keeping our stock thoroughly replenished with the freshest and best class of articles for home and table use, making a specialty of keeping the very best and most desirable goods. He makes a specialty of handling California fruits. He is also proprietor of the only bakery in the town, which is under the supervision of a first-class baker. The grocery and provision establishment is located on South Front street, while the bakery is situated on Broadway avenue. Mr. McAlpine has established an enviable business reputation in the town of his adoption, which, with his unswerving integrity, justly entitled him to a high position among the dealers in this country.\n\nLake House, W. R. Hamilton, Proprietor Main Street, Moosomin, Assiniboia.\u2014As one of the favorite hotels in this country, the Lake House is deserving of special mention. This house has always held a leading place among the hotels of this town, both on account of the excellent way in which its business has been conducted and its splendid location in Main street in the business heart of the town. Besides, as a host Mr. W. R. Hamilton is unrivalled, and is perfectly aware how to keep a hotel. The Lake House is a spacious building, two stories in height, and contains about twenty-five sleeping rooms, all of which are well furnished, and is in every way a desirable place to stop or reside permanently. The dining room is commodious and the table is supplied with the best the market affords, while the bar is well stocked. We take pleasure in referring to the Lake House as one of the best places to stop at while in Moosomin. The proprietor is a genial and considerable host and is very popular with the travelling public.\n\nF. T. Carman, Druggist and Chemist, Books and Stationery, Main street, Moosomin, Assiniboia.\u2014An important feature in connection with the business of any city is its well conducted drug establishments, and in a comprehensive work which presents in a prominent and attractive manner the business facilities of this town, we take great pleasure in noticing the excellent and popular drug house of Mr. F. T. Carman, located on Main street, in the centre of the business portion of the town. This business was started in 1884 by the present proprietor, and since the beginning he has enjoyed an excellent patronage. He occupies a prominent building which is well fitted up. The stock embraces a full line of pure drugs and medicines, perfumeries, toilet articles, books and stationery, and all such articles as are usually associated with a first-class drug house in larger cities. Special attention is given to the preparation of physicians' prescriptions, which are carefully compounded from purest medicines. An accomplished druggist and scientific chemist, Mr. Carman richly deserves the popularity and confidence he is receiving.\n\nW. H. Barton, Lumber, Lath, Shingles, Sash, Doors and Blinds, Main Street, Moosomin, Assiniboia.\u2014One of the important and distinctive enterprises which has found Moosomin a congenial centre for its operations is the wholesale and retail lumber interests. This town and the Northwest represent a market of enormous magnitude for lumber. This business was founded in 1886 by the present proprietor. His facilities are perfect and he is in daily receipt of shipments of lumber, lath, shingles, etc., which commands his share of the trade in the Northwest. His office and yards are very conveniently located in the centre portion of the town, where all orders, by mail or telegraph, will receive prompt attention. A force of men are employed in the receiving and shipping of lumber, and the care and attention bestowed on every detail of the business indicates Mr. Barton's laudable ambition to maintain his high reputation for supplying his customers, and the prospects for a steady development of his trade in the future are of the most favorable character.\n\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF BROADVIEW.\n\nA. G. Thorburn, Dry Goods, Groceries, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Hardware, etc., Broadview, Assiniboia.\u2014Prominent among the general stores of this country is that of A. G. Thorburn, dealer in dry goods, groceries, hardware, boots and shoes, clothing, etc. During the five years that he has been in business here he has succeeded by the exercise of a large capacity for business, and strict attention to the wants of his customers, in building up a large and commodious, well arranged and well fitted up, and in which is displayed a well selected stock of dry goods, embracing silks, woollens, hosiery, dress goods, fancy goods, gents' furnishings, staple and fancy groceries, clothing, boots and shoes, hardware, and everything pertaining to a first-class establishment of this kind.

Mr. Thorburn holds the positions of Justice of the Peace and School Trustee. He is an honorable, straightforward merchant, who is highly esteemed by his fellow-citizens and the community at large. Mr. Thorburn is also a grain buyer and shipper, and he also does quite a wholesale trade in adjoining towns, in coal oil and salt; he is also one of the largest fur traders in this part of the country.\n\nJohn O'Neil, Groceries and Hardware, etc., Broadview, Assiniboia.\u2014Prominent among the establishments of Broadview is that of John O'Neil, dealer in hardware, groceries, etc. This business was established in 1882, by W. A. Reed & Co., coming under the present management.\nin 1883. By square dealing and business push he soon obtained a considerable business. Mr. O'Neil has always on hand an excellent assortment of staple and fancy groceries embracing canned goods, sugars, teas, coffee, syrup and general groceries of all descriptions; also, a full and complete line of hardware, such as table and pocket cutlery, mechanics tools, house furnishing goods, stoves, tinware, etc. Mr. O'Neil being contented with small profits, knowing that thereby he will secure larger sales. He has won an excellent reputation as a reliable business man, and he will be found prompt, liberal and fair, and always prepared to offer advantages in keeping with such a reputation.\n\nJ. Clementson, Dry Goods, Groceries, Boots and Shoes, Hardware, Clothing, etc., Broadview, Assiniboia.\u2014In considering the various commercial enterprises of Broadview, the general merchant assumes an importance with reference to the wealth and general prosperity of the community that commends him to the most careful attention of any work bearing upon the resources of the country. In this connection the establishment of J. Clementson, from the magnitude of its business and the character of its operations, should receive fitting consideration. It is one of the largest and most thoroughly equipped and reliable houses in this part of the country. This business was founded in 1882 by the present proprietor. Since his establishment here, through energy and determination, coupled with an honorable, liberal policy of doing business, soon attracted attention to the house, and a thriving and steadily growing trade soon sought it, and has permanently remained. A customer once secured, his own interests make him a lasting adherent. Mr. Clementson is owner of some of the most valuable town and country property, embracing town lots, farms, etc. A more thorough going, liberal minded, active and energetic business man than Mr. Clementson cannot be found in this part of the country. He is also Justice of the Peace. Mr. Clementson's establishment, which is one of the oldest in this part of the country, has withstood the hard times of the last few years, and is deserving of the success it is now achieving. Its trade among the C. P. R. Railway men along the line is superior to any other establishment.\n\nQU'APPELLE.\n\nThe town of Qu'Appelle, comprising 400 souls, is on the main line of the C.P.R., 223 miles west of Winnipeg and 32 miles east of Regina. It is picturesquely situated, being surrounded by poplar bluffs, which impart a park-like character to the scenery, as well as affording valuable protection from winter storms, and ensuring a bountiful supply of firewood and building material. The celebrated Qu'Appelle valley is 18 miles north. The character of the surrounding country generally is undulating, dotted with small lakes and poplar bluffs, so favorably regarded. A large number of settlers took up land here long before any railway had been graded in the vicinity, having so much faith in its future as an agricultural settlement. The soil is black loam with clay sub-soil, and very little alkali, and this only in small patches. Already some 9,000 acres of government lands are occupied in the municipality which is named South Qu'Appelle, and about 107,000 acres are still open for free grant. Lands can also be purchased close to the town at reasonable figures, and on easy terms, from the Canada Northwest Land Co. and the Ontario and Qu'Appelle Land Co. This promising town dates its foundation from the fall of 1882, but was nearly swept out of existence by fire in May of 1883, but quickly renewed and continued growing and prospering since that time, never having been afflicted with a \"boom.\" Property in the business part is rising in price slowly but surely, which may be regarded as an undeniable evidence of a most substantial progress. There are three good hotels in Qu'Appelle, a private bank, post office and money order office, three general stores well stocked with every conceivable article in hardware, groceries and dry goods; also a weekly paper. The town boasts of having the largest roller flour mill west of Winnipeg. It was built in 1883 by McMillan Bros., Winnipeg, and had a capacity of 200 bushels per day. There is also an excellent public school with an attendance of about 100 pupils, as well as good substantial churches. The Church Colonization Land Society of England having obtained considerable tracts of land, they propose to settle English laborers on them,\nand will afford them assistance for the first year or two, after which they can either acquire holding on easy terms or make an advantageous start for themselves on government land, having acquired this experience. The management of this enterprise is under the control of Prof. H. Tanner of South Kensington, London, who exercises personal supervision over the settlers during the summer months. Qu'Appelle supports a drug store, hardware store, harness shop, flour and feed, boot and shoe, 2 lumber yards, 2 blacksmith and carriage manufactories, 3 livery and sale stables and 2 bakeries and confectioners. Thus ample means are provided for the procuring of all the necessities of life. Prince Albert is distant about 275 miles. Communication is made by stage and mail route, and long experience has taught the drivers the shortest road. About 1\u00bd miles out of town stands the St. John's College founded by the Right Rev. Adelbert, Bishop of Qu'Appelle, including both a theological department and high school for boys. There are four churches\u2014English, Methodist, Presbyterian and Roman Catholic. The present settlers being of the industrious stamp, and the land very rich, the future prosperity of Qu'Appelle may justly be looked upon as an assured fact, particularly in face of the rapid strides it has made during the few years of its existence.\n\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF QU'APPELLE\n\nJ. P. Beauchamp, Dry Goods, Groceries, Hardware, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, etc., Qu'Appelle Street, Qu'Appelle Station, Assiniboia.\u2014At the above-named locality will be found one of the most elegantly fitted up and handsomely arranged general stores in the town.

The store is filled from end to end with as fresh, pure and attractive line of goods as can be procured or desired, and the stock is kept supplied with frequent additions. He has energy, industry and integrity to recommend him, and has already secured a position in the community entitling him to the respect and confidence, as well as liberal patronage, of the public. This business was founded by the firm of Goldstein and Beauchamp in 1883, Mr. Beauchamp coming into possession in 1884, and from the inception it has steadily grown until it now reaches large proportions.\n\nLeland House, Love & Raymond, Proprietors, Pacific Avenue, Qu'Appelle Station, Assiniboia.\u2014As one of the few favorite hotels in this country, the Leland House is deserving of special mention, more particularly on account of its being an old-established hotel and consequent identification with the solid and substantial institutions of this place. Three years ago Messrs. Love and Raymond built this house, and infused new life into the hotel business of this town by their wide experience and attractive characteristics. Improvements were introduced, the hotel handsomely furnished, an excellent bar and billiard room, and every modern convenience supplied for the comfort and convenience of the guests. The building is spacious, containing ample and elegant accommodations, and in every way a desirable place to stop at. Besides the parlors, there are twenty-one handsomely furnished sleeping rooms, all large and comfortable apartments, while the dining room is commodious and the table is supplied with the best the market affords. Game in season. Good sample rooms in connection with the house, where the commercial traveller can display his goods to the best advantage. The travelling public have probably never had more careful and assiduous caterers to their comfort than Messrs. John Love and Angus Raymond, the present proprietors. They are genial and considerate hosts, always looking after the welfare and comfort of their guests.\n\nR. Johnston, Livery, Feed and Sale Stable, also Stage Line from here to Qu'Appelle, Caswell Street, Qu'Appelle Station, Assiniboia.\u2014This is one of the oldest and most widely known livery and boarding stables in this part of the country, being founded by J. W. McLean in 1882, the present proprietor coming into possession in 1887, and it enjoys today a large and influential patronage among the best class of citizens. The premises occupied consists of a substantial two-story structure, which is admirably arranged, well-ventilated, and equipped throughout with every facility and convenience for the transaction of business, ample stall room being afforded for sixty horses. He does a general stabling business, taking horses to board, also buying and selling horses. He keeps on hand, for hire, handsome carriages, buggies, sleighs, etc., which are of modern style and build. Mr. Johnston runs the only stage line from here to Fort Qu'Appelle, leaving every morning and carrying the mail. During a long and busy career, he has sustained an excellent reputation for honorable dealing and sterling integrity. This establishment makes a specialty of hiring rigs to people wishing to visit Fort Qu'Appelle, Prince Albert, and intermediate points, this being the only direct trail to the far north.\nWhiting Bros., Bakery and Confectionery, Qu'Appelle Street, Qu'Appelle Station, Assiniboia.\u2014The marked success attendant upon the career and operations of this house is of such a pronounced and obvious character as to demand more than ordinary attention in making a careful review of the commercial and manufacturing business of the town. This business was established in 1885 by Messrs C. H. Gibson, A. T. Whiting, and F. G. Whiting, the present proprietors coming into possession in 1887. The premises occupied are commodious, and well adapted for the transaction of business. The building is centrally located in the business portion of the town, and equipped with all the appliances necessary. They have always on hand a large supply of fresh bread, pies, cakes, etc., filling the largest order in the promptest manner. They also deal quite extensively in foreign and domestic fruits, nuts, candies, etc. Both members of the firm are natives of England, and are gentlemen of unimpeachable integrity, standing deservedly high in the esteem and confidence of the community. They are both justly entitled to a prominent position among the business men of this district.\n\nFrank Marwood, Carriage Building and Horse Shoer, Qu'Appelle Street, Qu'Appelle Station, Assiniboia.\u2014All owners of horses know how important it is that the care of horses' feet should only be entrusted to a horse-shoer of the very highest class, as many fine animals are ruined by the bungling of ignorant or inexperienced men in this line. No person sending their horses to Mr. Frank Marwood need have any fear on this score, as he is a practical horse shoer and farrier of great experience, who has made a life-long study of horses' feet, and has adopted the most scientific method of shoeing. He established his present business here in 1887, and now commands a large and strictly first-class trade. Mr. Marwood is about to establish a carriage and wagon factory at this place, where he will manufacture all kinds and styles of carriages, buggies, wagons, sleighs, etc. He will employ none but first-class workmen, and use none but the best of material, and guarantees to give his patrons satisfaction in every instance.\n\nREGINA,\n\nthe capital of the Territories, of whose early history Powers, in his description of the place, says:\n\n\"REGINA, THE CAPITAL OF THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES.\n\n\"A few miles down the creek from the site of the Northwest Mounted Police buildings, stands a small hill or butte which some years ago bore on its modest crest a collection or 'pile' of buffalo bones. In the buffalo hunting days, hunters usually camped at this crossing of the stream, killing and preparing for winter the bison captured in the fall hunt. The rich and vast prairie for miles round the 'pile' was a favorite haunt of the buffalo, and where could a hunter's camp and pemmican factory be more conveniently established than contiguous to the hute aforesaid? That great essential, water, was at hand; poles were to be had for drying-scaffolds; the adjacent grounds were level as billiard tables for the stretching and drying of the skins, and, above all, the spot lay in the centre of a region abounding in choice game. Every season contributed its quota of bones to the 'pile,' and the red man's nomenclature, which is of a piece with his entire surroundings, readily furnished a name to the meandering creek which drained that section of country. Oskana in the Cree language means bones, and from this word is derived the more mellifluous and dignified Wascana. And the tortuous stream, which has its marshy source fifteen miles southwest of the Hurricane Hills, and meanders north-westwards along a dozen townships until it reaches the Qu'Appelle River some twenty miles from Regina, is now known to the map-makers and world in general as the Wascana, or Pile-of-Bones Bones Creek.\n\n\"In the neighborhood of a quarter of a century ago, this pile of bones stood six feet high, cylinder-shaped, and boasted a diameter of forty feet at its base. In justice to the pile-builders, it will be admitted that the bleached materials were laid with artistic skill and taste, shin and other bones radiating from a centre with that...\"\ngrace characteristic of the rude children of Nature. Opposite the 'pile,' and on the east side, was situated the 'pond' or 'pound' into which were driven the decoyed bison. The butte itself served as a signal station for the sentry, whose duty it was to give notice of the approach of buffalo from the east. We all know Pilot Butte. The Crees called this hill Ota-sa-wa-pa-win, or 'Indian Outlook,' and an admirable signal station it made, standing as it did in a splendid tract of country, from which the roving herds could be observed for miles in all directions. Old Indian folks had their superstitions failings like other people, and one of these appears to have been that live buffalo were very loath to abandon a locality which contained the bones of their slain comrades. This belief raised the 'pile.' Until very recently, ample proofs existed of the immense numbers of buffalo that roamed this part of the country. Whitened bones and skeletons paved the prairie, clearly demonstrating that the choice herbage of our lands was dearly loved by the lordly bison. But the bones have recently become an article of commerce, being used in the east as fertilizers. Our half-breeds, as well as those unbelieving Indians who do not expect a sudden re-appearance of the bison while white men rule the Northwest, have been sufficiently un-entimental to collect these bones and carry them to the railroad, where they command a ready sale at a few dollars a ton. Fifteen hundred dollars' worth of the bleached left Regina alone during 1886. The great pile itself has long since ceased to exist in pillared form, having ingloriously gone the way of all buffalo bones. The butte alone remains, keeping silent and unromantic vigil over the once celebrated camping ground of the red-skinned hunters, whose race, like the almost extinct bison, will ere long be known in the world's story as creatures that were.\"\n\nBut Regina has risen its places, and named by the Marquis of Lorne in honor of his illustrious mother-in-law, it occupies as important a position amongst the white men of the Territories as its predecessor did amongst the red ones in by-gone days. The prosperity of the place has been steady, and in a few years it has secured nearly all the adjuncts of a metropolis. Besides being the seat of government for the Territories, the head-quarters of the North-West Mounted Police\u2014the Rough Riders of the Plains, whose services to Canada have never been fully appreciated. The barracks of the police are at the western extremity of the city. The residence of the Lieutenant-Governor, the offices of the Indian Department and North-West Government are also located in Regina, which also possesses a custom house and a fine brick post office. The press of Regina is in the front rank of western journalism\u2014Nicholas Flood Davin's Leader and the Journal each enjoying a wide circulation. In May, 1885, the Regina & Long Lake Railroad was commenced; and on the same day Riel was taken prisoner by Capt. Young and confined in the police barracks, there to await his trial, which took place on the 6th of June, at which he was accused and convicted of high treason, and afterwards hanged. The different religious sects are well represented there being a Catholic, Presbyterian, Episcopal and Methodist church. Each of the buildings are large and commodious, and Sunday sees them well filled at both services. The Presbyterians intend enlarging their church at the near future. Chief Pie-a-Pot's reserve lies 30 miles out of Regina, and very favorable reports as to the improvement, both spiritually and physically, of the Indians come with great regularity to the Home Mission Boards. Many schools for the education of the Indians have been established, and as they are quick to learn, much hope and satisfaction is felt among those interested in their welfare. With a little training, some of\nthem become good farmers, and many of them are zealously striving to attain both knowledge and skill in this line. The financial interests are well represented by two banks, a branch Bank of Montreal and the private bank of Lafferty & Smith. The town supports four lawyers and two doctors. Regina is happy in having a good school, with very efficient teachers at the helm and plenty of room for all the scholars who desire to come. The North West Land Company and the Land Corporation of Canada claim to be doing a fair business, and the managers of both are sanguine as to the future greatness of the town. At the present, however, the land in the vicinity is not as extensively cultivated as one would wish, notwithstanding that Regina is in the midst of one of the largest blocks of wheat-growing land in the country. The explanation to this may be found in the fact that great portions of the surrounding country has been bought up by speculators. Active steps are being taken by the Board of Trade to frustrate this holding of land at high figures, and great expectations are entertained for the rapid colonization and advancement of their future city. The Regina Milling Company continues to prosper. The lumber business proves to be a lucrative one. The government intend spending about $85,000 this year on improvements, and now there is nothing to prevent the North-West capital from becoming a great and prosperous city in the near future. The corporate body is composed as follows:\u2014W. C. Hamilton, Mayor. Aldermen\u2014C. Howson, John Dawson, R. Williams, A. Martin, H. Sheppard and C. McCosker. Regina also has a board of trade. Statistics show there are about 1400 inhabitants and about 300 Mounted Police; 1 elevator; 1 flouring mill, 100 barrels capacity per day; 1 planing mill; 4 churches, English, Presbyterian, Methodist and Catholic; 2 carriage manufactories; 2 good hotels; 2 book and stationery stores; 1 wholesale drug house; 1 wholesale grocery establishment; 2 lumber yards; 1 boot and shoe store; 2 retail drug store; 1 commission merchant; 2 harness shops; 1 merchant tailor; 1 furniture house; 2 butcher shops; 1 cigar store; 3 restaurants; 3 grocery stores; 5 general stores; 2 dry goods stores; 4 hardware stores; 2 millinery stores; 2 barber shops; 2 banks, and a large number of handsome and costly residences.\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF REGINA.\n\nMowat Bros., Wholesale and Retail Groceries, Provisions, Crockery, etc., Bakers and Live Stock Dealers, Broad Street, Regina, Assiniboia.\u2014One of the oldest, if not indeed the oldest, firms in this city is that of Mowat Bros., which was established in 1852 as a retail grocery business, under the same firm title as at present; and from that time until the present it has never been changed. Their start was in a modest way; but merit, business ability, and continued fair dealing increased their trade until they are now forced to enlarge their business connections and augment their facilities. They have brought in their many years' experience ripe judgment and business habits, making it one of the substantial and reliable establishments of the North-West Territory. They have built up a large and growing trade in the legitimate channels of commerce, through their superior business qualifications, and they are destined to still further enlarge it, as such men never stand still, but increase naturally, in a ratio commensurate with the times. Their stock comprises the most complete variety of everything connected with the grocery trade, embracing tea, coffees, sugars, syrups, canned goods, and all kinds of staple and fancy groceries. Their assortment is excellent for buyers to select from, and they are able to hold out special inducements. Experience in commercial ethics is considered equal to capital, and there are few men in Regina, now engaged in active business, who have been so long identified continuously with the grocery trade, and whose opportunities for gaining experience have been so advantageous as those of Messrs. D. Mowat and A. Mowat, the proprietors. They are live business men, conducting their affairs on the most elevated plane of commercial integrity. Liberal, enterprising, and energetic, they are esteemed as among our best business men. Mr. D. Mowat held the honorable position as mayor of this city for the years 1886 and '87.\n\nDawson, Bole & Co., Wholesale Druggists and Manufacturers, Broad Street, Regina, Assiniboia.\u2014The oldest and leading house in its line in the North-West is unquestionably that of Messrs. Dawson, Bole & Co., the widely and favorably known wholesale druggists, and importers and jobbers of drugs and druggists' sundries, and manufacturers of Clarke's saraparilla, carbolic ointment, climax kidney cure, samsonella cure, Bole's pills, Dawson's yellow oil, etc., etc. The business dates back to 1852, at a time when Regina was but little more than a village of but a few houses, and the new fruitful West was but a mere wilderness. Messrs. John Dawson and D. W. Bole, the proprietors, bring the widest range of practical experience to bear, coupled with an intimate knowledge of the trade, and their stock is the largest and most completely assorted of any in the North-West. As importers, wholesalers, and jobbers, Messrs. Dawson, Bole & Co., with their ample resources and splendid connections in the East, are enabled to offer to their customers a stock unequalled as regards the freshness and purity of drugs and chemicals, paints and oils. Limits of space prevent our attempting to give even a summary of the long list of articles always to be found in stock. It includes numerous preparations of ammonia, all kinds of barks and balsams, borax and brimstone, cinchona, sulphate of quinine and quinine pills, morphin, opium, mercury, cocaine, and other costly drugs, all the finest chemical preparations of soda, also all standard proprietary remedies and patent medicines. Their cigars and tobaccos include the choicest Havana and domestic seed leaf stock, and cannot be duplicated elsewhere for the money. This is one of the strongest firms in the country, known and respected far and wide, its trade extending to all parts of the North-West, and requiring the services of several salesmen on the road. The foremost position which this firm have invariably occupied in the transaction of their diversified business has been clearly indicative of their well-directed efforts, which have been justly rewarded in the brilliant success achieved, and the high esteem with which they are regarded.\n\nJ. F. Mowat, Gent's Furnishings, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Fur Goods, etc., South Railway Street, Regina, Assiniboia.\u2014This handsome and well fitted up store is large and commodious, and most admirably arranged. The stock carried embraces a large and varied assortment of fine men's, youths', and children's clothing, fine underwear, shirts, ties, collars, silk and linen handkerchiefs, hats, caps, etc., also a full and complete line of fine footwear for ladies, gent's, and children, including the standard shapes, original patterns, and correct styles. Only the best and most reliable goods are kept in stock, and the same are sold at very reasonable prices. Mr. Mowat's facilities for transacting business are of a strictly first class character, enabling him to offer special advantages to customers. He is well known as an honorable, liberal, and conscientious business man, giving a hearty support to every movement having for its object the welfare and prosperity of this city. He is held in the highest estimation, both in social and commercial circles, and has achieved a well-merited success.\n\nR. B. Ferguson, Furniture and Upholstering, South Railway Street, Regina, Assiniboia.\u2014This business was founded in 1884 by the present proprietor, and from the first it was the aim of this house to keep none but the best and most artistic goods; this met with a most gratifying response from an appreciative public, and built up one of the largest and most representative businesses of the kind in the city. Mr. R. B. Ferguson is a gentleman of vast practical experience in the trade, and is possessed of unerring judgment and superior executive abilities. The store-room contains one of the most extensive, as it is one of the freest and most elegant stocks of furniture in this part of the country. All of the newest designs in parlor, chamber, dining-room and kitchen furniture are included in the stock; the parlor sets are obtainable in all the first styles of upholstery. The prompt, upright, and reliable character of all of Mr. Ferguson's dealings, and the superior quality of his goods, has secured to him the representative position he now holds, and which renders his establishment an interesting feature of the city's activity and enterprise.\n\nP. Lamont, Books, Stationery, Fancy Goods, Wall Paper, Musical Instruments, etc., South Railway street, Assiniboia.\u2014Prominent among the well conducted and prosperous business enterprises which line this great trade artery of the country, will be found that of Mr. P. Lamont, general dealer in books, stationery, fancy goods, toys, wall paper, musical instruments, etc. Mr. Lamont is general\nagent in this city for the Mason & Rich pianos, also the Doherty organs. The spacious and elegantly fitted up store, and the large and complete stock embraces everything incident to the line of trade. The store has long been a favorite resort for people of art tastes, and the large and prosperous patronage represents the best class of city custom. This business was founded in 1883 by the present proprietor, whose long experience and natural artistic taste has eminently fitted him for the successful conduct of his business. Through his upright, honorable dealing, and energetic and able management, it has attained the proportion of a leading, prosperous city industry.\n\nJ. D. Sibbald & Co., General Commission Merchants and Grain buyers, Office, South Railway street, Warehouse on C. P. Railway, Regina, Assiniboia.\u2014This is one of Regina's old established and thoroughly representative commission houses, its origin dating as far back as 1883, when it was founded by Sibbald & Lindsay. Mr. Lindsay dropping out of the firm about one year later. Since its inception at that date, it has enjoyed a very successful career, and stands today foremost among the leading houses in the trade. The firm occupy spacious and commodious premises, and their facilities for transacting business are of a strictly first-class character. They receive daily, large consignments of flour, feed, grain, provisions and produce of all kinds, which they handle on commission, effecting immediate sales at best market prices, and make prompt and satisfactory returns to consignors. They also purchase grain, flour and provisions on commission. This house is so well known and has retained its old customers for so long a time, that its reputation for honorable, straightforward dealing is established beyond the requirements of praise. This firm own the only grain elevator in the city.\n\nSweet & McDonald, Harness, Saddles, Bridles, etc., South Railway street, Regina, Assiniboia.\u2014As in most of the leading branches of mechanical art in this country, very remarkable improvement has been effected, within recent years, in the manufacture of harness, saddles, bridles, etc. Among the best known and most popular concerns engaged in this line of business in this country, may be mentioned that of Sweet & McDonald, manufacturers of and dealers in harnesses, saddles, bridles, whips, blankets, nets, etc. This prosperous business was established in 1886 by Messrs. R. Sweet and A. McDonald, the present proprietors, and from its inception has enjoyed a large and substantial patronage; the superior excellence of the goods made and handled, and the energy and enterprise displayed in the management, being among the chief elements contributing to the large measure of success they now deservedly enjoy. We forget to mention that this firm took first prize at the fall exhibition here on single and double harness, making the finest set of harness ever made in Manitoba or the Northwest.\n\nJ. A. McCaul, Lumber, Coal and Insurance, Office Yard, Hamilton street, Regina, Assiniboia.\u2014The growth of the Great Northwest as a country for commercial enterprises has not only been very rapid during the past ten years, but its entire history is one of advanced strides toward the position now so creditably occupied. Every branch of trade has kept pace with this remarkable growth, and to-day are to be seen the colossal results of the ability and energy of our citizens. To single out one department of the country's interests, it would be found that the lumber trade not only represents vast capital invested, but also has had much to do with the country's welfare and prosperity. Among the leading firms in this line is that of Mr. J. A. McCaul, wholesale dealer in lumber, sash, doors, and coal. He also represents the following fire insurance companies:\u2014Glasgow & London, and Quebec, as good companies as are represented in Canada. This business was established in 1882 by Mr. McCaul. His facilities for transacting business are of a strictly first-class character, and he is one of the most highly esteemed business men of the community, and has always given a hearty support to every measure calculated to advance the welfare and prosperity of the country, and he well merits the success he is now achieving.\n\nWm Hunt, Merchant Tailor, South Railway street, Regina, Assiniboia.\u2014As one of the leading houses in this line of business which has been foremost in promoting the standard of elegance in dress, that of Mr. William Hunt has obtained an enviable reputation. He has been established two years, and by strict attention to customers' interests, coupled with a straightforward system of honorable dealing, he has built up a large and influential patronage. His store is eligibly located, and its interior arrangements are neat and attractive. The stock carried embraces a full assortment of the finest imported and domestic woolsens and suiting, in all of the latest and most fashionable shades, colors and designs. His prices are very moderate, and all orders are executed in a prompt and satisfactory manner. He is honorable and fair in all transactions, and well deserving of his success.\n\nWm. M. Child, Butcher and Cattle Dealer, South Railway street, Regina, Assiniboia.\u2014In progress and enterprise in commercial and manufacturing advancement, Regina has not only kept pace with the times, but is conceded to be amongst the foremost. In her establishments, whether of a private or public character, she yields the palm to none. Among these enterprises there are none that have become more conspicuous or attracted more attention from their extending trade than the cattle interests. One of the most thriving and growing concerns in this line is the house of Mr. Wm. M. Childs, originated by him in 1888, with moderate capital and business, which has enjoyed a steady increase in trade up to this time. He does a general butcher business, and deals quite extensively in cattle, buying and selling in large quantities. All of the departments of this establishment are as neat as possible, and are models of cleanliness, and the products of it are unsurpassed in popularity, both as regards the standard, quality and flavor of its meats and the manner of handling. This house is sold, reliable and obliging, and orders, no matter from where or how large, can be filled with accuracy and satisfaction, and it can be relied on for square, honorable dealing in all business transactions.\n\nCharles H. Black, Books, Stationery, Fancy Goods and Wall Paper, Broad street, Regina, Assiniboia.\u2014Few business houses in Regina are more widely or more favorably known than that of Mr. C. H. Black, which, although established only five years ago, has already succeeded in gaining a reputation not often accorded those of much longer standing in other cities. Of course, as far as Regina is concerned, five years is a long time to have been engaged in business, and Mr. Black's business has grown in prosperity as Regina emerged from the position of a village into the leading city of the Northwest. His\nhandsome store occupies one of the best locations in the city, while the stock carried would be a credit to any city. The shelves in this establishment are loaded with the works of the standard authors and with the leading publications of the principal publishers. The show-cases are filled with photograph albums and the choicest styles of fancy goods from the leading American, Canadian and European manufacturers, while he keeps in stock\u2014school books, paper, blank books and stationery of all kinds.\n\nDuring his long and busy career, he has ever sustained an excellent reputation for honorable, straightforward dealing, which has won for him the esteem and confidence of his fellow-citizens.\n\nC. Howson, Dealer in Carriages and Horses, also Livery and Sale Stable, Broad street, Regina, Assiniboia.\u2014One of the old established business men of Regina is Mr. Howson, whose carriage repository and livery stable is located on Broad street. Mr. Howson came to this city in 1882 and put up the first hotel building. He is owner of the Windsor House, which has lately been remodelled and made into a first-class hotel, one of the largest in the Northwest. Mr. Howson does a general business in handling all styles and makes of carriages, buggies, also buying and selling horses. He also conducts the only first-class livery in the city. The building is large and commodious, good ventilation, large stables, and has accommodation for twenty-two head of horses, which are all first-class roadsters, while the rigs are of the most stylish and comfortable to be found anywhere. Mr. Howson enjoys a large and increasing business, and is highly esteemed throughout the city and country. The confidence reposed in him by the citizens was shown by his election in 1888 as alderman.\n\nWindsor House, Mrs. A. A. Doig, Proprietress, Broad street, Regina, Assiniboia.\u2014In a view of Regina as a commercial centre, there is, perhaps, no line of houses more appropriate for special mention or affording more interest to those engaged in all branches of business who are called on to visit the city, than the accommodation for the travelling public. As a commercial centre, and as a central point on the railway between Winnipeg and the Pacific coast, Regina commands a position that essentially calls for first-class hotel accommodations of good capacity and able management. In this respect this city will be found capable of maintaining a reputation equal to any other of the same size in the possession of hostleries unsurpassed in their appointments and the excellence of their management. In support of these assertions, it is only necessary to refer to the Windsor House, this being one of the leading hotels of the country, handsomely furnished, thoroughly fitted up and arranged for the comfort and convenience of its guests. It is centrally located and easily accessible from either the C.P.R. Depot or the business houses of the city. The house has lately been rebuilt and refurnished, now containing twenty-four sleeping rooms, all large, well ventilated and lighted, and equipped in such a manner as to best conduce to the comfort of the most particular parties. The dining-room is commodious, while the table is at all seasons of the year supplied with the best the market affords, the bill of fare being complete in every respect. This house is thoroughly appreciated by the travelling public, and it is the aim of the management to spare no pains in making the guests comfortable. We cordially commend this house to the public as a first-class hotel in every respect.\n\nR. J. Steel, Cigars and Tobacco, Broad street, Regina, Assiniboia.\u2014This is one of the leading and most successful establishments in its special line in the city. Mr. Steel, its enterprising proprietor, started business here in 1887, and by strict attention and a straightforward system of honorable dealing, he has built up a large and permanent patronage. The premises are spacious, admirably arranged and well stocked with a fine and well selected assortment of foreign and domestic cigars, smoking and chewing tobaccos, pipes of all makes and patterns, cigar cases and everything pertaining to smokers' supplies. He sustains an excellent reputation as an energetic, clear-headed business man, liberal and fair in all transactions, and well deserving of the success he has achieved.\n\nThe Leader was started on the 1st of March, 1883. There were then only three timber buildings in the town, the rest of the establishments were tents. Nevertheless, Mr. Davin put in a six-horse power boiler, a Taylor press and a large and complete plant of type for newspaper and job work. From the first issue the paper took a position in Dominion journalism. During the early days of excitement about land its circulation had run as high as 7,000. Its regular average circulation is 1,860. The Leader announced itself as the friend of the settler and the advocate of whatever was in the interest of the Northwest, and the reforms in the Mounted Police, in the land laws. The enlarged liberties for the Territories were advocated by it early, and their triumph admittedly was in the main due to its advocacy. At the office, books, pamphlets, etc., are printed, and thousands of volumes have been turned out. In 1886, owing to increased business, a new Wharfside press was put in. There are larger, but no completer newspaper office can be in existence. The Leader, from the first, has been a power, and since its birth, on the 1st of March, 1883, whatever it has attacked has had to go; whatever it has advocated has been done. Four years ago it advocated throwing open the odd sections for settlement. In March, 1887, it passed from Mr. Davin's hands into those of a company, in which Mr. Davin has still a substantial interest. At this office is printed and published the first and only magazine in the Territories, Our Messenger, a Church of England periodical of sixteen pages.\nMOOSEJAW.\n\nMoosejaw, a divisional terminus town on the C. P. R., of some 600 inhabitants, is 398 miles west of Winnipeg, and is prettily situated in a valley about a mile in width, slightly sloping to the south. The land to the north and south of it is 150 or more feet in height. Settlers began to come into this district early in 1882. In May of 1883 the land was well occupied. The soil varies a good deal in its character; but speaking of it generally, it may be characterized as a clay loam. There is very little of it that is not first-class agricultural land. The greater part of the land in this district was not open for entry until the summer of 1884; and this, combined with the proverbially restless character of the western settler, caused a number of those who originally came to it to go elsewhere. The C. P. R. was not opened as far as Moosejaw until December, 1882. In the spring of 1883, the town came into existence. For a time it made rapid progress; people flocked into it from all quarters, the majority coming, however, from the Province of Ontario. Since that time its growth has been slow, the needs and requirements of the surrounding country being yet fully met by it in its present condition. It was incorporated as a town at the beginning of 1884. The following compose the municipal council for the present year: Mayor, R. Bogue; Councillors\u2014Bellamy, Bates, Campbell, McKenzie, Porter and Whitmore. Its school is very efficiently conducted by two teachers, of whom J. A. McDonald is the senior, and Miss Alexander is the junior. Moose Jaw is the nearest point on the C. P. R. to Prince Albert, both being in the same range 26 W. 2, to Saskatoon, in the Temperance Colonization Society's lands, to Wood Mountain Post, etc. In the town there are three churches, with resident clergymen\u2014the Presbyterian, Methodist, and the English Church. A priest frequently visits and conducts service for the Roman Catholic residents of the town and district. In the town there are stores where all supplies needed by settlers can be obtained at reasonable prices.\n\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF MOOSEJAW.\n\nJ. G. Gordon, Advocate, came to Moose-Jaw in April, 1883. He is a barrister of the Province of Ontario. He was Solicitor of the town after its incorporation, and its Mayor during 1886 and 1887. He has taken an active part in all matters affecting the town and district from the beginning.\n\nR. Bogue, Hardware, Stoves and Tinware, Moose Jaw, Assiniboina.\u2014The special branch of commercial industry pursued by Mr. Bogue is one of such importance, and withal so conducive and necessary to the industrial advantages of the community, as to be deserving of special mention in this work. Of late years there are no branches of business that have so steadily increased in importance and have added so many improvements and acquired such perfection as the hardware trade. It has had the benefit not only of experience, but that of the best mechanical and scientific skill. It may be classed almost with the fine arts, for to such perfection have the manufacturers of different articles coming under the generic term of hardware, brought the results of their ingenuity, that they justly merit a position among artistic productions. Among the many firms engaged in this line of trade in the country, none occupy a more substantial position than Mr. R. Bogue, and none are carrying forward a more promising and growing business. This house was established in 1883, being one of the first buildings erected in Moose Jaw. Thorough knowledge of his business, attention to his custom and fair dealing, soon made their effects known, and his trade has gradually increased, until he now does a large and prosperous business. He carries a large and well selected stock, consisting of every variety of foreign and domestic hardware, saws, shovels, spades, harvest and agricultural tools, builders' and mechanics' supplies, cabinet hardware, chains, anvils, carpenter tools, etc. He also keeps in stock a carefully selected assortment of breech-loading guns, pistols, and sportsmen's goods, ammunition, etc. This establishment will compare most favorably, both in quality of goods kept in stock and amount of business done, with any in the retail hardware trade in this country. Having several years' experience, and conducting his business upon principles of sound mercantile integrity, he justly merits the credit, reputation and confidence which he has acquired. The citizens of Moose Jaw manifested their confidence and esteem by electing him to the mayoralty for 1888.\nJ. J. McLean, Dry Goods, Groceries, Crockery, Boots and Shoes, Clothing, Gents' Furnishings, etc., Moose Jaw, Assiniboia.\u2014In calculating the general aggregate of the commercial and manufacturing importance and progress of this vast western country, the general store trade, in all its various branches, must not be overlooked, as it is a factor of no insignificant dimensions, in the many and varied enterprises which influence the prosperity and material advancement of our country. In the general store trade the annual business is an item of considerable magnitude, and we deem a sketch of the most prominent houses engaged in this trade as an important part of our mission. Mr. McLean may, with justice, be classed under this head, as he is not only one of the most prominent in this business, but also one of the most energetic and enterprising citizens of Moose Jaw. As an instance of what can be accomplished by industry, application to business, and square, honest dealing, supplemented by a goodly share of intelligence, his business has increased and assumed an importance second to no house in the city. He keeps in stock a full and complete assortment of dry goods, groceries, crockery, clothing, gents' furnishings, boots and shoes, etc. Having a thorough knowledge of the business, and excellent judgment in selecting and buying goods, he is able to offer to customers advantages which is not surpassed by any similar concern in the Northwest. Mr. McLean is one of our pioneer merchants, having established his business here in 1883.\n\nE. A. Baker & Co., Hardware, Groceries and Provisions, Moose-Jaw, Assiniboia.\u2014One of the representative business establishments of this city is that of the firm which heads this article, dealers in hardware, guns, ammunition, sportsmen's goods, staple and fancy groceries, etc. This business was established in 1883 by Baker & Lee, Mr. Baker retiring shortly after. Mr. Baker is one of the pioneer merchants of this section of the country, and his extended acquaintance in this community and with buyers from a distance, his experience and business qualifications have placed him in the front rank. The house is centrally located, and there can be found a full and complete assortment of hardware, embracing cutlery of all kinds, edge tools of all makes, and everything pertaining to heavy and shelf hardware, also staple and fancy groceries. Mr. Baker, from his arrival here, has become thoroughly identified with the interests of the city, and regards with much satisfaction any move made or act performed to add to its prosperity.\n\nMEDICINE HAT.\n\nThe prosperous and rising town of Medicine Hat is on the Canadian Transcontinental railway, at the crossing of the South Saskatchewan, and is essentially the creation of the railway, though the spot on which it is built is not without fame, being remembered by a few old rangers as the battle-ground of the Cree and Blackfoot Indians. Here was the dividing line between the kingdoms of respective aboriginal nations, and it was here that the rivals, in pursuit of the buffalo, often met, and then came the tug of war, the deadly hatred of tribe for tribe on their coming together resulting in bloodshed. However, the present town cares very little for the antecedents of the red man, their thoughts being given to the attainment of wealth, and naturally the Hat is a busy town. In the spring of 1883 Medicine Hat consisted of two or three stores on the east and one on the west side of the river, in which resided land speculators awaiting, with more than ordinary interest the advent of the railway. With the railway came civilization, and a town of canvas sprang up as if by the magic wand of the fairy, and soon after all was bustle and stir; and as the work of constructing the road was necessarily slow, on account of the steep hills and the crossing of the river, the merchants reaped a rich harvest from the large number of men who were engaged on the work. The little town met with a disaster on July 2nd, 1883, which swept it almost out of existence. This occurred while the residents were out celebrating Dominion Day. While the sports were in progress, there suddenly arose a hurricane which, with lightning rapidity swept through the valley, carrying before it, in the direction of Dunmore, every movable article, and when at length it ceased, the town was scarcely recognizable. The town soon became itself again, and permanent structures were substituted for the tents, and today it is one of the best built towns on the C. P. R., and the site is unquestionably the prettiest between Rat Portage and Calgary. The country surrounding it is first-class for cattle-raising, and good crops are also grown in the district. The Saskat-\nchewan coal mines are only seven miles distant in a south-easterly direction, and the junction of the Galt line of railway, leading to Lethbridge, is only eight miles east. The town numbers 600 inhabitants, and within its limits are four churches, several general stores, two drug stores, a live weekly newspaper, two hotels, bake-shop, harness-shop, boot and shoe shop, hardware store, millinery and dressmaking establishment, and blacksmith shop. The town has excellent schools. The surrounding country has proved suitable for ranching, and now over 8,000 sheep graze on the neighboring hills, and find their thirst easily quenched in the clear depths of the Saskatchewan, which flows through this fertile valley of the west. Vast coal beds lie in the vicinity and only await the miner's pick to unearth mines of wealth, which will spread its blessings abroad. Fireclay is also found, from which excellent bricks can be manufactured. These latent resources will, it is anticipated be soon developed. The Board of Trade, with J. Tweed as President, L. B Cochrane as Vice, and P. S. Scatcherd as Secretary-Treasurer, enjoy the entire confidence of the people, and will do all in their power to further the welfare of their western home. A large number of men are employed in the C. P. R. shops and on the road in the vicinity, the town being the end of the railroad division. The climate is said to be the mildest in the Medicine Hat district of any portion of Canada. During the last week of January of the present year, ploughing was done close to the town. On account of all these advantages, Medicine Hat must, beyond all question, continue to flourish in the future, as it has been doing in the past.\n\nProminent Business Houses of Medicine Hat.\n\nTweed & Ewart, Wholesale and Retail Dry Goods, Groceries, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Gents' Furnishings, Hardware, etc., Medicine Hat, Assiniboia.\u2014The present age is a busy and progressive one, with competition in all lines of business, so energetic and vigilant as to require, in most lines, the utmost perseverance and enterprise to gain success and keep pace with the times. But while this is proverbially true, there are instances where increasing perseverance, long trained experience and consummate knowledge of business rises superior to competition and defies rivalry. The house of Messrs. Tweed & Ewart may be ranked with this class. This business was established in 1883 by Messrs. Thomas Tweed and John Ewart, the present proprietors being the first to locate here. The premises occupied are large and commodious, the building being two stories in height, and 25 x 100 feet in size. They have also a large warehouse, where is stowed the large and bulky articles. The store-room is most admirably adapted and arranged for their business. They carry a large and most complete stock of dry goods, embracing dress goods, linens, woollens, hosiery, fancy goods, etc., staple and fancy groceries, clothing, gents' furnishings, hats and caps, fur goods, heavy and shelf hardware, etc. The post office is located in the rear of the store. Mr. Tweed being Postmaster and Express Agent, and also President of Medicine Hat Board of Trade. This firm are also largely interested in a cattle ranch, situated about thirty miles south-west of here. It is not the province of this work to indulge in excessive praise of any single establishment, but in this instance we feel that we are not deviating from our rule by asserting that while no establishment in the city has achieved a more respectable position commercially, not one has been conducted upon a basis of more conservative, honorable and liberal principles, or managed with more enterprising progressive policy. With such characteristics and qualifications it is only natural that the trade should grow to be as extensive as it is.\n\nGeo. McCuaig & Co., Wholesale and Retail Dry Goods, Groceries, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Hardware, etc., Medicine Hat, Assiniboia.\u2014Certainly the Northwest has not neglected her mercantile or commercial opportunities, and that this is especially true with regard to her general store merchants will be seen by reference to the notices of her leading representative houses, and the statistics furnished relative to their importance and extensive trade in other portions of this works. Possessing unsurpassed facilities in her geographical position and modes of transportation, as well as in the enterprise and high standing of her leading merchants in this line, Medicine Hat can to-day furnish the staple articles of trade at prices which will compete successfully with eastern dealers, and effect a great saving in freight to parties throughout the surrounding country. Prominent among the houses engaged in the general store trade, may appropriately be mentioned that of G. McCuaig & Co. This business was founded by Mr. McCuaig in 1883. They keep a full and complete stock of general merchandise, such as dry goods, embracing silks, woollens, linens, hosiery, notions, etc., choice teas, coffees, sugar, syrup, canned goods, etc., clothing,\nthe latest styles of boots and shoes, heavy and shelf hardware, etc., and comprising every article pertaining to this line of trade. Mr. McCaig sustains an excellent reputation for honorable dealing, and is well known as a liberal, conscientious business man. Through his own efforts he has achieved success, and he well merits the esteem and respect in which he is held.\n\nE. Walton, Druggist and Chemist, Books and Stationery, Medicine Hat, Assiniboia.\u2014Of all the branches of business connected with the mercantile industries of the Northwest, there are none of more importance than the drug trade; none requiring more ability, closer study, or more thorough preparation. One of the neatest and most attractive establishments in this trade is that of the courteous gentleman, Mr. E. Walton. He occupies a handsome store, which is tastefully fitted up and presents an attractive appearance. He carries a large and well-selected stock, as complete as any in this section, consisting of pure drugs and medicines, all popular and reliable patent preparations, chemicals, surgical instruments and appliances of the finest quality, toilet and fancy articles, perfumery, druggist sundries, books and stationery, and all such goods as are to be found in well conducted establishments of this kind. He is a thoroughly skilled, scientific and practical druggist and pharmacist, enjoying a high reputation in his department, he bestows his personal attention on his large and growing prescription trade. He possesses the confidence and esteem of the medical profession. This with his energy and enterprise, has won for him the confidence and patronage of the public.\n\nM. Leonard, Bakery and Confectionery, Medicine Hat, Assiniboia.\u2014This name has long been familiar to the homes and tables of the citizens of this place, and is certainly entitled to creditable mention among the leading houses of this city. This business was established by Mr. Leonard in 1883 with medium capital, which has since been handsomely increased. He occupies a large and commodious building, well arranged and equipped with the latest and most improved appliances necessary for the transaction of business. He manufactures the best bread, pastries and cakes of every description, and is prepared to supply the choicest cakes for weddings or parties. Ice cream of all flavors is also kept constantly on hand in its season, as well as a stock of the choicest foreign and domestic fruits, nuts, candies, etc. He supplies the C.P.R. dining cars with bread, cakes, etc., also doing a large business at Dunmore Station. Mr. Leonard is of high standing in the community, and his excellent management and long experience has secured him liberal and deserved patronage.\n\nL. B. Cochran, Dry Goods, Groceries, Clothing, Medicine Hat, Assiniboia.\u2014This establishment was opened for trade in 1886, with a full and very carefully selected stock of dry goods, groceries, clothing, boots and shoes, etc. Mr. Cochran has had probably as much experience in this business as any man in the trade in this town, and that systematic, thorough manner of transacting business, which long continued practice, has so rooted into his life that it seems a part of his character; combined with this he possesses that rare good taste which experience only cultivates and refines. His trade is increasing and his annual business will simply compensate for the risks attending his venture into the uncertain waves of mercantile life. His stock is ample, consisting of dry goods, staple and fancy groceries, clothing, gent's furnishings, etc. Progressive, prompt, reliable and thoroughly conversant with his business and its details, he is entitled to a high position in commercial circles, and merits signal prosperity in his business operations. Mr. Cochran has been a resident of this place since its inception in 1883.\n\nS. B. Yuill, Diamonds, Jeweler and Watchmaker, Medicine Hat, Assiniboia.\u2014This house has been established for the past five years and has built up a large and permanent patronage. The store is eligibly located, and well arranged, displaying to advantage a splendid stock of diamonds and fine gold and silver watches, clocks, jewelry, silverware, etc. Only the best and most reliable goods are kept in stock, and offered at the lowest possible prices. Mr. Yuill is an expert, practical watchmaker and jeweler, and brings to bear a thorough knowledge of the business. He is prepared to execute all orders in his line in the promptest and most satisfactory manner. Personally he is well known in trade circles as an honorable, conscientious business man, liberal and fair in all transactions, and well meriting the patronage he now enjoys.\n\nAmerican House, J. C. A. McRea, Proprietor, Medicine Hat, Assiniboia.\u2014The American House was erected in 1883, and is a large two story building. The street floor is taken up by the office, smoking room, sample rooms, bar, billiard room and dining room, and is thus very conveniently arranged in every respect. On the second floor are the parlors and twenty-five sleeping rooms, all large and well furnished. The building is constructed with a view to comfort and convenience throughout, is neatly furnished in every particular, and is capable of accommodating about 50 guests. Mr. McRea, the proprietor, is a gentleman of extensive experience in hotel business, and in this house has given unmistakable proofs of being the accomplished host. His hotel has proved a great boon to the travelling public, and must still rank among the best houses in the Northwest. Its location is extremely convenient, being right opposite the C. P. R. Depot and in the centre of the business portion of the city.\n\nMedicine Hat \"Times.\"\u2014The Medicine Hat Times was founded in October, 1885, by A. M. Armour, who presided as editor and publisher until August, 1886, when he was succeeded by B. J. McMahon. The paper was edited by Mr. McMahon until February, 1887, but was not a success, until D. G. Holt assumed the management, for the shareholders, after a month's suspension. From the time Mr. Holt took charge, until the present time, the paper has continued to thrive, and its influence has extended till it is now recognized as one of the leading independent local journals of the Northwest.\n\nJ. R. McInnis, Boots and Shoes, Anthracite, Alberta.\u2014The art of making boots and shoes to fit the feet of the wearers with nicety, and afford no pain or injury, is one of sufficient importance to demand some attention. The subject of this brief sketch has made this art a study, and by long experience has learned just how to adapt the last to its particular work. Commencing in 1887, at Medicine Hat, he has built up for himself a reputation which placed him at the very head of the custom boot and shoe trade of this country, and in a short time increased his business over 200 per cent. He also keeps in stock a full and complete assortment of American, Canadian, and English makes of boots, shoes, slippers, rubber goods and everything pertaining to a first-class boot and shoe establishment. Ladies and gentlemen will find it greatly to their comfort to call on Mr. McInnis, who guarantees such fits as shall make pedestrianism a matter of thorough enjoyment and delight, instead of the unutterable torture it frequently becomes.\nLETHBRIDGE.\n\nEight hundred miles west of Winnipeg and 109 miles from Dunmore lies Lethbridge, so named in honour of the president of the Northern Coal and Navigation Company, to whose efforts and those of Sir Alexander Galt, much of the coal explorations of this district are accredited. The town is in its fourth year, but is already presenting an appearance of which the inhabitants, which number 1,200, have no need to feel ashamed. North of the town, and 200 feet below its level, flows the Belly river; the walls rise perpendicularly from the brink of the stream, which rushes and tumbles over its stony bed. The water is pure, clear and cold, coming as it does uncontaminated from its mother glacier. Its tributaries on the west are the Kootenai, Old Man's, Willow Creek and numerous smaller streams; further east, the Little Bow river adds its volume of water, and the river rushes on to the Big Bend, where the name is changed to the South Saskatchewan. The town being situated on a high plateau, the strong western winds entirely rid the country of any germs of disease that might be present had the town site been located under the lee of the surrounding hills. These winds are not always friendly, but when health and adverse winds are weighed in the balance, the former preponderates. The town has railway connection with the C. P. R. via the Galt line, 109 miles in length. Three times a week the stage runs to Fort McLeod, all the travel to and from this town now comes through Lethbridge, and as there is large consumption in this district, Lethbridge enjoys the added trade. Lethbridge has three hotels, a weekly newspaper, the Lethbridge News, three churches, a branch of the Union Bank of Canada, a drug-store, and four general stores, with railway facilities for procuring from Winnipeg any desired article inside of two days.\n\nStock raising is carried on extensively in the vicinity. It is estimated that from 5 to 6 million acres of land are suitable for pasture land, 90,000 head of cattle are scattered over this vast expanse of undulating prairie. It will be seen that there is ample accommodation for many thousands more. The law requires one head of stock to every ten acres and a cent an acre is charged for the land. The land is leased, and some companies hold as much as 300,000 acres. Looking from the car window, tracks of buffalo may be seen worn 4 inches through the soil about 1\u00bd feet wide. The trails lie close together, but all lead to the Saskatchewan river; the aborigines testify that this is a sure sign of good pasturage. In the summer of 1881, Sir Alexander Galt, Mr. Lethbridge, of London, England, and several other gentlemen obtained their leases for coal lands in Alberta. The mines were opened at Lethbridge and during the summer of '83 and '84, 3,000 tons of soft coal were delivered to the C. P. R. at Medicine Hat. This proving satisfactory, a narrow gauge railway was constructed between the mines and Dunmore. The capital is \u00a3150,000 sterling. The output is 430 tons per day, and it is expected that it will be doubled when the machinery now being placed is got to work. The company employ 350 workmen, many of whose families reside in Lethbridge. The pay-roll amounts to $20,000 per month. The country in every direction is rapidly being settled. The importance of the town as a distributing centre is recognized far and wide. Red sandstone red brick clay and sand are plentiful, and lumber can now be procured at a reasonable rate. The soil is fertile, the water and fuel supply good, a lively business is done in all lines and with every requisite for the maintenance of its children. Lethbridge bids fair to become one of the first cities of the North-West.\nMACLEOD.\n\nOn the south bank of Old Man's River, thirty miles west of Lethbridge, is the prosperous town of Macleod. Situated in the centre of the famous ranching district which bears its name, it does a large and profitable business, which last year aggregated about $350,000. Macleod was founded in 1874 by Col. Macleod, who, with a force of 150 men\u2014the pioneer troop of the Mounted Police\u2014made a memorable march across the plains in search of whiskey peddlers. Here a fort was erected, and it was unanimously determined to call it after its popular founder, the name of the barracks being afterwards transferred to the town itself. Macleod was then cut off from communication with Canada, and was reached by way of the Missouri river to Benton, thence by a stage journey of 200 miles. At its inception, such extensive firms as I. G. Baker & Co. and T. C. Power & Co., opened branches and were soon followed by other merchants. In the year 1876, farming operations were inaugurated, and a few years later, the capabilities of the county for cattle raising being appreciated, large herds were brought in and the venture proving profitable, a number of stock companies were organized, and the cattle business at once expanded into pretty large proportions. There was an extensive fur trade done here with the Indians, but the buffalo becoming extinct in 1878, it fell off to a mere nothing. Near the close of 1877, a treaty was concluded with the Bloods, Blackfeet, Piegan, Stonies and Sarcees, and the first payment under the treaty was made them. This contributed to the welfare of the town, as the money was mostly spent with the merchants. The five years that followed 1879, when the government assumed the maintenance of the Indians, rendered necessary by the practical extinction of the buffalo in the previous year, was an epoch of steady progress and prosperity for the settlement. The experiment of farming has proved successful, and as the three years term of enlistment of the police expired, we find many of them adopting this vocation. Cattle ranching had become a craze, and from both sides of the Atlantic, capital poured in seeking investment in a new and profitable enterprise. This brought in its train an immigration insignificant compared with the amount of wealth invested, certainly, but remarkable as being almost the only immigration that the inherent qualities of the country itself attracted. In 1882, Mr. C. E. D. Wood started the Macleod Gazette, a live enterprising paper, and Harry Taylor, who is known far and wide as \"Kamouse\", opened an hotel some few years previously. Macleod possesses a good school, 53 residence of all kinds, 4 churches and parsonage, 2 blacksmith shops, 2 laundries, 3 livery stables, 9 saloons, 2 butcher shops, 15 stores and a number of miscellaneous buildings. The location of Macleod is a lovely one. To the northwest, rise the wooded summits of the Porcupines, while away to the west, and circling southward, the magnificent peaks of the rocky range meet and enchant the eye.\u2014Chief mountain, a massive collection of huge rocks with the boundary line dividing it in two, standing out by itself a conspicuous landmark, which can be seen at 200 miles away.\nTHE DISTRICT OF ALBERTA.\n\nThe district of Alberta lies directly to the west of Assiniboia, and, with an area of about 100,000 square miles, extends north from the 49\u00b0 to the 55\u00b0 parallel, and from Assiniboia to the summit of the Rockies. Alberta is pre-eminently the dairy region of America. Its cold, sparkling streams and nutritious and luxuriant grasses, make it a very paradise for cattle, the mildness of the winters enabling them to graze all the year around. Numerous ranches have already been started, and while there are now over 100,000 head of cattle, besides sheep and horses, feeding on the plains, they are capable of herding vastly increased numbers. And, it is gratifying to know, the numbers are rapidly increasing. It has been demonstrated by actual experience that with careful management the cattle thrive well in the winter, the percentage of loss being much less than that estimated for when these ranches were undertaken. We have in these facts the commencement of great industries, and these ranches will very soon commence to send their cattle and horses and sheep by thousands to the eastern markets, including those of the United Kingdom. The question has been raised in the past as to the suitability of Alberta for ordinary farming operations, an opinion prevailing that it should be given up to ranches. This question, however, of its suitability for mixed farming, especially that in which dairying has a large share, is no longer doubtful, proof having been furnished by actual results. It has been shown, even in an unfavourable year, that crops of grains, including wheat, and roots and vegetables, in the vicinity of Calgary, were large and perfectly ripened, leaving nothing in this respect to be desired. Such being the fact, it will assuredly follow that settlement, having for its industries mixed arable and stock farming, will rapidly take place. The country along the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, from Moose Jaw to Calgary, has been commonly said to be a desert, incapable of growing crops. It is true that at certain seasons the aspect of these plains is not very inviting, but it has also been demonstrated to be true, that the theory advanced by Prof. Macoun, botanist of the exploratory surveys of the Canadian Pacific Railway, has proved to be quite correct. These plains in their natural state, as the summer advances, have a baked and in some places cracked appearance; but when the surface of this crust is broken in the spring, it absorbs the rain-fall, and has sufficient moisture for vegetation, in place of shedding it, with, at the same time, the conditions of rapid evaporation, these combined causes producing apparent aridity. In 1884, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company caused a series of experimental farms to be tried, without any special selection of site, the places being chosen for convenience near the railway stations, which are placed at certain fixed distances from each other. The result of these experiments, without exception, was luxuriant crops of wheat and other grains, and vegetables of every kind put down. Mr. Mackenzie, late Premier of Canada, who was one of these who were sceptical as to the capability of those plains for cultivation, visited these farms during the summer, and expressed himself astonished at the favourable results he saw. He found oats to be so luxuriant that he might hide himself among them walking upright. The uniform success of these experimental farms at so many different points settled the question as to the adaptability for cultivation of the formerly so-called \"arid plains\" of the vast steppe of the continent of America, in the North-West Territory of Canada. With respect to those portions of these North-West\nplains of Canada in which alkali is found, Prof. Macoun declares that these will become the most valuable of the wheat lands, as settlement progresses, the alkali being converted into a valuable fertilizer by the admixture of barn-yard manure. The professor further contends that these alkaline plains will become the great wheat fields of the American continent long after the now fertile prairies and fields to the east shall have become exhausted.\n\nBut it is not only its agricultural resources that enrich Alberta. It possesses a vast extent of coal fields, and there is a world of minerals yet to explore in the Rockies and their foot-hills\u2014not only iron, copper, and galena, but gold and silver; and besides, in the timber clad sides of the mountains is another source of wealth. But, perhaps, the most important are the coal fields, from which shipments have already been made as far east as Winnipeg, and as far west as Victoria, B.C., and San Francisco. The zone of cove fields which borders on the Rockies between the United States and the Peace River, extends northwards nearly 450 miles, and with a mean width of about 125 miles, comprises an area of nearly 55,000 square miles. Government surveys, already made, establish beyond doubt that through this large area there are coal and lignite in great abundance, and that in some places, the mining of the \"dusky diamond\" is comparatively very easy and inexpensive. According to Dr. Dawson, the approximate estimates underlying a square mile of country in different localities are as follows:\n\n- **Main Seam**, in vicinity of Coal Banks, Belly River. Coal underlying one square mile, 5,500,000 tons.\n- **Grassy Island**, Bow River (continuation of Belly River Main Seam). Coal underlying one square mile, over 5,000,000 tons.\n- **Horseshoe Bend**, Bow River. Coal underlying one square mile, 4,900,000 tons.\n- **Blackfoot Crossing**. Workable coal seam as exposed on Bow River. Underlying one square mile, 9,000,000 tons.\n\nThere is thus under one square mile of territory a sufficiency of coal for a large population in the North-West to last at least for one generation; and whether the coal fields are continuous or not, there are many thousands of square miles of them.\n\nThe coal-bearing rocks developed so extensively on the Bow and Belly Rivers and their tributaries are known to extend far to the north and west, though, up to the present time, it has been impossible to examine them at more than a few points. On the North Saskatchewan, several seams of lignite-coal, resembling those of the Souris River region, outcrop at Edmonton. The most important is about six feet in thickness, and has been worked to some extent for local purposes. Thirty miles above Edmonton a much more important coal seam occurs. This, as described by Dr. Selwyn, has a thickness of eighteen to twenty feet. It is of excellent quality, and much resembles the \"Coal Banks\" coal from the Bow River. Good anthracite coal has also been found near the Pacific Railway, at the point of its entrance in the Rocky Mountains, large shipments of which have profitably been made to the Pacific coast.\n\nIn addition to all this, Alberta is, with the gifts nature has no lavishly bestowed upon it, a natural resort for the tourist and the healthseeker, the magnificent scenery of the eastern slope of the Rockies being not the least attraction.\n\nAlberta, with a population of 15,532, according to the last census, contains many thriving towns, amongst which the following may be mentioned:\nCalgary, the most western town of the prairies and the gateway of the country from the west, is situated 838 miles west of the city of Winnipeg and 60 miles east of the base of the Rocky Mountains. It is in the centre of a beautiful hill-girt plateau, and almost entirely surrounded by the Bow and Elbow rivers. In front of the town, and on either side, the mountains rise in varied forms, and in endless change of aspect as the lights and shadows play upon them. Behind it is the great sea of open prairie, and to the northward is the wooded district of Edmonton and the North Saskatchewan. Southwards, stretching away 150 miles to the United States boundary, is the ranche country, where countless herds may be seen feeding out upon the plain. Cattle and horses graze at will all over the country, summer and winter alike. The warm Chinook winds from across the mountains keep the ground free from snow in the winter, except for a day or two at a time, and the nutritious and naturally cured grasses are always within reach of the cattle. The incorporation of Calgary dates only from 1885, Mr. George Murdoch being the first mayor. The present civic officials are:\u2014A. E. Shelton, Mayor; Aldermen\u2014W. F. Orr, H. Collins, H. Douglas, G. McCallum, James Linton and Alex. Allen. E. P. Davis is the City Clerk; H. Barber, Treasurer; G. C. Marsh, Assessor, and J. Ingram, Chief of Police. The town has grown very rapidly since the arrival of the railway, and to-day has a population of about 3000. Prior to the advent of the Canadian Pacific Railway, Calgary was known only as a Hudson's Bay post, which had gathered around it a few trading institutions. To-day it is the distributing point for a great portion of the immense territory of Alberta and the mountain country to the west, freight for Edmonton and the North Saskatchewan country all passing through here. There is also a considerable amount of business done in the fur line here. The legal and medical professions are well represented. There are also two or three fire and life insurance agents located here. There are also two saw mills, one planing mill, three first class hotels, three banks, four churches\u2014Presbyterian, Catholic, English and Methodist. The chief industry of the surrounding country is ranching or stock-raising\u2014though farming is receiving more attention of late. The first shipment of cattle from the ranches to Britain were made last summer. About 1300 head of beef steers were sent out, some of which were sold in Montreal. This is only the commencement of a trade which is expected to reach great proportions. It is estimated that there are about 100,000 head of cattle in Alberta. Sheep and horses are also raised extensively. In the latter, attention is being given to producing superior saddle horses especially. A number of thoroughbred stallions, Kentucky running stock, and Irish mares have been imported during last season. About 15,000 hides were handled last year, and it is thought a tannery might be made a profitable investment. Coal is abundant in the Bow River valley, west of the town, in the valley of which river the town is beautifully situated, providing an abundance of excellent water. The place is now lighted by electricity, and schemes are on hand to provide water works, and to make a test for natural gas, of which there are excellent indications. A charter is out for a railway to run northward from here, to tap the rich Saskatchewan country. The many costly private residences which have been erected of late is a surprise to the visitor who has inspected other western towns, and noted the usual cheap style of buildings. Building operations in 1886\nwere carried on to the extent of $205,000, and in 1887 $270,000 were expended in buildings. Calgary affords a good opportunity for the establishment of a butter and cheese dairy, prices for these products being high and the supply limited. A good field is also open here for the establishment of a woollen mill, flour mill, tannery. Hemlock bark, of a very superior quality, can be obtained in abundance in the Selkirk ranges. It is estimated that no less than $1,250,000 changed hands in business transactions during the year 1887, $400,000 of this sum being expended on land transactions, and $300,000 worth of building was also done in the same year. Statistics show that there are 125,000 head of cattle, 20,000 head of horses, and 40,000 sheep in the Alberta district. Speaking of the climate of Calgary, the Alberta Stock Journal of February, 1888, says\u2014\n\n\"For the past month the weather has been all that could be desired, the thermometer ranging away up in the thirties above zero. A balmy Chinook has been raising sad havoc with the snow and ice, causing everybody to wear a smile of entire satisfaction. Even the full-fledged chronic kicker from Bruce is forced into wearing a pleasant countenance, an occurrence which has never been heard of in any other country, and seems to have come to the conclusion that this life is not such an unpleasant affair after all, and is well worth living, especially in Alberta. Reports come in every day from all points in the north, east, south and west that cattle have never been in finer condition, and a most profitable year is anticipated. Between 8,000 and 10,000 steers are already in the hands of agents for shipment and the prospects are good for a much heavier shipment during the season. We think this is an excellent showing for a young country, and, with the many new industries to be started in the spring, ought to make Alberta a most prosperous province. Alberta as a stock-raising country is unsurpassed, and its many natural advantages will no doubt induce a large number to engage in every kind of business throughout the province during the coming year. The principal need of Alberta is more factories, and if the people are wide-awake in answering the enquiries of eastern capitalists in regard to the inducements to be offered to those engaging in manufacturing of all kinds, many could be induced to settle here and so build up the country in every way.\"\n\nWhile the people of Calgary are of a frugal nature, their whole attention is not given to the making of the \"Mighty Dollar.\" Educational matters are given, as they deserve, a great deal of consideration, and a great deal of money is spent in the cultivation of the young, whom, their parents seem bound shall not grow up in ignorance and therefore they are not stingy in such matters, but have secured competent instructors, who are paid large salaries. The press is well represented by the Tribune and the Herald, which publish daily and weekly editions. There is also an excellent journal devoted to the stock raising industry, the Alberta Live Stock Journal. Farming operations are also carried on to a very large extent, in this district, and this portion of the territories presents unmistakable evidences of the fact that it is fast becoming, if indeed this zenith is not already reached, the \"cattle ranch of the world.\" All the scientists, as well as practical cattle raisers, who have closely examined the country, agree as to its wonderful fitness for the raising of cattle and horses, and already population is pouring in to occupy what, but a very short time ago, was known as the \"Great Lone Land,\" but which, before long, will be filled by industrious and prosperous communities.\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF CALGARY.\n\nI. G. Baker & Co., J. L. Bowen, manager, Wholesale and Retail Dry Goods, Groceries, Crockery, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, etc., corner Stephen avenue and MacTavish streets, Calgary, Alta.\u2014The business prosperity, enterprise and solidity of a city are in a large measure indicated by the extent and character of her commercial houses. The great mercantile houses of the country have exercised a powerful influence, and the old, wealthy and successful establishments have become familiar, by name and reputation, in all sections of the land. Calgary is most favorably situated as to the great arteries and highways of commerce, having invaluable connections, by rail and stage, with the north, south, east and west\u2014her mercantile ramifications extending in every direction, and yearly growing larger and more important. One of the great factors in her progress and improvement has been her general store interest and the history of her large wholesale and retail houses; while a necessary and integral part of her statistical biography is interesting and valuable as an historical record and useful for purposes of reference. In 1866, I. G. Baker & Co. started business at Fort Benton, Montana, U.S., running a line of steamboats from St. Louis, Mo., up the Missouri River to Fort Benton. In 1875 this firm established a branch at Calgary, being the first store here, under the management of D. W. Davis, who is now general manager for the Northwest Territory, located at Fort McLeod. The McLeod branch was started in 1872, and the Lethbridge establishment in 1885. Mr. J. L. Bowen, the present manager for the Calgary district, succeeded Mr. G. C. King in 1882. This house pushed their business energetically, and carried their transactions into all the neighboring territories, extending their influence and regulation gradually and surely. This house ranks as the leading establishment (wholesale and retail) in this part of the country, a position to which they are justly entitled and freely accorded, from their extensive transactions and the magnitude of their stock. Through all the years that this house has been in existence, the trade incident to its long career and the late depression in business, it has maintained, with brightening reputation, the perfect system, the high degree of mercantile integrity, the elevated business enterprise with which it was inaugurated by its founder, I. G. Baker. Wealth is one of the elements of success; but it is non-effective and a resultless ingredient when not combined with business sagacity, which acts as a balance valve in the regulation of the supply of motive power which capital furnishes. In the narrative of the progress and development of this great house, an illustration can be found of the grandly superior power of ability, and clear thought, even in prosperity, and the subordination of capital to enterprise and adaptability. The business house of the firm consists of a fine cut stone building, two stories and basement, 30x100 feet in dimensions, fronting on Stephen avenue. The immense business is thoroughly organized under different departments, managed by competent men, all under the constant supervision of the manager, and in these departments can probably be found more goods suited to the wants of the people in this section of the country than can be found under any one roof in the Northwest. They carry a large and complete stock, embracing dry goods of all kinds, foreign and domestic, staple and fancy groceries, crockery, clothing, gent's furnishings, boots and shoes of all styles and makes, etc., etc. Mr. J. L. Bowen, the popular manager, has an experience acquired by a connection with this house of many years' standing, he is a gentleman of enterprise and energy, coupled with invariable courtesy and liberality.\n\nGeorge Murdoch, Wholesale and Retail Saddlery, Harness and Saddlery Hardware, Atlantic avenue east, Calgary, Alta.\u2014The most extensive harness and saddlery establishment in Calgary, and unsurpassed by any house in the Northwest, is that conducted by Mr. George Murdoch. In general variety and quality of goods this establishment is unequalled. The business was established in 1882, being the first of its kind west of Brandon, Man., and by enterprise he has increased the trade to very large proportions. The premises occupied on Atlantic avenue is a three story brick building, 25x70 feet in dimensions, stocked with every variety of goods pertaining to the business. A glance at the large stock carried in this establishment shows harness, saddles, bridles, chaps, whips, brushes, blankets, robes, trunks, valises, saddlery hardware, etc. A specialty is made of stock saddles. All the saddles, harness, collars, etc., are made in the establishment, and an immense stock of foreign and domestic goods is carried besides. The factory is fitted up with all the newest machinery, and the fine character of the work done is acknowledged by most competent judges. Mr. Murdoch is a thoroughly practical man, giving close personal attention to his business, and is highly esteemed throughout the entire Northwest. He was Calgary's first mayor, being elected in 1883.\n\nJohn Field, Wholesale and Retail Druggist and Chemist, Stephen avenue, Calgary, Alta.\u2014One of the most popular drug stores in this city is that of Mr. John Field. The store is admirably arranged, while the stock carried embraces a full assortment of pure drugs, chemicals and proprietary medicines of standard reputation, fancy and toilet articles, perfumery, and everything pertaining to a first-class drug store. Special attention is given to the careful compounding of physicians' prescriptions, and in this department a large business is done. This business was established in 1886 by Mr. Field, and since its inception it has grown to large proportions. He is a gentleman enjoying the utmost confidence of all who know him, and is drawing from among the people a large and lucrative patronage. As a gentleman and business man, he is energetic and reliable, well deserving of the high esteem in which he is held. Mr. Field is a native of Brighton, England, where he was a prominent citizen, having served several terms there as a member of the city council.\n\nHull, Trounce & Co., Wholesale and Retail Butchers, Cattle, Sheep and Horse Dealers, corner MacTavish street Stephen avenue, Calgary, Alta.\u2014No firm in the country stands higher in commercial life than Messrs. Hull, Trounce & Co., nor has any firm any better or greater advantages. The large number of cattle, sheep and horses raised in the country surrounding, not only in this district but for hundreds of miles east, west, north and south, and for which Calgary is the great central market, makes this business not only a very lucrative one, but one of enormous proportions. Messrs. Hull, Trounce & Co., one of the pioneer firms of this country, have no superiors as business men, and no concern stands higher in commercial life. This firm brings to bear splendid\nbusiness qualifications, a large and successful experience and an influence excelled by none. The firm as it stands today is one of the strongest in the country. The large trade which they enjoy extends over a great portion of the Northwest Territory and British Columbia, they having branch houses at Banff, Donald, Revelstoke, while at Kamloops their establishment is as extensive as it is here. They are also owners of a large cattle ranch located on Mosquito Creek, fifty-five miles south of Calgary.\n\nThe members of the firm are W. R. Hull, W. P. Trounce and J. R. Hull. Not only is the firm one of most substantial character, but it is progressive. There is no enterprise that will tend to advance the business interests of the country that Messrs. Hull, Trounce & Co. are not found in the front rank as promoters and subscribers, for which alone they are justly entitled to their present commercial prosperity. Mr. H. P. Brown, the manager for the Calgary district, formerly manager for Dunn & Linenham, is highly esteemed and respected by the business men and citizens of Calgary.\n\nR. H. Moody, Real Estate Agent and Valuator, Stephen avenue, Calgary, Alta.\u2014In publishing a statistical history of a city and collecting data incident thereto, we find classes of businesses outside of the regular branches, co-relative, in fact, with the professions, which exercise an important influence in the progress of the city towards prosperity and commercial enterprise. Of these none are more important than real estate agencies. A great portion of the prosperity is entrusted to their talents and ability, either for selling or buying. In pursuance of this business they necessarily influence the value of property, fixing the selling or renting prices, and while doing this, their assistance is invaluable, lifting the trouble and annoyance attending those matters from the minds of owners, and relieving them from much petty care. It is a business requiring energy, industry and sound principles. One of the most successful agencies in this city is that of Mr. R. H. Moody, whose office is located on Stephen avenue West. Mr. Moody, established himself here in the real estate business in 1885 with small capital, but with a thorough knowledge of the business and great faith in the prosperity of the country, he has gradually but surely laid the foundation of one of the best businesses in the city. Mr. Moody is one of Calgary's self-made business men. Coming here less than three years ago, with but $500, he has, by judicious investments, accumulated property, which, placing it at its lowest value, amounts to about $30,000. There is no financial interest of such magnitude and importance as that involved in real estate, and the great demand for eligible city and suburban property, coupled with a steady rise in values, is the best evidence of Calgary's growing wealth and prosperity. Mr. Moody possesses all the qualifications necessary for making him a valuable man in the business. Activity, prudence, good judgment and keen business tact, the management of estates, buying and selling properties, are the main characteristics of his business. The success of Mr. Moody fully attests his popularity, public confidence and possession of qualities peculiarly fitting him for his pursuit, and establishing his reputation for integrity, close attention to his business, upright and honorable dealing, has placed him on a solid basis.\n\nG. C. King & Co., Wholesale and Retail General Merchants, corner Stephen avenue and Oder street, Calgary, Alta.\u2014Among the several firms in Calgary engaged in the general store trade, none occupy a more prominent position with reference to extent, general appointments and magnitude, as well as variety of stock, than the establishment of G. C. King & Co. This widely known house was established in 1882. The premises occupied are most eligibly situated on Stephen avenue, in the centre of the business traffic of the city. The building, a handsome two-story and basement brick edifice, 30 x 60 feet in dimensions, is one of the handsomest business houses in the city. The two floors of this building are engrossed in the prosecution of the trade, and are fitted up for the rapid and convenient transaction of business, in a manner worthy of the character and high standing of the concern. The general furnishing and appointments are all that could be desired. The first floor is occupied as the main salesroom; it is admirably lighted and adapted for the exhibition and inspection of goods, which, with other advantages, makes it one of the most elegant and spacious business departments in the city. The stock embraces a full and complete assortment of foreign and domestic dry goods, carpets, staple and fancy groceries, crockery, clothing, gent's furnishings, boots and shoes, etc. For more than six years, Mr. G. C. King has exerted a marked influence in business circles, to the benefit of the general public, by whom he is justly esteemed as one of the oldest and most widely experienced representative business men of Calgary. In his thorough and detailed knowledge of everything pertaining to or contingent upon his business, he has few equals. Prompt, reliable and liberal, with an activity and industry that knows no pause, he has made his house a favorite one for those who have once appreciated the advantages to be derived there in prices. With these advantages and facilities, natural and acquired, it is no matter of surprise that the trade of this house has extended not only throughout the city, but north, south, east and west through the territory, with the high standard of commercial honor and enterprise with which he conducts his business, he well merits the respect accorded him.\n\nPrior to 1882 Mr. King was manager for I. G. Baker & Co.\n\nEdwin R. Rogers, Wholesale and Retail Hardware, Stoves, Tinware, Paints, Oils, etc., Stephen avenue East, Calgary, Alta.\u2014In a work embodying the various industries of the city, its business facilities and prominent features, for the general information of the public, at home and abroad, which will elicit present and future interests, it is only proper that the representative house in their respective lines, with their facilities for transacting business, should be clearly set forth. The hardware trade, especially in competent hands, is no unimportant factor in the general mercantile progress of this city, and an element that has conduced largely to her reputation as a commercial point. In connection with this trade, the house of Mr. Edwin R. Rogers is worthy of special mention, both from the extent of his transactions, his noteworthy and unusual experience in his business, and his high standing in other respects. This business was established by Rogers & Grant in 1884, Mr. Rogers, the present proprietor, assuming control in 1887. Possessed of undaunted pluck, systematic business habits, and a high order of ability, his enterprise may be said to have been a success from the start, and ever since its existence it has been conducted with energy, ability and liberality without interruption, regardless of general commercial derangements, financial panics or social upheavals. He occupies a large two-story building, 45 x 60 feet in dimensions, stocked with as large and complete an assortment of heavy and shelf hardware as can be found in the Northwest, consisting of every variety of foreign and domestic goods.\nworthy of handling\u2014cutlery, saws, shovels, spades; harvest and agricultural implements, builders, machinists, artists, railway and cabinet hardware, chains, anvils, nails, etc., stoves, ranges, heaters, tin and copper ware of all descriptions. This house compares with any in the West, and stands in the front rank of business houses of Calgary. His trade is located in this city and surrounding country, and he is prepared at all times to fill orders from any point for any goods in the hardware line. Experience in mercantile ethics is equal to capital, and in this qualification, Mr. Rogers has no peer in this section and few in any other.\n\nLafferty & Smith, Bankers, Stephen avenue, East Calgary, Alta.\u2014That the banks of this country are making rapid progress, which will soon give them rank with the greatest in the country, is evident to every sagacious business man. Their true pre-eminence, however, its causes, and the volume of business transacted by them is comparatively little understood. For the past few years their record has been most gratifying, showing good profits, increased surpluses, strengthened confidence, extended business facilities and connections with the leading banking centres of the civilized world. We are growing each year more and more independent, and owing to the accumulation of capital in the country we have rarely need to order currency from the East. Among the prominent banks above referred to is the pioneer banking firm of Messrs. Lafferty & Smith, established in 1882, with head office at Calgary, Alberta N.W.T., and branch agencies at Regina, Moosomin and Edmonton, all in Northwest Territories. They transact a general banking business, deal in domestic and foreign exchange, issue drafts on all points, receive deposits, and do general discounting, make loans on live stock, and advances to stockmen and ranchers, having superior facilities for making collections in Canada and the Northwest Territories, dealers also in half-breed and money scrap. Special attention is given to correspondents wishing to make investments in the country. References, Bank of Montreal.\n\nEau Claire & Bow River Lumber Co., Calgary, Alta., P. A. Prince, Manager\u2014The situation of Calgary with reference to the timber-growing districts of the mountain has conduced to give it importance in the lumber trade, representing at the present time thousands of dollars' worth, a trade that has in a large degree added to industrial prosperity. There are a number of firms engaged in the various branches of the lumber business, employing in the aggregate a vast capital. Some of these establishments are mammoth in their proportions, and are supplied with every requisite facility for the manufacture and handling of lumber in all its various forms. At the very head of these is the firm of the Eau Claire & Bow River Lumber Co. Their establishment is one of such vast proportion and of such perfect arrangement, and occupies such a prominent position among the manufacturing interests of this country, as to demand prominent mention in a work devoted to the industrial history of the day. This mill was built in 1886-7, and it is most admirably located, being built on the banks of the Bow river, having a large frontage and splendid harbor in which is anchored at all times millions of feet of the finest stock of lumber that can be found in the great lumber regions of this district. One powerful and fine engine of 75 horse power is employed to drive the machinery, which consists of gang and circular saws, all of the latest and most improved machinery used in a first-class saw-mill. They employ about fifty men in the different departments. The capacity of the mill is 50,000 feet of lumber and 20,000 laths per day. This company have a timber limit of fifty square miles situated on the Bow, Kananaskis and Spray rivers. They have also in connection with the saw-mill a first-class planing mill, containing all of the latest and most improved machinery. Mr. Prince, the manager, is a gentleman of indomitable energy, possessed of those characteristics of unquestionable honor and liberality, which, coupled with his well known enterprise, have gained him the respect of the community and the confidence of the trade. Such manufactures and enterprises give reputation to a city, and add materially to its progress and prosperity.\n\nA. E. Shelton, Furniture Manufacturer and Upholstering, Stephen Avenue, East, Calgary, Alta.\u2014A most important element of industrial activity in this city is the manufacture of furniture. One of the leading houses in this line is that of Mr. A. E. Shelton, whose premises are large and commodious, admirably situated on Stephen Avenue, in the centre of the business portion of the city. He founded this business in 1884, and from its inception it has proved a success. Mr. Shelton manufactures and deals in all kinds of furniture, embracing the choicest and most elaborate designs of parlor and bedroom sets, kitchen and all kinds of household furniture; he also does a large and prosperous business in upholstering. His facilities are of a first-class character, enabling him to execute all orders in the promptest and most satisfactory manner. He is a thorough-going, clear-headed business man, honorable and fair in all transactions, and has achieved a well merited success. He has always taken a deep interest in the development of the country, and the advancement of the city, and the citizens of Calgary manifested their confidence and esteem by electing him to the mayoralty for 1888.\n\nH. Collins, Dry Goods, Clothing, and Gents' Furnishings, Stephen Avenue, East, Calgary, Alta.\u2014One of the most enterprising houses we feel called on to mention in connection with the industries and business of Calgary, is that of Mr. H. Collins, dealer in dry goods, clothing, etc. This concern was established in 1887, by the present proprietor, Mr. Collins. With energy and a thorough adaptation to the business, he soon received a liberal patronage from the citizens and surrounding country, and a steady and gradual increase in the trade has been the result. He has a large stock, which is kept in excellent order and condition, keeping it thoroughly full and complete with the freshest and best class of goods, the assortment of which embraces dress goods, silks, linens, woollens, hosiery, men's, youths' and boys' clothing, gents' furnishings, etc. Mr. Collins is a gentleman who gives close personal attention to his business, and he has established a high business reputation, which entitles him to consideration among the citizens and the community at large.\n\nRoyal Hotel, Roily & Martin, Proprietors, corner Stephen Avenue and McTavish street, Calgary, Alta.\u2014There is no place outside of a home where man's comfort can be so effectually ministered to as at a hotel. Every hotel, especially in this country, where its inhabitants are so continually travelling, should cater to suit comforts. But, unfortunately, the travelling man is often doomed to disappointment. When tired, exhausted, dusty, cold, wet and hungry, he is more liable to find a place in which to commit suicide, than let his exhausted body find the luxury which he confidently expects to meet with at the\nend of his days' journey. There are but few hotels in the country, rarely more than two or three where accommodations are found that will just meet a traveller's expectations. Calgary is numbered among the fortunate cities that has within her borders a house where real comfort can be found, not only in rooms but menage. The recent additions made to the Royal, the taste with which it is decorated, the neatness and cleanliness of the rooms, and last, but not least, the sumptuousness of its table, has placed the Royal Hotel in the front rank of first-class houses. Messrs. Reilly & Martin started the hotel business here in 1854, with but a very small house, and in 1856 they finished their new popular hotel, it is a three-story brick building, 50 x 120 feet in size, having sixty sleeping rooms, besides the parlors, all handsomely furnished and large, airy chambers. Every department of the house is in complete repair, and supplied with all the modern improvements. The dining-room is large and commodious, while the table is supplied with the best the market affords, and game in season. There is also a billiard and pool room in connection with the house. Messrs. James Reilly and A. F. Martin are the proprietors; both gentlemen are widely known and esteemed citizens of this community. Closely identified with Calgary in the development of her various commercial and productive interests, they exert an active interest in all public measures and improvements. Mr. Reilly has always put forward every movement for the advancement of the city, and the citizens of Calgary manifested their confidence and esteem in him by electing him to the mayoralty for 1886. The Royal is offered, from the hosts down, by considerate, genial employees, never neglecting the comfort of guests, but always promoting their ease and enjoyment, adding to their esteem which they richly merit and possess, of the public.\n\nG. H. Reilly & Co., General Merchants, Stephen avenue West, Calgary, Alta.\u2014Among the best known and most deservedly successful merchants in this city, G. H. Reilly & Co. are prominent. They commenced business here in 1857, and since that time they have persevered with an energy and determination that could not fail to command success. They occupy a handsome two-story building, fitted up and furnished with an especial view to the requirements of a first-class establishment. Energy and a thorough adaptation to and knowledge of their business have secured them a liberal patronage among the best class of citizens, and a steady and gradual increase in trade has been the gratifying result. Their storeroom is stocked with a full and complete assortment of foreign and domestic goods, embracing gents' furnishings, clothing, staple and fancy groceries, crockery, boots and shoes, etc. Their stock is kept in excellent order and condition, and they are almost daily receiving fresh goods, thus keeping their stock thoroughly replenished with the freshest and best class of articles. This firm has established an enviable business reputation, and is justly entitled to high position among the leading merchants of Calgary.\n\nW. H. Kinnisten, Bakery, Fruits, Confectionery and Fancy Groceries, Stephen avenue East, Calgary, Alta.\u2014An important mercantile enterprise which has found Calgary a congenial centre for its operations is the fruit and confectionery trade. Mr. W. H. Kinnisten, whose store is on Stephen avenue East, in the centre of the business portion of the city, is favorably known as an extensive wholesale and retail dealer in foreign and domestic fruits (California fruits a specialty), candies, nuts, etc. He also has in stock a fine assortment of staple and fancy groceries, embracing sugars, teas, coffees, canned goods of all kinds, etc. He is prepared to supply in large or small quantities. This business was founded in 1854 by the present proprietor, and from the very start has proved a success financially. Personally popular and thoroughly understanding the details of the business, the prospects for a steady development of Mr. Kinnisten's trade in the future are of the most favorable character. He also runs a first-class bakery in connection with the business.\n\nDavidson Bros., Jewellery, etc., Stephen avenue, Calgary, Alta.\u2014Among the various and extensive growing industries of the Northwest which exercises an important influence upon our general trade, there is none perhaps occupying a more prominent position than the jewellery trade. Among the enterprising and popular firms in this line is that of Messrs. Davidson Bros., whose elegantly fitted up establishment is on Stephen avenue, a few doors east of the Royal Hotel. This house has been established four years, and by strict attention, coupled with a straightforward system of honorable dealing, they have built up a large, prosperous and permanent trade, both in Calgary and the surrounding country. The premises occupied are admirably arranged and equipped with every appliance and facility for the transacting of business. They carry a large and valuable stock of diamonds, gold and silver watches of all makes and styles, ladies' and gentlemen's jewellery and electroplate of all kinds. Being direct importers, they are able to offer advantages to customers which are hard to duplicate elsewhere. Only the best and most reliable goods are kept in stock, and they are offered at the lowest prices. The members of this firm are Messrs. C. N. Davidson and A. A. Davidson, gentlemen of high standing and sterling integrity, honorable and fair in all transactions.\n\nA. Grant, Hardware, Stoves and Tinware, Stephen avenue west, Calgary, Alta.\u2014Popularly, the term hardware is understood to embrace all the unclassified manufactures of iron and steel, including all the appendages of the mechanic arts, from a file to a mill-saw; many of the lesser articles used in ordinary life from a rat-trap to a church bell, articles as various in appearance, size and uses as can well be conceived. There are no miscellaneous hardware manufactories in Calgary, but the want is supplied by such establishments as the house which is the subject of this article, in whose stock will be found every article made in the great Eastern and foreign manufactories, and their products are sold at factory prices. Of the firms in this city dealing in hardware and cutlery, none are more prominent or on a firmer basis than the house of Mr. A. Grant, who is carrying forward a large business in this line on Stephen avenue. The business was established in 1857; prior to that time Mr. Grant was a partner of R. R. Rogers, under the firm title of Rogers & Grant. The enterprise and excellent business capacity of this house has not only had a marked effect upon the trade, but largely increased his own business. His place of business is 32 by 80 feet in dimensions, consisting of two floors and basement, cut stone. This house compares well with any in the line of hardware in the North-west and stands in the front rank of business houses in Calgary, not only in regard to the quality of stock and extent of business transacted, but also for energetic, enterprising and systematic business habits. He deals in general hardware for all purposes, builders, mechanics, architects, etc., such as saws, forks, shovels, files, locks, edge tools, springs and spring steel, rasps, nuts, etc. He makes a specialty of fine cutlery, scissors, knives, razors, butchers tools, etc., and in this he can give particular inducement to country buyers.\nThoroughly acquainted with his business and its requirements, and with facilities of the highest order, ample capital and untarnished career, he has acquired a position in this community that few firms so well deserve, and as a desirable house with which to establish agreeable and profitable relations, it has no superior.\n\nJohn Sharples, Wholesale and Retail Flour, Feed and Provisions, Stephen avenue East, Calgary, Alta.\u2014It is interesting to contemplate the magnitude which the flour and provision trade has attained in this country, when compared with the limit to which it was circumscribed a few years ago. Probably no business has had a more rapid growth, and this increase must be largely ascribed to the enterprise and effort of those connected with the trade, and who have made its extension a life-study. One of the most widely known and successful houses in this line, is that of Mr. John Sharples. This business was established in 1887, and has attained proportions of great extent. He is a wholesale and retail dealer in flour, feed, beef, ham, bacon, lard, and vegetables of all kinds. Mr. Sharples' place is equipped with the most improved appliances, and his facilities for transacting business are of a strictly first-class character. He does a large wholesale as well as retail business, making a specialty of supplying the towns and railway west, and in the mountains, in the promptest and most satisfactory manner. He is highly esteemed as an energetic, clear-headed business man.\n\nI. S. Freeze & Co., Groceries and Provisions, Clothing and Gents' Furnishings, Boots and Shoes and Crockeryware, etc., Stephen avenue, Calgary, Alta.\u2014This business was established in the spring of 1883, on the old town site east of the Elbow river, and was the first located on the C.P.R. site upon its introduction to market. Merit invariably tells, and the growth of their business eventually necessitated their removal in 1887 from their original stand, on Atlantic avenue, to their present eligible premises, specially erected by Mr. Freeze, to meet the requirements of the firm, and considered one of the handsomest specimens of business architecture in the city. The building is of stone, 28x64 feet in dimensions, two stories in height, with basement full size, and has an ornamental front, with an elegant cornice surmounting the whole. The business is carried on both wholesale and retail, and extends throughout the city and province of Alberta, as well as into British Columbia. This establishment is destined to a constant increase of trade, and will thus contribute to the credit of the city as a basis of supplies. The conclusion is but the legitimate deduction from the ability which characterizes its business policy and operations. Mr. Freeze, the senior partner of the firm, was born in New Brunswick in 1847, and carried on a successful business while there. Mr. Robertson was born in Ontario in 1859, and is a popular member of a large circle of business and social communities.\n\nCalgary Townsite Agency.\u2014This important agency is held by Mr. W. T. Ramsay, one of the oldest residents of Calgary, Mr. Ramsay having been sent up to Calgary by the C.P.R. Townsite Trustees, in August, 1883, to look after their interests in the Townsite. At that time, Calgary had only a small collection of shacks and tents, and a floating population, consisting chiefly of railway employees, of about 300, all of which were on the east side of the Elbow river. In January, 1884, the C.P.R. put their property in the market, and although there was no boom of any kind, the sale was a great success. Their sales have kept improving, and what was the bare prairie a few years ago, is now covered with fine stone and brick stores and many handsome residences, with a population of over 3,000. Great credit is due Mr. Ramsay for the very creditable manner in which he has handled the affairs of the Townsite.\n\nThomson Bros., Books, Stationery, Wall Paper, Fancy Goods, Trunks, Musical Instruments, Job Printing, etc., Stephen avenue east, Calgary, Alta.\u2014This firm, which was established in the year 1882 at Portage la Prairie, and Calgary in 1884, is one of the old and thoroughly representative Calgary houses, and has for years enjoyed a reputation in keeping with its extensive and increasing business. The firm occupies the spacious and commodious two story building, which is 26x75 feet in dimensions and is admirably arranged for the immense stock of goods which they carry. The shelves and counters are loaded with the works of the standard authors, and with the leading publications of the principal publishers. On a long line of tables and counters, school books are stacked, and a more complete line of paper, blank books and stationery cannot be found in any western house. The show cases are filled with photograph albums and the choicest styles of fancy goods from the leading foreign manufacturers. The composing room, press room and binding are located in the rear and second floor of the main building. They are also dealers in musical instruments, etc. Throughout the establishment there pervades a system of order and regularity which facilitates the transaction of business and makes the house a pleasant one to deal with. The facilities are of an unusually complete character, enabling the firm to fill the largest orders in the promptest and most satisfactory manner, and at prices which compare most favorably with eastern houses. The trade of the house extends throughout the Northwest. It is such firms as this that are recognized exponents of Calgary mercantile enterprise and capacity, and they well deserve the success they have attained. Messrs. J. A. Thomson and M. P. Thomson are the members of this firm, and are highly esteemed in commercial circles as energetic and hard working business men. They have an establishment at Vancouver, B.C., which was started last year.\n\nRankin & Allen, Dry Goods, Millinery, Clothing, Gents' Furnishings, Boots and Shoes, Tailoring, Calgary, Alta.\u2014Of the houses engaged in the dry good trade, we can with confidence assert that none in the city occupy a position of higher rank, or one more entitled to consideration, with reference not only to the high commercial standard upon which its operations are based, but also to the extent of business transacted, and its influence in commercial circles. Since its establishment in 1884, by, and under the style of Rankin & Allen, this house has always maintained a prominent position in the general trade. The premises occupied by them, so far as regards facilities for the operation of their business, are all that could be desired, being ample, commodious and eligibly situated, the building being a large two-story cut-stone, 32 by 80 feet in dimensions, erected by Messrs. Rankin and Allen in 1887. This large business is thoroughly organized into different departments, each managed and supervised personally by the proprietors, with thorough and competent assistants. Here may be found at all times, in their proper departments, dress goods, foreign and domestic, woollens, jeans, shawls, cloaks, and suit goods, white and linen goods, prints and ginghams, also\nhannels and blankets, carpets and domestic goods, and a varied and extensive stock of black and colored silks, satins and laces. The millinery, notion and hosery department is a leading feature. The dress-making and tailoring departments turn out the latest styles and patterns. Each department embraces a wide range of textile fabrics, affording an opportunity for selection rarely attainable outside of large eastern cities. The members of the firm, Messrs. A. Rankin and A. Allen, both very prompt who have made their house a pleasant one with which to establish relations, and profitable, for no parties understand better how to secure for buyers, lower prices on better terms. Cordially commending them to the trade and public, and calling attention to their liberal manner of doing business, and their resources, it may justly be added, that ranking as it does among the first in the line of its contemporaries, the establishment of Messrs. Rankin & Allen commands the respect of the trade, and the highest consideration of the community at large.\n\nLinton, Bros., Wholesale and Retail Books, Stationery, Wall-paper, Fancy Goods, Sporting Goods, etc.\u2014Stephen avenue, Calgary, Alta.\u2014This establishment is very centrally located on Stephen avenue, two doors east of the Royal Hotel, making this stand one of the very best in the city. The store is well adapted for the business, being admirably arranged in every particular and presenting a neat and attractive appearance. They carry a large and carefully selected stock, embracing every article usually found in a first-class establishment of this kind. The stock embraces a large miscellaneous collection of stationery, wall-paper, literature, American and foreign newspapers, and a varied assortment of all kinds of school books authorized for use in the North-west. They have also on hand a fine stock of stationery of the best quality, and in the latest styles and patterns, in fancy and sporting goods, they do a large and constantly increasing business, importing all the late novelties as fast as they appear in the markets. The members of the firm are J. C. Linton and T. B. Linton, establishing their business at Rat Portage in 1883, and Calgary in 1884. Calgary offered better opportunities for business, they sold their Rat Portage establishment in 1886, and are now devoting their whole attention to their rapidly increasing business here. Messrs. Linton, Bros., possess business qualities of a high order, and are honored and respected by all who know them, for their strict integrity and high character.\n\nSoules & York, Butchers, and Cattle Dealers, Stephen avenue, Calgary, Alta.\u2014The growth of the wholesale and retail meat trade of Calgary, has been very considerable of late years. The firm of Messrs. Soules and York engaged in this business here last year, and already their trade has assumed very large proportions. This result is largely traceable to the fact that the members of the firm thoroughly understand the business, and are good judges of beef cattle, and thus are able to secure the best meats for the benefit of their numerous customers. The premises occupied by the firm are very commodious, and equipped with every facility and appliance for the transaction of business. They do a large wholesale and retail trade, numbering among their customers people east and west on the line of the C. P. Railway, also a large share of the citizens of Calgary. They have won an excellent reputation for selling only the best quality of meat, and always at lowest prices. Messrs. T. M. Soules and A. York compose the firm, and during their residence here they have gained the regard and respect of all who have had business relations with them, and are fully deserving of the success they have attained. Mr. T. M. Soules is the proprietor of a large cattle ranch, situated in this district. This firm do an extensive business in buying and selling cattle, all orders by mail or telegram will receive prompt attention.\n\nT. C. Power & Co., D. W. Marsh, Manager, Dry Goods, Groceries, Crockery, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, etc.\u2014Stephen avenue west, Calgary, Alta.\u2014In presenting for the consideration of our readers, both at home and abroad, historical and descriptive reviews of the great industries and commercial enterprises of this vast country, it is necessary and important to select representative institutions and establishments, and consider more particular those whose successes have made them conspicuous, and gained for the proprietors positions prominent in the mercantile history of the country, the character of business men being often measured by their success, redounds to a certain degree the credit and reputation of the communities of which they are members. The general store trade of this, or, in fact, any country, is one of the most important factors in the general make up, and exercises an influence not out-measured by any other branch of trade. Twenty-four years ago, in 1861, and it may be said in the infancy of the commerce of the then unknown North-west, the firm of T. C. Power & Co., were established at Fort Benton, Montana, they gradually branched out, extending their operations by establishing branch stores throughout Montana, and in 1874-5 they located branches at Fort McLeod and Walsh in the North-west Territory, the latter, upon the commencing of the rail road, was removed to Maple Creek, and the former to Calgary, in 1882, and in 1884 they opened another branch at Maple Creek and Calgary in 1884. With regard to so well-known a house, but little can be said that is not already known of its importance as a mercantile industry, and a detailed description is therefore unnecessary, beyond giving the plain facts connected with this, one of the largest and oldest houses in the North-west. The business premises occupied by the firm are located on Stephen avenue, and consist of a large two-story brick building 25 by 82 feet in dimensions, while the warehouse is 24 by 33 feet in size. Their facilities for doing business and their superior qualifications for its management are unsurpassed by any house in the west, while their experience and business sagacity can not be excelled. They rank deservedly high among the successful merchants of the North-west, and have built up one of the strongest and best mercantile houses in the country. Their establishment is both an honor to themselves and a credit to the country.\n\nA. Perland & Co., General Merchants, Stephen avenue west, Calgary, Alta.\u2014The many advantages possessed by the city of Calgary as a commercial as well as a manufacturing centre cannot be overlooked in an enumeration of the principal mercantile points in the country, with the facilities afforded the facilities and trade provided by each. With all requisite facilities unsurpassed by those of her sister cities, Calgary has grown to be an important commercial metropolis, and purchasers from neighbouring towns and country are rapidly becoming convinced of and conceding the fact that many important articles and industrial products can be purchased here as low as in the large eastern cities, at a material saving of time, freight and other incidental expenses worthy of con-\nsideration. In connection with the general store trade, the house of Messrs. A. Ferland & Co. must be mentioned as one of the most prominent, not only in this city, but in the West and Northwest. It is one of the pioneer institutions of this city, established back in the year 1883. From a moderate capital and business at the outset, this firm, by hard work, economical habits, business sagacity and honorable dealing, have acquired a position among the leading commercial houses of the country, and present a splendid example of what industry and careful business diligence can accomplish. Conducted with every advantage to be derived from an enterprising and stainless business policy, the success of this house has increased with each succeeding year, until at the present time it stands equal to any similar establishment in the West. Their business extends throughout the Territories and into the mountains, they having branch stores at Banff and Golden City. They carry a large and complete stock of dry goods, groceries, crockery, clothing, gent's furnishings, Canadian and American makes, of boots and shoes and everything pertaining to the general store trade. The members of the firm are Messrs. A. Ferland and C. Watson. Closely identified with the progress and commercial advancement of this country, enterprising, progressive and in the first degree honorable and liberal in their dealings, this firm occupy a position equally honorable to themselves and the community in which their house originated.\n\nMarsh & Geddes, Real Estate, Commission and Insurance, Stephen avenue east, Calgary, Alta.\u2014Prominent among our leading real estate and insurance firms is that of Messrs. Marsh & Geddes, who established themselves over one year ago. They carry on a general real estate business, buying, selling and exchanging real estate, collecting rents, negotiating loans, and taking full charge of property for non-residents. Legal contracts and all notarial business is promptly attended to, and every branch of the business is conducted in the most efficient manner. Their office is located on Stephen avenue, next door to the Royal Hotel. Their books contain large lists of very desirable property, both business and residential, for sale and to rent, also acre property and farms. Their abstracts of title have always been regarded by bankers and capitalists as perfectly reliable and conclusive. The firm have had an extended experience, and are regarded as reliable authorities upon present and prospective values, and those intrusting interests to their charge will derive advantages from the connection. The individual members of this representative firm are Messrs. Geo. C. Marsh and J. D. Geddes. This firm also do a general insurance and commission business, dealing in cattle, horses and real estate on commission.\n\nW. H. Cushing, Planing Mill, Calgary, Alta.\u2014There is probably no city in this country presenting greater advantages and facilities to the manufacturers and dealers in the lumber trade than Calgary. In a large and growing city like this, men who are conversant with their business, practical in its details, and, withal, energetic and industrious, are important acquisitions to its progress. Such a man, in an eminent degree, is Mr W. H. Cushing, possessing as he does a thorough understanding of the various departments of his business in a mechanical, scientific and business point of view. This establishment was started in 1885 by Jarrett & Cushing and carried on by his firm until 1887, when Mr. Cushing assumed full charge. The mill is a two story frame structure, 40x70 feet; the engine room, dry kiln and store room, 30x30 feet. Twelve to fifteen hands are constantly employed.

He manufactures and keeps in stock sash, doors, cornices, brackets, flooring, weather boarding, moulding, newel posts, balusters, etc. His straightforward, square manner of doing business entitles him to a continuance of patronage.\n\nW. Carroll, Merchant Tailor, Stephen Avenue, West, Calgary, Alta.\u2014There is no longer a question as to the propriety of the employment of a competent merchant tailor, with those who appreciate properly fitting garments. Clothes made for nobody in particular never fit anybody properly. One of the most popular establishments of this kind in the city is that of Mr. W. Carroll, whose place of business is situated on Stephen Avenue West. He will be found a pleasant and reliable gentleman to transact business with, and as he is a first-class and experienced cutter, and employs none but first-class workmen, you are assured perfect fitting and well made garments; this, he is at all times prepared to guarantee. His stock of goods embraces fine cloths, English and French camisoles, and all the most popular styles for coats, pants, vests or suits. He carries a large stock, which is constantly being replenished from the most reliable manufacturers and importers in the country. This business was founded in 1887, and has been successful ever since its commencement, and will undoubtedly continue to gain in popularity, as the excellent quality of goods and work becomes more generally known. The facilities of this house for desirable goods, neat fits and low prices, are unsurpassed by any other tailoring establishment in the city.\n\nThe Frontier Stables, W. H. Ford, Proprietor, Stephen Avenue West, Calgary, Alta.\u2014One of the oldest and most widely known livery, board, feed and sale stables in Calgary, and one which to-day enjoys a large and influential patronage among the best class of citizens, is that conducted by Mr. W. H. Ford, and situated on Stephen Avenue. The premises occupied consist of a substantial and spacious building, which is admirably arranged, well ventilated, and equipped throughout with every facility and convenience for the transaction of business, ample stall room being afforded for one hundred and twenty-five horses. Mr. Ford does a general stabling business. He keeps on hand for hire, handsome coaches, carriages, buggies, sleighs, cutters, etc., he also has a number of fine riding horses. He also buys and sells horses, and in this branch does an extensive business. The stable has telephone connection with all parts of the city, and orders will receive prompt and satisfactory attention. Mr. Ford has been engaged in this business for many years, and during his long and busy career has sustained an excellent reputation for sterling integrity and honorable dealing. For a fine turnout, and at moderate price, Mr. Ford's stable is the place.\n\nMcTavish Bros., Carriage Manufacturers and Blacksmithing, Stephen Avenue East, Calgary, Alta.\u2014As in most of the other lines of mechanical art, so in the carriage manufacture and horse-shoeing trade, only a comparative few attain to anything approaching a high degree of skill. Those who do, however, find no difficulty in building up a large business. Such are Messrs. McTavish Bros, whose establishment is situated on Stephen Avenue. The premises occupied are large and spacious.\nadmirably arranged and equipped with all the latest and most improved machinery necessary for the transaction of business. They manufacture all kinds and styles to order, of carriages, barges, wagons, sleighs, etc., also repairing and horse-shoeing; none but first-class workmen are employed. As might be expected, the trade is very large and is constantly increasing, the uniform satisfaction rendered being the chief element contributing to the large measure of prosperity they now enjoy. This business was established in 1856, by Messrs. A. R. McTavish and A. McTavish, the present proprietors. They have, through their honorable dealings, gained the respect and confidence of their fellow-citizens and the community at large.\n\nWindsor House, J. Donohue, Proprietor, Atlantic avenue, West Calgary, Alta.\u2014This handsome structure occupies an admirable site, facing the Railway Passenger Station, and has the best arrangements, not only for the convenience and comfort of guests, but for the excellent, economical and systematic performance of the necessary labor to conduct so extensive an establishment. The Windsor is a three-story brick building, 21 x 122 feet in dimensions. There are in the building forty-three sleeping rooms, besides suites of gentlemen's and ladies' parlors, all furnished with an eye both to the taste and comfort of the guests. The cooking department is such as to meet the wishes of even the most fastidious. No inland hotel in the country is better prepared, or furnishes a table that for cleanliness, excellence of its cooking and the season's luxuries surpasses the Windsor. A still greater advantage it has in having as its head Mr. J. Donohue, who, since 1883, when he started the hotel business here, has been catering to the public, and whose qualifications as a host are excelled by none in the land; frank, genial and with true ideas of hospitality, he gives to the hotel more varied and greater advantages than can be enjoyed elsewhere. The bar is stocked with the best imported and domestic cigars, and also all kinds of Northwest drinks. There is also a large billiard-room and pool-room in connection with the house.\n\nG. T. Duncan, Harness, Saddles, etc., Stephen avenue, West Calgary, Alta.\u2014An industrial review of this enterprising city would be far from complete which omitted permanent mention of the widely known house which is made the subject of the present sketch. This business was founded by Mr. G. T. Duncan in 1887, and at present a large and complete stock is carried of the far famed production of the establishment. The quality of the goods, which fact, in connection with the fair and equitable methods which will ever characterize its management, give it an enviable reputation in the trade, and consequently extensive and prosperous business. He makes a specialty of the famous stock saddle, for which he took the first prize at last year's agricultural exhibition. Mr. Duncan is thoroughly versed in all the details of this enterprise, and the efforts of his energetic and able management are already shown in the trade.\n\nE. C. Holbrook, Surgeon-Dentist, Stephen avenue West, Calgary, Alta.\u2014In all the human anatomy there are no parts which can give greater comfort or cause more inconvenience and pain than the teeth. So necessary in themselves as an important part of the great whole, it is surprising that there is no part of the human system that meets with such utter neglect. Five minutes in every day spent in cleansing the teeth is all that is required for one of the greatest comforts of life, and yet how few there are who give even a thought to them. If those who neglect their teeth only knew how ugly they look, and how disagreeable the person owning them becomes to friends and family alike, assuredly they would devote some attention to them. A decayed tooth makes an unpleasant breath, and there is nothing can be more disagreeable than this, and how easily prevented! Would parents for a moment stop to think of the misery they must cause their offspring by neglecting their teeth, they assuredly would give more attention to them. Every person's teeth should at least be examined once every six months, not by any one claiming to be a dentist, but by those who are known to be such, and who enjoy the confidence of the public. Such a gentleman and dentist heads this article\u2014Being a regular graduate in the College of Dental Surgery at Ann Arbor, Michigan, he has a thorough knowledge of all that pertains to his profession. His rooms are splendidly located over G. H. Riley's store, and are among the most elegant and commodious in this city. His charges are moderate, and his uniform tenderness toward his patients makes it almost a pleasure to put oneself in his hands. The doctor's success, which has been remarkable, is almost as much due to the latter fact as to his knowledge of his profession. The implements which he uses in the daily prosecution of his business are of the latest and most improved styles, and the material used in either making decayed teeth as sound as new and manufacturing false sets is of the best to be procured, and his work will last as long as life. These facts recommend him most highly to those in need of dental aid.\n\nJ. F. Glanville & Co., Clothing and Gents' Furnishings, etc., Stephen Avenue West, Calgary, Alta.\u2014There is no branch of business requiring more energy, executive ability and mercantile knowledge than the clothing trade. As a distinct line of commercial industry in this country, there are few pursuits in which more capital is invested or more persons employed. One of the largest houses in the city devoted to the clothing trade is the clothing establishment of Messrs. J. F. Glanville & Co. This firm occupy commodious quarters, which is filled with a complete stock of coats, pants, vests and overcoats, one of the best assortments of ready made clothing in the city; also a fine assortment of gents' furnishing goods, a place for a man to attire himself in a gentlemanly manner, and at the same time secure the full value of his money. This firm began business in 1897, and since then their large and rapidly increasing trade is sufficient and stronger evidence in their favor than any we can offer. In the various departments this house has already acquired a reputation not excelled in this section for excellence, cheapness and variety, and in style, make and quality, as well as all points that are essential in a perfect fitting, well made suit. All transactions of this house are characterized by liberality and square-dealing, and they are justly entitled to the high position they have achieved for themselves by the exercise of integrity and the commercial ability which they have displayed. The members of the firm are J. F. Glanville and T. R. Glanville.\n\nCarson & Riley, Harness, Saddles, Bridles, etc., Stephen Avenue East, Calgary, Alta.\u2014In reviewing the various industries of this busy city, it is not only those mammoth establishments which demand our attention, but all enterprises which give employment to skilled labor or furnish a field for the investment of capital, and thus add in any way to the mercantile prosperity of the\nRANKIN AND ALLAN BLOCK, CALGARY.\ncity. In this connection special mention should be made of the popular and well equipped establishment of Messrs. Carson & Riley. Their factory is equipped with all the necessary appliances and tools, employment being furnished to several skilled workmen. They manufacture all kinds of double and single harness, saddles, bridles, etc., and are dealers in blankets, whips, nets, ropes, etc., etc., and their goods are equal to anything the market affords, being made from the best materials and in the most perfect manner. Their facilities are such that they can execute all orders in the promptest and most satisfactory manner, and at prices which will compare favorably with those of any house in the trade. The members of the firm are Messrs. A. Carson and W. J. Riley, both honorable, liberal, and fair in all transactions, and they well merit the success they have achieved. They make a specialty of stock saddles.\n\nG. E. Jacques, Watchmaker and Jeweler, Stephen Avenue West, Calgary, Alta.\u2014This well known house traces its existence back to the day when Calgary was a mere village of two or three business houses, and years before she was incorporated. Founded by Mr. Jacques in 1881, it has the advantage of having no superior in this country. Mr. Jacques is one of our best known business men, and has carried with him that popularity which he has so justly earned. Doing a wholesale and retail business, he has the best selected stock in the market, such as he knows will please his numerous patrons, and he has succeeded in securing a trade that must eventually prove of a most remunerative character. Mr. Jacques has all the elements of success to back him in his business, popularity and the thorough confidence of his customers. His stock of diamonds, gold and silver watches, silver and plated ware, jewelry, clocks, etc., will compare favorably with that of any similar establishment in this section. He is a courteous gentleman, gifted with a high degree of ability, energy and industry, and his establishment ranks as one of the representative institutions of the city. Mr. Jacques makes a specialty of repairing, having quite a reputation in this work all along the C. P. Railway.\n\nBoerne & May, Photographers and Landscape Artists, McTavish street, Calgary, Alta.\u2014This commodious gallery and handsome parlor, of which Messrs. W. H. Boerne and E. G. May are the proprietors, occupies a whole building on McTavish street, rooms being devoted to the taking of negatives and printing of positives, etc., other rooms for receiving patrons and for the display of the beautiful specimens of excellent work. They also have another house where the finishing is done. Pictures taken by the most modern processes of photography, by which the features of the very young and aged are easily caught with the most surprising life-like rapidity. They make a specialty of landscapes, scenes (embracing a fine collection of mountain views along the C.P.R.), buildings, interiors, machinery, architecture, etc.; also groups of societies, clubs and parties, their work being among the most perfect in the city. And such is their knowledge of posturing, grouping, light and shade, the effect of colors, the action of chemicals, etc., that they are enabled to turn out masterpieces of this most wonderful of the practical sciences. Parties desiring sittings of mountain scenery views will do well to patronize this establishment, as all work turned out by them is of a first-class character. The views that represent Calgary in this book were taken by this firm.\n\nFerguson & McMurray, Groceries and Provisions, Stephen avenue west, Calgary, Alta.\u2014One of the most enterprising establishments which is our province to mention in connection with the industries and business interests or Calgary is that of Messrs. Ferguson & McMurray, dealers in staple and fancy groceries, crockery, etc. This business was established in 1887 by the present proprietors. Energy and a thorough adaptation to their business soon gave them liberal patronage among the best class of citizens, and a steady and gradual increase in trade has been the result. They carry a large stock, which is kept in excellent order and condition, and they are in frequent receipt of fresh goods, keeping their stock thoroughly replenished with the freshest and best class of articles for house and table use. They keep in stock all kinds of family and fancy groceries, flour, coffees, teas, sugars, syrup, canned goods, soap, oil, fish and a general assortment of sundries. Their shelving and counters are loaded with as choice a selection of goods as can be found in the city, and at as popular prices. The members of the firm are Messrs. J. R. Ferguson and J. H. McMurray, gentlemen who are reliable, energetic and trustworthy, and having established an enviable business reputation, they are esteemed by all who know them. This firm is also agents for Blackwood Bros., soda and mineral waters.\n\nJ. S. Douglas & Co., Fruits and Fancy Groceries, corner McTavish street and Atlantic avenue, Calgary, Alta.\u2014Among the first-class fruit and family grocery establishments of Calgary, we wish to call attention to that of Messrs. J. S. Douglas & Co. This model business was established in 1887, previous to that time Mr. Douglas was a member of the firm of Kinmonth & Douglas. Since starting here he has by natural ability and enterprise built up a flourishing trade; prudence and good judgment in buying soon attracted custom, and his business assumed very gratifying proportions. He retails foreign and domestic fruit, staple and fancy groceries of the purest and freshest quality, and in these goods can offer special inducements. He attends personally to his business, giving to it his entire time and energy, which is the only sure method of doing business. His store is recognized as reliable, where purchasers not only get the worth of their money, but are supplied with first-class goods. His stock is ample, and is being constantly replenished; his assortment of coffees, teas, sugars, syrups, canned goods, glass goods, etc., cannot be surpassed in the city. He has achieved a notable success in his business, of which he is in every way worthy, having accomplished it by his own unaided and well directed efforts.\n\nA. J. Ross, Photographer, Stephen avenue East, Calgary, Alta.\u2014One of the most enterprising and popular photographers in the Northwest is Mr. A. J. Ross, whose gallery is located on Stephen avenue, nearly opposite the Royal Hotel. He started here in 1886, and, by strict attention, coupled with excellent work at reasonable prices, he has built up a large and prosperous business. His gallery is equipped with the most improved apparatus for taking photographs by the instantaneous process, and all work leaving his establishment is finished in the best style of art. He brings to bear vast practical experience, having been in the business for years. He is a courteous gentleman, liberal and fair in all transactions and well deserving of the success he is achieving.\n\nJ. S. Mackie, Gunsmith and Sporting Goods, Stephen avenue East, Calgary, Alta.\u2014Mr. Mackie, the proprietor of this establishment, has carried on this business in Calgary...\nsince 1886. Being a thoroughly practical mechanic, perfectly conversant with his business and its details, being also energetic and enterprising, it cannot be wondered at that his trade has steadily increased. The reputation of his goods stand high, both for workmanship and reliability. Those who have occasion to deal with him will always be treated with courtesy and dealt with in the most upright manner. He fills all orders entrusted to him promptly, giving each and every article turned out of his concern his personal attention and supervision. This is the largest gun establishment in the Northwest. He manufactures and keeps in stock all kinds of breech-loading guns, revolvers; ammunition, fishing tackle, cutlery and all kinds of sporting goods. With undoubted skill and experience and unequalled facilities, Mr. Mackie can offer inducements to the trade that cannot be surpassed.\n\nJ. Wm. Cockle, Taxidermist, Stephen avenue east, Calgary, Alta.\u2014The art of taxidermy is one that must commend itself to all persons of refinement and culture. As we observe the light-winged inhabitants of the air flitting joyously by, we cannot fail to admire, and admiring we wish for some means to preserve and perpetuate their beauties when Death shall have claimed them for his own, and but for the taxidermist they otherwise would have mouldered away into nothingness. Mr. Cockle established his present business in 1885, and from the start it has grown to large proportions. His salesroom is admirably situated on Stephen avenue, where he has on exhibition a large quantity of specimens of his skill as a taxidermist. Beasts, birds, fish and reptiles are mounted and preserved in the most artistic style. Mr. Cockle can stuff anything on sea or land, from the tiny jeweled humming bird that glances by like a thing of light, to the ponderous elephant from his native jungles in the East. All are alike to him, and so perfect and life-like are his specimens that we almost expect to hear the birds warble their sweetest songs. Mr. Cockle has some beautiful specimens of buffalos' heads, deer, mountain sheep, moose and elk heads, also a large variety of stuffed beasts and birds for sale. Parties living abroad will do well by consulting him before purchasing elsewhere.\n\nF. J. Claxton, Fruit, Confectionery and Bakery, Stephen avenue east, Calgary, Alta.\u2014In a complete review of the varied manufacturing and business interests of the city, is the establishment of Mr. F. J. Claxton, which is entitled to special notice and a prominent position. This business was established in 1883 (being one of the pioneer establishments of Calgary), with but moderate capital, but owing to his practical knowledge of his business, his industry, frugality and unremitting attention, his business has shown a steady and gratifying increase. The store is stocked with a large and complete assortment of foreign and domestic fruits, making a specialty of California products, nuts and fancy confectionery in all styles and in endless profusion, also fresh bread, pies, cakes, etc. The various articles manufactured at this establishment are noted for their excellence and purity. This house also runs wagons, supplying families and hotels with bread, employing practical bakers, and having unsurpassed facilities for this part of his business, enables him to give unbounded satisfaction. The entire establishment is fitted up in a most thorough and complete manner and will take rank with any similar business in the country. This gentleman is an energetic, active businessman, thoroughly conversant with his business, and stands high in the mercantile community.\nTHE GREAT MACKENZIE BASIN.\n\nThe first official knowledge which the British Government gained of the value of the country they had acquired through Wolfe's conquest of Quebec, was that by which the French monarch characterized its loss\u2014\"a few leagues of snow,\" and it is curious to notice the changes in the estimates of its value wrought by the various influences at work since that time. From the Ontario peninsula to the eastern sea, and belt of fifty or sixty miles was thought; twenty-five years ago, to comprise all the cultivatable land of the British American Provinces. Men who went as far as Sault St. Marie and the sources of the Ottawa were considered hardy explorers, who risked life and limb for the sake of minerals or timber; and it was only when confederation became to be discussed that the scientific reports of Hind and Dawson, Palliser and Hector, and the practical accounts given by Buckingham, Coldwell, and Schultz attracted attention, and the question began to be asked, whether these men were more than dreamers of dreams, when they spoke of a vast inland prairie sea, over which roamed millions of buffalo, fattening upon the grasses and vetches of a soil as rich as that of the delta of the Nile. The lands of this rich western domain were the Hudson's Bay Company's, whose interest it was to keep it as a fur preserve, and whose astute managers, warned by an enquiry into the advisability of abrogating their powers thirty years ago by the Imperial House of Commons, had only retained their exclusive rights by giving evidence going to show that the country was unfit for cultivation, as the frost never left the ground, and judiciously closing all communication with Canada by abandoning the Kaministiquia (afterwards Dawson) route, and dealing entirely with Britain through Hudson's Bay. The last stand of these traders was their connivance with Riel in his first rebellion, the putting down of which not only quashed their hopes, but, attracting that attention to the country which eventually built up our inter-oceanic railway, has enabled Manitoba to at once take front rank among the wheat producing countries of the world, and to present the unequalled spectacle of 12,000 farmers producing fourteen million bushels of cereals on a cultivated acreage equal to only a little over one-quarter of the road allowance area of the Province. The Saskatchewan rebellion of 1885 drew prominent attention to the fact, that there was good land as far north as the Saskatchewan, through which that river ran, an almost uninterrupted course from west to east, from the Rocky Mountains to that great inland sea, Lake Winnipeg. Thus has the \"few leagues of snow\" expanded into a belt of cultivable land from the Atlantic to the Pacific, fitted for the homes of many millions of people, and giving Canada the right to be fully considered an auxiliary kingdom, as she had, even before these vast additions of territory, being considered the brightest jewel in the British Crown.\n\nIt has, however, been reserved for a gentleman, a Manitoban, in thought, and word and deed\u2014to disclose the agricultural, mineral and other resources of a part of the Dominion but little known, and that little to those whose interest it was to keep their knowledge a secret, inasmuch as on prairies with so rich a soil and so mild a climate, that its rank grasses and vetches concealed from view and made difficult of pursuit the \"wood buffalo,\" the last of the bison family on this continent, and through wooded areas, whose evergreen and other trees of the largest kind, there roam the sable, the silver, black and cross fox, the fisher, lynx, and other animals\nwhich yield an English company so great a revenue at its annual sales at home; while the great lakes, rivers, and streams of the region produce the otter, beaver, mink and musquish, which are undisturbed save by the canoe of the voyager, till they are called upon to yield their rich covering to the trapper and hunter, to furnish an artificial winter one to beauty and fashion, through the medium of the Hudson's Bay Company at their London sales. Naturally enough, it was not in the interest of the officers who controlled this last great fur preserve of the world to disclose what they knew of its fur and other resources.\n\nThe powerful influence of a parliamentary committee has, however, within a year, been brought to bear upon the question, and their enquiry, conducted with singular ability and skill in collecting and condensing information, has surprised even the Canadian press, and startled that of Great Britain, by a report upon the resources of the great Mackenzie Basin, which was unanimously adopted by the Dominion Senate at its last session. This addition to our knowledge of the resources of Canada comes a little in advance of that which has become known of a vast area in Northern Asia, access to the confines of which has just been had by the opening of a new line of Siberian railway, containing wheat lands, mines and minerals, the value of which might have given the Russian Bear some advantage over the British Lion in the extent of territory in the northern cereal zone of the world, but that can now never be, and it needs but a hasty perusal of the following extracts from the report of which Senator, now Lieutenant-Governor Schultz, was chairman, to show that through Manitoba, which must always be the portal to this vast domain, must flow the commerce of a region, which, while not at present available, and which may not be until every arable acre is tilled in Manitoba, yet in future years, westward and far north-westward, the star of Canadian Empire will take its way.\n\nThis Senate report contradicts, for all time to come, the belief that our Confederation of Provinces is agriculturally, but a slight fringe of arable land along the United States border, for we know that, vast as are the agricultural resources of the country along the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway between Winnipeg and the mountains, yet this fertile stretch is but the base of a cone-shaped tract as large as two or three European kingdoms, and out of which may be carved grain-growing provinces enough to make the Dominion the granary of the world. This vast, newly discovered region is equally rich in forests and mines, and the lake area, which is equal to that of the Canadian-American chain of lakes, teems with fish of the best northern varieties. Along its shores are captured nearly two-thirds of the seals, narwhals and walrus of commerce, and off its coast, in its straits and around the shores of the most eastern of the islands of the Arctic archipelago, are killed nearly all that are taken of the fast diminishing schools of \"right\" or \"sperm\" whales. The heart of this vast region forms the last fur preserve of the world, all of the rich furs of commerce being there found, and many of them, as the musk-ox and wood buffalo, being found nowhere else. It is from here that the rich sables, the fisher, silver, black and cross foxes come, while the beaver, otter and mink are found with their richest and darkest winter dress. Probably the largest petroleum deposit in the world is there found, the extent of which, north and south, is known to be nearly 900 miles, and to have at one place a width east and west of 150 miles. The auriferous area, taken with that of British Columbia, exceeds that of the United States, and probably of any country in the world:\nThe greatest river of the continent\u2014the Mackenzie\u2014drains this great country, and, with two breaks only, is navigable for over 2000 miles. There is reason to believe also that this North American Amazon may be entered by way of Behring's Straits and sea for at least four months in the year, and its most southern navigable waters, the Athabasca River,\u2014the steamer landing of which is only ninety miles from Edmonton, on the Saskatchewan\u2014may be navigated as long and as late as that great river-artery which drains itself into Lake Winnipeg, thus giving a complete waterway from the mouth of the Mackenzie to Winnipeg\u2014interrupted by only three or four breaks\u2014of nearly 3500 miles, through a region where is to be found coal, gold, petroleum, salt, sulphur, gypsum, iron, lime and sandstone, marble, brick pottery and fire clays, salt and fresh water fish, large desiduous and evergreen trees, and some of the richest soil in all this favored land. Here is a vast stretch of country, of which little or nothing was known until the other day\u2014a country whose dormant resources must some time add, in a boundless measure, to the wealth and prosperity of the Dominion.\n\nTHROUGH THE ROCKIES.\n\nAlthough separated from the rest of the Dominion by an apparently impenetrable barrier of rocks, Providence seems designedly to have left a pathway by which communication between the Pacific and the eastern provinces, which is easily obtainable, and the bonds of national union more closely drawn between the widely separated members of the Canadian Confederacy. Nature has always a purpose in everything, and in the awful upheaval of primeval days, when the Almighty, as if in His terrible wrath, had twisted and tossed and distorted the earth, piling up huge, shapeless, towering masses of rock irregularly, broken by abyssmal canyons and deep gorges, through which, rushing and foaming, mad torrents ceaselessly pour,\u2014\u201ca molten sea lashed into gigantic billows, which at the very height of the storm had been suddenly petrified\u201d\u2014there was a grand purpose in leaving at the eastern rim of this sea of mountains a portal through which, centuries after, the greatest civilizer the world ever knew could enter easily, and bear with it, through the vast solitudes of the cloud-touched rocks, the very elements of national greatness to a young people in a new world, enable closer communion of the sturdy Canadian family, give an impetus to the rapid development of inter-provincial trade, and entwine the union with a welcome bond, indissoluble and, let us hope, like the hills it traverses, everlasting. To seek to found a great nation\u2014as Canada's proud destiny is to be\u2014without the Pacific coast would have been a hopeless task. A very important factor would be wanting without a western seaboard, and while a mere sentimental feeling of attachment to the old flag might possibly retain the provinces in the Confederation, it required in this prosaic, matter-of-fact age more than a sentiment to consummate to the fullest extent the patriotic scheme which the political leaders of Canada had devised. A great transcontinental railway was an imperative necessity, and, thanks to Canadian statesmanship, Canadian enterprise and Canadian faith in the future of the country, it has been secured. Already the widespread beneficial results of this great national undertaking are felt in a marked degree; but if even a venture were made to foretell the possibilities and probabilities of the\nfuture, so boundless in their munificence are they, that he who dared to portray them would be written down as a wild visionary or an idle dreamer.\n\nUp through this peaceful valley of the beautiful Bow, the iron horse wends its way, and plunges in among the everlasting hills, amidst which, like sheets of silver, smiles many a lovely lakelet, and leaps many a wild torrent by the borders of beautiful park-like enclosures. The approach to the recesses of the Rockies is an easy one\u2014a natural highway,\u2014and the traveller finds himself at a high altitude after the Foothills are passed, without knowing that he has risen many feet above the level of the contiguous plains. Fifty leagues away to the east the first glimpse of the Rocky Mountains is obtained. Towards the rising sun, the eye rests on nothing but a shoreless ocean of verdure, the land and sky seem to meet; towards the setting sun a long, glittering line of silver marks the furthermost limits of the wide plain. Like a huge battalion of body-guards of God, marshalled in serried ranks from north to south, as if to dispute the approach of man, the grim rocks rise in their awful stupendous grandeur, and make the beholder feel his utter insignificance and puny littleness. As the traveller advances, the glorious landscape ever changes. The forms which the mountains and the clouds assume become more beautiful and strange and weird and fantastic. On either hand they so intermingle and blend, that in the delicate haze\u2014amber and roseate and golden at times\u2014the lines of demarcation are invisible. None but an Almighty could frame so wondrous a scene; no brush in human hands could paint it ever so clumsily; no words could describe its dazzling beauty. It is grand beyond conception\u2014overpowering to the senses\u2014and subdues one with mixed feelings of awe and wonderment\u2014the sublime grandeur of the surroundings being accentuated by the sudden and wide contrast between the level prairies and the tumultuous masses of serrated and broken rock which reach upwards and upwards until they pierce the very clouds. The contrast is as divergent as the poles\u2014as the coral strands of India from Greenland's icy mountains, of which the good Bishop Heber sings in his grand old familiar missionary hymn. Here, in the mountains, Nature has piled up her stately walls, planted her bastions, flung up her turrets and spires, and hung out her wardrobe of oriental splendor. Here she has spread her banquets of health and beauty and poetry. All around in solemn majesty stand the overshadowing forests, with yawning chasm and dark ravine and roaring canyon and beetling cliff\u2014the song of bird, the scent of violet, the subduing, all-pervading sense of majesty and magnificence. In the midst of this awful sublimity, the devout Christian's faith in the omnipotence of the Creator becomes more strong and steadfast, and the thoughtless mocker and sceptic and scoffer loses his infidelity and, with bowed head and reverent mien, becomes unconsciously impregnated with the Christian faith: \"I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth.\" And it is at the threshold of these mountains that the preaching of Christ's earnest and faithful followers has reclaimed from paganism the once wild and barbarous Stones, who, but a few years before, surprised and slaughtered ruthlessly their wily savage foe of the plains. In a winsome vale, the Morleyville mission stands, a monument of Christian work and a remembrance that the grand old Sermon on the Mount, preached nearly two thousand years ago, has re-echoed in these western hills, and been heard by those groping in heathen blindness, to whom it has brought the Light.\n\nEntering the Gap, the rocky gateway through which the Bow river issues from\nthe hills, one finds himself in the Heart of the Rockies\u2014and before him are four other ranges: the Selkirks, the Cascade, the Gold and the Coast\u2014the latter being partly submerged in the Pacific ocean. The scene is one of indescribable grandeur. The senses are overpowered by the ideas of immensity, titanic strength, adamantine hardness and endless existence which these huge collections of rock evoke. It is only in such a spot that the human mind can adequately comprehend the sublime imagery of the inspired writers who told of the \"everlasting hills.\" The frowning peaks, at times dark and gloomy and threatening, defying the elements for ages past, and to defy them for ages to come, appal and oppress one with their immensity\u2014on the one side fantastically broken and castellated heights\u2014on the other, huge snow-mantled monsters. Beyond again, the Three Sisters, loom up as if the long-gone builders of the pyramids of Egypt had crossed the ocean ages ago, and left in this western land these monumental traces of this wonderful work. Beyond this trinity again, the Bull's Head is to be seen; then Anthracite mountain, a spur of the Fairholme range, rich with the coal its name indicates, rises impressively, and not far away is Banff, the great sanitarium which Nature has created and which man has sought to improve. This is the Nation's pleasure ground. The park is a national reservation, ten miles in width and twenty-six in length, and embraces parts of the valleys of the Spray, the Bow and the Cascade rivers. In it, besides innumerable lakelets, is Devil's Lake, whose fascinating loveliness belies its name.\n\n\"Above us are snow-drifts\nA hundred years old,\nBehind us are placers with their pockets of gold,\nAnd mountains of vullion that would whiten a noon,\nThat would silver the face of the harvested moon;\nBeyond us are oceans of ripple and gold,\nWhere the bread cast abroad\nRolls a myriad fold.\"\n\nSuch may be said of the National Park, which, of all the lovely spots that gem the surface of the great Northwest, stands without a rival. Though its fame has flown far and wide throughout, perhaps, the entire civilized world, no charm of artist's bush, or cunningly wreathed words from author pen's has given, or can give anything approaching a just idea of its numerous attractions\u2014it must be seen to be comprehended. Those seeking for health came there each year, not only from all parts of the Dominion of Canada, but also from the Old World, and as each year rolls on, old visitants as well as new ones, are captivated by some hitherto undiscovered charms, and while Nature bewilders her admirers with her lavish beauty, yet she keeps ever in reserve a wealth of attraction which is revealed only to those who yield to her alluring spells, and leads them day by day into some fresh infatuation. What was, but a very few years ago, the wild and unsubdued paradise of the red man, and a few venturesome tourists from afar, who gazed upon its native wildness and virginity, and felt the witchery of its spell, is now the objective point toward which thousands of the weary and sick, as well as the gay court of love, look with unallayed pleasure in anticipation of a few weeks holiday to be spent there, indulging in healthful pastimes and freed from the business cares of everyday life. Banff is no longer a local resort, but with a sudden spring into favor, and a magic acquisition of all the appliances necessary to minister to the comforts of human nature, and satisfy the most\nexacting, it welcomes yearly the thousands who have heard of it from afar, and been drawn thither by its magnetic influence. Its charms being their own interpreters, need no other laudation, and the day when it shall be known and sought by the pilgrims of fashion and recreation from every corner of the globe, is rapidly dawning.\n\nIt is here that Nature brings forth in profusion her richest and most varied charms, and the quiet recesses along the indentations, which are among its most remarkable features, will ever preserve their characteristic wildness, and beyond what may be desirable in the way of beautification and adornment, the hand of man can never undo what Nature, with such wonderful and unerring skill, has wrought. During the past two years, the Dominion Government has expended an immense amount of money on the Park which, by the way, was reserved from settlement. In the summer of 1886, Mr. Pearce, the inspector of mines, was appointed to enquire into the claims of those who alleged they were the first white men on the ground, and who, it is true, had made some little improvements on the rude manner in which Nature had left the place, in the way of fencing in the cave and constructing a stairway from the mouth to the ledge at the water's edge, erecting rough shanties over the spot where the boiling stream bursts forth from Sulphur Mountain, and \"blazing\" a road from the Canadian Pacific Railway track to the side of the Bow River, on the north side, and continuing it on the south, up the side of the mountain, to where the bath-houses were located. There were numerous \"first discoverers,\" and a few who claimed ownership by virtue of purchase from the original finders of the \"wizard stream.\" From the time of the arrival of the agent of the Department of the Interior, those different parties were notified that no portion of the territory within a certain radius of the spring could be taken up, as the Government intended reserving it for the purposes of a post, and this, very naturally, gave rise to a great deal of disappointment to those who had gone to some trouble and expense, both in \"fixing up\" the baths and making accommodation for guests, and in hunting up evidence in support of their claim. The evidence was very lengthy, and, after consideration at Ottawa, those who established their claims in any respect were compensated for what they had done. While the commission was sitting, a party of men were sent out by the Government, under Mr. J. Stewart, C.E., and a temporary boom bridge was soon constructed and swung across the Bow River from the north to the south side, doing away with the necessity of rowing across the river in order to gain the springs. This being done, a much larger force of men was obtained, and an excellent roadway was made from the bridge up the side of the mountain, a distance of nearly two miles. In the pioneer days, the hotel accommodation not being adequate for all the invalids and tourists, many could be found all around the vicinity of the springs, as well as on the other side of the river, living in tents and log huts. All the time, preparations were being made for the erection of a very large and handsome hotel, which is now completed, with capacity to accommodate over 300 guests, known as the \"Canadian Pacific Railway Hotel.\" It is situated in a lovely spot on the bank of the river, and ranks as the best hotel in the Northwest. As it is well kept, furnished throughout with excellent taste, and the menu such as to more than satisfy the epicure, there is no wondering at the immense business which it does. Another of the institutions of the park is Dr. Brett's \"Sanatorium,\" a health resort, which is fitted out with all the modern paraphernalia required for such a place, the guests being able to bathe in the sulphur fluid without the neces-\nA PEEP AT THE ROCKIES, FROM NEAR CANMORE.\nsity of travelling up to the springs, these wonderful curative waters being conducted from the mountain to the Sanitarium by means of pipes. The Sanitarium is under the direct supervision of Dr. Brett, a physician whose ability is well-known throughout Manitoba. The doctor also has a staff of competent assistants, including another medical doctor, to assist him in the work, which has grown to wonderful proportions since the place was opened. The temporary bridge thrown across the river in 1886 has since been replaced by an iron structure, and in fact the Dominion Government has added, as far as possible, to the natural beauty, or rather to make the beauties of Banff accessible. There are also a number of residences erected at Banff, and several stores have been opened within the last two years. A number of residences are also in course of erection. There is plenty of fishing and shooting here. It would be difficult to mention another place in the \"Great Lone Land\" which unites in itself so many attractions of so many different kinds as Banff, and the reason its scenic beauties have been dwelt on with such ardor is because they are so preeminently distinguished, so different, not only in degree but in kind, from those of the average resort, that they more than merit all that has been said of them. It lies in the centre of Nature's sanitarium, to dip in whose springs, and breathe in whose air, is for the invalid and despairing one to take new courage and live.\n\nPassing deserted mountain hamlets, once prosperous, but whose life-blood ebbed away with the passing of railway construction, the castellated turrets of Castle Mountain, pointing skywards, remind one of some of the grand ancient castles on the Rhine, or rather the home of some giant knight in the brave days of old, to be read of in children's fairy stories. For fifteen miles, the sombre wall of this gigantic giant's keep is a sheer precipice of 5,000 feet. At the summit of the Rockies, a large wooden cross marks the dividing line between British Columbia and the District of Alberta, and here is a miniature lake with no visible inlet or outlet. This is the Great Divide. From here the waters which rise in the mountains above separate and flow to the Pacific or to the Hudson's Bay. Here, too, is Mount Stephen\u2014towering over eight thousand feet above the railway track, the highest peak in the range\u2014and beyond, Cathedral Mountain, grand past all conception, impresses one with its magnificent presence. A perfect edifice\u2014one so colossal that it seems as if it were built by divine hands for the angels to worship the Creator of the Universe and ceaselessly sing Hosannahs to the Highest\u2014and so magnificently beautiful\u2014far out-rivalling and out-dazzling the great temple at Jerusalem, that only the Great Architect himself could have devised and planned it. A fitting edifice for the celestial choir to chant the praises of Him\u2014a shrine at which a world could worship\u2014a sanctuary, from which, at the last supreme day, could issue forth the sound of the Great Amen!\n\nThe scene changes. Passively through the common-place named Kicking Horse Pass, the narrow defile leads down a dark and gloomy canyon, through which flows the river, raging and boiling and leaping, as if all the imps of the inferno were lashing it into a mad fury. Hemmed in on all sides by the towering mounts, you descend deeper and deeper\u2014as if into the Valley of the Shadow of Death guarded by adamantine Titans to resent intrusion into this other world. The waters of the Kicking Horse, roaring and hissing and dashing furiously\u2014a devil's cauldron\u2014break the dread silence. Here and there are inextricable confusion, a labyrinth of rocks, stones, stumps, broken trees, crushed pines, dead giants torn from their roots by storms, or hurled from the mountain sides by avalanches of snow, or by the immense\nmasses of stone which were lying by their sides. Acres of these tangled collections of broken and dead or dying material had been cut through by the persistent engineer, and it could be seen where fragments, dislodged from the lofty sides of the mountains, weighing hundreds of tons, had crashed their way through the forest, leaving the pines bent, broken and wrenched by the roots from their rocky beds, and had sunk themselves deep in the yielding earth. Some are hoary with age and covered with lichens of the most beautiful colors. Some are lying over trees they had stricken to death in their headlong fall, some had trees lying over them, some are deep in the ground stopped by trees whose roots they had dragged from the soil; some are almost hidden by a maze of blackened trunks, which a mountain fire had laid low and left to certain destruction by the rains and the snows and the ice, and the tempests which for ages will continue to howl and hold dreadful reverie in this fearful pass. There is but one peaceful spot\u2014and that is Field, where the traveller, awed and impressed by the strange weirdness of that through which he has passed, finds relief and pleasure in a romantic and picturesque place. Then on down to the very base of the Rockies, across the seventeen mile valley which separates them from the Selkirks\u2014and new wonders of scenery of calm and solemn grandeur fascinate and transfix one. The traveller has crossed the first Great Divide of the North American continent.\n\nACROSS THE SELKIRKS.\n\nIf the scenery of the regal Rockies is wierd and impressive, that of the sister Selkirks is even more entrancing, because more winsome and more beautiful. The grand peaks, rising to the heights of 8000 feet, whose tops are frequently enveloped in guazy clouds, says one writer, \"seem to be a supernaturally dignified priesthood of a religion whose votaries were deities. I was constantly constrained to fancy their lofty heads bathed in light, as the embodiment of the devotional sentiment, intensified for a reverence of the Great Maker of this wonderful region; whose depth was unfathomable, and whose vastness was inconceivable. Divines may attempt eloquently to describe the majesty of the Great Power, but the silent peaks of the Selkirks make them mute; for they are the most eloquent exponents of the illimitable and everlasting. These eternal priests have for untold ages raised their lofty heads in silent adoration of Him who is Alpha and Omega, and, for ages yet to roll over the world, they will in similar silence point man to the same God, and command him, with an authority he dare not dispute, to bow down before His power, and adore His marvellous works.\" Priests! did I say? Would that the little things which insist on this appellation would take for example the wonderful priesthood of the 'everlasting' hills! They know no littleness\u2014they bend to nothing which is small or trifling or ignoble\u2014they know no uncharitableness; they dream of no narrowness, they are not divided in their adoration, and though each priest is robed in his own light, no one takes offence, or even criticises the robes of his associate.\"\n\nClouds rush by between the bottoms of the highest peaks, and it can be dimly imagined that in this wondrous spot the two great monarchies\u2014this mother earth of ours and the celestial kingdom\u2014meet; it can be faintly realized that this planet\nACROSS THE SELKIRKS.\n\nrises up to the blue-vaulted heavens; and as we see the sky line broken by the mountains divine, fancy, as the rays of the sun glint and shine, that here, too, is another golden pathway that leads to the unknown world beyond the clouds\u2014up which the gods of the ancients have climbed. The beauty, the grandeur, the sublimity of the Selkirks are bewildering. The feast of picturesque loveliness satiates the senses, and, dreamily closing the eyes, one can imagine he is passing through an enchanted realm, whose gorgeous beauty outrivals the wonderful scenes of the Arabian Nights.\n\nCrossing the Columbia River,\u2014the grandest stream in America west of the Rockies\u2014the name reminds one of the province to which it gives its name. This river's nomenclature is derived from an American ship, the Columbia, which entered its mouth in 1792; old Spanish navigators had previously called it St. Roe. The total length of the river, which rises in American territory, and, making a huge bend in the British possessions, flows back to the neighboring republic and empties into the Pacific, is about 440 miles. Of this distance, one-third is composed of lakes or expansions of a lake-like character, which are of great depth, the river being navigable for many miles. Before reaching the \"first crossing\" of the Columbia, however, one passes an historical spot\u2014Moberley House\u2014the site of the oldest cabin in the mountains, named after Walter Moberley, C.E., to whose persevering energy in exploring, Canada is deeply indebted, and which indebtedness will probably never be paid. Following down the western bank of the Columbia, the gate of the Beaver is entered\u2014the Beaver, an impetuous mountain torrent twelve miles beyond Donald, a railway town with an undeserved character for wickedness, compared with which Chicago and Winnipeg were saintly cities. Donald is flourishing, and will outlive the ill reputation it earned in its infant railway-building days. Up the railway climbs and creeps\u2014the size of the dark, densely foliaged monarch of the forest, the Douglas fir, increasing appreciably. Up the mountain side, and Sir Donald, with seven other giant peaks, enrobed in perpetual snow, comes in view. The beauty of the scene is augmented by successions of foaming cascades which leap down the mountain side\u2014one of which so impressed the railway builders with its charm that they named it the \"Surprise.\" Beyond again, a rift in the cliffs to the right affords a grand sight\u2014the old Hermit, keeping lonely vigil, as he has mutely watched since that solemn day when He created the heavens and earth. It is near here that one of the loftiest bridges in the world spans a ravine 295 feet above the torrent, and 750 feet long; cost a quarter of a million dollars in its construction. On past the mile-high Mount Carroll and the Hermit, through a narrow portal, leading between enormous precipices, the summit of the Selkirks is reached. This is Rogers' Pass, named after Major A. B. Rogers, who, after prolonged explorations, discovered it in 1883. While doubtless previous to that time this fastness of the Selkirk had never been penetrated by white men, the Indians both on the east and west had known the possibility of access by it, probably for centuries, but neither Shuswap nor Kootenay would reveal it or traverse it, as traditionally they were bitter enemies. The pass lies between two lines of huge, snow-clad peaks\u2014that on the north, as told in the guide book, \"forming a mammoth amphitheatre, whose parapet, eight or nine thousand feet above the valley, encircles vast spaces of snow and shelters wide fields of perpetual ice, glaciers besides which those of Switzerland would be insignificant, and so near that the shining green fissures penetrating their masses can be seen.\" Here\nthe traveller is 4300 feet above the level of the sea. At the very foot of the greatest of all the glaciers of the Selkirks, stands a pretty Swiss chalet\u2014a resting place for the tourist from which to view the entrancing beauty of the mountainous surroundings. Searcely a mile away is the glacier,\u2014a huge mass of ice, hundreds of feet deep, where it has lain for centuries, moving imperceptibly\u2014a field for lovers of the sensational and novel. Not far away from this icy wonder, dropping from the abrupt cliffs, is a beautiful cascade. Here is to be seen those magnificent atmospheric effects of light and shade, which are so frequent in the mountains. One, unaccustomed to such scenery, can really form no adequate conception of the astonishing, the absolutely bewildering profusion of these effects. From early morn to far into the evening the colors are constantly changing. Clouds of densities, infinitely varying, are perpetually passing over the snow-capped peaks and the deep valleys, producing colors from the most delicate of purples and grays to the most glowing crimson and orange: blues from the faintest cobalt to the richest ultramarine: greens from the palest of sages to the darkest of chromes: yellows from the almost imperceptible lemon to the heaviest of aureolas,\u2014and these are always moving, ever restless, ever forming new combinations. Besides the varied scenery to entrance the eye of the tourist, the spot has an additional attraction to the sportsman, for the summits of these lofty ranges are the homes of the wild sheep and goat and grizzly. Here it is that the turbulent Illicilliwaet takes its rise, and, following its course, the descent of the western slope of the Selkirks is made. At the base of Ross Peak, a sudden, sheer, precipitous cliff is reached, which could not be bridged. An engineering difficulty was encountered which seemed, at one time, to baffle the skill of man to overcome. But by a series of lofty trestles and curves across the heads of gorges and around the brows of promontories,\u2014known as \"the Loop\"\u2014man achieved a triumph. \"Perhaps,\" writes Lady Macdonald in her admirable description of the overland journey, \"no part of the line is more extraordinary, as evincing daring engineering skill, than this pass, where the road-bed curves in loops over trestle-bridges of immense height, at the same time rapidly descending. In six miles of actual travelling the train only advances two and a half miles, so numerous are the windings necessary to get through this canyon. As I sit looking forward down the pass I can see long trestle-bridges below, and yet on a line with the one we are crossing at the moment! They show above the forest, sharply distinct, so far below, that for a moment my heart beats quickly as I feel the brakes tighten, and the engine bear on with a quiet, steady, slower rush round and down and over, while I look through the trestle-beams into the hurrying foam of waters 150 feet below.\" In this locality are promising silver mines penetrating the crest of one of the foot-hills, and beyond is Albert Canyon, which seems to be a final effort of Nature to intensify all that is frightful. It is about 300 feet deep from the level of the road, and the mountain shoots up a very slight angle to a height of 2000 feet. The bottom does not appear to be more than ten or twelve feet wide, while the opening at the top is certainly not over thirty. The sides are broken\u2014projecting and jagged masses of almost black rock tortured into a thousand shapes. The canyon twists and turns in a most extraordinary manner, and the whole is so crooked and broken and distorted as to defy description. It is quite impossible to describe the feeling of wonder and awe inspired by this deep, dark cavern, at the bottom of which we see the river boiling and rushing along with the speed of a\nrace-horse. We hear its roar long before we reach it, and when we see it fairly leaping in its rage and haste, imprisoned by the black walls of the cruel-looking mountain, the blood freezes, and the beating of the heart almost ceases. At Albert is a remarkable soda spring, where a natural liquid, equal to the best manufactured watered water, flows in liberal volume. And then \"the Gate\" is reached\u2014two walls of dark rock, each about two feet thick, twenty feet high, and ten feet wide, jutting out from each side of the canyon immediately opposite each other, leaving a space of ten feet open in the centre of the canyon. Through it the pent-up river roars with augmented maddening noise and turbulence. If the waters of the Illicilliwat were wild before, they are delirious and frenzied now as they dash with terrible fury against the adamantine walls, which have defied their ceaseless rage for ages unknown. At Revelstoke, the second crossing of the Columbia is reached, the mighty Selkirks are crossed, and before the traveller rises up the third great rocky range,\u2014lower than its brethren, but richer in mineral wealth\u2014the Gold Mountains.\n\nThe following are the heights of the principal peaks along the line of the Canadian Pacific:\n\n| Above C.

It is a land of delight\u2014with scenes winsome and beautiful and gorgeous and grand\u2014an elysium, if not of perpetual summer, possessing such an equable voluptuous climate that it requires no vivid imagination to fancy that here the golden Indian summer days first found their birth. The wealth of beauty is enchanting and alluring\u2014everywhere a magnificent panorama dawning upon the entranced vision\u2014and beside it, Switzerland becomes common-place and prosaic, and old-world resorts of\ntourists fade into nothingness. No pen has yet adequately depicted its loveliness; no pen can. Around it cluster the romance of legend and tradition, for while young to us, Columbia is rich in historical associations; and a century ago was almost the cause of precipitating a war between the two great nations of Great Britain and Spain. While the mountain fastnesses have been undoubtedly peopled with Indians from time immemorial, it was not until the early days of the sixteenth century that civilized nations discovered the existence of the Pacific Ocean. Spain, ever leading the van in that age of discovery, had sent her staunch ships and dauntless mariners up the west coast of the continent, and in 1577 Great Britain followed in exploratory voyages. The famous Sir Francis Drake, commissioned by good Queen Bess, sailed with a quintette of vessels of small burden, and passing safely through the straits of Magellan, heroically faced the fleets of Spain, which then held undisturbed possession of all that was known of the western coast of America. With his little squadron, save one vessel, destroyed by storm, to escape interception by the enemy, Sir Francis determined on searching for a north-east passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic by the Straits of Anian, which are now supposed to be identical with Hudson's Straits, little dreaming that a continent lay between the two waters. Whether Drake ever entered the Straits of Juan Fuca and discovered what is now British Columbia, is an unsettled question, but there is not the shadow of a doubt but that, by right of original discovery, he claimed in the name of the British Sovereign the country extending from the 43d to the 48th parallel and christened it New Albion. Although up to this time, the Spaniards had not penetrated so far north, they advanced further and made important discoveries. A Greek mariner in the Spanish service, Juan de Fuca, was sent at the close of the century \"to discover the Strait of Anian, along the coast of the South Sea, and to fortify that strait to resist the passage and proceedings of the English nation.\" As to finding communication with the Atlantic, of course, the venture was a complete failure, but de Fuca believed otherwise. Entering the straits, which bear his name to this day, he sailed up the Gulf of Georgia, which separates Vancouver Island from the mainland, and coming out into the Northern Pacific, imagined that he had reached the Atlantic through Hudson's (Anian) Strait. Returning home, with the impression that at last the great question of the age\u2014the long sought for northwest passage\u2014had been solved, it was not until other explorers failed to find the passage that the egregious error\u2014only pardonable by the imperfect science of the time\u2014was discovered. The Spaniards, however, did not abandon their exploring expeditions, and about the middle of the eighteenth century the British Parliament offered a reward of \u00a320,000 for the discovery of a practicable passage, by water, between the Atlantic and the Pacific. Geographical knowledge now explains the failure of the daring explorers in their efforts, and why the rich prize was never claimed. During the century, the country was formally taken possession of by several English and Spanish expeditions and the flag of their nations implanted, but no actual effort at colonization was made. At this time, the visitors were fiercely attacked by the warlike tribes which inhabited the country. It was not until 1788\u2014just a century ago\u2014that an English fur trader, sailing under the Portuguese flag for commercial reasons, erected a house at Nootka Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver, then considered part of the mainland, and commenced trading. The following year, the Spaniards took forcible possession of the place, built a fort, and seized three English vessels, and sent officers and crew as prisoners.\nto Mexico. This belligerant act aroused the British Lion, and Captain Vancouver was sent to the place to confer with the Spanish officer in charge, and happily the result of his mission was that the amicable relations between the two powers were, although greatly strained, not entirely broken, and by the treaty of 1790 Spain relinquished her claim to Nootka Sound. Vancouver was a discoverer, as well as a diplomat, and searching for a northwest passage, sailed up the Straits of Georgia, upon which he bestowed the name of his sovereign, and discovered that Vancouver was not what it had been supposed it was, part of the mainland, but an island\u2014and with that island his name has been inseparably connected to the present time. Spain had Commissioner Bodega y Quadra to confer with Vancouver, and the two commissioners agreed to name the island, in their own honor, and both entered it upon their charts as the \"Island of Vancouver and Quadra,\" though in after years the Spaniard's name was dropped from the title and is now almost forgotten.\n\nAn effort was made to revive it by calling the new city of Vancouver \"Quadra,\" but the residents refused to accept it, and insisted in perpetuating the memory of the gallant English captain. During 1793, Alexander Mackenzie, one of the partners of the Northwest Company, made the first overland journey to the Pacific. He started the previous October from Fort Chipewyan, the advance post of the great fur company he represented, and followed up Peace River to the base of the Rocky Mountains. In the spring, he crossed the mountains and came upon the Fraser River, which he named the \"Tacoutchee-Tassee.\" This name was dropped and \"Columbia\" substituted when, upon his return, he learned that the mouth of that stream had been discovered the year before. He descended the river southward in canoes a distance of 250 miles, and then turned to the west and crossed the mountains to the coast at an inlet in latitude 52 degrees and 20 minutes, arriving only a few days after Vancouver's fleet had explored and named it \"Cascade Canal.\" The next step towards occupation was taken in 1805 by Simon Fraser, a representative of the same company. He followed Mackenzie's route as far as Fraser Lake, where he established a trading post. The country was then called New Caledonia. In 1812 he followed the river to the ocean, and thus learning that it was not the Columbia, bestowed his own name upon it. During the next thirty years, the consolidated Hudson's Bay Company founded a number of trading posts, or forts, and in 1843, established a general supply station for this region on Vancouver Island, which they named Victoria, in honor of the young Queen who had recently ascended the throne of England. In 1849, the Island of Vancouver was constituted a crown colony; the mainland nine years later; and in 1866, the two colonies were united under the name of British Columbia, which, prospering and thriving under a paternal government, entered the confederation of the Dominion in July 1871, and was clothed with the dignity and title of a province. It was in 1859, that the island of San Juan, a small spot in the Haro archipelago, nearly became a casus belli between the United States and Great Britain. The island was occupied by the Hudson's Bay Company and an American settler, and a dispute about a pig belonging to the latter occurred, which increasing in importance\u2014the dispute, not the pig\u2014led to international complications. The Americans took forcible occupation of San Juan, and British gunboats, with shotted guns, threateningly guarded the earthworks the enemy had erected. War seemed inevitable, but thanks to the wise counsels of the commanders of the opposing forces, hostilities were averted. Diplomatic negotiations were carried on for some time,\nthe island being jointly occupied by martial camps of the two nations, and finally American cuteness overmastered British blundering, and this key to the gulf of Georgia was formally ceded to the Americans.\n\nThere was another event in the annals of British Columbia that should not be omitted in even this brief retrospect of the province\u2014the discovery of gold. Although the existence of the precious metal had been known by the Hudson's Bay Company's officers for some years, through the Indians bartering it for supplies, it was not until 1857 that the fact became widely learned, and in that year a party of Canadians prospected the banks of the Bonaparte and Thompson rivers, on their way to the Fraser. The news of the finding of gold in paying quantities spread quickly and widely; and, in the following spring, thousands flocked into Victoria from California, and the population of the little settlement of Victoria rose in a few months from two or three hundred to between 20,000 and 30,000. A motley throng rushed in, and Victoria became one vast camp of gold-seekers. In the crowd, naturally, were gamblers and loafers and riffians of the vilest type. The offscourings of the States were there in force. Property rose to extravagant values, and, while rival cities were boomed, the commanding position of Victoria overshadowed them, and they were short-lived. The effect of the gold fever was very depressing on Californian property, which fell to a degree that almost threatened the ruin of the state. While the majority of new comers remained in Victoria and indulged in gambling in real estate, and also in cards, several thousands ventured across the gulf and proceeded to the gold fields. A monthly license was required for each miner. Gold was found in large quantities by those who arrived early in the year, but the great mass did not reach the Fraser till the June rise, which submerged the gold bars, and, in ignorance of the periodic rise and fall of rivers, they were disappointed at their non-success. Their patience becoming exhausted waiting for the uncovering of the hidden auriferous wealth, thousands returned to California despondent, crestfallen and bankrupt, leaving the country with a curse on their lips. The report was widely spread that the river never subsided, and with the heavy commercial restrictions imposed by the Hudson's Bay Company, which then practically ruled the country, tended to largely check immigration. There were some men of indomitable spirit, however, who, cognizant of the unfavorable season at which they had arrived, pushed on further up the Fraser, overcoming the perils and difficulties of the hazardous route. \"The misery and fatigue endured by them,\" says Mr. Macie, then a resident of British Columbia, \"was indescribable. They crept through underwood and thicket for many miles, sometimes on hands and knees, with a bag of flour on the back of each, alternately under and over fallen trees, scrambling up precipices, or sliding down over masses of sharp, projecting rock, or wading up to their waist through bogs and swamps. Every day added to their exhaustion; and, worn out with privations and sufferings, one knot of adventurers after another became smaller and smaller, some lagging behind to rest, or turning back in despair.\" * * * * Gold there was in abundance, but want of access prevented the country from being 'prospected,' and reckless men, without stopping to take this into account, condemned the mines and everything connected with them without distinction.\" While this fierce race for wealth was in progress, the sudden re-action set in. Eager expectation gave way to lethargic despondency, and matters in Victoria became pretty dismal. The rowdy element began mob rule, and actually\nMOUNT STEPHEN, NEAR THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCKIES.\nproposed, after a bold defiance of the law, to hoist the Stars and Stripes on the forts occupied by the Hudson's Bay Company. The timely arrival of a gunboat from Esquimalt had a restraining effect, however. But the boom had broken. Large sums of money sent for investment from California, were returned, and whole cargoes of goods, ordered during the heat of the excitement, were either shipped back or left unsaleable on the hands of the merchants. Then the exodus commenced, and Victoria's population of 30,000 dwindled down to about 1500. And yet, in the short time the fever raged, nearly three-quarters of a million of dollars in gold was extracted from the rivers\u2014a far larger sum than California produced in the same period in the halcyon days of the Argonauts in '49. In '61, the gold fever again broke out, though less fiercely, and immigrants once more poured in. A large number made independent fortunes, others were fairly successful, and the remainder lost their all.: The Cariboo Diggings were 500 miles away from what the newly-arrived gold-seekers thought was the termination of their journey; and this was to be passed over muddy roads, and across rivers and lakes, past beefing cliffs and frowning precipices, with whatever necessaries they required strapped to their shoulders! It is no wonder that many, half way to the Eldorado, retraced their steps, deterred by the hardships they had met and those before them; but many of those who persevered attained their goal, and reaped the rich reward of their labor. And today there are hundreds engaged in mining successfully. The following are the amounts of gold taken out of the placer mines of British Columbia for the part twenty-eight years, so far as can be accurately determined, and making a total of $50,289,417. The yield for 1887 was smaller than the years chronicled below. This was owing considerably to the extreme drought during the summer, and the fact that a great many miners were engaged in quartz mining:\n\n| Year | Yield | Miners |\n|------|-------|--------|\n| 1858 (6 months) | $520,353 | 3,000 |\n| 1859 | 1,615,072 | 4,000 |\n| 1860 | 2,228,543 | 4,400 |\n| 1861 | 2,666,118 | 4,200 |\n| 1862 | 4,246,266 | 4,100 |\n| 1863 | 4,400 | |\n| 1864 | 3,735,850 | 4,400 |\n| 1865 | 3,491,205 | 4,294 |\n| 1866 | 2,662,106 | 2,982 |\n| 1867 | 2,480,868 | 3,044 |\n| 1868 | 2,372,972 | 2,390 |\n| 1869 | 1,774,978 | <2,369 |\n| 1870 | 1,336,956 | 2,348 |\n| 1871 | 1,799,440 | 2,450 |\n\n| Year | Yield | Miners |\n|------|-------|--------|\n| 1872 | $1,610,972 | 2,400 |\n| 1873 | 1,305,749 | 2,300 |\n| 1874 | 1,844,618 | 2,868 |\n| 1875 | 2,474,904 | 2,024 |\n| 1876 | 1,786,648 | 2,282 |\n| 1877 | 1,608,182 | 1,960 |\n| 1878 | 1,275,204 | 1,883 |\n| 1879 | 1,290,058 | 2,124 |\n| 1880 | 1,013,827 | 1,955 |\n| 1881 | 1,046,737 | 1,898 |\n| 1882 | 954,083 | 1,738 |\n| 1883 | 794,255 | 1,905 |\n| 1884 | 736,165 | 1,838 |\n| 1885 | 713,738 | 2,902 |\n| 1886 | 903,651 | 3,147 |\n\n$50,289,417\n\nBut now a few words as to the country itself:\n\nPerhaps there is no other province in the Dominion of which so little is known and about which there are so many misapprehensions and misconceptions. The most remote from the central authority, it has been generally looked upon by many as a minor and unimportant member of the Confederation\u2014a mere sea of mountains, as it has been derisively dubbed, a land of rock and river and waste on the coast, sparsely inhabited by a few Englishmen, more Chinamen and a larger number of uncivilized Indians. As with the case of Manitoba, however, the \"many\" were\negregiously wrong, and Canadians are awakening to the truth of the eloquent words of Lord Dufferin: \"Canada would indeed be dead to the most self-evident considerations of self-interest, and to the first instincts of national pride, if she did not regard with satisfaction her connection with a province so richly endowed by nature, inhabited by a community so replete with British loyalty and pluck, while it afforded her the means of extending her confines and the outlets of her commerce to the wide Pacific and the countries beyond.\" No other province has richer or more varied resources; none, a climate so balmy, invigorating and health giving; a coast line so magnificent, with such excellent harbors; none, such a wealth of mineral, timber, coal and fish; none, as a writer puts it, for which Nature done so much and Man so little. British Columbia occupies a very important position geographically. It is the only British territory on the western coast of the North American continent, and jutting out from the Northwest, as Great Britain does from Europe, it is the entrepot through which must pass the traffic of a very large portion of the civilized globe. The distances across the Pacific to China, Japan, and Australia compare favorably with other routes, and the direction of the trade winds, the excellent and safe harbors, and the immense coal fields, are favorable factors in directing and developing the commerce which, in a few years, has reached gigantic proportions and which yet are trifling compared with that they will be within a decade.\n\nThe area of the Province is 341,000 square miles\u2014a vast region not of mere coast line, but sitting astride the Rocky Mountains, and comprising within its limits the great rivers flowing to the Pacific, north of the international boundary, and the upper tributary waters of the broad Mackenzie, which drains the continent northward to the polar seas. With the general shape of a parallelogram, the Province has a length of seven hundred miles with a breath of five hundred. The Rockies form the eastern boundary in part, but to the north the Province overlaps them, and includes within its borders part of the fertile Peace River Valley, of which so little yet is known. The provincial limits may be thus defined: South by a line through the centre of the Strait of Fuca, and through the Haro Archipelago, by a definite line to the 49th parallel of north latitude; along that parallel east to the Rocky Mountains; along the summit of that range, westward, to the 120th meridian of west longitude; along that meridian north to its intersection with the 60th parallel of latitude, which parallel forms the extreme northern boundary. Coast-ward by the Pacific Ocean, from the Strait of Fuca to latitude 50 deg. 40 m., and through the middle of the inlet marked in Vancouver's chart as the Portland Channel, whence the western boundary is formed by the eastern limit of Alaska. The vast tract comprised within these limits\u2014extending as it does in a mean north-westerly direction through nearly 12 degrees of latitude, and with a varying breadth and varying elevation\u2014presents, as may be supposed, much difference of local feature and diverse conditions of climate. The coast-line, with its long narrow indentations and wide archipelagic fringe, has been computed to measure upwards of seven thousand statute miles, or more than double the circuit, similarly measured, of Great Britain and Ireland. As the crow flies, it is about six hundred miles in length. And it is of this wonderful feature that Lord Dufferin said: \"Such a spectacle as its coast line presents is not to be paralleled by any country in the world. Day after day, for a whole week, in a vessel of nearly 2,000 tons, we threaded an interminable labyrinth of watery lanes and reaches, that wound endlessly in and out of a network of islands,\"\npromontories and peninsulas for thousands of miles, unruffled by the slightest swell from the adjoining ocean, and presenting at every turn an ever-shifting combination of rock, verdure, forest, glacier and snow-capped mountain of unrivaled grandeur and beauty. When it is remembered that this wonderful system of navigation, equally well adapted to the largest line of battle ship and the frailest canoe, fringes the entire seaboard of your Province and communicates at points, sometimes more than a hundred miles from the coast, with a multitude of valleys stretching eastward into the interior, while at the same time it is furnished with innumerable harbors on either hand, one is lost in admiration at the facilities for inter-communication which are thus provided for the future inhabitants of this wonderful region.\"\n\nThe general physical features of the province are described in a government guide-book as follows: It occupies the mountainous, or hilly, region that extends to the Pacific Ocean from the western edge of the great plain or prairie country of Central Canada lying east of the Rocky Mountains. The length of the province is about 700 miles, and the extreme breadth over 500 miles. Its area is estimated at about 250,000 square miles. The Rocky Mountains rise abruptly at their eastern base from the plain or prairie region of Central Canada, and present often to the east almost perpendicular walls of rock. They are composed, not of a single upheaved ridge, but of a number of more or less nearly parallel ranges, which have a general direction a little west of north, and a breadth of over sixty miles. The rivers that flow into Hudson's Bay and the Arctic Ocean have their sources farther back among the several ranges of the Rockies as we proceed northward. Between the 51st and 52nd parallels, the ranges not only become more diffuse, but decrease rapidly in height, till on the Border of the Arctic Ocean, they are represented by comparatively low hills. The surface of the country between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean may be divided into two subordinate mountain districts, flanking on either side an irregular belt of high plateau country, which extends, with an average width of about 100 miles, up the interior of the province to about 55.30, N. L., and is, in fact, a northerly continuation of the great basin of Utah and Nevada in the United States. On the eastern side of this high irregular plateau, are masses of mountains that run generally parallel to the Rocky Mountains, and are not well distinguished from them. This is one of the mountain districts above-mentioned. The other is a mass of mountains on the western side of the plateau. These latter are commonly called the coast range of British Columbia\u2014a range uplifted later than the Cascado Mountains of Oregon, and not of the same formation. The large Islands of Vancouver and Queen Charlotte, which shelter the mainland coast, are above-water portions of a still more westerly range of mountains now half submerged in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Cascade Mountains of Oregon, though described in some accounts of the province as running longitudinally through it, in fact merely enter the south-west angle of British Columbia and disappear on the east side of the Fraser, about 150 miles up that river. In the extreme north of the province, the mountains generally, except those of the coast range, diminish in height, and the surface has a gentle northerly and northeasterly slope towards the Arctic Ocean.\n\nThe climate of the Province is proverbially genial and salubrious, and it is the boast of every Columbian that \"it is unsurpassed in the world.\" The temperature of the Pacific coast is much milder than that in the same latitude on the American shores of the Atlantic. The one great influence is the broad stream of warm water,\nknown as the Kuro Siwo, or Japan current, which flows in the Pacific ocean northward from the equator along the shores of Japan, then turns eastward and southward along the Aleutian Islands, and down the Pacific coast of America again. Its genial influence is exerted from Alaska to Southern California, and from it, genial winds almost incessantly waft landward. Its gentle breezes dispel winter and make drouth impossible. The great island of Vancouver, says H. L. Wells, in the West Shore magazine, lies parallel with the coast for a distance of three hundred miles, and has a central ridge of mountains reaching a height of three thousand feet. In passing these mountains, the warm air suffers its first chill, and copious showers fall upon the island, the outer coast receiving more than the inner. The wind then sweeps inward, across the Gulf of Georgia, until it strikes the still higher mountains along the mainland coast, where a still greater precipitation of rain is the result. Robbed, now, of the greater portion of their warmth and moisture, they sweep across the high plateau of the interior, shedding upon it but little of their store of life-giving water. Finally, they encounter the Gold and Selkirk mountains, and another precipitation of rain follows, leaving but little to be taken from them by the rugged peaks of the Rockies. The average rainfall on the island; at Victoria, is about twenty-five inches, falling almost exclusively during the six months, from October to March. At New Westminster, on the mainland coast, the mean annual rainfall during a period of seven years, was fifty-nine and one-half inches. At Spence's bridge, on Thompson river, in the centre of the inland plateau, the rainfall is about ten inches. The climate of Vancouver island is delightful and invigorating. Snow seldom falls, and lies on the ground but a few hours. For a period of three years, the lowest temperature was eight degrees above zero, and the highest was eighty-three and nine-tenths degrees, the summer heat being tempered by the cool breezes from the Olympic mountains. The mercury has never fallen below zero since observations have been taken. On the mainland coast, in the vicinity of the mouth of Fraser river, the thermometer ranges slightly higher in summer, and lower in winter, than at Victoria. As a general thing, ice forms on the river for a short period, and from January to March, snow falls at intervals, reaching an average total precipitation of fifty inches. Because of its extremely light rainfall, the climate of the interior plateau differs widely from that of the coast, being subject to a greater range of temperature. The thermometer occasionally indicates twenty-five degrees below zero in winter, and rises to ninety-eight above in summer. Snow lies on the ground longer than near the coast, though the snowfall is not heavy. As the mountains on the east are approached, the fall of snow increases in proportion with the rainfall. In the mountains, the winters are severe and the quantity of snow heavy. The climate of the interior varies with the latitude. In the southern portion it is milder in winter than farther north. Though the heat is sometimes great in the daytime, sunstrokes are unknown, and a cool breeze from the mountains renders the nights comfortable. Snow seldom exceeds two and one-half feet in depth, and is frequently removed in short order by the chinook, as the warm ocean wind is called. To the northward, the general surface of the country is higher, and is broken by irregular masses and spurs of mountains. The summers are short and warm, and the winters are longer and colder than farther south, with a heavier fall of snow. In the valley of Fraser river, throughout its entire length, the climate is milder than on the adjacent uplands. Even in the extreme north, the islands along the coast, and that portion of\nthe mainland between the mountains and the sea, have the same mild, moist climate as Vancouver island; and this condition continues far to the north, in Alaska. Taken as a whole, the climate, differing widely as it does in places, is salubrious and invigorating. No miasmatic infection from ague-breeding marshes taints the atmosphere. Whatever locality one may select for a residence, whether the one of moist air and equable temperature along the coast, or the dryer and more varying one of the interior, he will find the climate healthful, invigorating, and calculated to inspire activity, comparing more than favorably with the same latitude on the Atlantic slope.\n\n\"No words can be too strong,\" said the marquis of Lorne\u2014speaking at Victoria in the month of December, 1882\u2014\"to express the charm of this delightful land, where the climate, softer and more constant than that of the south of England, ensures at all times of the year a full enjoyment of the wonderful loveliness of nature around you.\"\n\nOne of the principal sources of wealth of the Province is its extensive forests which apparently contain an inexhaustible supply of lumber; but the increasing demand is so rapid that the Provincial government has wisely legislated against speculators securing timber limits, and in other ways protected this great resource from being wantonly destroyed. The prevailing timber is the Douglas fir, which covers the coasts and islands densely, from near Alaska down beyond the international borders, and extending into the interior as far as the Rockies. This magnificent tree attains gigantic proportions, varying from 150 to 200 feet in height and from ten to twenty feet in circumference; but even larger specimens than these are sometimes found. The Douglas stands proudly erect, straight, and without any lower limbs, thus affording a large quantity of clear lumber. Although the grain is coarse, it is tough and tenacious and stronger even than oak. It is a peculiarity of this timber that it can be used green, without danger of shrinking or swelling. The red cedar, which grows more thickly along the coast, is very durable, and is one of the most beautiful woods for house furnishing known, rivalling mahogany, and cherry. The Indians use it for canoes, weave the fibre into blankets, and utilize the bark for roofing their houses. There is a beautiful yellow cedar, or juniper, which grows on the upper end of Vancouver island and along the lakes of the interior, which takes a splendid finish, and is very desirable for use with the red cedar, mahogany or cherry, as an ornamental panel. There is another yellow cedar, or cypress, which is more abundant, being found along the coast from Puget sound to Alaska. Owing to its strong odor, the voracious toredo will not attack it, and for this reason, as well as for its toughness, it is in demand for piling and submarine works. In the extreme north is found the white, or Alaska, cedar, a splendid finishing wood, of which but little has ever been cut. The Indians use it for making their elaborately carved heraldic columns, or totem sticks. South of this, and north of the fifty-second parallel, the spruce predominates in the coast forests, but has not yet been cut for lumber. On the Lower Fraser, the Weymouth, or white, pine is found, though not in great quantities. It attains great size and beauty. Balsam pine, also, obtains a vigorous growth, but is not present in quantity, nor valuable for timber. Yellow pine flourishes in the interior. The wood is heavy, closely grained and very durable. Hemlock, which is found along the lower coast and islands, grows to large proportions, and its bark is valuable for tanning. In the bottoms along the international line,\nthe western larch attains great size, and Scotch fir grows in the interior, and a smaller growth is found on Vancouver island. Of hard woods, there are several varieties. The yew grows along the coast and extends up Fraser river as far as Yale. It is of smaller size than the yew of England, and was used by the natives for bows. Oak abounds on Vancouver island, and is a tough and serviceable wood. Along the streams of the coast, alder is found in quantity, and is used for furniture, as, also, is maple, which abounds on the lowlands of the islands and coast as far north as the fifty-fifth parallel. A variety of maple, the vine maple, is confined to the coast, and has a strong, white wood. Crab-apple, white thorn, arbutus and dogwood are found on the islands and coast, and mountain ash in the interior. Several varieties of aspen and poplar are found along the water courses of the coast and interior, all known as \"cottonwood.\" The extent of merchantable timber in the province is enormous, and any estimate must be largely guess work. Mill men of the province calculate a total of from seven to ten billion feet of such timber as is now being cut\u2014the choice trees of the forest. An experienced lumberman from Michigan recently investigated the question, and computed that of timber which is suitable for milling, there are between forty and fifty billion feet, of which eighty per cent. is fir, ten to fifteen per cent. red cedar, and the remainder of other varieties, although there are many large mills in the province, which have been cutting industriously for the past fifteen years, scarcely any impression has yet been made on the forests which appear practically untouched. In 1887, the cut was a hundred million feet, and it is estimated that the output for fifteen years has been between forty and fifty million feet annually. The centre of the lumbering industry is on Burrard Inlet. The chief markets are China, Australia, Central and South America and the Sandwich Islands, to which doubtless will soon be added the great treeless plains of the Canadian Northwest.\n\nThe great marine resources of British Columbia are described by Mr. Walls\u2014and no apology is necessary for reprinting his excellent account\u2014in the following words:\u2014Multitudes of fish, valuable for food and oil, swarm in the bays, inlets and rivers of the province, and in the waters of the adjacent ocean. Here is a source of wealth which may be drawn upon for an indefinite period, and which will yearly yield employment to an increasing number of men, and add to the revenue of the province. Several branches of the fishing industry have already obtained a foothold, but they are overshadowed by the enormous possibilities of the future. Nowhere else in the world are such quantities and so many varieties of valuable fish to be found, in waters where the dangers of navigation are so slight and the climate so mild and agreeable. The want of a sufficiently extensive market, and popular ignorance of the extent and character of the fisheries, have, in the past, operated to retard the growth of this industry; but both of these causes are now disappearing. The Canadian Pacific Railway offers a route to eastern markets, and the fishermen of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland are beginning to realise the immeasurable superiority of the waters of British Columbia for the prosecution of their business. The outlook is now favorable for the immigration to this coast of large numbers of fishermen, who will soon give the cod banks of the Pacific as wide a notoriety as that now possessed by those of the Atlantic. The most extensive industry is that of canning and salting salmon. Salmon of several varieties crowd into the inlets and streams of the province, ascending as far inland as possible, to deposit their spawn in the shallow, fresh\nwaters of the interior. Those entering Fraser River ascend the main stream and branches to their very sources, some of them reaching a point nearly 800 miles from the sea. With powerful leaps they scale the rapids, falls, and whatever obstructions they encounter, bruising themselves against the rocks in their frantic efforts, until the banks are lined with their dead carcasses. The survivors of their progeny, only a small percent of the billions of eggs that are deposited, descend the streams to the sea, whence, at the proper time, they in turn ascend again to the place of their birth, to exercise the procreative power. It is while thus making their annual pilgrimage from the sea, that they are caught, usually near the entrance to the streams, though often many miles inland, and prepared for market. The salmon has always been one of the most important of the various forms of food used by the Indians of the Pacific coast, who annually gather along the streams and catch thousands of them, drying them in the sun for winter use. Years ago, the Hudson's Bay Company began salting them for their own use, and of late years many canning factories have been established at various points, where thousands of cases are prepared for market annually. There are many good locations yet to be found, where salmon are abundant, and these will, no doubt, be occupied as soon as the rapidly increasing demand for the product assures it a reliable market. In this branch of the fishing industry about 5000 hands are employed, in about thirty canneries. The annual pack averages some 200,000 cases, valued at about $5 per case. The scene of the greatest activity is on Fraser River. Five distinct varieties enter the river during the season, each seeking different spawning grounds. The run of the silver salmon begins about the first of April, and continues till the end of June. These fish are often caught weighing seventy pounds, though the average weight is from ten to twenty-five pounds. Beginning in June, and continuing till August, is a fish of five or six pounds weight. In August, a most excellent salmon, weighing generally about seven pounds, enters the river. The fourth species is the humpback, a fish weighing from six to fifteen pounds, which is caught from August till winter, every second year. The last to appear is the hookbill, a salmon weighing from twelve to forty-five pounds, which arrives in September and remains till winter. For fifteen miles above its mouth, the Fraser is dotted with boats of the salmon fleet during the season, and the river and canneries present a busy scene. North of this point, establishments are located on Burrard Inlet, Alert Bay, Rivers Inlet, Skeena River, Metlakahtla and Nass rivers. Large quantities of salmon are also salted and packed in barrels. The majority of fishermen, especially in the northern canneries, are Indians, who are expert and reliable, and are preferred to any other kind of labor. On steamers, they are employed almost exclusively for roustabouts, and are paid higher wages than white men, because they can do more work and are more reliable and steady. In 1883, the Provincial Government established a salmon hatchery on the south bank of Fraser River, four miles above New Westminster. The undoubted success of this effort of the Government to foster one of the most important industries, will enable the canning establishments to make improvements and invest additional capital, with the assurance of a permanent and liberal supply of fish. One establishment is a floating cannery and oil factory combined, which can be moved about from place to place, and is known as \"Spratt's Ark.\" On board are complete canning appliances, machinery for manufacturing oil from the offal of the fish caught, and accommodations for the hands. The vessel and its adjuncts cost $60,000. The shipment of fresh\nsalmon to the East, in refrigerator cars, has become an important feature of this industry. The next most important fish, so far as present utility is concerned, is the oolachan, or candle-fish. This is a small fish, about the size of a sardine, and is so oily that, when dried, it will burn like a candle, especially those caught in Nass River. They enter the Fraser in millions about the first of May. They are delicious when fresh, smoked or salted, and their oil is considered superior to cod liver oil, or any other fish oil known. It is of a whitish tint, and about the consistency of thin lard, and is a staple food among the Indians, and an article of barter between the Indians of the coast and the interior tribes. These fish begin running in the Nass about the last of March, and enter the stream by the million for several weeks. The various Indian tribes of that region assemble on its banks, and catch them in immense numbers. The fish are taken in purse-nets, frequently a canoe load at a single haul, and are piled in bins on the shore. They are then placed in bins made of plank, and having sheet-iron bottoms, holding from three to five barrels, and are boiled in water about four hours. The concoction is then strained through baskets, made from willow roots, and the oil is then run into red cedar boxes of about fifteen gallons capacity each. When the run of fish is good, each tribe will put up about twenty boxes of oil. Before the introduction of sheet-iron bottoms for their tanks, the Indians boiled the fish by throwing heated stones into the tank. There is no doubt that this undeniably valuable article will soon become one of the regular products of the province, for exportation in quantity, as it is even now, to a limited extent. Herring swarm in the waters of the bays and inlets during the spawning season in the spring. They are not, at that time, of as good quality as when taken in nets from their permanent banks and feeding grounds. They are somewhat smaller than the herring of Europe, although fully equal in quality when taken in their prime. There is a factory on Burrard Inlet, where herring oil is extracted, and fertilizers made of the dried scraps. Halibut are found in great numbers, especially off the west coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands, where they are frequently taken upwards of 100 pounds in weight, and often twice that size. Though a great many are caught, and sent to market fresh or dried, halibut fishing has not yet become one of the regular industries. The Indians of that region catch and dry them for food. The same may be said of codfish, which abounds in the waters of the coast of British Columbia. There are a number of banks on the Alaska coast where cod fishing is carried on by fishermen from San Francisco, who salt 2000 tons annually. Similar banks have been located, in the waters of the province, farther south. Deep sea fishing has not yet been inaugurated on a large scale, though its practicability has been demonstrated. The black cod, formerly called \"coal fish,\" abounds in the waters off Graham Island, where the Indians catch them in great numbers by the use of an ingeniously contrived spring hook. The fish is also known to frequent the waters off the west coast of Vancouver Island, and as far south as Cape Flattery. The fish is highly spoken of, and is considered far superior to the cod of Newfoundland, the flesh being richer and of finer fibre. The Skidegate Oil Company is engaged in extracting oil from the livers of dog fish. The works are located at Skidegate, at the southern end of Graham Island, and give employment to about ten white men and a large number of Indians. About 400,000 fish are caught annually, which yield a total of 40,000 gallons, or an average of one gallon of refined oil from the livers of ten fish. This oil is admitted to be superior to any other kind, as a lubricant, and is chiefly shipped to\nthe United States, though small quantities are consumed in the province, or sent to Honolulu and China. Whale oil is another product, though whale fishing is not carried on extensively. Whales of the largest description are found on the outer coast; and in the waters of the archipelago, humpback whales are quite numerous, and yield from thirty to fifty barrels of oil each. Porpoise, also, yield a large amount of oil. Sturgeon are caught in great numbers, and marketed fresh; also such table fish as anchovy, haddock, rock cod, flounder and whiting, crab, prawn, cockles, mussels, etc. Lobster is not a native to these waters, but is being introduced, and will soon be plentiful. Oyster beds are found in numerous places, but the bivalves are small, and inferior to those on the Atlantic coast. Several beds have been planted with large oysters from Boston, and probably will, ere long, supply the market with a superior quality. The inland streams and lakes abound in salmon trout and the delicious mountain trout, which are the delight of sportsmen, and the famous lake white fish. The holothura, a small mollusk, generally known as the \"sea cucumber,\" inhabits the waters about the islands. These, when cured and dried, make the article of commerce known as \"b\u00e8che de la mer;\" and highly prized in China for food, where it is called \"trepang.\" A valuable industry might be built up by preparing this commodity for market. Seals and sea otters are annually caught in great numbers off the Straits of Fuca and the west coast of Vancouver Island. From ten to fifteen schooners are engaged in sealing, employing about fifty sailors and some 300 hunters, the latter chiefly Indians. The annual catch is about 10,000 fur seals, valued at $10 each, and 3000 hairy seals, valued at fifty cents each. Sea otters are not so numerous, and are very wary, requiring much patience and skill in their capture. They are generally shot with a rifle, and at such long range that only the best marksman succeed in killing them. About 100 are taken annually, valued at $50 each. One can not read the above brief statement without being struck with the great possibilities of the province. In the waters lies an uncounted and exhaustless mine of wealth, which will amply reward those who work it in the proper way.\n\nIf the waters and woods of British Columbia are so wealth-producing, what must be said of the mines? There are large deposits of precious and useful metals, many of which have been profitably worked for years, while others are only awaiting development. Besides the vast tracts known, there are doubtless many places yet undiscovered, in which there is hidden wealth. The minerals include gold, silver, iron, copper, lead, coal, platinum, cinnabar, bismuth, limestone, plumbago, antimony, marble and salt; but gold and coal are the most extensively worked. Gold mining first began on the bars of the Lower Fraser in 1856, and, as already mentioned, drew thousands temporarily to the country, but no permanent progress was made until the fabulously rich mines of Cariboo began in '60 to yield up their golden nuggets. Owing to the almost inaccessible character of the mountains, the existence of long stretches of unnavigable waters in the interior, and the entire absence of railways, until the past two years, preventing the importation of heavy machinery, British Columbia has hitherto been unable to emerge beyond the \"placer era.\" But now, following the appearance of cheap and quick modes of transportation, the era of quartz mining is commencing; and there is every indication that in a few years, at latest another boom, rivalling the flush times of thirty years ago, will set in. Already several extensive veins of silver bearing ores in the Selkirks have been opened, and in other districts quartz mills have been introduced. It has been demonstrated that\na wide mineral belt extends uninterruptedly from Utah, through Idaho, nearly north-\nwesterly into British Columbia, until the borders of Alaska are touched; and the\nindications are that this new field is the banner wealth-producing region of the con-\ntinent. Cariboo, although sending out bullion for the past 28 years, is not yet ex-\nhausted, and quartz milling there will doubtless increase the output. A quarter of a\nmillion was the return for the district last year\u2014a small amount owing to the unfa-\nvorable season\u2014and the Selkirk, Stump Lake, Rock Creek, Kootenay, Lillooet,\nYukon, Cassiar, Ominecka and other districts, are each contributing their share\ntowards the wealth of the world. The name of Cariboo is more closely connected\nwith gold-mining in British Columbia, for, as a writer in the Victoria Colonist puts it:\n\"It was the prosperity of Cariboo that caused the building of the mountain road\nthrough the canons of the Fraser, winding along its tortuous course, and, from the\nglimpse now secured from the rushing train, seemed like a goat-path far up the\nmountain side. The crack of the driver's whip, the rush of the spirited horses, the\nrumble of the coach, are no longer echoed among the lonely canons, for they have\nbeen replaced by the wild shriek of the locomotive and the thundering of the train,\nbut the road along which so many thousands of men passed to and from the mines\non the express coach, on hardy horses, others, alas, foot-sore, weary, unsuccessful,\nwill ever remain as a monument to the unflagging energy and courage to the pioneers\nof the province. The railway built through the mountains of British Columbia is\nthe wonder of the world, but too much praise cannot be accorded the few thousands\nof people that paid for and constructed that highway from Yale, along the Fraser\nand Thompson, and on north river mountain and valley, along precipices and rushing\nrivers and lonely lakes, until it reached its terminus at Williams Creek, the richest\nprobably ever known. Along this highway the agriculturist placed himself, and\nnumerous ranches, producing crops as wonderful in their way as the gold creeks,\nexist in the most favored spots. It will thus be seen that permanency commenced\nwith the progress of Cariboo, and the success of that field induced prospectors to seek\nout others, until the Peace River, Omineca, Cassiar and Big Bend were each discovered,\nand contributed to the advancement of the province.\"\n\nNext in importance to gold mining is the coal industry, which has undergone a\nwonderful development within the past few years. The black diamond is found in\nplaces over a wide area of both the mainland and islands, the principal mines being\nat Nanaimo, Wellington, on Vancouver Island, where the industry has reached the\ngreatest proportions and the coal is of the best quality. The quality varies in diffe-\nrent localities, from the common lignite to anthracite, the latter being on the Queen\nCharlotte islands, and the only vein of anthracite yet discovered on the Pacific coast.\nNo effort has yet been made to work it. The coal at Nanaimo is the best quality of\nbituminous coal to be found on the coast, and is shipped in quantities to all points,\nSan Francisco being the best market, notwithstanding the high tariff. From 1860\nto 1875 there were shipped to San Francisco only 320,000 tons; then shipments\nbegan to increase rapidly, and cargoes are now sent to the Sandwich Islands and\nChina. The mines producing this coal are those of the Vancouver Coal Mining and\nCoke Company and the Wellington collieries. The former are five in number, and\nare situated in Nanaimo and vicinity. The operations of this company are very ex-\ntensive, giving employment to about eight hundred men. The Wellington collieries\nare situated at Wellington, a few miles from Nanaimo, and are connected with their\nshipping wharves, on Departure bay, by a narrow gauge railway nearly five miles long. About a mile distant are the South Wellington mines. This company employ about nine hundred men. All of these mines are connected with shipping wharves at Nanaimo and Departure bay by lines of railway. The coal beds at that point cover a wide area. At Comox, still farther north, it is estimated that they occupy three hundred square miles. They are also found at other points on the island.\n\nLarge fields of lignite exist near New Westminster, in the Nicola Valley, and along the North Thompson and Skeena rivers. On Texada Island, in the Gulf of Georgia, and only twenty miles from the Comox coal fields, and not far from the mines at Nanaimo and Wellington, are great masses of rich magnetic iron ore, assaying sixty-eight and four-tenths of iron, and having a low percentage of phosphorus and other impurities. This ore is now being used by the smelting works at Irondale, across the line in Washington Territory, where it is mixed with the brown hematite found in that vicinity. The existence of great bodies of superior coal and iron in such close proximity, suggests the springing up, ere long, of large smelting and iron works. The coal output last year was considerably in excess of any previous, being 410,573 tons. The nearest approach to this figure was in 1884, when 394,070 tons were mined. There output would have been much greater, had it not been for the occurrence of the melancholy mining disaster at the Vancouver Co.'s colliery. The chief market for the coal is the United States, principally at San Francisco, the amount shipped being 335,854 tons. The output in Dunsmuir's Wellington mines was 242,723 tons, 915 men being employed, and the value at the mine's mouth, at $4 per ton, being $966,892; at the Vancouver Coal Co.'s mine, 137,850 tons, valued at $537,500 at the mine's mouth, the number of men employed being 615; and East Wellington Co. produced about 30,000 tons. The following table shows the output of coal of each year from 1874 to 1887 inclusive:\n\n| Year | No. of Tons |\n|------|-------------|\n| 1874 | 81,000      |\n| 1875 | 110,000     |\n| 1876 | 139,000     |\n| 1877 | 154,000     |\n| 1878 | 171,000     |\n| 1879 | 241,000     |\n| 1880 | 268,000     |\n| 1881 | 228,000     |\n| 1882 | 282,000     |\n| 1883 | 213,000     |\n| 1884 | 394,000     |\n| 1885 | 365,000     |\n| 1886 | 326,636     |\n| 1887 | 410,573     |\n\nAlthough the proportion of arable land is comparatively small to the area of the whole Province, there are large tracts pre-eminently suitable for agricultural purposes, aggregating probably ten thousand square miles. The great deterrent, heretofore, in the agricultural development of the country, has been the rugged and mountainous character, which separated the tillable areas widely, and made them difficult of access. But, with the advent of railways, the facilities for shipping produce, for lack of which thousands of acres laid fallow, are provided, and although the Province will never aspire to be a rival to Manitoba or the North-West, in this particular, yet great progress and development may be confidently anticipated amongst the farming community. The climatic conditions are admirably adapted to the production of every fruit, cereal, vegetable and plant known to the temperate zone. The most tempting inducements are held out by the Government for settlement upon the public lands, which must naturally attract settlers. The Dominion Government\nowns a belt forty miles wide, twenty each side of the Canadian Pacific Railway; outside of this, the Province owns all land not now the property of private individuals or corporations, and all is open to settlement, except certain tracts reserved to aid enterprises for the public benefit. On Vancouver Island are to be found splendid locations for hundreds of families, and the opening of the railway reserve will supply hundreds more. It is estimated that there are 389,000 acres of arable land on the island, of which 300,000 are well suited for agriculture, the greater portion, however, being densely timbered. The New Westminster District is not exceeded in fertility by any tract of land on the coast. The productiveness of the delta lands is marvelous. Statistics carefully prepared give the return, per acre, at 75 bushels of oats; hay, 3\u00bd tons; barley, 40 bushels; turnips, 40 to 50 tons; potatoes, 30 tons. Roots and vegetables attain an enormous size, and the yield to the acre is very prolific. In this district there is a quarter of a million acres of prairie. Dr. Dawson, an authority unquestioned, estimates the whole area of agricultural lands east of Fraser River, in the southern portion of the Province, at 1,000 square miles, which may be easily utilized. In the Spallumcheen, Salmon, Okanagan, Kootenay and Columbia regions there are thousands upon thousands of acres of arable land yet to be claimed. Some of this is so situated as to require irrigation, but the greater portion yields abundant crops without artificial watering of the soil. There are quite extensive bench lands, covered with the nutritious bunch grass peculiar to that portion of the American continent, and make unexcelled ranges for cattle. The bunch grass cures on the roots, as it stands, and remains as hay until it is renewed in the spring; cattle graze upon it all winter. They do not require other food, except in exceptional seasons, when the snow may for a short time be too deep for them, or have a crust upon it. With a little food on hand for such emergencies, the stockman is prepared for the hardest winter. The grass is so nourishing, that stock are fat and in condition for market early in the spring. The ranges in the southern portion of the Province are pretty well occupied, but there are others further north. The country possesses, of course, the same advantages for sheep that it does for cattle and horses. There is a large agricultural section, an extensive area of low land, lying west of Fraser River, and chiefly north of the fifty-first parallel, which Dr. Dawson estimates at 1,230 square miles. Of it he says: \"The soil is almost uniformly good; but, being to a great extent covered with trees, it cannot be utilized so readily for agricultural purposes, and it lies, besides, off the route of the railways, and is not likely to be opened up for some time. Still, it is a country which I have every reason to believe will be occupied eventually by an agricultural population.\" The same authority says that there are on Peace River, at an average elevation of 2,000 feet above the sea, 23,500 square miles of good arable land, of which about 6,000 lie within the limits of British Columbia. Wherever wheat, oats and barley have been tried in that region, they have produced excellent crops. Potatoes grow to great size and perfection. There is no doubt that the whole area will eventually be cultivated. Prof. Macoun, botanist of the Canadian Pacific Railway Survey, says of the same region: \"I consider nearly all of the Peace River section (including the portion in British Columbia) to be well suited for raising cereals of all kind, and two-thirds of it fit for wheat. The soil is as good as any part of Manitoba, and the climate, if anything, milder.\" There is another considerable agricultural area, as yet wholly unoccupied\u2014the Queen Charlotte Islands. At the upper end of the most northerly one there are about\n70,000 acres of cultivable land, where the climate is such as to render a residence pleasant, and agricultural pursuits highly successful.\n\nIf, however, British Columbia is not an agricultural country, it can boast of great capabilities in fruit production. Luscious apples, pears, peaches, plums, cherries, grapes\u2014all the fruits of the temperate zone, in fact\u2014can be raised in profusion; and, with the opportunities now existing for supplying the Dominion, the industry, no doubt, will be greatly stimulated.\n\nBritish Columbia, like Manitoba, has made great strides in the cause of education. In 1872 the Free School system, similar to that of Ontario, was introduced. An attempt had previously been made to establish free schools in Vancouver Island, before its union with the mainland, but failed, and educational matters were in a somewhat crude condition. Until the passing of the Act just referred to, full control over educational matters was vested in a board of education, composed of six persons appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, and presided over by the Superintendent of Education. After the abolition of this board, in 1879, the duties belonging to it were transferred to the Educational Department; a more complete control over local school matters was given to boards of trustees\u2014notably the power of appointment and dismissal of teachers, formerly held by the Board of Education; and a system of monthly reports of the attendance, etc., of each school was instituted, the teacher being required to supply both the Education Office and the trustees with monthly information of all matters pertaining to such school. From the introduction of the public school system into the province until the present day the whole cost of maintaining the school machinery has been paid directly from the Provincial treasury, and the liberality with which education is provided for will command universal admiration, when it is stated that wherever there are fifteen children of between six and sixteen years of age within the radius of a few miles, a school house is built, the salary of a teacher provided for, as well as the incidental expenses arising from the maintenance of the same. The gradual growth of the schools, as well as the cost of maintenance, is fully shown by the record of attendance and expenditure given in the following tabular statement, taken from the annual school report of 1885-36:\n\n| Year     | Number of School Districts | Aggregate Enrolment | Average Daily Attendance | Percentage of Attendance | Expenditure for Education Proper |\n|----------|----------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 1872-73  | 25                         | 1,028               | 575                      | 55.93                    | $36,768 77                       |\n| 1873-74  | 37                         | 1,245               | 767                      | 61.60                    | $35,287 59                       |\n| 1874-75  | 41                         | 1,403               | 863                      | 61.51                    | $34,822 29                       |\n| 1875-76  | 41                         | 1,685               | 984                      | 58.39                    | $44,506 11                       |\n| 1876-77  | 42                         | 1,998               | 1,260                    | 63.06                    | $47,129 63                       |\n| 1877-78  | 45                         | 2,198               | 1,395.50                 | 63.49                    | $43,334 01                       |\n| 1878-79  | 45                         | 2,301               | 1,315.90                 | 57.19                    | $22,110 70                       |\n| 1879-80  | 47                         | 2,462               | 1,293.93                 | 52.56                    | $47,006 10                       |\n| 1880-81  | 48                         | 2,571               | 1,366.86                 | 53.16                    | $46,960 69                       |\n| 1881-82  | 50                         | 2,653               | 1,358.68                 | 51.21                    | $49,288 63                       |\n| 1882-83  | 59                         | 2,693               | 1,383.00                 | 51.36                    | $50,850 63                       |\n| 1883-84  | 67                         | 3,420               | 1,808.60                 | 52.88                    | $66,655 15                       |\n| 1884-85  | 76                         | 4,028               | 2,089.74                 | 51.89                    | $71,151 52                       |\n| 1885-86  | 87                         | 4,471               | 2,481.48                 | 55.50                    | $79,527 56                       |\nThis valuable statistical information gives not only a clear idea of the growth of the schools but of the province itself, showing as it does that during the last decade, the number of children attending school has more than doubled.\n\nThe railway development of the province, notwithstanding the natural difficulties encountered, is most encouraging. Only a few years ago, there was not a mile of track laid; today the province boasts of possessing the western section of the great transcontinental road which renders the early construction of branch lines necessary, in order that its full benefits may be enjoyed, and a railway on Vancouver, which is a great factor in the prosperity of the island. The Esquimalt & Nanaimo railway connecting Victoria with the mining district north was completed in August, 1886, the last spike having been driven by Sir John Macdonald. Although the traffic is as yet unequal to meet the expenditure, the service is maintained at the highest standard of excellence, being unsurpassed even by larger and more pretentious corporations which exist in more thickly settled communities. The management is in excellent hands, Mr. Dunsmuir, the president, having around him an efficient and experienced staff. The length of the road is seventy-eight miles. For a long time this enterprise was a bone of contention between the Provincial and Dominion Governments, and was finally undertaken by Mr. Dunsmuir on the terms of the Settlement Bill, which gave his company a large land grant and a cash subsidy of three-quarters of a million. This amount, however, was insufficient to construct the road, portions of which were of a very formidable character, not only taxing the skill of the engineers, but also the private resources of the capitalists interested. A considerable portion of the road on the south end runs through a country affording to the artist bits of finest country\u2014and the line can boast of one tunnel, fifteen miles from Victoria. Shawinigan Lake, skirted by the railway, twenty-seven miles from Victoria, is a sheet of water about seven miles in length, of great natural beauty, abounding in trout and surrounded by fine wooded hills where large game is plentiful. The stations along the line of railway are in suitable localities and with no pretensions to architectural effect, are amply sufficient for the present or prospective business of the line. It is intended to extend the road to a point on the Straits of Fuca to connect by transfer boat with a line of railway to be built from a point near Portland to Port Angeles, W.T., distant ten miles across the Straits from Beechey Bay, the probable terminus of the island line. Preliminary surveys have been made for the American line, and there is every probability that it will be constructed within the next couple of years. The branch of the Island railway will be completed in time to form a connection with it. This will virtually allow of the running of trains of the American lines into Victoria. It is also in contemplation to extend the main line from Wellington to Comox, which would tap a magnificent section of country. The officers of the company are Hon. Robt. Dunsmuir, president; Joseph Hunter, general superintendent; H. R. Prior, freight and passenger agent; William White, accountant.\n\nNor is the Mainland railway wanting in railway enterprise. A line is proposed from Sicamous on the C. P. R., along the Spallumcheen river to the head of Okanagan lake, and several lines are projected through various parts of Kootenay district, one from Lethbridge, in Alberta, through Crow's Nest Pass, to the boundary line between Kootenay and Montana; a second from Golden, on the C. P. R., south, along the Columbia river and lakes, to a connection with the former road; and a third\nfrom Revelstoke, on, the C. P. R. south to Kootenay lakes. This company, the Kootenay & Athabasca, secured a charter, and has also one from the Dominion Government. Charters were not secured by the others, but it is probable in the near future that each of the lines will be built, the gold, silver, coal and copper mines of the southern portion of Kootenay demanding it. The New Westminster Southern Railway company were granted a charter to build a line from Brownsville, opposite New Westminster city, to a point on the boundary line. This road will provide good communication with the farming lands of the district, and, when connection with the American system is made, with all points south and east. Another projected railway extends from Ladner's Landing to Sumas, running through the farming districts on the south shore of the Fraser river. The question of building a line from Ashcroft, on the C. P. R., north to Cariboo was also considered, a report of a preliminary survey being submitted and maps of the proposed route prepared.\n\nIn a letter in reply to questions of interest and value to intending settlers, Hon. John Robson, Provincial Secretary and Minister of Mines, a most indefatigable worker in everything calculated to promote the welfare of the Province, gives some information very concisely: He says: \"Although, on account of its broken and mountainous character and climatic conditions, this will, perhaps, never be entitled to claim high rank as an agricultural province in the sense of becoming a large exporter of food products; yet, it has the capacity to sustain a large home population. In food, fish, and fruit it certainly possesses great possibilities, and will, doubtless, become a larger exporter.\n\n\"The class of emigrants from the old country most likely to succeed here are sober, industrious, small farmers in the prime of life, or with stout growing sons, able and willing to undertake the rougher farm work of a new country, and who would not shrink from the hardships and privations incident thereto. But even these should not come here with less than would carry them through the first year without any return for their labour.\n\n\"The Provincial Government will be prepared to provide such emigrants with experienced guides to assist them in finding suitable locations, and granting each male of 18 years of age and upwards an absolute and indefeasible title to 160 acres of agricultural land, if west of the Cascade Mountains, or 320 acres if east of that range, upon performance of pre-emption duties (vide Land Act) and payment of one dollar (four-shillings) per acre in four annual instalments of twenty-five cents each; but the first of such payments shall not be due until two years after the date of the record of the pre-emption. Free or partly free grants of smaller areas are made in special cases.\n\n\"Regarding educational matters it may be said, generally, that the schoolmaster follows close upon the heels of the settler. Practically, the Government places a good free common-school education within the easy reach of every child. To be more specific: a school is established wherever there are fifteen children of school age (6 to 16 inclusive) within three miles of a common centre; the entire cost of which\u2014buildings and appurtenances, teachers' salary, and incidental expenses, &c\u2014is defrayed by the Government, so that a good common-school education is absolutely free to every pupil. Free High Schools are also established and maintained in the principal centres of population.\n\n\"The Government make all leading roads to and in every settlement. As a\nmatter of fact, about one-fourth of the entire public revenue is annually devoted to the work of making roads and bridges, and, speaking generally, it can be truthfully asserted that no settlement is beyond the sound of the Government roadmaker's axe.\n\n\"As to what crops are likely to pay best, that is so largely dependent upon locality and other conditions that anything like a satisfactory answer is difficult, if not impossible. If the market be a mining or lumbering camp, all food products pay well; if a town, the same is more or less true; if to be transported to a distant market, cereals; if to Manitoba or the North-West, fruit.\n\n\"In a new country like this, where every man can easily acquire a homestead, the class commonly designated \"agricultural labourers\" prefer, as a rule, to work their own farms; but there is always a fair demand for hired help on the larger farms. Female servants are very much wanted, and can readily command from ten to fifteen dollars a month, and even more, according to experience and ability. Good, well-behaved girls would experience no difficulty in obtaining places.\n\n\"The influx of artisans from the older provinces of Canada since the opening of the Canadian Pacific Railway has been such as to supply all ordinary demands. Perhaps in the line of bricklaying, the supply is inadequate.\"\n\nThe affairs of the province, under His Honor Lieutenant Governor Nelson, are administrated by Hon. A. E. B. Daire, Premier and Attorney General; Hon. Robt. Dunsmuir, President of the Council; Hon. Forbes G. Vernon, chief commissioner of Lands and works; and Hon. John Robson, Provincial Secretary, Minister of Finance and Mines. No other Provincial government in the Dominion is so unceasing in its efforts to promote the welfare of the country, and its wise administration has been most beneficial.\n\nThe following figures, showing the exports, the produce of the province, for fifteen years ending 30th June 1886, will give some idea of the development of the country:\n\n| YEAR | MINES | FISHERIES | FOREST | ANIMALS | AG'L | MFG. | TOTAL |\n|------|-------|-----------|--------|---------|------|------|-------|\n| 1872 | $1,389,585 | -$37,706 | $214,377 | $211,700 | $142 | $1,540 | $1,558,050 |\n| 1873 | 1,224,382 | 43,351 | 20,026 | 259,292 | 2,885 | 1,197 | 1,742,123 |\n| 1874 | 1,314,115 | 111,118 | 200,116 | 356,621 | 5,298 | 443 | 2,051,743 |\n| 1875 | 1,429,299 | 125,999 | 292,116 | 411,910 | 9,271 | 7,723 | 2,272,773 |\n| 1876 | 2,062,129 | 71,338 | 273,430 | 32,027 | 9,080 | 68 | 2,709,083 |\n| 1877 | 1,768,448 | 10,003 | 297,042 | 140,853 | 3,883 | 1,600 | 2,346,969 |\n| 1878 | 1,759,171 | 421,840 | 337,950 | 257,314 | 462 | 2,768,147 |\n| 1879 | 1,636,493 | 63,493 | 292,396 | 298,705 | 2,595 | 377 | 2,508,468 |\n| 1880 | 1,664,828 | 377,710 | 2,843,396 | 2,838,383 | 3,433 | 100 | 2,934,001 |\n| 1881 | 1,917,079 | 409,984 | 17,747 | 350,474 | 248 | 22 | 2,231,554 |\n| 1882 | 1,437,072 | 976,903 | 362,875 | 300,429 | 946 | 2,610 | 3,080,841 |\n| 1883 | 1,379,648 | 1,332,385 | 407,824 | 287,94 | 6,791 | 443 | 3,345,263 |\n| 1884 | 1,419,582 | 829,573 | 458,365 | 227,796 | 1,745 | 1,413 | 3,100,404 |\n| 1885 | 1,499,899 | 227,122 | 251,071 | 414,284 | 2,824 | 5,948 | 3,022,281 |\n| 1886 | 1,720,305 | 641,062 | 194,988 | 329,248 | 1,917 | 2,811 | 2,891,211 |\nKAMLOOPS.\n\nA thriving and prosperous town is Kamloops, at the confluence of the North and South Thompson, 252 miles from Vancouver, and 2,654 miles from Montreal. It was originally an outpost of the Hudson's Bay Company, and, although as a town is young in years, gives every indication of rapid growth and progress. The modern town, at first located on a narrow ledge under the shelter of a range of precipitous hills, has spread out on to the plain, where the hills recede. The town site was purchased by a company which, while not a philanthropic concern, had deeper interests than mere speculation, and offered liberal terms to actual settlers. As a result of its excellent policy, there has been an influx of desirable people, and the population now reaches about 1,000, exclusive of the Chinese. Kamloops is the most important station between Vancouver and Calgary, both as to passenger and freight business. It is the great centre for large cattle shipments, the passenger traffic is daily on the increase, for eastern visitors find Kamloops a pleasant resort both in summer and winter, and the importation of general merchandise increases steadily, as shown by actual returns. Owing to the clear sky and the central location of the place, the Dominion Government selected it as the starting point for their surveys in the Province. From here all the points between the coast and Winnipeg were located.\n\nDuring 1887, over forty houses were erected, at a cost of about $70,000. The town boasts of a newspaper; several churches, good hotels, a bank, and an excellent school. It possesses a fine system of water works, and an efficient fire brigade. Kamloops is the centre of a large, well-settled, fertile tract, for which it forms the natural distributing point and nearest market. The grand, rich valley of Nicola, Grand Prairie, that gem of comfortable homesteads; Spallumcheen, Priest's Valley and Okanagan, the garden of British Columbia; the rich, large farms along the banks of the South Thompson, and Thompson up and down to the lakes, which remind one of old country farms. They all are connected with Kamloops, their natural outlet. The town is also the centre of a rich mining district. Mines are already being worked, others discovered, prospecting is active in the south, the east and the north, and the eagerness of the miners is sharpened by the favorable results already obtained, and by the confidence which, in the most experienced, amounts to a certainty that larger treasures are still hidden away to await the patient search of the pick. And no matter where it is that success may crown the miner's arduous labors, Kamloops will reap benefit from it. It is in direct communication with all parts by road or water, is the nearest point of the railway for shipments, the point to draw provisions from, and in some cases the only starting point to gain access to districts until now unexplored and untrodden by human foot. The climate of Kamloops is very salubrious. Lying as it does on the plateau between the Gold and Cascade ranges, a thousand feet above the sea level, and having a dry, sandy soil, its air is exceptionally dry and clear. The summer heat is not excessive, and the evenings are always cool and pleasant; the winters are short and mild, with an occasional cold snap, just enough to give its inhabitants a taste of the pleasures of sleighing, tobogganing and skating. Kamloops, for these reasons, will some day blossom out into a great invalid resort.\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF KAMLOOPS.\n\nR. E. Smith, Wholesale and Retail dealer in Dry Goods, Groceries, Crockery, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, etc., Victoria Street, Kamloops, B.C.\u2014The many advantages possessed by the city of Kamloops as a commercial centre, should not be overlooked by those who contemplate purchasing goods. With facilities unsurpassed by any other city in this district, Kamloops is rapidly becoming an important commercial metropolis, and purchasers in the interior and along the line of Railway are rapidly becoming convinced of the fact that they can purchase goods here as low as in the eastern and western cities, and at considerable saving of time, freight and other expenses. The general merchant has played no insignificant part in the growth of this city and the development of the country, as might be illustrated by a detailed history of the above house, which was established in 1881. The departments are numerous, and embrace dry goods, clothing, gent's furnishings, groceries, crockery, boots and shoes, etc. Mr. Smith is a gentleman of sterling integrity, and in the consideration of customers, no house takes higher rank or is more deserving the success which it has achieved, or the spotless reputation it bears.\n\nGrand Pacific Hotel.

Renier, Merchant Tailor, Victoria street, Kamloops, B.C.\u2014Among the many mercantile houses of Kamloops, we commend the tailoring establishment of Mr. P. S. Renier. Having established himself here in 1887, he has built up a large and prosperous business.

John T. Edwards, Proprietor, Herbert Smith, Manager, Kamloops, B.C.\u2014One of the oldest and best known hotels in British Columbia is the above named house. Being erected in 1872 it has always held its own as a first-class hotel in every respect. Mr. Edwards took possession in 1884. Mr. Smith assumed the management in 1886, and it has since become one of the best hostleries in the province. It is a two-storey building, having a frontage on Victoria street of 85 feet, and extending back 75 feet, and is one of the finest appearing hotel structures in the city. The house contains thirty-five bedrooms and suites, with elegant parlors, spacious corridors and large offices, all of which are furnished in the most tasteful and comfortable manner. Particular attention is paid to the table, and the menu is always of the choicest description, the cuisine being in charge of the most accomplished cooks to be obtained, while the attendance cannot be surpassed. The bar is stocked with a choice assortment of wines, liquors and cigars. The manager of the house, Mr. H.

Mr. Jones personally is one of the most popular business men in Kamloops, and is well entitled to the esteem that energy, reliability and talent always inspire.\n\nW. E. McCartney, Druggist and Chemist, Victoria street, Kamloops, B.C.\u2014One of the handsomest and most popular drug stores in the city is that of Mr. W. E. McCartney. The store is neat and attractive, and he keeps on hand a choice stock of pure drugs and medicines, perfumeries, fancy goods, toilet articles, and everything pertaining to a well regulated establishment of this kind. Mr. McCartney is an experienced pharmacist and pays special attention to compounding physicians' prescriptions in a careful and accurate manner, using only the very purest and best ingredients. He enjoys the most unbounded confidence of the physicians, and his prescription business forms quite an important item of his trade. He carries a large and valuable stock, which is being constantly replenished from home and foreign markets. As a businessman, Mr. McCartney is energetic and reliable, well deserving of the high esteem in which he is held.\n\nRobson & Lee, Wholesale and Retail Dealers in Groceries, Provisions, Flour and Feed, Paints and Oils, etc., Victoria street, Kamloops, B.C.\u2014The character of our grocery houses have always elicited the praise, not only of their patrons, but of strangers visiting our city. The proprietors themselves have learned the knack of captivating the fancies and appetites of those who deal with them, not only from the cleanliness of their store, but from the further fact that they display on their shelves the most tempting appetizers which the art and ingenuity of man have been capable of devising. One of the most attractive establishments of this kind is the one which heads this article. Messrs. F. H. Robson and R. H. Lee, since 1887, when they first started in business here, have caught the popular taste and hold it, and have been gradually but surely securing a trade that has not only been profitable but alike pleasing to their patrons. Their stock is amply large and is being constantly replenished with such goods as go to make up a first-class grocery establishment, and their trade is in keeping with their large and varied stock. The building in which their business is conducted is most advantageously situated, and contains within its walls all that the appetite of man can ask for or the comforts of a household can demand. They have also in stock a full and complete assortment of paints and oils. Messrs. Robson & Lee have established a reputation for business integrity and energy that is second to none in Kamloops.\n\nThe \"Inland Sentinel,\" issued weekly at $3 per year, is published by Mr. Hugh McCutcheon of Kamloops. It is devoted to the development of the mining, timber, agricultural and ranching resources of the inland country. The \"Sentinel\" has a large and increasing circulation throughout the province, from Vancouver on the Pacific coast to Donald on the eastern border of the province, and from the international boundary to Cariboo on the north, being the only inland journal published within the territory embraced. The \"Sentinel\" was established in the spring of 1880, by Mr. M. Hazan, at Emery, a point on the line of the C.P.R., about one hundred and fifty miles west of Kamloops. In the fall of 1880 Mr. Hazan moved the business to Yale, a station on the railway line, seven miles east of Emery, where the \"Sentinel\" was published until 1884, when he moved to Kamloops. The \"Sentinel\" was first issued as a five column paper of four pages. In September, 1886, Mr. Hazan sold the business to Mr. McCutcheon, the present proprietor, who has enlarged the paper to a six column sheet of eight pages, and otherwise greatly improved it.\nAt the head of navigation on the Fraser, the old town of Yale is located. Its history dates from 1858, when the gold excitement first made it a miner's camp. Hill's Bar, just across the river, was one of the richest findings in the country, and at one time the place was the scene of bustle and activity. Even now, Chinese miners wash over the old diggings at low water and with varying success. Above Hill's Bar, and on top of the high bank, the ground was all turned over, and the gold deposited where the river probably overflowed it, taken out. Efforts have been made of late years to wash the ground back from the river. Many miles of substantial flumes were constructed, but the water failed to connect in sufficient quantity to wash the dirt, which, if treated on a large scale, would no doubt pay well. Yale is built on a gold-bearing deposit, and miners in recent years have tunneled as far as the law would allow underneath the road bed. Some day, no doubt, the gold-bearing benches on both sides of the river will undoubtedly be worked. After the gold excitement, the town decayed, but soon again sprang into prominence as the shipping point for all supplies destined for Cariboo, and all interior points. This trade dwindled with the working out of the mines, but again Yale was destined to see great prosperity. It was made the head-quarters for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway government contract in this province, and during this period it probably witnessed its best days. The rails were at last united east and west. Yale was side-tracked, descending into insignificance, and today there is little life in its once busy streets.\n\nNEW WESTMINSTER.\n\nNew Westminster\u2014the royal city of the mainland\u2014is one of the substantial cities of the province. It is eligibly located in the midst of the finest farming district British Columbia boast of, its site having been chosen by Col. Moody in 1859, whose name is indelibly connected with the country, for the strategetical advantages it possessed in case of war with the United States. It is fifteen miles from the mouth of the Fraser, upon a steep slope of the bank which, at the founding of the infant city, was covered with a dense forest. It was the capital of the crown colony, and besides possessing the government buildings, also boasted of the only mint Canada ever had within its borders. This was established by the imperial government in 1862, but, not having received the sanction of the ruling governor, was \"disallowed.\" There were only a few coins turned out, and these are held sacredly by their owners. For a $20 coin, $100 has been offered\u2014and refused. It is a handsomely made coin, heavier than the American, with no alloy; it bears a plain crown, with the legend \"Government of British Columbia, 20 dols. 1862,\" encircled by a wreath of leaves. New Westminster's situation is favorable to its advancement. It has communication by steamer with all points on the Fraser, and by rail has daily communication with the east, being connected with the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway by a branch. The growth of the fisheries and the lumber industry, the rapidly increasing area of land cultivated in the district tributary to the city, are each contributing towards\nits permanent prosperity. The place has never been visited by any boom; there has been no sudden rise in values, fictitious in its nature; but the steady, constant growth of the city has demanded all the improvements that have been made during its existence, and especially during its latter years. It boasts of all the adjuncts of civilization\u2014churches, schools, daily newspapers, etc., and although one of the oldest\u2014and at one time sleepiest\u2014towns in the province, is destined to be one of the wealthiest and most thriving. New Westminster possesses fine churches, one daily newspaper, the *British Columbian*, and one semi-weekly, the *Mainland Guardian*\u2014both being very creditable journals\u2014several good hotels, the Colonial being the leading one. The lumber business is extensively carried one, one mill alone employing 200 men.\n\n---\n\n**VANCOUVER.**\n\nThe youngest city of the Dominion, Vancouver\u2014the western terminus of the great Canadian transcontinental route\u2014can proudly vaunt of being the Chicago of the coast\u2014not only emulating the great Lake City in its rapid progress and characteristic enterprise, but resembling it in another memorable manner. Both were almost completely destroyed by fire; both sprang from the blackened ashes of ruin with new life and increased vigor, and disaster, instead of discouraging, rather appeared to infuse renewed energy into a homeless people, and animate them to greater exertions in founding a city in whose future they had unbounded faith. The history of Vancouver is a brief but eventful one. One year from its birth, it was totally destroyed by fire. Two years later, it was a thriving city of over 7000 inhabitants. Its whole history is comprised in the years 1885-6-7-8. Previous to this there was the little lumbering village of Granville, where the Hastings' saw-mills were located; Vancouver's substantial growth has perhaps been unparalleled, its great strides on the road to great wealth and commanding position unequalled, and its prospects never brighter than they are to-day. Port Moody, at the head of Burrard Inlet, had originally been chosen as the terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway by the Federal Government, but in 1885, it was decided, for obvious reasons, that Coal Harbor was a more eligible site. At that time, it was a thickly wooded wilderness, with a saw-mill half a mile to the east. Coal had been found here some seventeen years previously, but the explorers, after spending considerable money, ceased operations and nothing remained to show what they had sought to accomplish but the name which attached to the place. It lay dormant\u2014for there was nothing to awaken it in the early days\u2014until its selection as a terminus of the railway. Port Moody\u2014fourteen miles further up the inlet\u2014in which heavy speculation had been indulged in, fell into decay, and, worshipping the rising sun, investors were attracted to the yet unborn city. Its location is such an admirable one that one wonders why Port Moody was ever chosen instead. Vancouver is on Burrard Inlet\u2014named after Sir Harry Burrard of the British Navy\u2014just inside what is called the First Narrows, where the inlet widens out into a broad bay three miles across. The city itself, says a writer in the Oregonian, describing Vancouver, is built on a peninsula, formed by the waters of Burrard Inlet on the north, and those of False creek and English Bay on the south. This peninsula widens out toward English Bay, but at its narrowest\npart, the width does not much exceed one-half a mile. It is on this neck of land that the original town-site of Vancouver was located, and it is here, that the principal business portion is now centred. The city rises gradually back from the water's edge of both Burrard Inlet and English Bay, until at the highest point the elevation is about 200 hundred feet. The average elevation of the whole city does not exceed 100 feet. There is just enough slope to the land on which the city is built to afford a perfect drainage, and while there is a perfect slope to all of the land of the townsite, there are no very steep grades encountered in ascending any of the city's main thoroughfares. Across the inlet nestles the little Indian village where there is a school, a church and regularly laid out streets. A little farther to the east of this settlement on the opposite shore from Vancouver is the town of Moodyville, receiving its support from the largest saw-mill in the province, which is located there. Casting the glance upwards from these points the eye encounters an almost impenetrable forest, which at this distance loses its sharp definite outlines and blends into one symmetrical whole, lending its rich green to the quiet waters below in which it is so perfectly mirrored. Reaching to the very summit of the Coast Range mountains, which stand out in bold relief as sentinels on the northern shore, is this same thick forest of the finest woods for general use in the world. This range attains an elevation of from 4000 to 5000 feet. Towering still above the summits of the nearer range are the two peaks of the \"Twin Sisters,\" sitting majestically on the tops of the higher elevations, in the background. The summits of the highest peaks of these mountains are the abodes of eternal snow, and these great masses, with the whiteness of their snowcapped tops, add a serenity to the whole picture which is as thrilling as it is pleasant. To the west of the city lies the broad expanse of English Bay, while still further out, in plain view, is the long stretch across the Gulf of Georgia. A background to this view, surpassing the finest works in oil for scenic effects is formed by the green-covered hills of Vancouver's island, more than twenty miles distant. To the south, at your very feet, is the second inlet, known as \"False Creek,\" while still beyond, as far as the eye can reach, is that same impenetrable forest of fir which here meets the gaze wherever the eye strikes terra firma.\n\nTo this spot rushed hundreds, long before the railway reached the place, for the Port Moody people put legal obstructions in the way, and the arrival of the C. P. R. was delayed for some time. While the city was in its early infancy, and gradually being transformed from a wilderness into a town, the great calamity which temporarily wiped it out of existence came. In the afternoon of June 13, 1886, a fire broke out and spread with such remarkable rapidity that in a few hours not a house in the city proper was left standing. Night showed nothing but a desolate area of smouldering ashes and blackened ruins. The destruction was complete, the ruin overwhelming. Thousands of dollars\u2014the \"all\" of the place\u2014went up in the flames, lives were lost, the people were homeless and hungry, but thanks to the Hastings and city mills located within the city limits, their needs were relieved that night, and relief came abundantly and quickly from east and west and north and south. While the fires were still smouldering, the rebuilding of the city of Vancouver energetically commenced. A number of buildings were hastily erected, business was resumed, and although a dark cloud of smoke reigned over the city, there seemed to be no cloud to mar its future. But the insatiable flames once more attacked the new built city,\nand in the following month it narrowly escaped destruction a second time. The inhabitants, headed by Mayor Maclean, worked as men never worked before to stem the encroachments of the fiery element, and their ceaseless efforts were finally triumphant and Vancouver was saved. Precautionary measures were at once taken against fire, and since then the city has been singularly free from conflagrations. The Vancouver of today is in marked contrast to the sight it presented two years ago. The stumps and trees and areas of ashes have been replaced with magnificent brick buildings, handsome residences, fine hotels, excellent wide and well paved streets. Substantial evidences of prosperity are to be seen on every hand, and indications that the rapid growth is not of the mushroom species, but of the solid and enduring kind. Vancouver possesses 20 miles of graded streets, and 19 miles of sidewalk, 5\u00bd miles of the streets being planked and one mile gravelled. Like Victoria, Vancouver possesses some pretty drives, which the city is yearly improving. A tract of six hundred acres lying between the Inlet and English Bay\u2014a beautiful spot designed by Nature for the recreation ground of a nation\u2014was granted the city by the Dominion Government for a park, and the authorities, with commendable public spirit, aspire to make it a rival to the Beacon Hill of Victoria. Roadways are being constructed, one encircling the park and being ten miles in length, and the grounds are being beautified and rendered very attractive. Dead Man's Island is being connected with the park, and will be converted into a picnic resort, and none more desirable could be wished for. The view from places in the park are beautiful. And while Vancouver is being supplied with the luxuries of life, it is not lagging in securing the necessaries. Heretofore the water-supply has been entirely inadequate, but the Vancouver Water Works Co., with a capital of $250,000, has constructed a huge reservoir at Capilona river, across the inlet, and six and a quarter miles from the city, pipes being laid on the bottom of the inlet, through which the purest water from the fountain head of mountain rills is supplied. After its severe lesson of June, 1886, Vancouver appreciated the necessity for securing the best appliances for extinguishing fires. A very efficient brigade was organized, two steam fire engines purchased, and two huge tanks located in the most convenient parts of the city, which, with the water works' hydrants, will furnish an unfailing supply of water and prevent the recurrence of the disaster of two years ago. No city in the Dominion is better lighted than Vancouver, both electricity and gas being used to illuminate it, and at night the approaching traveller, either by rail or water, is deeply impressed by the scintillations of the distant lights, which guide and direct him to this newly created magic city.\n\nBut not only keenly alive are the people of Vancouver to their present requirements, but they wisely endeavour to secure the establishment in their midst of all enterprises that will tend to the future welfare of the city. Whatever industry will attract capital and labor is encouraged liberally, and every effort made to secure its location. Amongst these, none perhaps is more important than the establishment of smelting works, which will shortly be in operation, and which will make the city the centre for handling the entire smelting product of the mines of the Province. English capitalists, who have been generously aided by the Provincial Government, are interested in the scheme; and inexhaustible beds of ore at Field and other mineral centres will supply the material to keep the institution busy. The works, doubtless, will develop gradually, it is anticipated that in a few years they will be\nthe largest on the continent, and be a great source of wealth, not only to the city but to the Province and the Dominion.\n\nVancouver possesses a board of trade, organized in 1887, with Mayor Oppenheimer, president, a real estate board, and has branches of the different national societies and athletic clubs. The following brief description of the city will best tell of the marvellous strides the young western metropolis has made during his short existence:\n\nCity incorporated April 6, 1886.\nPopulation February 1, 1885 ........................................... 000\nPopulation January 1, 1886 ........................................... 600\nPopulation January 1, 1887 ........................................... 2000\nPopulation January 1, 1888 ........................................... 6095\nPopulation July 1, 1888, over ........................................... 7000\n\nThe city assessment on February 6, 1888, was as follows:\n\nReal property ......................................................... $3,471,245\nPersonal property ..................................................... 204,660\n\nTotal ................................................................. $3,675,905\n\nIncrease in one year, over $1,000,000.\n\nThe following is a statement of the city's finances during the year 1887:\n\nAmount expended in building ........................................ $1,500,000\nAmount of loans effected by the city for streets, sewerage, fire department and hospital ........................................ 150,000\nAmount appropriated for streets and roads ......................... 60,000\nAmount appropriated for fire department .......................... 15,000\nAmount appropriated for driving park .............................. 20,000\nAmount appropriated for sewerage ................................. 20,000\n\nNumber of houses in city June, 1886, after fire, 3; Number of houses June, 1888, over 1000; miles of street graded January 1, 1887, 1; miles of street graded in city January 1, 1888, 13\u00bd; miles of sidewalk laid in city January 1, 1887, 1\u00bd; miles of sidewalk laid in city January 1, 1888, 1\u00be.\n\nSubsidy given by city to smelter, to be immediately constructed at Vancouver, $25,000; bonus given to smelter by provincial government, $12,000.\n\nNumber of saw-mills in the city, 6; cutting capacity of three largest saw-mills in the city (annually), 45,000,000 feet; amount of lumber annually exported from Vancouver, 10,000,000 feet; number of ships annually loaded with lumber at Vancouver, 50; number of men constantly employed in and around these mills, 1000; number of shingle mills in Vancouver, 1; cutting capacity of shingle mill (daily), 35,000 shingles.\n\nStanley Park, 600 acres; length of road through park, 10 miles.\n\nNumber of water companies in the city, 1; capital stock water company, $250,000; capacity water mains discharging in the city daily, 3,500,000 gallons; water discharge of river where supply of city is taken from, at lowest known stage of water daily, 440,000,000 gallons; elevation of reservoir, where water supply of city is taken from, above high water mark of Burrard's inlet, 417\u00bd feet; average elevation of city above same level, 100 feet; extreme elevation of city above same level, 200 feet; \"head\" of water in city mains, average, 300 feet.\nBETWEEN VANCOUVER AND NEW WESTMINSTER.\nNumber of gas companies in city, 1; capital stock of gas company, $150,000; number of electric light plants in city, 1; capital stock electric light company, $35,000; number of electric lights now in use in city, 400; number of electric lights soon to be increased to 700.\n\nCost of new brick and stone hotel in city, just opened, $150,000; capital stock of new Opera House Company in city, $75,000; cost of new Catholic cathedral in city, to be built immediately, $80,000.\n\nNumber of banks in city (chartered), 3; number of banks in city (private), 1; number of telephone companies in city, 1; number of express companies in city, 1; number of newspapers in city (daily), 3; number of iron-foundries in city, 2; number of lime-kilns in city, 1; number of soap works in city, 1; number of reading rooms and libraries in city, 1.\n\nNumber of fire engines owned by city, 2; number of streams these engines can throw, 4; length of each stream, 150 feet; number of feet of hose owned by the city, 2000; number of hose carts owned by the city, 4; number of water tanks in city, 10; aggregate capacity of these tanks, 350,000 gallons.\n\nAverage price of best business property in Vancouver, 1886, $30 to $50 per front foot; average price best business property in Vancouver, 1887, $70 to 100 per front foot; average price best business property in Vancouver, early spring of 1888, $100 to $200 per front foot.\n\nVancouver has always been blest with enterprising and public spirited citizens who have earnestly labored for the city's welfare. Mr. M. A. Maclean was the first mayor, two terms, and the present occupant of the high position is Mr. David Oppenheimer, in whom is found a worthy successor to Mr. ex-mayor Maclean. The council for 1888 consists of Ald. H. Bell-Irving, Samuel Brighouse, Joseph Mannion, I. Oppenheimer, Joseph Humphries, R. H. Alexander, J. M. Lefevre, Robert Clark, Robt. Cuth and John Dongal. Mr. Thomas McGuigan is city clerk.\n\nElegibly situated on the crest of the upland is the Hotel Vancouver, a magnificent structure erected by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and which rivals the large hotels of San Francisco. It has all the conveniences of a leading hotel, is furnished elegantly throughout, and is managed by Mr. E. M. Mathews. There are other fine hotels in the city\u2014in fact, no place is better supplied with them.\n\nThe newspapers of Vancouver take a leading place amongst the provincial press. The News Advertiser (morning) and Herald and World (evening) are ably conducted sheets, enterprising, energetic, and their newsy appearance is an excellent indication of the life and go-aheadativeness of the place.\n\nBut one word more of this wonderful city\u2014quoting from the Boston Herald:\n\n\"A gentleman who arrived in Boston yesterday fresh from Vancouver, the Pacific terminus of the trans-continental railway, gives the genesis of that city in terms which are as startling as they are significant. Two years ago there was but one house in the locality. A year ago there were a dozen struggling log huts. Today there is a population of 5000 persons; the Victoria hotel is one of the finest houses in the country, charging four dollars a day and worth it; the main street, built through the virgin-forest, as it stood a year ago, is flanked by granite blocks that rest where stumps, fifteen feet or more in diameter, have been blown out by dynamite; the town is lighted by electricity; there is semi-weekly communication with China and Japan by steamship, and the Canadian Pacific keeps the northernmost\ncity on the Pacific coast in daily communication with the eastern world. All this is substantially a year's work. Other places of this size, or even greater, have sprung up in a night, like Jonah's gourd, but it is believed that there is no record on the American continent of the building of a similar town, will all the improvements of modern civilization, within so short a space of time. It is to be said that it has had the most powerful stimulus that could be brought to bear upon any single spot in the country, but the rising city has simply grown out of the primeval forest without going through the pioneer stages at all. It has been the uprooting of the original wilderness in order to receive the latest touches of civilized life.\"\n\nA few miles away is Hastings\u2014a delightful summer resort called the Brighton of the coast.\n\nPROMINENT BUSINESS HOUSES OF VANCOUVER\n\nOppenheimer Bros., Importers and Wholesale Groceries, Provisions, Cigars and Tobaccos, Powell street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014Vancouver's greatest pride is her merchants, and she can proudly boast that no other city can surpass her for commercial standing and business qualifications. All of her merchants are imbued with the city's interests and make it part and parcel of their daily business by endeavoring to extend her's and their own good name throughout the country. No people are more energetic or prompt to take advantage of the prospects for business that may be brought to our doors, and every exertion is used by them to add to their own accumulations and advance the city's prosperity, and none are more deserving the name of aiding in these enterprises than that of the firm that heads this article. Messrs. Oppenheimer Bros. established their business here in 1885. Previous to that time they were in business in Victoria. Being far-sighted and seeing the great future before Vancouver, they wisely moved to this city. Their extensive trade reaches throughout British Columbia, the Dominion of Canada, China and Japan. The premises occupied consist of a substantial three-story brick building, 35 x 75 feet in dimensions, which is filled with a full and complete line of staple and fancy groceries, provisions, cigars, tobaccos, etc. The members of the firm are Messrs. David Oppenheimer and Isaac Oppenheimer. Both gentlemen are progressive, enterprising and liberal, and no house in the country occupies a more enviable position for integrity, or stands higher in commercial circles, and in the estimation of the public. The citizens of Vancouver manifested their confidence and esteem by electing Mr. David Oppenheimer to the mayoralty for 1888, and Mr. Isaac Oppenheimer as alderman.\n\nIXL Clothing House, Kirschberg and Landsburg, Proprietors, 21 Cordova street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014Prominent among the leading houses in Vancouver is the well-known house of the above mentioned firm, which is located at 21 Cordova street. This business was established three years ago, and since its inception has met with marked success, having constantly and steadily increased. Here will be found one of the large stock of ready-made clothing in the city, of the most fashionable cut and of the best quality of goods from the leading manufacturers of the Dominion, and at prices that cannot be beaten. A large and well selected stock of gent's furnishings is always carried, including all the latest and most seasonable novelties in neck-ware, hosiery, hats and caps, etc. The members of the firm are Messrs. E. Kirschberg and F. Landsburg, who are both wide-awake, enterprising and progressive business men. This firm also own the Victoria Loan Office, situated on Johnson street, near Government, in Victoria, starting in that city three years ago, and the business has increased each year, until at the present time it is the largest of its kind in British Columbia.\n\nGeorge Taylor, Importer and Dealer in Curios from Japan, 429 Cordova street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014A most important branch of commercial activity in Vancouver's leading industries is the above named business. One of the largest and most thoroughly representative concerns in this line of business in British Columbia, and the only one in Vancouver, is that of Mr. George Taylor. This house was established the present year, and since its inception it has enjoyed a very prosperous career. The premises occupied are very spacious and commodious, well arranged and stocked with a full and complete assortment of curios of all descriptions, including silk handkerchiefs, dressing gowns, and a thousand different articles too numerous to mention. The facilities of the house for doing business are of an unusually complete character, enabling it to offer special advantages to strangers, who will here find a complete stock of goods direct from Japan. Mr. Taylor is a courteous gentleman, liberal and fair in all transactions, and well deserving of the success he is achieving.\n\nRand Bros., Real Estate Brokers, Wilson Block, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014There is no financial interest of such magnitude and importance as that involved in real estate, and the steady demand for eligible city and suburban property is the best evidence of Vancouver's growing wealth and prosperity. In this connection it is a pleasure to make prominent mention of an old-established and thoroughly representative house, which has been identified with the real estate interests of Vancouver from its inception. This firm has built up the highest of reputations as talented and responsible brokers in all descriptions of\nTheir connections are of the most superior character, including, as they do, among their customers, many leading Canadian, American and foreign capitalists and investors. Their facilities for transacting business are of an unusually complete character, enabling them to offer special advantages to customers, and to cover every branch of their business in the promptest and most successful manner. They have used their books descriptions of reality so varied as to size, location, price and terms as to suit all classes of investors. Mr. C. D. Rand, its head, has ever taken an active interest in the development and prosperity of the city. Mr. E. E. Rand, the other member of the firm is located at London, Eng., and attends to all matters of the firm in the old country. Mr. C. D. Rand is a genial and courteous gentleman, whose career is alike a credit to himself and the city wherein he resides.\n\nThomas Dunn, Wholesale and Retail Dealer in Heavy and Shelf Hardware, 10 and 140 Cordova street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014There is probably no branch of trade in a more healthy condition than hardware. Prominent among the firms engaged in this branch of commercial trade in Vancouver, and one that is deserving of more than a passing notice in a work professing to give an adequate display of the commercial advantages of the great North-West, is the firm which heads this article. This business was founded in 1886 by the present proprietor. Having ample capital, he is enabled to successfully compete with, and hold his trade against rival establishments in larger cities, never allowing himself to be undersold by any other house, which has resulted in a prosperous and increasing business. The premises occupied are large and commodious, eligibly located and of sufficient dimensions to accommodate a large and varied assortment of hardware, including bar iron, pocket and table cutlery, mechanic's tools of all descriptions, guns and ammunition, house furnishing goods, etc. Mr. Thomas Dunn, the proprietor, has a reputation for enterprise and probity that makes his a most desirable house with which to establish business relations.\n\nGilmore & Clark, Clothing and Gents' Furnishings, 23 Carroll street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014That the city of Vancouver has a bright future before her is beyond all question. Situated as it is on the coast and the terminus of the C.P.R., it could not well be otherwise; nothing this fact, many wide-awake business men and capitalists are locating in this city and surrounding country, which offers the best of inducements to energy and enterprise. Among those houses established here, may be mentioned that of Messrs. Gilmore & Clark, dealers in clothing and gents' furnishings. The premises occupied are large and commodious, and they carry a large and well-selected stock of men's, boys' and children's clothing, all of the latest styles and designs, while the stock of gents' furnishings, embracing all the latest novelties in underwear, shirts, neck-ware, hosiery, hats, caps, etc., are all of the latest importations.

Mr. Clark has been a resident of British Columbia for several years, and has always taken a deep interest in all national and civic affairs, and is now a member of the city council, representing ward three.\n\nLeland House, Messrs. Prout & Ensley, Proprietors, corner Hastings and Granville streets, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014Among the hotels of this city there are none enjoying a higher reputation than that of the Leland House; situated on the corner of Hastings and Granville streets eligibly and conveniently located, within a short distance of the railroad depot and steamboat wharf, the Leland House affords to visitors inducements which cannot be excelled but by few houses. It is a substantial four-story building. On the first floor is the office, dining-room, reading-room, billiard parlor and bar, on the second and third floors are the parlors and sleeping apartments, all large, airy, and handsomely furnished.

There are 76 sleeping rooms in the house. The dining-room has ample seating capacity, and the cuisine is under the supervision of competent and experienced assistants. Messrs. William Prout and John Ensley, the proprietors, are deservedly popular with all classes, and possess a thorough familiarity with all the details and requirements of the business necessary for success.\n\n\"Cheapside,\" A. C. Thicke, Proprietor, Importer and Dealer in Dry Goods, Notions, etc., corner Cordova and Abbott streets, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014In preparing a history of the institutions, establishments and noteworthy enterprises of a city, it is frequently done by comparison, but we often meet in our business with a house so far in advance of its contemporaries as to merit special attention, such is the position Mr. Thicke occupies in Vancouver in the retail dry goods trade. The trade in dry goods is the most important branch of commerce in this country, as it is one of the prime factors in the development of commercial progress, and exercises a larger influence than any other branch of trade. The variety of articles embraced in the general term dry goods is almost exhaustless; but the materials entering into their construction are principally cotton, wool, flax and silk. The business requires as great an amount of good judgment, executive ability and keen foresight as any of the leading mercantile pursuits. The house under consideration was established in 1886 by the present proprietor. His store is filled with as varied and complete a stock of dry goods, embracing dress goods, silk, cotton, woollen and linen fabrics, notions, etc., as can be found in any strictly retail establishment in British Columbia, also lace curtains of exquisite fineness and texture, as well as plain varieties. His stock is ample and the assortment well selected as can be found to choose from. Mr. Thicke is a careful and expert business man; for energy, enterprise and liberality he has no superior. He also has a store situated on Water street.\n\nO'Toole & Ralph, Stoves, Tinware, Cornices, Roofing, Plumbing and Gas Fitting, 114 Carroll street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014This well known and prosperous concern was established in 1896 by Vair & Miller, the present firm buying out the business in 1888, and has been conducted continuously ever since with uniform success, the trade today being exceedingly heavy, owing to the superior character of the goods produced and the unmistakable business ability, energy and enterprise displayed in the management. The premises occupied are spacious and thoroughly equipped with the most approved appliances known to the business, and a heavy and excellent stock is carried to meet the extensive and constantly increasing demand. They keep in stock a full line of stoves, ranges and heaters, tin plate, pumps, iron and lead pipe, gas fittings, etc. They are also manufacturers of all kinds of\ncopper, brass and tinware, black and galvanized sheet iron work and galvanized iron cornice. The members of this firm are Messrs. J. M. O'Toole and William Ralph. We heartily commend this establishment to the public as a first-class house in every particular.\n\nVancouver Drug Co., A. A. Rolls, Proprietor, Dr. James F. Rolls, Manager, 70 Cordova street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014The increase in the population and the constant growth of the city must have its legitimate effect upon the drug business, and in connection with the leading houses in that line we take pleasure in noticing the enterprising drug house of the Vancouver Drug Co. The premises occupied by them are commodious and eligibly situated in the business centre of the city, and are splendidly fitted up for the business. They established here in 1886, and are meeting with most gratifying success, being in the enjoyment of very excellent business. Their establishment is well stocked with pure drugs and medicines, popular patent medicines, perfumery, toilet articles, fancy goods, etc. Dr. Rolls, being a thorough druggist, with a comprehensive knowledge of materia medica, takes special pains accurately to compound and fill physicians' prescriptions. Mr. Rolls will not only be found a good druggist, but a pleasant and accommodating gentleman.\n\nC. S. Bailey, Landscape Artist, 227 Hastings street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014Prominent among the leading and most talented landscape artists of British Columbia is Mr. C. S. Bailey, whose well-equipped studio is at 227 Hastings street. Since establishing himself in business, he has built up a large and influential patronage, and won an excellent reputation for first-class work. He makes a specialty of scenery views along the coast, through the mountains, and as far east along the north shore of Lake Superior as Ottawa. He has in stock a fine collection of views, which are for sale either in sets or singly. Mr. Bailey will furnish a catalogue, on application, to parties living abroad, who wish to secure a collection of scenery views. He is an artist of rare ability, and is meeting with a well-deserved success.\n\nF. W. Hart, Furniture Manufacturer and Importer, Warerooms, 27 and 29 Cordova street; Factory on False Creek, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014Prominent among the established houses of Vancouver is the furniture establishment of Mr. F. W. Hart. This business was founded three years ago by the present proprietor, and from its inception has enjoyed a prosperous career. The premises occupied as saleroom are spacious and commodious, being 25 x 420 feet in dimensions, while the factory on False Creek is a two-story and basement building 40 x 50 feet in size. The show-room is admirably arranged, and heavily stocked with a splendid assortment of parlor, bed-room and dining-room furniture. He has ample manufacturing facilities, and makes to order fine cabinet-work and furniture of every description. This house is so well known, and has retained its old customers so long that its reputation for honorable dealing is established beyond the requirements of praise. Mr. Hart is proprietor of Hart's Opera House, which has a seating capacity of 1000 people. He is a thorough-going business man, fair and honorable in all transactions, and is highly esteemed and respected by the citizens of this city and the community at large. Mr. Hart has the only first-class undertaking establishment in the city.\n\nPage Ponsford, Importer and Dealer in Gents' Furnishings and Ladies' Novelties, 511 Hastings street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014This house conducts the leading business in furnishings and novelties. The premises are commodious, handsomely fitted up, and conveniently arranged, a thorough system of organization pervading the entire establishment. The stock is fresh and desirable throughout, having been selected with the greatest care in the European markets, including the latest novelties in patterns, styles, etc., of foreign manufacture, embracing fine hosiery, underwear, hats, caps, and neck-wear for gentlemen, and all kinds of novelties for the ladies, embracing the latest importations from Paris, while the prices quoted command the attention of the closest buyers. Mr. Ponsford has retained the confidence of leading commercial circles, and is in every respect a worthy exponent of his branch of trade throughout the city and British Columbia.\n\nF. X. Martin, Groceries and Provisions, 25 Cordova street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014The staple and fancy grocery merchant has been an important factor in our mercantile growth, and among our leading houses most actively engaged in connection with the grocery trade is that of Mr. F. X. Martin, dealer in sugars, teas, coffees, syrups, canned goods, and everything pertaining to a first-class grocery establishment. This is one of the best known houses in Vancouver, being established in 1887 by the present proprietor. His facilities and connections are of a strictly first-class character, enabling him to execute all orders in the promptest and most satisfactory manner. Mr. Martin brings to bear sound practical experience, and he now does a large and prosperous business, as a result of his liberal policy, enterprise and extended dealings. He has the esteem and confidence of the citizens of this city and the community at large.\n\nCharles Nelson, Chemist and Druggist, 112 Cordova street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014One of the most thoroughly reliable drug establishments and pharmaceutical depots in this city will be found at No. 112 Cordova street. This business was founded in 1886, and from its inception it has grown to large proportions. The stock of drugs, chemicals, medicines, etc., are of the freshest and purest quality to be had, and the assortment of toilet and fancy articles, druggists' sundries, etc., will compare favorably with that of any drug establishment in the country. In the prescription department he does a large and increasing business. The establishment is centrally located on Cordova street, in the centre of the business portion of the city. Mr. Nelson possesses business ability and energy of a high order, well qualifying him to carry on his business successfully, and his establishment is every way worthy of liberal patronage. Prompt, reliable and energetic, he will be found to be fully up to the times.\n\nDavid Evans, Merchant Tailor, 75 Cordova street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014Among the industries carried on in Vancouver the manufacture of gents' clothing is a most important one, and when carried on (as in the present instance) in accordance with the prevailing styles, the importance is surely all the greater\u2014alike a credit to the city that sustains such an industry, and to the gentleman engaged in it. This gentleman commenced business here in 1886, being one of the pioneer merchants of Vancouver. Mr. Evans keeps a full and complete assortment of all the latest styles and designs in Canadian styles and designs in Canadian and Scotch tweeds, also English and French worsteds, etc. The work turned out by this gentleman\nhas secured for him a first-class reputation, and purchasing his clothes on the most favorable terms, he is enabled to supply his customers at most reasonable prices. Mr. Evans is an experienced and skilful cutter, honorable and upright in all his dealings, and is deserving of the large and constantly increasing patronage of which he is in the enjoyment.\n\nG. L. Allen, Boots and Shoes, 12 Cordova street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014The handsomely and elegantly fitted up store of Mr. G. L. Allen is eligibly situated at No. 13 Cordova street, and is most admirably arranged, being one of the finest establishments of its kind in British Columbia. The stock carried is a large and varied one, embracing a splendid assortment of fine and medium priced footwear for ladies, gents and children. Here will be found all the standard shapes, correct styles and original patterns, and all the goods are warranted to be manufactured out of the very best material, a very important consideration in these days, when shoddy goods are so frequently palmed off upon the unsuspecting public. Mr. Allen's stock is reliable in every respect, and those who patronize the establishment will never have cause to regret it. The business was founded by Mr. Allen in 1887, and, by his energy and enterprise, coupled with a thorough knowledge of the business and the requirements of the public, he has largely increased it, and his annual sales reach a very respectable figure. Mr. Allen is well known as an honorable, liberal and conscientious businessman, and is held in the highest esteem both in social and commercial circles, and has achieved a well merited success. He also manufactures all kinds of boots and shoes to order, employing none but first-class workmen.\n\nS. T. Tilly, Books, Stationery and Fancy Goods, 11 Cordova street, Vancouver, B.C.\u2014It is needless to estimate the importance of the book and stationery trade, as that has long since been recognized, its importance being coeval with the development of a country commercially, socially and intellectually, and the character of an establishment of this kind decides to a very large extent the intellectual status of the community in which it exists. In Vancouver there is certainly cause for congratulation, as here there is one of the finest book and stationery establishments in the city. We refer to that of Mr. S. T. Tilly. This gentleman commenced business here in 1886, since which time he has built up a large and flourishing trade, being, in fact, one of the largest of the kind in Vancouver. The premises are large and commodious, and the stock, which is complete in every detail, consists principally of a large assortment of books, stationery of all kinds, pictures, engravings, autotypes, etc., also a full line of artist's materials and fancy goods of every description.

Chief among them is Victoria, the capital, which bears the same relation to British Columbia that Portland does to Oregon or Winnipeg to Manitoba. Beautifully located on the extreme southeastern coast of Vancouver Island, in a completely land-locked bay, which affords a safe harbor, it naturally occupies a commanding position\u2014one so important, that it gives rise to the aspiration in its people that some day, rivalling San Francisco, it will divide with her the honor of being the mistress of the Pacific. The queenly city, appropriately named after the sovereign of Great Britain, was incorporated in 1862, although long before that it was a thriving trading place of some importance. It is the oldest and largest and wealthiest city in the Province; its situation rivals that of the famed sea-girt cities of the Orient. Nestling on low evergreen hills, it faces the straits of Fuca, and across in American territory are to be seen the long, snow-crested Olympian range, stretching south and east; Mount Baker to the left uplifts its broad expanse of white far above its comrades; the island-dotted Gulf of Georgia; and the rich background\u2014all add sublimity and beauty to the lovely surroundings of glistening waters and winsome wooded retreats. No other city in America is blest with such enchanting environments; none can boast of lovelier flower-scented drives, or beautified natural parks, which combine to make the spot an earthly paradise to the lover of nature. See Naples and die! Rather see Victoria and live, for the prospect is so charming, the sea breezes so invigorating, the people so hospitable, that new heart and life and courage are given the dyspeptic or discontented, who, entranced and delighted with the charms of the place, find something worth living for in this beautiful city by the sea. But it is not Victoria's beautiful environments that are its only attractions. Commercially, it is prosperous and progressive; historically, it is interesting. Indeed, it may be said, that in a large measure the history of Victoria is the history of British Columbia. Nearly a century ago, the roving Spaniard, Quinepe, discovered a good port for shelter on the Island of Vancouver, then supposed to be the main land, and called it Corboda. This is supposed to be the site of the city of Victoria. Of the succeeding years, little is known, but there was located on the summit of an adjacent hill the Indian village of the Songhies, who were at one time the sole inhabitants of the locality. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Hudson's Bay Company established a post here, and in 1847 Fort Victoria was made the headquarters of the Company. From this, dates the permanency of Victoria, although previously it had reached the dignity of something more than a mere trading post. The site was chosen on the east shore of Victoria harbor, one mile from its entrance, the original name being Fort Camosin, the Indian term for the inlet. In a report made in 1846, Colonel Holloway thus describes the place: \"Fort Victoria is situated at the southern end of Vancouver Island, in the small harbor of Camosin, the entrance to which is rather intricate. The fort is a square enclosure of one hundred yards, surrounded by cedar pickets twenty feet in height, having two octagonal bastions each containing six-pounder iron guns at the north-east and south-west angles. The buildings are made of squared timbers, eight in number, forming three sides of an oblong.\"\nIt is badly situated with regard to water and position, which latter has been chosen for its agricultural advantages only. This is the best built of the Company's forts; it requires loop-holing and a platform or gallery to enable men to fire over the pickets. A ditch might be cut around it, but the rock appears on the surface in many places.\" Seven years later, the site of the fort was described as an oak opening, and inside the enclosure were a number of stores, carpenter and blacksmith shops, chapel, prison, and residences for the employees of the Company. A whaling depot was established, and Victoria became the headquarters of the trade. The embryotic city soon started to trade direct with England, the first vessel reaching port direct from the Mother Country in 1845. Agriculture was also fostered by the Company, and dairies were established, with large herds of cattle. In 1849, the whaling industry declined, but, if not a prosperous whaling port, Victoria made progress in another direction, becoming a great fur depot. Up to this year there were no courts of justice in British Columbia, legal matters of importance being adjudicated on in Montreal. In the same year, Vancouver Island was proclaimed a British colony, and Victoria was made the capital. Governor Blanchard, the first governor, arrived on 10th March, 1850, but, being unable to find accommodation, was compelled to remain for some time on the vessel in which he had arrived. His tenure of office was very brief, and he resigned in the following November, his resignation being accepted in April, 1851. He was succeeded by Chief Factor Douglas, who ruled the Company as well as the country until 1859, when he retired from the Company's service, and was knighted four years afterwards. In 1852, Victoria was laid out in streets, but owing to the monopoly held by the Hudson's Bay Company, there was not much progress made until 1856. The gold discoveries of 1858, already referred to at length, gave an impetus to the growth of the city, and in that year stores were established, saloons started, newspapers published, the first one being the Gazette. Population rushed in, and the number of permanent inhabitants increased from less than three hundred in 1853 to thirty five hundred in 1861; although in the year previous the number had fallen away to about fifteen hundred. A police force was organized in 1859, land office opened, and courts of justice, with regularly appointed judges and officials established in the city and Province. Several wharves were constructed in 1860, the new Government buildings erected on James' Bay, across which a bridge was built. Fire appliances were procured, an efficient volunteer fire brigade organized, and during the year a number of fine buildings were erected. A fair idea of the progress the place has made is given by the Victoria Directory, published in that year, which says:\u2014\n\n\"In trades and professions, Victoria possesses seven butchers or meat salesmen, several fish and vegetable dealers, ten bakers, thirteen dry or fancy goods stores, six tailors, thirteen commission merchants, three chemists and druggists, three architects, one ambrotypist, eight or ten carpenters or contractors, twenty grocers and provision dealers, four hair-cutting saloons, three dressmakers, about twenty-five hotels, inns and saloons and restaurants, six surveyors, three watchmakers, four lumber dealers, eight or nine medical practitioners of different classes, ten legal professors, of whom four are barristers at law, two banks, four blacksmiths, machinists and shipsmiths, three express offices, three newspapers (tri-weekly), seven auctioneers and estate agents, seven dealers in tin and hardware, three wholesale liquor dealers, six cigar and fruit dealers, two ship-brokers, one patent roofing dealer; four lodging...\"\nhouses, one tanner, one underwriter, one crockery and glass dealer, one fur dresser, two seed dealers, two breweries, five milk sellers, two saddlers, eight wharves.\" The spiritual welfare of Victoria was well looked after; there being Roman Catholic, Wesleyan, Congregational and Episcopalian churches and missions, and the Sisters of St. Ann had a nunnery. There were also educational establishments in the shape of a young ladies' seminary, a private educational institute for boys and girls, a school under the control of the Roman Catholic bishop, and the public schools. The following institutions and societies were also in existence or in course of formation: A hospital, Masonic Lodge, Odd Fellows' Association, Ladies' Benevolent Society, a first Hebrew Society, Victoria Benevolent and Philharmonic Society, which had been in existence a long time, \"The ports of Victoria and Esquimalt receive ten river and sea-going steamers * * * two built in Victoria by navigation companies. * * * We carry on a lucrative trade in lumber, flour and fruits with the ports on the Sound, and have bi-monthly communication with the Atlantic States and the Home Government.\" Victoria was then a free port, in the fullest sense of the word, being, with the exception of Hong Kong and Labrador, the only British depots for ocean commerce in which no customs duties were levied. There were other free ports existing in different parts of the world, but Victoria bore the distinction of being the only one that was absolutely free, while the others had certain restrictions. The glory surrounding the Hudson's Bay fort began to depart in 1861, and the new Victoria, incorporated in the following year, began to assume the dignity of a city. It was divided into three wards, the council being composed of a mayor and seven councillors. From this time the city's progress has been gradual, the population increasing to 6,000 in 1863, with about fifteen hundred buildings. In 1878 the city boasted of a horticultural society, four hospitals, one lunatic asylum, two iron foundries, two sash and door, etc., factories, one cigar manufactory, two tanneries, six breweries, two soap factories, two boot and shoe factories, two ship yards, two lumber yards, three wagon, etc., makers, three machinists, three boiler-makers, one book-binding and blank-book manufactory, one match factory, two brick yards, three printing offices, the Albion iron works, and two planing, moulding, etc., mills. In 1882, Victoria's population had increased to over 7,000, exclusive of Indians, and to-day that number is exactly doubled.\n\nVictoria has, like all western towns, been the theatre of many exciting scenes, but public feeling ran highest perhaps in 1874, when the people who had become entirely disgusted at the nonfulfillment of the terms made with Canada, threatened secession from the Dominion. Happily, however, the differences were adjusted, and a long suffering people ultimately\u2014though after years of patient waiting\u2014found their long cherished hopes of being connected with the provinces of the east fully realized.\n\nThe limits of the city have twice been enlarged since its incorporation, and now embrace an area of four square miles. It now extends from the George road on Victoria Arm, on the northwest, to Cedar Hill road, Cadboro Bay road and Moss street on the east, its southern boundary cutting across Beacon Hill park, and abutting on the water at the foot of Menzies street on James Bay. The business portion is mainly built of brick and stone, and while some of the structures are quaint and old fashioned, they have a substantial appearance, indicative of the solid character of its business enterprises. Victoria has not had any booms of late; but\nits growth has been steady and gradual. In 1887, $315,000 were expended in building improvements. The city possesses an excellent system of waterworks, fire and police protection, telegraph, telephone and postal arrangements, and is well governed by a careful council. It is lighted by electricity and has street cars. The city has about sixty miles of streets and a water frontage of six miles available for wharves. Being the seat of the Provincial Government, and the Dominion Government having large interests in the place, there are numerous public buildings, some of which display the taste and skill of the architect. The Local Government buildings are located on James' Bay, and are built in the Swiss style. The Lieutenant-Governor, Hon. Mr. Nelson, resides in Carey Cattle, whose surroundings are amongst the most charming in the attractive environs of this fair city.\n\nThe great pride of the average Victorian is Beacon Hill Park, a natural retreat, whose pristine beauty requires not the aid of man to render perfect. From Beacon Hill, which slopes gradually to the water, an admirable roadway running around its base\u2014a view is obtained the loveliness of which baffles description. The park itself on a bright afternoon is a scene of life and festivity. The beautiful drives are graced with the presence of the youth and fashion of the city, the grassy slopes and sunny lawns afford to the devotee of athletic games an opportunity seldom missed of indulging in his favorite pastime of cricket, lacrosse or baseball. There is no fairer spot man could wish to visit; none which he views with such admiration; none which he leaves with such pleasant recollections.\n\nAn extract has already been made from the directory of 1860: here is another from that of 1887: Victoria now numbers among its industries, sash and door factories, planing mills, sail lofts, boat and ship-building yards, a malting establishment, breweries, soda water and syrup factories, tanneries, hat makers, saddle and harness makers, barrel and furniture factories, rice mills, broom and match factories, coffee and spice mills, saw mills, wire works, corset works, stove factories, blacksmiths and foundries, boot and shoe factories, piano manufacturing, waggon and carriage making, and pork packing establishments, cigars and cigar box manufactories, lithographic and chromo-lithographic printing, job printers, blank book manufacturing, book-binding and ruling, brick-making, cracker bakeries, soap works, and others too numerous to mention. It is hoped that in the near future, entreprising capitalists will establish smelting works for the reduction of both iron and copper ores, both of which abound in the Province; also woollen and paper mills, rope works, glass works, wood and willow ware, drain and tile works.\n\nThe water supply is excellent, the service having been completed at a cost of about a quarter of a million. There are six miles of water mains, and the gross receipts annually amount to about $40,000. Electricity has superseded gas for public lighting, the corporation owning the electric works; but there is also an incandescent electric light company and a gas company composed of private individuals, which are well patronized. That Victoria is well governed is shown by the fact that notwithstanding the many public improvements made, the indebtedness of the city is very small, and the taxes very light. The following are the civic representation and officials: Mayor, John Grant; alderman, D. R. Harris, Geo. Powell, Wm. Wilson, Louis Vigelius, S. Kelly, John Braden, S. T. Styles, Jno Coughlan, C. T. Penwill; clerk, James D. Robinson; treasurer and assessor, Thomas Russell; city surveyor, Peter Leach; water commissioner, Peter Summerfield; assistant-collector, T. J.

Since established in 1860, this house has always maintained a prominent position in the dry goods and commission trade. Through all these years of their business life, the members of the firm have maintained the characteristics for energy, high commercial integrity and enterprise with which they began business, and, as the years pass, gain some added value, rather than lose in efficiency. The premises occupied, so far as regards facilities for the operation of their business, are all that could be desired, being ample, commodious and eligibly situated. Here may be found a large stock of dry goods, hosiery, etc., also always stored in the cellar below, the finest brands of wines, liquors, ales, arrested water, etc., from the various European and Canadian houses represented by this firm. T., B., & Co. are also importers of tin plates, black tin and other canary material, and are agents for the following companies and firms:\u2014Guardian Fire Assurance Company, London; North British & Morantile Insurance Co., London (for mainland); Commercial Insurance Co., Marine, San Francisco; Inverness and Balmoral Salmon Canneries; Peoples' Steam Navigation Co.; Steamer Rainbow; O.

The members of the firm are Hon. Mr. J. H. Turner and Mr. H. C. Beeton. Mr. Turner is Finance Minister for the province, and was mayor of Victoria in the years 1879 and 1880. Mr. Beeton is agent general for British Columbia in England, office 33 Finsbury Circus, London. Cordially commending this house to the trade and the public, and calling attention to their liberal manner of doing business, and their resources, it may justly be added, that, ranking as it does among the first in the line of its contemporaries, the establishment of Messrs. Turner, Beeton & Co. commands the respect of the trade, and the highest consideration of the community at large.\n\nDriard House, Redo & Hartingel, Proprietors, corner View, Broad and Douglas streets, Victoria, B.C.\u2014The oldest first-class hotel in British Columbia, and one which has for years enjoyed a reputation second to no hotel in the country. An institution of which the city of Victoria should feel proud, and which is in every way deserving of patronage and generous support. For twenty-six years this house has been well and favorably known, not only to the residents of British Columbia, who occasionally visited this only, but to thousands all over the world, travelling for business or pleasure, who availed themselves of its accommodations. The old hotel was built in 1862, while the new structure was erected in 1886. The hotel proper occupies a whole block, and three stories in height, and is fitted up with all modern improvements, gas, electric light, electric bells, closets and baths on each floor, hot and cold water, etc. The chambers, for the accommodation of guests, are 125 in number, well ventilated, handsomely furnished, and strictly clean and comfortable, the dining-room is large and commodious, having a seating capacity of over 200, while the office, reading and smoking rooms are large, airy and well lighted.

Tingley, President; Frank S. Barnard, Secretary; Broughton street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014Among the active enterprises of a city like Victoria, the business of livery, hack, and sale stables occupies, necessarily, an important place, contributing as they do to the pleasure, convenience and actual necessities of the community. The most notable establishments of this class in the city is that of the Victoria Transfer Co., which is the largest establishment of its kind in British Columbia. The business was established in 1883. The building is a two-story structure, 66 x 240 feet in dimension, and contains all modern improvements, the interior arrangements being perfect, no expense having been spared in equipping it with every convenience and facility. In the front is located the office, waiting-rooms, repository for carriages, etc., while in the rear are stalls affording accommodation for 100 head of horses. The ventilation and sanitary arrangements are perfect, and the welfare of the stock is carefully attended to. This firm have here about 100 head of horses, embracing good saddle horses and roadsters, also 30 to 40 handsome and stylish carriages and about 10 hacks. They also have a stable on Johnson street for the accommodation of their patrons in that part of the city; also a blacksmith shop, wood-work shop and paint shop, all in connection to facilitate their business. This firm are also owners of the British Columbia Express Co. and Stage Line, which runs from Ashcroft, on the C.P.R., to Barkerville and Lillooet. Stages leave Ashcroft every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. This line was established by Mr. Barnard some twenty years ago; their stage lines run to the famous Cariboo country. Mr. Frank S. Barnard, the secretary and manager of this company, is an active competitor for legitimate business, energetic, honorable and fair in all dealings, and is very popular throughout the country.\n\n**Champlain Saw Mills,** Croft & Angus, Proprietors; Mills at Champlain, Office Government street, next Bank British Columbia, Victoria, B.C.\u2014There are no more important or available and widely distributed elements of wealth in British Columbia than the lumber interests. Her great resources in this line, in their importance and value, cannot readily be overestimated. The situation of Victoria and vicinity, with reference to the timber growing districts of British Columbia, has made it an available point in the lumber trade, and added considerably to her industrial prosperity. The magnitude and extent of this trade is thoroughly appreciated, and at the present time is represented by many thousands of dollars. Many firms are engaged in the various branches of the lumber trade, some of them mammoth in proportion, and supplied with every requisite facility for the sawing and handling of lumber in all of its forms. In the front rank of these is the firm of Croft & Angus, H. Harrison, agent at Victoria. This establishment is one of large proportions, perfect in its details and arrangements, and occupies a prominent position among the successful enterprises of Victoria. This business was founded in 1884 by the present proprietors, Messrs. Henry Croft and William Angus. They have carried on the business since that time with no interruption to their success, making frequent improvements and additions, introducing the most perfect machinery, adding to the capacity of the mill, which at present exceeds 50,000 feet every ten hours. The mill is admirably located at Champlain, having a spacious frontage and harbor for anchoring millions of feet of logs. Almost every particle of the log is utilized in some way in making lumber, lath or shingles. One engine of 260 horse-power is employed to drive the machinery. One hundred hands are employed by this company in the various departments. These mills in every respect are as perfect and completely arranged as any in British Columbia. Their trade is scattered all over the world, shipping to China, Australia, South America and all over Canada. They make a specialty of large timber. This firm are owners of Champlain town site. Mr. Croft is M.P.P. for Champlain, and Mr. Angus is a brother to R. B. Angus, vice-president of the Canadian Pacific Railway. This firm is liberal, energetic and straightforward in their policy, and they have been successful in legitimate business, always occupying a high position for mercantile honor and integrity. We should mention also that this mill supplies all the lumber for the construction of the Island Railroad, amounting to some 12,600,000 feet. It supplies also nearly all the lumber used on the east coast of Vancouver Island, both by land and water, between Nanaimo and Victoria. The mail steamers call at the mill wharf and ship lumber to the various places of call along the coast. Messrs. Croft & Angus own large timber limits on the mainland and islands, as well as at various points near by. They have a yard also in Victoria. A 56 and a 52 double circular saw, a 5-gang circular, a 42-inch \"edger\" machine, a planer (capable of planing two flooring boards at once, 36 inches wide). Also an English general joiner and planer, that will simply do anything you tell it. A 36-inch hand-saw, a gang lathe mill and boiler, a No. 20 Detroit fan to blow the shavings and sawdust away from the mill. A 21-inch turbine, driven by 50 feet fall of water. The mill, moreover, is supplied with water pipes to each floor with troughs on every roof, so that by just turning a tap, every roof, and, indeed, every part of the mill can be flooded at once. In summer, by way of precaution, they flood all the roofs both night and morning. The water, which is of the purest quality, is brought in pipes from a lake about five miles distant, and flows with great force. From this source all the mail steamers on the coast draw their supply of water. Everything in and around the mill is in apple-pie order, and simply works like clockwork. It is evident that the proprietors attend well to business, and know also how to attend to it.\nH. A. Harrison, Coal, Wood and Lumber, Office Government street, next to Bank of British Columbia, Victoria, B.C.\u2014One of the most extensive coal, wood and lumber merchants in Victoria is Mr. H. Harrison, whose office is located on Government street, and yards and wharf on Lauris Point. Mr. Harrison has always on hand a large stock of the famous Wellington coal, and as agent for the Chemainus saw mills, he has a large stock of lumber of all dimensions, thoroughly seasoned and of a most desirable class. These extensive delivery and storage yards are eligible in location, which facilitates the prompt filling of the largest orders at lowest market prices. Mr. Harrison receiving his supplies direct from the producers, enabling him to offer special advantages to customers. He also carries an immense stock of wood of all kinds, selling in lots to suit customers. Mr. Harrison, during his busy career, has ever sustained an untarnished reputation for honorable, straightforward dealing and sterling integrity.\n\nT. N. Hibben & Co., Bookseller and Stationer, Government street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014In all the wide range of industrial pursuits there is not a more interesting occupation than that of the bookseller, upon which the education of the masses and the enlightenment of the citizens of the country in a large measure depend. The city of Victoria is especially a city of erudition and culture, the consequence being that the book trade is of more than ordinary importance. There is no better evidence of refined taste in the house than the presence of books, and it is a matter of congratulation to the friends and laborers in the cause of education that the major portion of the literature which forms the reading matter of today is far superior in character as compared with that of a few years ago. Messrs. T. N. Hibben & Co., the proprietors of this enterprise, have been engaged in this branch of industry for the last thirty years, this being one of Victoria's pioneer establishments, they having established their present business in 1858, and by the use of most effective and energetic business methods have succeeded in building up a trade connection of which they may justly be proud, and one which will bear favorable comparison with that of any kindred house in the Dominion. The premises occupied are large and commodious, being 20 x 82 and addition 20 x 30 feet in dimensions, and fully stocked with a choice variety of popular literature, which includes both ancient and modern classical, biographical, historical, scientific and artistic works, as well as books of fiction, romance, poetry and religion, which are offered at most reasonable prices. They also carry a full line of stationery, plain and fancy, as well as legal and commercial, also blank books and office sundries. They import all their stationery direct. To the careful and judicious management of the proprietors, Mr. T. N. Hibben & Co., is due the present success of this enterprise, which in its line may justly be ranked as one of the leading houses of British Columbia. This house holds the agency of British Columbia for the Caligraph Type Writer, Admiralty charts and books, Judd Paper Co., Holyoke, J. & A. Arnold's, Walden's and Antoine's Inks, Guillott's and Esterbrook's steel pens, T. Shriver & Co.'s copying presses, J. W. Foley & Le Roy Fairchild's gold pens, Cowan & Co.\n\nA HEAVY PURCHASE.\n\nMessrs. T. N. Hibben & Co.'s tender for the bankrupt stock of the British Columbia Stationery and Printing Company of $74 cents on the dollar was accepted today by Sheriff McMillan, who is in possession of the premises on behalf of the creditors. So soon as the stock list is checked over the new proprietors will take possession. The stock is said to be a good one, being largely staple. This, we believe, is the fourth or fifth stationery and fancy goods establishment in Victoria that has been merged into the business of Messrs. Hibben & Co. Their latest purchase is considered the best they have yet made, and they are being congratulated on their success and enterprise.\n\nGeorge H. Maynard, Boots and Shoes, 59 Government street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014There is no branch of business which requires a higher degree of enterprise and business capacity than the boot and shoe trade, and in this connection we desire to call attention to the excellent establishment of Mr. George H. Maynard, whose fashionable emporium is located on Government street, in the centre of the business portion of the city. He occupies commodious premises, where he keeps a choice and most desirable stock of boots, shoes and slippers for men's, women's, misses and children's wear, of all styles and grades, from the fine and costly hand-made to the coarsest qualities. This business was established by the present proprietor in 1869, and has won its way as the first-class boot and shoe establishment of Victoria. He handles none but the best quality of goods, and his full and well assorted stock being bought directly from eastern markets enables him to compete with any contemporaries in price and style, to the decided advantage of the customer. The liberal and prompt way in which the establishment is conducted bespeaks an unusual share of popularity. As an establishment this house is so well known for its strict adherence to truthful representation and reliability for business honor that any comment from us would be unnecessary to strengthen its well deserved popularity.\n\nRobert Ward & Co., Commission Merchants Shipping and Insurance Agents, Wharf street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014To no class of her merchants does Victoria point with more pride than does she to her commission merchants. Not only have they been largely the means of advertising her as a cheap and pleasant business locality, but through them her commission merchants have come to be looked upon as the most generous and stable of her business men. A prominent point, and one that will have more effect than any other, is the fact that less money has been lost through failures of her merchants than can be said of any other city on the coast. This has given them a very high commercial standing, and made Victoria a valuable factor in the commission business. No firm of our merchants can lay a more just claim to all these advantages than Messrs. Robert Ward & Co., and it is due as much to their business integrity that the present state of affairs exists as to any other merchants in the city. This house was established in 1862, and from its inception it has succeeded in building up a large and influential trade. This firm, as agents, represent Messrs. Curtiss & Harvey, London, the Salmon Canning Establishments of Eyen & Co., and the Bon Accord Fishery Co., Fraser River, and they are also general agents for the Province of British Columbia for the following well known insurance companies: Royal Insurance Company, London and Lancashire Fire Insurance Company, Standard Life Assurance Company, London and Provincial Marine Insurance Company (Limited), Alliance Marine Insurance Company (Limited), Union Insurance Company.\n\nMr. Robert Ward is consul for Sweden and Norway, a Justice of the Peace, and President of the British Columbia\nBoard of Trade. He is a live business man, conducting his affairs on the most elevated plane of commercial integrity. Liberal, enterprising and energetic, he is respected and esteemed in social as well as business circles. This firm is represented in London by Messrs. H. J. Gardiner & Co., 1 Gresham Buildings, Basinghall street, E.C.\n\nJ. C. Devlin, Commission Merchant, 150 Government street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014There are few business enterprises that have the capacity for wider range and scope than the produce and commission business. Few persons are aware of the fact that to carry on the produce business with success, a higher amount of business knowledge is more essential than in ordinary branches of trade. Success in the commission business requires activity and energy, with keen perception of the best interests of the consignor. Among the houses that are considered as most prominent and influential in this trade is that of Mr. J. C. Devlin. He has, since coming to this city, taken an active part in promoting its business prosperity. This gentleman commenced the produce business here in 1886 with a capital sufficiently large for the undertaking, and his comprehensive knowledge of its requirements and responsibilities, and his straightforward manner of transacting business has increased his trade wonderfully. His transactions embrace a general produce and commission business, receiving and disposing of consignments of produce, as well as being a buyer. He makes a specialty of dairy and farm produce. Through long experience in every detail of his business, and a high reputation for integrity and fair dealing, this house is justly entitled to the confidence in which it is held by the trade.\n\nLowinberg, Harris & Co., Real Estate, Mining and Insurance, 47 Government street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014There are no financial interests of such great importance as those involved in real estate, and there can be no better evidence of Victoria's growing wealth and prosperity than the great demand for eligible property, coupled with a steady rise in values. Among the active, enterprising successful firms identified with the real estate interests of Victoria, is that of Messrs. Lowinberg, Harris & Co. This business was established by Mr. Lowinberg in 1838, and is the oldest and most representative firm of its kind in British Columbia. Mr. Lowinberg died several years ago, and the business has since been conducted by Messrs. D. R. Harris and N. P. Snowden, the present members of the firm. Both gentlemen possess ample practical experience, and are widely known in financial circles. Their facilities for transacting business are of an unusually complete character, enabling them to offer special advantages to customers, and to cover every department in the promptest and most satisfactory manner. They make a specialty of the care and management of estates and business blocks, securing responsible tenants, collecting rents, effecting repairs, and maintaining them at the highest standard of productive efficiency.

This firm are financial agents representing the North British Canadian Investment Co. and other large companies, and do a large and increasing business in placing loans on all first-class securities.

The proprietor, Mr. F. G. Richards, Jr., who is an old British Columbian, coming to this country in 1862, is highly esteemed by all who enjoy his acquaintance.\n\nAlbion Iron Works, R. Dunsmuir, President; W. F. Bullen, Secretary and Manager, Victoria, B.C.\u2014The history of this concern has been so intimately connected with the development of the trade of Victoria, that no record of the industries of this community would be complete that did not take cognizance of the above-mentioned Company. Started in 1861, the efforts of the Company from the first have been devoted to the manufacture of steam-engines and other machinery. The works were erected and specially adapted in construction for the required purpose, being equipped with the best mechanical appliances that modern improvement could suggest, and such processes adapted for the perfect preparation and finish of their manufacture as would render the product absolutely flawless. In the attainment of this desideratum, the Company have met with the most signal success; and the reputation that followed has led to a trade that at the present time is not limited to Victoria and the Island, but to all parts of British Columbia and the coast. As manufacturers of steam-engines, boilers, coal mining machinery, saw-mill and fish canning machinery, they have no peer on the coast; and for strength, durability, perfection of workmanship and finish, their work is recognized and appreciated by machinists for its matchless superiority. Their plant is ample in extent,\nthe buildings covering an area of three and a quarter acres. Employment is given to 150 men in the various departments. Mr. Bullen, the secretary and manager, is one of our pioneer business men, and is a gentleman respected and esteemed by the citizens of Victoria. The financial and general business management falls to his care, and he gives his personal supervision to the operative manufacturing departments of the works.\n\nThomas Earle, Importer and Wholesale Merchant, 92, 94 and 97 Wharf street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014The wholesale commission trade forms a very important branch of industry in Victoria, and contributes materially to the prosperity of the city. Among the firms most actively engaged in connection with the trade in groceries, provisions and produce, is the popular and successful house of Thomas Earle, situated on Wharf street. He established this business in 1869, and has built up a large and influential patronage, the house being classed to-day among the leading and most substantial in its line. He does a general commission business, handling all kinds of consignments in merchandise.

As a rule, a well-dressed man betokens the gentleman, while the \"loudly\" or flashily dressed the reverse. It is an important matter that a person who has not a special taste in matters of dress themselves should go to a first-class merchant tailor and submit to his judgment, while it is equally necessary for those who are possessed of taste to place their orders in the hands of an expert. Among those prominently engaged in the merchant tailoring business in this city is the firm of Messrs. Leask & Morrison. This business was established in 1832, and since its inception has gradually and steadily advanced in volume and importance. The premises occupied are 30 x 75 feet in dimensions, and are tastefully fitted up for the requirements of the business.

Short, Gun Manufacturer and Dealer in Fire Arms, Ammunition, and all kinds of Sporting Goods, 32 Fort street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014The oldest and leading house in its line in British Columbia is unquestionably that of Mr. H. Short. This business was established by him in 1862, he being one of the pioneer merchants of Victoria, starting at a time when Victoria as a city was in its infancy, and the new beautiful West was a mere wilderness. Mr. Short brings the widest range of practical experience to bear, coupled with an intimate knowledge of the business, he being a first-class gun maker by trade, having learned his profession in Cork, Ireland, where he formerly resided. Mr. Short carries on the business of manufacturing all kinds of firearms, his establishment being fitted up with all the latest and most improved machinery for the transaction of his business.

The Western demand, which is proverbially fastidious in the choice of furniture, is dependent on Victoria for a large portion of their supply. With the increased demand there has been a corresponding improvement of taste in design, and nowhere can there be exhibited finer displays than can be seen in the cabinet warerooms of Victoria. In this special line of industrial manufacturing enterprise there is no house in the city better known or more entitled to recognition in a work recounting, for public information, the resources and manufacturing facilities of Victoria than Mr. Jacob Sehl, who established this business in 1861, with moderate capital. Enterprise, ability, a thoroughly comprehensive knowledge of the trade and industrial courage, are elements that win in any of the active pursuits of life. Possessing these qualifications in a superior degree, Mr. Sehl has succeeded in building up a trade equal to any in British Columbia, and steadily increasing year by year. He is a large manufacturer and dealer in all kinds, styles and qualities of parlor, bedroom, dining-room, library and kitchen furniture, from the highly ornamented, decorative and costly set to the plainer and cheaper articles, making a specialty of fine furniture.

With so useful a place among the general industries, and a trade so large and productive of such satisfactory results, the business of Mr. Jacob Sehl exerts no small influence upon general prosperity and commercial enterprise, and is justly classed in his line among the leading houses of British Columbia. Mr. Sehl manufactured the fittings for the Bank of British Columbia, which is not surpassed for original design and finish by any bank on the Pacific coast. This house has a branch establishment at Vancouver for the accommodation of its patrons on the main land.\n\nMann & Heron, Wholesale and Retail Harness, Saddles, etc., 29 Broad street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014The manufacturer and dealer in saddlery and harness is one who occupies an important place in the industries of our country, and in this line in Victoria we have an old established and thoroughly reliable house in that of Messrs. Mann & Heron. This business was founded by Mr. H. T. Mann, the senior partner, in 1862, Mr. R. Heron entering into partnership in 1875.

In these days of the complexities of city life the plumber has become in the highest degree essential to our comfort, and a few words concerning an enterprising and reliable firm engaged in the trade cannot but prove of interest to our readers. We refer to that of Messrs. Colbert & Warner, steam heaters, gas engineers and sanitary plumbers. This firm, since its establishment here, has built up an excellent reputation for honest work at reasonable prices. A complete stock is carried of supplies and materials, embracing steam, gas and plumbers' goods, pipe fittings, etc., and everything in the way of plumbing, copper work, gas fittings, drain laying, ventilating, etc., is executed, contracts are entered into, and the complete fitting up of buildings of all kinds is satisfactorily performed.

They are active, enterprising and popular business men, of ample practical experience, and they are meeting with a well deserved success.\n\nVancouver Bakery, Thomas Harding, Proprietor, Fort street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014The industry of the baker is in all communities a most important one, as supplying a commodity necessary for our daily subsistence. In this line we have a prominent and thoroughly representative house in that of Mr. Thomas Harding, whose establishment is located on Fort street, in the centre of the business portion of the city. This business was established by its present enterprising proprietor some twenty-five years ago, who has, from a comparatively small scale, built up his present substantial and satisfactory trade.

Lombard, whose handsome and commodious warehouses are on Government street, off the post-office. He has been established here three years, and has built up a large and permanent patronage among the best class of citizens. Mr. Lombard is sole agent here for the world-famed Bell Organ, and is also general agent for the\nRonisch, Steinway, of New York, and Weber pianos. These instruments are the very best products of inventive genius and mechanical skill.

Bowman, Livery, Hack and Stage Line, Broad street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014It is necessary that in a city of Victoria's proportions and importance, livery establishments should be well represented. Happily, a number of such, alike creditable to the city and the proprietors, are here, and prominent among them is the well-known establishment of Mr. W. G. Bowman, who established his present business in 1858, being one of British Columbia's pioneers.

No house in British Columbia offers greater inducements to the purchaser than this, and no establishment, at least in that part of the city, is more widely known or enjoys a finer trade. This business was started in 1870 by Mr. W. J. Jeffree, one conducted by him until his death, when the business passed into the hands of his wife, the present owner. The business is managed by Messrs. S. Reid and R. A. Cunningham. Previous to embarking in business here, Mr. Jeffree was mining in the Cariboo country for several years, and was one of British Columbia's pioneers. The popularity of the house is due to the liberal policy and the cordial manner in which everyone visiting the store is treated, as well as the general excellence of the stock, and the complete and choice assortment that is at all times displayed, and the low and popular prices at which the goods are sold, which are to a great extent direct importations from the manufacturers.

Pitts, Wholesale Groceries and Fruits, 10 Yates street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014There is no more important factor in the commercial and industrial growth and prosperity of a city than the grocery trade, and no more unerring index or test by which to judge of its enterprise. Flourishing, prosperous and well-established grocery firms indicate the existence of qualifications among her citizens which are the surest evidences of progress and development in commercial affairs. The wholesale grocery trade must always occupy a prominent position in the history and statistics of Victoria, as it conduces in no small degree to the mercantile importance of the community. Among those houses whose long connection with the business, whose extended trade transactions, high standing and marked reputation entitles them to prominent mention in a work devoted exclusively to an elaborate and detailed description of the resources of the city, is that of Mr. S. J. Pitts, who established this business in 1870.

This business was established in 1879 by Mr. Rudge, who is a thorough practical stone-cutter, marble-worker and designer, and he enjoys a deservedly large patronage.

For,\nVictoria Carriage Works, William Grimm, Proprietor, 83 Johnson street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014The manufacture of carriages is an industry requiring much skill and experience, and the best proof of the possession of the essential qualifications is the success with which the efforts of those engaged in this industry are rewarded. The manufacture of carriages is a most important industry in Victoria, Mr. Wm. Grimm being its representative. This gentleman commenced business in 1870, having since built up a splendid trade, which is constantly increasing, and that is the best recommendation that can be given of the class of goods turned out, being really of a first-class character, none but skilful and experienced workmen being employed.

Williams & Co., Clothing and Gents' Furnishings, Johnson street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014In detailing the various pursuits which are carried on here, and which together combine to make up Victoria's commercial importance, it would be an error to omit mention of the establishment conducted by Messrs. B. Williams & Co. This business was established in 1881 by Mr. B. Williams, and has been continuously and successfully operated. The premises occupied are large and commodious, well located and adapted for the business. The stock carried by the house is one of the most extensive and diverse nature; everything conceivable in the way of men's, youths' and boys' clothing, gents' furnishings, etc., is here to be found in profusion, and the facilities for offering the best goods to the public are of the highest character.

The heavy business now transacted here was founded by Mr. James Fell, the present proprietor, in 1852, and as one of the oldest in Victoria is worthy of special mention in this historical review. Mr. Fell settled in Victoria some twenty-six years ago, at a date when the city was nothing but a trading post, and the Far West a wilderness. He foresaw, however, a bright future before the place, and no one has done more than he to help build up Victoria as a great centre for trade. His public-spirited, progressive course has met with the esteem and commendation of his fellow-citizens, while his house is today one of the most popular in the city. Mr. Fell handles only the purest and best of every grade, and is a direct importer of the most desirable lines of staple and fancy groceries.

Morley, Brated Waters, Waddington Alley, Victoria, B.C.\u2014This well-known concern has been established in Victoria since 1871, and it is entitled to more than passing notice in a work devoted to the business industries and interests of this city.

Government and Johnson streets, Victoria, B.C.\u2014The publishers and editors of a work of kindred nature to this, have, in the collating and elaborating of the business interests and establishments of a city, with special mission to note their progress and prosperity, unusual facilities\u2014and data for observing the importance of the different styles or classes of business, as to their bearing on the general thrift and development of the mercantile advantages and inducements which those cities claim and hold out to capitalists in quest of investments. Among these we would unquestionably give precedence to the various enterprises connected with iron in its manifold commercial and manufacturing industries. Of these there are none that tend in a greater degree to the extension and enlargement of business and mechanical as well as artistic progress, than the hardware business, or exert more favorable influence in promoting business relations with other provinces and cities. Among the houses devoted to this branch in Victoria, that of E. G. Prior & Co. may be justly regarded as the pioneer. This house was founded in 1858 by A. Fellows; a few years later the style of the firm was Fellows & Prior. The members of the present firm are Messrs. E. G. Prior and G. F. Mathews. They occupy their new building, situated on the corner of Government and Johnson streets, which is a fine brick structure, three stories in height, and basement 100 x 45 feet in dimensions.

He was a member of the local house in 1887 and at the present time is member from this district to the Dominion-House of Parliament. The relation of bare facts in connection with a house of this character, as to its growth and importance, is argument enough, without comment on our part, to direct attention of business men to it, and to the high position held by its proprietors for sterling qualities, entitling them to the respect and confidence of the public.\n\nO.

Langley and Fort streets, Victoria, B.C.\u2014The record of Victoria is one of substantial progress. No city of her age and population can show so many fine buildings nor such elaboration of details and finish in their interiors. While the prime factor in all this is of course the great wealth of our citizens, yet the splendid results achieved are due to the skill, experience, distinguished enterprise and energy of our leading contractors and builders. Prominent among the number is Mr. A. J. Smith, of the firm of Smith & Clark, for over sixteen years past has been actively engaged in business in this city, during that time carrying through to a successful issue many of the most important contracts in his line, bringing to bear, as he does, such a wide range of practical experience, coupled with perfected facilities and appliances.

List of views furnished on application.\n\n**British Columbia Soap Works**, Pendray & Co., Proprietors, Humboldt street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014There are few lines of manufacture in which the excellence of the product is so vital a condition of success as in the soap trade. Consumers are rigid in their requirements as to the quality, and they readily recognize the merits of those concerns where an uniform and superior quality is always obtainable. Among those engaged in this line of industry in this section of the Dominion is the firm of Messrs. Pendray, proprietors of the British Columbia Soap Works, which are located on Humboldt street, Victoria. The business was established twelve years ago and has steadily increased since its inception, and evidences still further success, owing to the superiority of goods manufactured.

Navigation Co.**, John Irving, manager. F. W. Vincent, assistant manager, Wharf street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014To the navigation of the Sound and Coast does the city of Victoria owe its present and past prosperity. By an outlet is secured, by which the lumber and mineral products of British Columbia can be transported by water to all parts of the world. In addition, the amount of capital invested in the different steamship lines and the employment furnished to our citizens, gives this branch of commercial enterprise an importance second to none. Of the different packet lines connecting with other ports, the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company commands special attention. Organized and incorporated in 1883, with Capt. John Irving general manager, the company succeeded in establishing a regular and remunerative trade, giving general satisfaction to the shippers and travelling community, and adding largely to the trade of the city with terminal and intervening points.

This business dates its inception back to the year 1862, since when it has, by the energy, zeal and business abilities of its proprietor, pushed itself into the very first rank of jewellery establishments. Mr. Redfern imports direct from European markets, and is enabled to cater to the most fastidious tastes of the public. The premises utilized by Mr. Redfern are situated on Government street, in the centre of the business portion of the city, and comprise a large and handsomely appointed store. The building is brick, two stories in height, and 49 x 75 feet in dimensions. He carries a large variety of elegant jewellery, plates, diamonds and all kinds of fancy articles, in the most chaste designs and beautifully finished, a specialty being made of both gold and silver watches, a varied assortment being kept constantly on hand, and all tastes as regards makes and prices can be suited. Mr. Redfern has taken an active part in the development of the city's interests, being elected city councillor in 1877-78, and mayor of Victoria in 1883. We, therefore, have no hesitation in saying that he is deserving of all the patronage he already enjoys, and of still greater success in the future. Mr. Redfern carries on an extensive business in manufacturing jewellery, employing three skilled workmen. The workshop is supplied with all the latest and most improved machinery necessary for the business.\n\n**John Weller**, Furniture Manufacturer, and Importer and Dealer in Crockery, Glassware, Carpets, etc. Furniture Factory on Humboldt street; Showrooms, cor. Broad and Fort Streets, Victoria, B.C.\u2014The history of this city presents to the gatherer of statistics, facts of an unusual interest. Her facilities for transportation by water and rail, her accessibility from the coast and inland towns, places her in a position not only to successfully compete with the larger western cities, but in some specialties to largely control the trade. The development of the furniture trade in its various branches has given constant employment to thousands of laborers and skilled mechanics, and listed in active service as much executive and financial ability as any branch of business in which human energy and enterprise have been employed. Among the most distinguished establishments in this connection, whose works have assumed such an extent as to exert a powerful, if not vital influence upon the prosperity and development of the city, Mr. John Weller may be said to occupy a leading position, not only for the magnitude and range of his operations, but also for the quality of his products. This business was established in 1862 by the present proprietor. By thorough management and a perfect knowledge of the trade and its requirements, the business has gradually enlarged, until it is now one of the representative concerns of British Columbia. The factory is located on Humbolt Street, and is a three-story and basement building 90 x 40 feet in dimensions. The motive power is furnished by a 30 horse power engine. The factory gives\nPALATIAL RESIDENCE OF HON. ROBT. DUNSMUIR, VICTORIA.\nTHE FIRST STEAMSHIP ON THE PACIFIC OCEAN, NOW PLYING ON THE BRITISH COLUMBIA COAST, AND OWNED BY MR. HENRY SAUNDERS, OF VICTORIA.\nconstant employment to twenty employees. The sales-room and furnishing departments are situated on the corner of Broad and Fort Streets; the lower floor is 30 x 80 feet, which is exclusively for Crockerery, Glassware, Platedware, Wall Paper and Shelf Goods in general, while the upper floor is 86 x 94 feet, and is used for Furniture, Carpet and Stock Rooms, also a new three-story brick building which extends through to Broughton Street, facing on Broad Street, making this the largest showroom in the city. Fifteen employees are required in the different departments of this establishment. The factory is fully equipped with the most approved machinery and labor-saving appliances known to the trade. Mr. Weiler's is a public-spirited gentleman and an energetic business man, a highly respected and honored citizen, and under his able and judicious management, this concern has become celebrated, and his establishment is one of the most perfect and complete of its kind in the country; and as a desirable house with which to establish agreeable, profitable and permanent business relations, it has no superior.\n\nRedgrave & Ella, Confectionery Manufacturers, 30 Fort Street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014Until comparatively recent years, nearly all the finer and most toothsome articles of confectionery were imported from Europe. Within the past twenty years, however, great progress has been made in this direction in Canada and United States, and the home products in confections now equal, if they do not excel, the imported goods. Among the best known and extensive establishments in this line, in or around Victoria, is the highly successful concern of Messrs. Redgrave & Ella, Manufacturing Confectioners, situated on Fort Street. The goods here made maintain the highest reputation in the trade for their superior quality, purity and flavor, and though they are produced in the most artistic designs, there is in these delicious and absolutely healthy morsels, an entire absence of the poisonous elements too frequently to be found. This business was established in 1869, by Henry Waller. Messrs. S Redgrave and F.W. Ella, the present proprietors, took the business in 1877; and, by the excellence of the goods produced, the ability, enterprise and judgment displayed in the management, it has steadily increased and extended, until to-day, few, if any, houses in the trade enjoy a larger measure of success. Altogether, this is one of the largest, best equipped and most ably conducted establishments of the kind to be found here or elsewhere.\n\nBritish Columbia Land and Investment Agency, Limited, 49 Government street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014Among the oldest, best known and most popular firms engaged in this line in the city may be named that of the proprietors of the above named business, than whom none in Victoria have been more fortunate in establishing and maintaining a high reputation for their upright and honorable dealing, and than whom few enjoy a larger measure of public favor well deserved. This business was established about 1858, and is one of Victoria's pioneer agencies. They transact a general real estate business, buy and sell real estate and real estate securities, negotiate loans, effect transfers, pay taxes for non-residents, take charge of and manage estates, etc., in short, everything pertaining to real estate and kindred branches of business. The close attention devoted to the interests of all persons entrusting business to their charge, their strict integrity and honorable methods, and the uniform satisfaction rendered to their patrons, have enabled this firm to build up the large and prosperous patronage they now enjoy, and to number among their clientele many of our wealthy and leading citizens. Their real estate and mining transactions cover the whole of British Columbia. They do a general insurance business, being agents for the two following well known companies: North British Fire Insurance Company and the North American Accident Insurance Company. We take pleasure in recommending this old established and well known firm to the public.\n\nWilliam Wilson, City House, Staple and Fancy Dry Goods, Government street, Victoria, B.C.\u2014The large, handsome and splendidly stocked establishment of Mr. W. Wilson is located on Government street, in the centre of the business portion of the city, and is recognized as one of the most prominent dry goods houses in Victoria. This business was established by Mr. Wilson in 1861, being one of our pioneer merchants. The store is filled from end to end with large, varied and attractive lines of goods as any one could desire, and the stock is kept supplied with frequent invoices of all the latest novelties and newest patterns. Advocating the motto, that \"the best things are the cheapest,\" first-class goods only are kept by this firm, no cheap trash being imported for delusive advertising purposes. The beautiful manner in which the goods are displayed, the perfect neatness in which everything in the establishment is kept, not a speck of dust allowed to accumulate anywhere, as is too frequently the case in many establishments, speaks volumes for the good taste and the high appreciation of the advantages to be derived from an attractive and pleasant place in which to greet customers of Mr. William Wilson, the popular proprietor, who takes much pride in this as well as all other features of the business. The stock of dry goods, silks, mantles, dress stuffs, notions, etc., just received by this house, is one of the largest in the city, and offers to patrons a great variety of styles and designs. He has on hand an especially fine assortment of dress goods, particularly the better class, in every style and shade. No house in the same line of business stands higher than that of Mr. W. Wilson, for its trade and the uniformly excellent quality of the goods in which he deals. The premises occupied are spacious and elegantly fitted up, centrally and prominently located, every convenience and facility is afforded buyers, who, by the extent of the annual trade, freely attest the esteem in which this house is held.\n\nQueen's Market, Lawrence Goodacre, Proprietor, cor. Government and Johnson streets, Victoria, B.C.\u2014One of the most prominent and well-known butchers and cattle dealers in the city is Mr. Lawrence Goodacre, whose name is familiar to most residents of Victoria. He is one of our pioneer business men, having established his present business in 1852. Of the business so successfully conducted by Mr. Goodacre, it is unnecessary to speak at any length in this connection, as his establishment has long been noted as one of the leading meat markets in the city, famous for the quality of meat which is always to be found here. Mr. Goodacre, who is a thorough judge of cattle, buys none but the very best obtainable, and as a result of this policy, his trade has steadily increased. His premises are located at the corner of Government and Johnson streets, where he has every facility for conducting his large business. All orders receive prompt attention. Patrons of this establishment will find all their wants satisfactorily attended to, and will be supplied with goods no other similar establishment can surpass, and that, too, at most reasonable rates. Mr. Goodacre is\ncontractor, by appointment, to Her Majesty's Royal Navy and the Dominion Government, etc. Supplies shipped at lowest rates.\n\nCITY FATHER\u2014Your Honor, shall we allow this grasping monopoly and extortion of some of our merchants when it is so easy to get relief? NEVER!! Let us boycott the gang with the exception of the fair and just firm of\u2014\n\nArgyle House, Wm. O'Reilly, Manager, 83 Douglas street, near Clarence Hotel, Victoria, B.C.\u2014The \"Argyle House,\" as the establishment of which Mr. O'Reilly is manager is called, has a wide reputation in this district, and caters to the wants of a large circle of customers. Its business is of a thoroughly comprehensive nature, and includes dry goods, notions, gent's furnishings, etc. This establishment was founded in 1866 by the present firm, who have since then carried on a progressive and steadily increasing business in the various departments to which their operations are confined. They import large quantities of staple and fancy dry goods. The large variety of articles embraced in this stock is such as directly relates to the general wants of a community, and comprise what are usually to be found in a first-class establishment of this kind. The premises are located on Douglas street, and comprise a large and beautiful store fitted up and arranged in an admirable manner. Mr. O'Reilly has ever closely identified himself with the interests and progress of the city of his adoption, and is personally esteemed for his sterling integrity and honorable dealings.\n\nThe Victoria \"Times.\"\u2014The Victoria Times (daily and weekly editions) stands at the head of the press of the province, and in point of enterprise and the influence it possesses, it has no superior. The success it has met with since its establishment in 1884 is attributable to its excellence as a newspaper, and to its advocacy of liberalism, quite as much as to the fact that there was a gap in the field of evening journalism that it has been the aim of the management to fill to the satisfaction of the public. The weekly edition circulates everywhere in the province, and boasts, evidently with good reason, of having more readers than any other two papers combined. The Daily Times has a circulation equal to, if not larger than, any of its competitors. It is a live paper\u2014bright, sparkling and newy, and deserves the liberal encouragement that it receives. The proprietors are the TIMES PRINTING AND PUBLISHING COMPANY, and the editorial and business management are in the hands of Mr. William Templeman (Manager), and Mr. J. E. McLagan, both journalists of many years' experience in Ontario. As there is in the East much enquiry about British Columbia, its resources, etc., we can suggest no more reliable means of satisfying the demand than a liberal circulation of this journal among those who are now turning their eyes with longing gaze in the direction of the setting sun.\n\nThe Colonist, was established in 1858, making its first appearance on the 11th of December, of that year. During the twenty-nine years of its existence, it has experienced all the ups and downs incident to a paper published in the west, in pioneer days, but it has always been looked upon as the leading journal of the province. In the palmy days of the Cariboo gold excitement the circulation increased to such an extent that the then publishers were enabled to issue a four sheet paper 28 x 42, but previous to that time, it had been issued in a form half that size. To show the difficulties under which papers were published in B. C., in early days, it may be stated that the supply of newspaper in Victoria having run out, the Colonist for several days was printed on common brown wrapping paper, until a fresh supply of \"print\" reached the then isolated town. With the growth of Victoria, the Colonist has steadily kept pace, and although circulating largely through all parts of British Columbia, it is looked upon as the chief exponent of the commercial supremacy of the capital city. On the 15th of October, 1886, the paper, including the extensive lithoargh and job printing office, passed over to the present proprietors, Messrs. W. H. Ellis, A. G. Sargeant and W. R. Higgins. In connection with the establishment is a fully equipped label printing and glazing department, where nearly all of the millions of salmon labels annually used in the salmon canning industry of the province are printed.\n\nThe British Columbia Blank Book Manufactory, R. T. Williams proprietor, 28 Broad Street, was established in 1882, employs nine persons, the buildings and machinery costing $14,000. Blank books of all classes are manufactured, nearly all the various blank books used by the contractors while building the western Division of C. P. R. were made at this factory. In connection with this establishment is a Rubber Stamp manufactory. The British Columbia directory and the B. C. hotel registers are also published here. The directory is a work of about 400 pages, and has proven of value to the business people generally, throughout the province. The registers are to be found in nearly every hotel from Victoria to the tops of the Rockies. This business, like many others that will be established in the near future in British Columbia, shows the capabilities of this western province, and the possibilities of establishing numerous manufactories within the borders of British Columbia.\nNANAIMO.\n\nThe original owners of the town site were Indians who sold it to the Hudson's Bay Co. in 1852, when a trading post and mining village was started. The Company retained possession for ten years, when they in turn sold it to the Vancouver Coal Mining & Land Co., which also required an extensive tract of land in the immediate vicinity. The city fronts on a well-sheltered harbor, and is the centre of the coal mining industry of the Island. Since its incorporation in 1874, the city has made continued progress, and now boasts of a population of over 4,000. The completion of the railway to Victoria has given a fresh impetus to the trade of Nanaimo, and greatly established confidence in its future as one of the most important manufacturing and distributing centres of the Province. The evidence of this is found in the recent establishment of gas works and water works in active operation, with extensive mains, street lamps and hydrants throughout the city, the erection of fine brick buildings for stores and hotel purposes; the commencement of manufacturing industries and the extension of some of these already in existence. The principal staple industry of Nanaimo is the production of coal. The colliery works of the Vancouver Coal Mining and Land Company, Limited, and their several exploratory diamond borings and pit sinkings in Nanaimo and its vicinity, and upon Gabriela Island, where the drill is already down about 1,000 feet, and will probably pierce and prove the strata of the coal to the depth of 2,000 feet at least, are being carried on by the Company without cessation. It was at one of these pits that a dreadful catastrophe which launched 149 souls into eternity occurred, the frightful catastrophe attracting the attention and exciting the horror of the whole world. The city includes the celebrated Newcastle townsite.\n\nClosely linked with Nanaimo is the town and mining district of Wellington, whose extensive collieries are energetically worked by the proprietors, who entirely own the town, which has a population of 1,000.\n\nThere are a number of other thriving towns and settlements in the Province deserving of extended notice, but which the limits of these pages prevent. Amongst these are Harrison Hot Springs,\u2014St. Alice's-well\u2014whose waters possess wonderful healing properties. This is becoming the great health resort of the Coast, and with the excellent hotel accommodation, the charming surroundings, and the capital fishing and shooting, is increasingly attracting visitors. Then there are Savona's Ferry, Lytton, Nicola, Donald, Quesnelle, Kootenay, Ashcroft, Spence's Bridge, Hope, Moodyville, Port Moody, etc., etc.\n\nIn closing these sketches, the writer wishes to freely acknowledge the free use he has made of\u2014and give credit for\u2014the valuable information obtained from the books of Mr. Macnie and Commander Mayne, of British Columbia; from the papers of Mr. C. N. Bell and the late Mr. Leggo, of Manitoba; and from the columns of that valuable magazine, the West Shore, the Victoria Colonist, Portland Oregonian and St. Paul Pioneer-Press; and others.\nTHE GREAT NATIONAL LINK.\n\nTraversing the entire breadth of the Continent\u2014from tide water to tide water 3,000 miles apart\u2014the Canadian Pacific Railway is not only the connecting link between the Provinces of the Dominion, but the great highway over which passes the traffic of three continents. For a young nation like Canada to even attempt a work of such colossal magnitude was, at its inception, deemed by many to be an herculean task, the accomplishment of which, if at all possible, would impose such a heavy burden on the financial resources of the country that national ruin would be the inevitable and direful result. But the history of the attempt to obtain a Canadian transcontinental route reveals an amount of enterprising spirit and vigorous intention more than creditable to the Canadian people. The world was indeed startled when seventeen years ago, Canada undertook the huge work of emulating the great nation to the south, which a few years previously has spanned the continent amidst the applause of civilization. For four millions of people to do that which had severely taxed fifty millions to accomplish, was a gigantic undertaking, and the very boldness of the scheme engendered a feeling of incredulity which only was dispelled by the inexorable logic of actual facts. This great national work was first assumed by the Federal Government, but in 1881 its construction was given to a syndicate of capitalists, and by their untiring energy, unceasing efforts, indomitable perseverance and boundless faith in the undertaking, the success of the great work was completely assured. Ten years were specified for the completion of the railway; in five years\u2014and five years ahead of the contract time\u2014the road was completed from ocean to ocean, and the first regular train crossed the continent reaching the western terminus punctually on time. The marvellously rapid construction of the road was one of the greatest achievements of the age, and effectually redeemed Canada from the uncomplimentary epithet of being \"slow,\" demonstrating that Canadians had all the pluck, enterprise and energy of their go-ahead cousins across the line. The construction of a line of railway 3,000 miles in length, through a country largely unsettled, was no small undertaking. The engineering difficulties were appalling, but they were overcome. The granite hills of the East and the fastnesses of the Rockies were pierced, and river, lagoon, coulee, morass, rocky defile and broad stretching prairie were crossed and covered with an iron trail, over which daily careers the iron horse with its long train of heavy laden coaches. Although the youngest of the several transcontinental railways, the Canadian Pacific is the leading one owing to the many advantages it possesses over its rivals. It is the shortest line across the continent, the best constructed, the finest equipped, has the most elegant and comfortable dining and sleeping cars, the cheapest rates, and it passes through a succession of scenery of forest, prairie and mountain that is unrivalled. Travellers credit it with being the best managed railway corporation in the world, and the many eminent personages who have had occasion to travel on it speak in the highest terms of the service, while the immigrants, in the colonist coaches provided, find that what was once deemed a fatiguing journey is now a pleasant jaunt.\n\nBut the great work of the Canadian Pacific is not finished in being merely a transcontinental route; the management aspire to make it the world's highway. A line of steamships has been established which cross the wide Pacific where the West becomes East again, and bring back the trade of the Orient, will pour over this route in increasing volume year by year as its superior advantages are recognized.\nIn a not less important measure\u2014to Canada\u2014are the operations of the branches of this mammoth enterprise which grid-iron Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, and have developed the struggling industries and resources of the country.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific is undoubtedly the greatest of existing railway corporations. It has a total mileage of about 5,000 miles. The main line from Quebec to Vancouver is 3,078 miles in length. The Toronto branch is 349 miles, Brockville and Ottawa, 75 miles, Owen Sound branch 122 miles; Teeswater branch 73 miles; Pembina Branch 202 miles, South Western Manitoba Branch 195 miles; Emerson Branch 65 miles; besides a number of minor branches. It employs a vast army of men\u2014over 10,000\u2014and throughout the Dominion it is estimated that there are over 100,000 persons directly dependent upon it. The entire control of the enterprise is vested in Mr. W. C. Van Horne, who recently succeeded Sir George Stephen in the presidency, but who, as well as filling that important office, performs the arduous duties of general manager, a position he has occupied almost since the very organization of the Company. An experienced railway man, Mr. Van Horne's administration of affairs has been most successful and satisfactory to the directors, whose endorsement of his policy is demonstrated in his elevation to the highest office in their gift. With Sir George's and Sir Donald Smith's names, that of Mr. Van Horne will be inseparably connected with the growth and expansion and success of the largest and most prosperous railway corporation of the age. The men who accomplished this great work so successfully, deserve to have their names inscribed amongst the distinguished personages of the day, and already two have received the order of knighthood from Her Majesty the Queen, and with the others, have participated in the emoluments which their success has earned for them. The general officers of the road are: President and General Manager, Mr. W. C. Van Horne; Secretary, Mr. Charles Drinkwater; Assistant General Manager, Mr. T. G. Shaughnessy; Hon. Geo. M. Clark, General Counsel; Mr. Geo. Olds, General traffic manager; Mr. Lucius Tuttle, Passenger traffic manager; Mr. Robert Kerr, General freight passenger agent Western and Pacific divisions; Mr. Henry Beatty, Manager steamboat lines and lake traffic; Mr. D. G. Ogden, Comptroller; Mr. W. Sutherland Taylor, Treasurer; Mr. T. A. MacKinnon, General Superintendent Ontario and Atlantic divisions; Mr. G. W. Spencer, General Superintendent Eastern division; Mr. W. Whyte, General Superintendent Western division; Mr. Henry Abbott, General Superintendent Pacific division; Mr. L. A. Hamilton, land commissioner; Mr. D. McNicoll, General passenger agent; Eastern and Ontario and Atlantic division; Mr. G. M. Bosworth, assistant freight traffic manager Eastern and Ontario division; Mr. J. N. Sutherland, General freight agent, Ontario division; Mr. J. A. Sheffield, Superintendent dining and sleeping cars.\n\nIt can be truthfully said that the Canadian Pacific has been of incalculable benefit to Canada. Revolutionizing the traffic of half the world, it has developed an unknown country, assisted in settling the wide plains of the West, created prosperous towns and villages, promoted the welfare of large cities; and it has brought the Great West of the Confederacy closer to the Mother Country across the Sea.\nGENERAL OFFICERS CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY.\n\nHEAD OFFICES: MONTREAL, CANADA:\n\nW.

A new Drawing Room has been added, facing on St. James Street, the fashionable boulevard for driving and promenading of the elite of the City; a boon the lady patronesses of the Hall will readily admit. The decorations of this room are in Lincustra-Walton in Gold colors, and the woodwork of Cherry. A rich new Turkish Carpet adorns the floor, and the upholstered furniture is luxurious, and cannot be surpassed in the City. Several suites of new Bed Rooms adjoin the new Drawing Room, with Bath and Water Closets attached, of the very latest improvements.\n\nThe large Dining Room has been lengthened over 20 feet, and has now a seating capacity for 400 guests. Seven new elegant Mirrors have been added, also a large Ventilator, which makes the Room effectually cool. This Room has also been under the Artists' hands; the walls being handsomely decorated in Oil Colors of varying hues, with Lincustra-Walton dadoes; and it stands to-day second to no dining room in the Dominion.\n\nThe whole House has been thoroughly renovated, painted and decorated. A new and elegant Passenger Elevator has also been added, and the Halls and Public Rooms are lighted by Electric and incandescent lights, making it the most attractively lighted Hotel in the Dominion.\n\nMr. Hogan, the genial proprietor, is still to the fore, and gives his personal supervision to all departments of the House, thus securing for his guests every attention required.\n\nHotel Coaches are in attendance on arrival of all Trains and Steamers.\nAll Baggage Checks should be given to the Porter in Attendance.\nDelicious Coffee\nIN A MOMENT\nBY USING\nLYMAN'S\nFLUID COFFEE\n\nECONOMICAL,\nWHOLESOME,\nFine FLAVOURED\nCAN BE USED ANYWHERE AND IN ANY QUANTITY.\n\nFor sale by Grocers and Druggists in 1 lb.,\n\u00bc lb. and \u00bd lb. bottles.\n\nWHOLESALE BY\nLYMAN, SONS & CO.,\nMONTREAL.\n\nYou can have\nCIBIL'S\nDELICIOUS, NOURISHING SOUP\nFLUID BEEF,\nThe Best for Beef Tea.\n\nTHE ONLY EXTRACT OF BEEF SUITABLE FOR\nMAKING JULIEN AND OTHER CLEAR SOUPS.\nA FINE RICH FLAVOURED SOUP CAN BE MADE IN\nA MOMENT BY ADDING BOILING WATER.\n\nLYMAN, SONS & CO.,\nSOLE AGENTS FOR CANADA.\n\nJAMES LESLIE,\n\u2014 MANUFACTURER OF \u2014\nENGLISH OAK-TANNED\nLeather Belting,\nLace * Leather, * &c.,\nCard Clothing, Loom Reeds,\nCotton and Woollen Mill Supplies;\n\nJUNCTION OF\nCraig and St. Antoine Streets,\nMONTREAL.\n\nP.O.
