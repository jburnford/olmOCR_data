Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nBox 787,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen Mr. Bell, the sub-agent at Denare Beach, passed through here this summer on his return from Prince Albert, he carried a strict warning from your part that we should not hire Shieff (Aviation) Ltd., of Channing, Man. to carry the children from Brochet or South End as we had been doing in previous years.\n\nThe reason of this, if I understand well, is that Shieff Ltd. does not carry passenger-insurance and, did any accident occur, all responsibility and financial consequences which might be heavy would fall back on our own shoulders.\n\nIn consequence of this decision, we have hired Central Northern Airways, with the result that we are charged $354.00 a trip to Brochet instead of the $165.00 we were charged by Shieff.\n\nIn view of this heavy burden, which the Guy School is carrying alone, since we have received no special grant from Ottawa this last year for the plane transportation of 1949, I respectfully ask you if you would not agree of our going back to the old system of hiring Shieff Ltd. If you think it preferable, we could ask every Indian sending his child via Shieff Ltd. to stand responsible himself for any consequences. The Indians from Brochet or South End often fly with Shieff and think nothing of it. Furthermore I am told by the Father from Brochet last week that Shieff now has insurance for four adult passengers, which ought to stand for eight children.\n\nWe shall be glad to have your views on this matter soon, since we are already looking for planes, school opening at Sturgeon Landing on August the 15th.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) Rev. L. Poirier,\nO.M.I.\nBox 787,\nPrince Albert, Sask.,\nAugust 2nd, 1950.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nPost Office Building, REGINA, Saskatchewan.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter from the Rev. L.\nPoirier of the Bishop's House, The Pas, Manitoba, which will be\nfound self-explanatory.\n\nI am at a loss to understand why the Department has not reimbursed\nthe Guy School at least in part in connection with their transportation\nproblems. You are aware that both the Lac la Ronge and St. Alban's\nSchool have received a special grant for this purpose. I am of the\nopinion the proper procedure in this case is through the channels of\nyour office.\n\nE.S. Jones,\nSuperintendent,\nCarlton Indian Agency,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration.\n\nESJ/jw\nRegina, June 14th, 1950.\n\nTO ALL INDIAN SUPERINTENDENTS\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Department that in one or more cases an unlicensed pilot has been hired to convey Indian children to and from Residential Schools.\n\nThis must not be done. You will instruct the Principals of Residential Schools that in future no Indian children travelling to or from the schools, at the expense of the schools or the Department, will be allowed to fly in an unlicensed aircraft or with an unlicensed pilot.\n\nJ.P.B Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 9th of June, 1950, File 763-10(E1), regarding air transportation of Indian children to and from the Beauval Indian Residential School, I have to say that on May 29th, 1950, Dr. W.J. Wood, Regional Superintendent, Indian Health Services, Winnipeg, wrote me to the effect that Indian children from the Guy School were not to be returned to their homes by unlicensed plane operated by Mr. Shieff, of Brochet. On the date that the letter referred to was received instructions were issued to Indian Superintendent Jones, by telephone, that such air transport was not to be used for Indian children, and to so advise the Principal of the Guy School. Subsequently, on June 14th, 1950, a circular letter was sent to all the Indian Superintendents of this province with regard to air transportation of school pupils, and I am enclosing a copy of the same herewith.\n\nI have now received a letter from Indian Superintendent E.S. Jones, of the Carlton Agency, with which he encloses copy of a letter he has received from Reverend L. Poirier, protesting against the high cost of air transportation when using a licensed plane.\n\nIt will also be noted that Indian Superintendent Jones is questioning the reason why the Department has not reimbursed the Guy School, at least in part, in connection with their transportation problems in view of the fact that similar assistance has been given at the Lac la Ronge School and St. Alban's School, in the Carlton Agency.\n\nMay the matter be carefully considered and instructions issued with regard to the matter under consideration.\n\nEnclosed is a copy of Mr. Jones' letter above referred to, and Father Poirier's letter addressed to him.\n\nJ.P.B.

The father states that Nancy Head, age 16 years, No. 234, Cumberland House Band, at my suggestion, has returned to the Guy Indian Residential School, and that she is taking Grade IX at the Provincial Government Day School recently opened at that point. Nancy has proved a good student in the past. May I request the same privilege be afforded this pupil and the Guy School as extended to pupils residing at the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School attending the Collegiate in Prince Albert, namely the sum of $7.50 be paid each month to the Guy School for the pupil's board together with the cost of text-books, etc.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nOctober 20th, 1950.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nP.O. Box 68,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nRe: Guy Indian Residential School\nYour File 1498-107/25-2-655\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, it is noted that Nancy Head, a pupil of the Guy Residential School, is attending Grade 9 at the Provincial Government School.\n\nThe Department will continue to allow the per capita grant for her at the Guy School, and in addition an amount of $7.50 a month for the extra expense in attending the Provincial School, including the cost of textbooks, will be allowed.\n\nA special Voucher at the rate of $7.50 a month should be forwarded either monthly or quarterly for this special payment. Her name should be continued on the Quarterly Return of the Guy School and per capita allowance will be paid for her.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship & Immigration, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Father Giard, Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School which reads in part, \"I want to recall a point about the transportation of the children. The last cheque of $2,000.00 is a payment for summer 1949; so far nothing has been paid already for summer 1950. As I am was telling me, this last summer 1950 we paid $4,349.23 for transportation of the children and I hope the Department will pay this amount.\"\n\nIn view of the fact that the children of this school all come from isolated sources thereby making the cost of transportation very high, it is presumed the Father is requesting a larger grant for this next year.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nNovember 21, 1950.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nPrince Albert, Sask.,\n\nYour file 1669-107/27-8\n\nI have your letter of November 14th in connection with expenses for the transportation of children to the Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease ask the Principal, Father Giard to provide you with a statement of expenditures in this respect and forward it to this office with your recommendation.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nBox 68,\nPrince Albert, Sask.,\nNovember 15, 1950.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFurther to our letter dated October 13th, 1950, file No. 1514-107/23-5-655, I am enclosing herewith a quarterly return for four children submitted by Rev. Father Giard, Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School, as at October 31st, 1950.\n\nAlso please find enclosed Admission & discharge of Pupils for July - September.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nMr. Philip Thomas,\nChief, Education Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRecently, we have received the June-September Earnings for our Guy Indian Residential School in the amount of $11,742.00\n\nMay I respectfully submit that this amount of $11,742. represents the average attendance for our school of 164.8 pupils while our \"Quarterly Return\" for the same period showed an average of 168.68 pupils.\n\nAs we do not know where would be our error, we would appreciate if you could advise us about the difference of the two averages.\n\nWith sincere thanks in advance,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Antonio Giard, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nDecember 12, 1950.\n\nRev. A. Giard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nGuy Indian Res. School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.,\n\nDear Father Giard:\n\nI have your letter dated December 7th in connection with a discrepancy on the September Quarterly Return for the Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nI fail to see where you secure your average figure of 168.68 pupils, as your copy of the Return shows 162.37 and our figures are 164.80, an increase of 2.43 pupils. This increase was arrived at by increasing your grant to certain pupils who were truant during the Quarter but were in residence during the June Quarter. You claimed 46 days. We paid at 62 days. The pupils involved were pupils 229, 231, 235, 260, 263, 266, 301, 320, 325, 0209, 0227, 0274, 0297 and 0305.\n\nI hope this information will suffice.\n\nAttached is a supplementary Return received, on which no action can be taken at this time as the September Return has been paid. It is suggested that the pupils shown on it be included on the December Return with a note showing the grant for them was not claimed on the September Return.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

They were received in this office October 12, 1951.\n\nIt has been the practice of these Northern Residential Schools to wait till the pupils are brought into the school from isolated reserves and then have the doctor examine, making application for their admission when they have already entered school. I would like to point out that pupils entering Prince Albert Residential School have been handled very much the same way. Just before the child gets on the train for the school, applications are received for admission. I brought this matter to the attention of the escort representing this school, who was in The Pas to take the children to Prince Albert. I told him I would forward the applications to Ottawa, but if they were not accepted they would have to pay the child's return fare.\n\nPlease advise what action will be taken on this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. Law,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Application forms for the following children, who are now in the Sturgeon Landing Residential School:\n\nEsther Adam, No. 70 Lac La Hache Band\nTherese Marie Veuillot, No. 119 Barren Lands Band\nEdna Moose, No. 216 Nelson House Band\nMarie Aline Colomb, Mathias Colomb Band\nPelagie Hart, Mathias Colomb Band\nLouise Sinclair, Mathias Colomb Band\nAdelaide Michell, No. 82 Barrrens Lands Band\nMarie Julienne Bighetty, Mathias Colomb Band\nCecilia Denechezhe, No. 109 Barren Lands Band\nSarazine St-Pierre, No. 95 Barren Lands Band\nMarie Annie Tssessaze, No. 108 Barren Lands Band\nOvide Denechezhe, No. 109 Barren Lands Band\nMartin Veuillot, No. 119 Barren Lands Band\nMarcel Tssessaze, No. 108 Barren Lands Band\nPierre Joseph Tssessaze, No. 118 Barren Lands Band\nJean Tssessaze, No. 118 Barren Lands Band\nAbraham Samuel, No. 124 Barren Lands Band\nIsaac Michell, No. 82 Barren Lands Band\nJean Baptiste Benaoni, No. 105 Lac la Hache Band\nJean Gazandlare, No. Stony Rapid Band\nRodolphe Gazayoue, No. 41 Lac La Hache Band.\n\nMr. Law took this matter up with me, as these children were just picked up and put in the school and the applications submitted sometime after. I advised him to forward the applications and he need not sign them, as these children were already in school without his permission,\n\n(over)\nor without consulting him.\n\nI would recommend that in this case these applications be accepted. However, schools should be notified that in future they are not to recruit or take children in without first consulting the Superintendent concerned, and having the applications approved by the Department.

Jones,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nPrince Albert, Sask.,\n\nWith reference to the September Quarterly Return for the Guy Indian Residential School, it would be appreciated if you would bring the following remarks to Father A. Giard's attention:\n\n1. It is noted that on the Return is claimed forty-seven days for pupils who did not return to school during the month of September. The practice has been to allow sixty-two days covering grant for July and August for these pupils. We have consequently increased the grant to sixty-two days in all cases.\n\n2. Father Giard has claimed sixty-one days for pupils 269, 0281 and 0330 indicating in the \"Remarks\" column that the pupils were sent to sanatorium and indicating that each had attended classes during the month of September. As these pupils were shown to have attended school during the June Quarter and were in residence during the month of September full grant of ninety-two days is allowed. The figure ninety-two days is arrived at as follows:\n\n(a) The school is entitled to sixty-two days for July and August\n\n(b) As the pupil was in residence during the month of September, the school is entitled to thirty days hospitalization grant\n3. Pupils 320, 0289, 0323 and 0341 were not in residence during the June Quarter consequently no grant can be allowed for them for the months of July and August. However, the school is entitled to thirty days grant for the month of September. We have adjusted the September Return accordingly.\n\nThis information should be given to the Principal in order that she can bear it in mind when preparing future Returns.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nExtract from letter of Mr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\ndated December 28, 1951.\n\nRe: Guy Residential School\n\nI would also refer to Father Giard's remarks\nthat the allowance of $2,000.00 which the Department makes\nto him toward the transportation of the school children\nby plane is about $3,000.00 short of the actual cost to the school.\nIs it possible to increase this allowance?\nJanuary 28, 1952.\n\nMr. J.F.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: Guy Indian Residential School\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of the 28th ultimo in which you mention the allowance for transportation of pupils.\n\nThe funds at our disposal will not permit us to increase the sum which we allow. As a matter of fact, it is fair to presume that the expenses would not be so heavy if the management did not recruit so many children, and as stated in a previous part of your letter, their action in this regard is overcrowding the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nBrochet, August 15, 1947\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child ...............................................................\nEnglish name ...............................................................\nAge ...............................................................\nName of Band ...............................................................\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid ...............................................................\nFather's full name and No. ...............................................................\nMother's full name and No. ...............................................................\nParents living or dead ...............................................................\nState of child's health ...............................................................\nReligion ...............................................................\nDoes applicant speak English? ...............................................................\nPreviously attended ...............................................................\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

Deputy and Secretary.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR HAMILTON,\nDATED OCTOBER 24th, 1928, ON HIS INSPECTION\nOF THE GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n---\n\nOriginal on #132-7-5.\n\nFive cows are kept at the school, but they were in poor condition and, in fact, appeared to be a poor dairy type. Hay is hard to get as the country is all bush and swamp. The Principal claimed he had 60 loads, but in order to get it he was obliged to go a distance of nearly 20 miles. It is impossible for the cows to provide milk sufficient for 105 children, as well as a staff of 12 or 14. If more cows cannot be kept, the milk supply could be supplemented by powdered milk. I believe milk added to the children's diet would be of great benefit.\n\n---\nI would particularly draw your attention to what the Inspector says regarding the type of cows that are kept at this school, and also the small number that are kept. This, to my mind, is a very important matter. Indians are subject to tuberculosis and unless they get proper and nourishing food, milk in particular, they will fail. As a matter of fact, under the best conditions, they cannot stand confinement as well as white children, so the Department should insist on the proper number of cows being kept at this school. Of course, if there is no way of producing feed for these cows it is another matter, but I have no doubt there is a means of supplying the necessary feed or the Department would never have built a school at this point. These children will be undernourished unless they get milk, especially where fish forms a large part of the diet.\nDear Dr Moore:\n\nHave today returned from Guy School, at Sturgeon Landing. I accompanied Dr Ridge and his technician. All pupils and Staff were X Rayed in record time, as we did not arrive there until after four yesterday afternoon, and were back to The Pas at 10.30 this morning, no time was wasted.\n\nAs this school can be definitely classified as in the over crowded class, the question of the health of the children has been giving me some concern. However, these fears appear to be groundless, as there has been less sickness this season, than any year since my association with the school. I, however, discovered nine new cases of enlarged neck glands, since my last visit. It would seem, as if the bovine population of the school should be checked for TB. They have seven cows milking at present, and these with the young cattle make up a herd of twenty. To date, I have found comparatively few enlarged glands amongst these children. I think, that these cattle should be tuberculin tested in the not too distant future. The necessity for it, and having it done is a different matter. I could do it myself, but my plans do not call for a visit there again until next September. It requires at least a twenty-four forty-eight hour stay. I do not think, that another school year should begin, without this matter being cleared up. This would be the case, if nothing is done before next fall.\n\nI discussed the question with Father Poirier, who is willing and anxious to co-operate. The matter will again be mentioned in my February report, but as that will not reach you for another month, I decided to report at once. Would hate to see it drag along, like Red Earth, as nothing has yet been done there, although the question was raised in 1942.\n\nYours trul$,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Regarding the death of these pupils, it is necessary that a memorandum of enquiry into the cause and circumstances of the death of each be forwarded, on the proper form for that purpose. You were instructed some time ago that, in the case of the death of a pupil, these forms should be completed and filled in. Full instructions are given on the form, two copies of which are enclosed. In future, I would request that you will see that these forms are promptly completed in the case of the death of a pupil and that they are forwarded to the Department. A supply of these forms was sent you some time ago, but, should you require a further number, please requisition for same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nS. Levell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter 132-7-10, dated the 19th instant, regarding form No. 414 and the deaths of 106 Jesiah Constant and 0133 Bibian Bighetty at the Guy Indian Residential School. These forms will be completed and returned to you as soon as possible.\n\nI did not however get a supply of these forms or any instructions in connection with them. Inspector Hamilton was here a few days ago and asked me if I had received them.\n\nI would be glad if you would send me a supply of the forms and also a copy of the letter of instruction, which I presume you sent out with the original supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lowell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter 122-7-10, dated the 19th instant, and forms you enclosed regarding making an enquiry into deaths that occur at Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nI cannot see how your instructions contained on the form can be complied with. Guy Residential School is sixty miles from here and it is difficult to get there either winter or summer, nor are there any regular means of communication. There is no one residing at Sturgeon Landing outside the school staff to whom I could delegate authority to act for me. In addition there is no doctor. Dr. La Rose from The Pas visits the school every three months. I could of course make a special trip accompanied by the doctor when a death occurs, though it would be practically impossible to get there for several days, probably a week after the death occurred. The Principal would have to send in word into The Pas and then I would have to get word back to him to meet us at Atik. It almost every case it would be impossible to notify the pupil's parents of the death as they live, for the most, in very remote districts, a great distance from the school.\n\nA special trip by myself and the doctor would cause considerable expense. Deaths at the school are not very numerous, though there has been this last two months. After you have considered the above report, I would like your further instructions in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nPttawa\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 30, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to completing the forms in connection with the death of a pupil at the Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nFrom the information contained in your letter, it is evident that all the procedure mentioned on the form cannot be carried out. At the same time, it is necessary that we should have on file as complete information as possible regarding the circumstances attending the death of any pupil in a residential school.\n\nThe forms that were sent to you should be forwarded to the Principal and, in the event of the death of a pupil, the Reverend Sister who acts as nurse and the Principal should supply on the form as much information as they can and, when this is done, the form should be sent to you and you should forward it to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

One little girl died in the school. I wrote to the parents this last Wednesday and told them that their girl was very sick though the case was not yet desperate.

Chisholm, Esq.\nInspector, D.A.\n\nSir,\n\nFurther on in his report Mr. Keith speaks of the Indian school at Little Hill which he considers a poor one and the teacher an ex-pupil of Emmanuel College not very competent, not being able to speak English intelligently. This man has taught for 5 years at the Little Hill school. He has 18 pupils all but 2 of whom are in the first standard. Mr. Keith says the building requires window frames and he gave instructions to have grass cut for thatching the roof.\n\n(Signed) R. Pimm\nFor Secy.\nExtract (Original on 156710)\n\nPrince Albert - Last.\nSept 8th 1898\n\nSir,\n\nThe school at Little Hill is a poor one and the teacher, an Indian from Cumberland, a finish from Emmanuel College, not much good. He can't speak English intelligently. He has 18 children, all but 2 of which are in the first standard. He has been teaching there for 5 years. This does not say much for his success. Of course Indians come and go and it is difficult to show progress.\n\nThe school house, used as a church, is a log building 16 x 34. Four windows two of which require window frames, only having the holes cut and a piece of cotton.\ncotton nailed up. The roof leaks. I told some of them to cut the thatch grass while it was good. Fifteen dollars would thatch the roof. A lock is required for the door. If this school is to be continued, the following articles will be required at once\u2014\n\n20 lbs rice\n25 lbs soap\n2 combs\n1 wash-basin\n10 yds towelling\n1 set alphabet cards\n1 set animal cards\n6 slates\n1 Box chalk\n1 Box slate pencils.\n\nThe walls look bare, the animal and alphabet cards would anyway give it the appearance of a school. A new boy stove and piping is required. I suggested building a mud chimney but they say the mission people\npeople object to this as they use the building for a church.\n\nAllow me to remind you that we have a box stove, stationery, basins and outfit at the Sturgeon Lake Reserve from the school once held there, which would be available.\n\nMy opinion is the school is no good and is only a bill of expense the way it has been conducted. I asked some of the Indians why they did not send their children more regularly, but they say they have to take them when off shooting hunting. I suggested that they should leave them with some of the old people who winter at Little Hills and leave a supply of fish and send to them now again. They agreed to this if I would get them some clothing.\nREPORT on the INSPECTION of\nWILLIAM CHARLES' and JAMES ROBERTS' BANDS.\n\nDate of Inspection, Aug. 8th to 23rd, 1905.\n\nThe Lac la Ronge day school was not in session on either occasion as I passed. It is situated at Little Hills, some nine miles west of Lac la Ronge. It may, I presume, be taken for granted that it will be closed as soon as the new Boarding School is prepared to receive pupils.\n\nRespectfully submitted\n\nW. J. Chisholm,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nMistawasis, Sept. 22nd, 1905.\nReport on the Inspection of William Charles and James Roberts' Bands,\nFrom August, 1905, to August, 1906.\nDate of inspection, August 10th to 18th, 1906.\n\nDay School.\nI was not consulted about the scheme of erecting two buildings. The plan I saw was for one building.\n\nD. L.,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\n14. The day school has been closed since May. So far as I was able to learn there was no authority for the closing. However, as shown in my former reports there was no advantage in keeping it open.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW. J. Chisholm,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nI authorized the day school to be closed when the Boarding School was opened.\n\nD. L.,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nPrince Albert, October 22nd, 1906.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6315)\n\nFile 655-14, part 1\nThe Pas Agency - Guy Roman Catholic Residential School - Livestock. 1926 - 1928, 1946\n\nFile 655-23, part 1\nThe Pas Agency - Guy Roman Catholic Residential School - Deaths of Pupils. 1937 - 1943\n\nFile 656-1, part 2\nCarlton Agency - Lac La Ronge Day School - General Administration. 1897 - 1898, 1905 - 1906\n\nFile 656-2, part 1\nCarlton Agency - Lac La Ronge Day School - Quarterly Returns. 1942 - 1950\n\nFile 656-2, part 2\nCarlton Agency - Lac La Ronge Day School - Quarterly Returns. 1951 - 1952\n\nFile 656-3, part 1\nCarlton Agency - Lac La Ronge Day School - Payments of Grants - Teachers' Salaries. 1923 - 1952\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lad'la Ronge Anglican School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 15th, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lac la Ronge, Anglican School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nOCT 5 1943\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lac la Ronge Anglican School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 4, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at APR 11 1944\n\nIndian Agency.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFour No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lac la Ronge Anglican School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1944.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: October 9th, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at CARLTON this OCT 17 1944 Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAC LA RONDE ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31st, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JANUARY 3rd, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at JAN 6 1945\n\nthis Indian Agency.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAG LA RONDE ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31st, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JANUARY 3rd, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at JAN 6th 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForms No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAC LA RONDE ANGLICAN School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31st, 1944.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: JANUARY 3rd, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at: JAN 4 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lea La Ronge Anglican School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1945.\n\nDated April 6th, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at APR 17 1945\n\nthis Indian Agency.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the La Loche Range, Aughlean School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated July 9th, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at CARLTON, JUL 19 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March; 30th June; 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lac la Ronge Anglican School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated July 9, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON this JUL 19, 1945\n\nIndian Agency.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the La Loche School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1945.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated July 9th, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at Indian Agency.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginat No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lac la Ronge Anglican School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 5th, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lac la Ronge Anglican School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 2nd, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Indian Agency this... 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lac la Rouge School for the Quarter ended 31st March 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 14th April 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at APR 21 1947\n\nIndian Agency.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lac la Ronge School for the Quarter ended 31st Dec., 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 19, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at MAR-31 Reed this Indian Agency.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lac la Ronge School for the Quarter ended 31st Dec., 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 12th March, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this Indian Agency.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|----------|----------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0255            | Susan A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints, Lac la Ronge School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 8th, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IFA. 403\nReq.

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints School School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 3rd 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON JAN 2nd 1949\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the All Saints Indian School at Prince Albert, Sask.**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended December 31, 1948**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 119             | Sandy Bird      | 13  | 1   |      | Wm.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints School for the Quarter ended January 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 28, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: January 28, 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3608\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 92              | Oscar Pete               | 6   | 1   |      | Little Pines x |                    |                        |                             | 92 / 43\u00bd Sick                |\n| 93              | Archie Baptiste          | 8   | 12  |      | Do             |                    |                        | 1-9-48                      | 92 / 44 Sick                |\n| 94              | Jonas Baptiste           | 9   | 1   |      | Do             |                    |                        | 1-9-48                      | 92 / 36\u00bd Sick               |\n| 95              | Mervin Baptiste          | 12  | 1   |      | Do             |                    |                        | 1-9-48                      | 92 / 47                    |\n| 96              | Victor Baptiste          | 11  | 1   |      | Do             |                    |                        | 1-9-48                      | 92 / 42\u00bd                    |\n| 97              | James Finiday            | 11  | 1   |      | Sweetgrass x   |                    |                        | 1-9-48                      | 92 / 58\u00bd                    |\n| 98              | Emile Whitesalf          | 10  | 1   |      | Do             |                    |                        | 1-9-48                      | 92 / 49 Sick                |\n| 99              | Absolom Halkett          | 6   | 1   |      | Wm.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 28, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the All Saints Indian School at Prince Albert, Sask., on Reserve for Quarter ended December 31, 1948.**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 65              | Raymond Ross    | 13  | 1   |      | The Pas         | 20 7 8 3 7 2 2 2 2 9 2221 |                      |                          | 4-9-48                     | 92/44 Sick |\n| 66              | Eric Bignall    | 12  | 1   |      |                 |                |                   |                          | 4-9-48                     | 92/54      |\n| 67              | Cornelius Geo.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints School School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JAN 28th 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 4th 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at JUL 6 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**CARLTON Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the ALL SAINT'S INDIAN School at PRINCE ABBERT on Reserve for Quarter ended June 30, 1949**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|---------------|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 37              | Leonard Whitehead Sr. | 15  | 1   |      |                |               |                  |                          |                             |            |\n| 38              | Stanley S.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 4th 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at JUL 6 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be proved and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 4th 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JUL 6 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Mary's Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 7, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at: Oct. 11, 1949\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S INDIAN School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct 7 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at QCI 11 1949\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. IA. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 159             | Norman Brightnose | 8   | 1   |     | Mile 214       |                   |                        |                           | 3.9.49     |\n| 160             | Leonard H.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nDated Oct 7, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated Oct 25, 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page of this form.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nDated\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S INDIAN School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31 1949.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated Jan 7 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at JAN 9 1950\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S INDIAN School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31 1949\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan 7 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at JAN 9 1950\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The average per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S INDIAN School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan. 7, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at JAN. 9, 1950\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT OF the ALL SAINT'S School at PAINTED ALBERT BAY on Reserve for Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1942**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 1               | Terry Bird      | 16  | 1   |      | Sandy Lake     |                   |                          |                             | 27.9.37    |\n| 3               | Lawrence Metcalf| 15  | 1   |      | Thunderchild   |                   |                          |                             | 5.11.38    |\n| 5               | Absolom Frenchman| 13 | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                             | 13.9.41    |\n| 8               | Peter Ellentynge| 16  | 1   |      | Little Red River|                  |                          |                             | 1.9.42     |\n| 9               | Baptiste Bird   | 12  | 1   |      | New Reserve    |                   |                          |                             | 2.9.42     |\n| 10              | Francis Paddy   | 11  | 1   |      | Thunderchild   |                   |                          |                             | 18.9.42    |\n| 11              | Stephen Frank   | 14  | 1   |      | Sweetgrass     |                   |                          |                             | 1.9.43     |\n| 12              | Roderick King   | 13  | 1   |      | Little Pines    |                   |                          |                             | 1.9.43     |\n| 14              | Ivan Rossyann   | 13  | 1   |      | Red Pheasant    |                   |                          |                             | 1.9.43     |\n| 15              | Howard Sighard  | 17  | 1   |      | Sturgeon Lake   |                   |                          |                             | 1.9.44     |\n| 17              | Norman Henderson| 15  | -

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saint's Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 3, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at APR 3 1950\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. LA. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Carlton Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the All Saint's School at Prince Albert on Reserve for Quarter ended March 31 1950**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DAYS OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|                 |                |     |     |      | Grade 1         |                    |                        |                           |            |                                                  |\n|                 |                |     |     |      | 7 5 24 7 1 4 13 |                    |                        |                           |            |                                                  |\n|                 |                |     |     |      | 93              |                    |                        |                           |            |                                                  |\n|                 |                |     |     |      | 61              |                    |                        |                           |            |                                                  |\n|                 |                |     |     |      | 34              |                    |                        |                           |            |                                                  |\n\n**Forward**\n\n| 080 | Angelique Ballentyne | 15 | 1 | Peter Bell | x | 23.3.49 | 90 | 57\u00bd | Working |\n| 090 | Ruth Thomas          | 11 | 1 | Gillam    | x | 3.9.49  | 90 | 54\u00bd | Working |\n| 091 | Christie McGillvray  | 11 | 1 | The Pas   | x | 3.9.49  | 90 | 61\u00bd | Working |\n| 092 | Emma McGillvray      | 7  | 1 | \"         | x | 3.9.49  | 90 | 41  | Sick   |\n| 093 | May McGillvray       | 6  | 1 | \"         | x | 3.9.49  | 90 | 63  | Working |\n| 094 | Lucinda McGillvray   | 10 | 1 | \"         | x | 3.9.49  | 90 | 61\u00bd | Working |\n| 095 | Miriam McGillvray    | 9  | 1 | \"         | x | 3.9.49  | 90 | 63  | Working |\n| 096 | Sylvia McGillvray    | 12 | 1 | \"         | x | 3.9.49  | 90 | 55\u00bd | Sick & Working |\n| 097 | Betsy Young         | 6  | 1 | \"         | x | 3.9.49  | 90 | 61\u00bd | Working |\n| 098 | Rosie Young          | 11 | 1 | \"         | x | 3.9.49  | 90 | 53  | Working |\n| 099 | Doris Young          | 8  | 1 | \"         | x | 3.9.49  | 90 | 60\u00bd | Working |\n| 100 | Esther Young         | 8  | 1 | \"         | x | 3.9.49  | 90 | 59  | Sick   |\n| 101 | Christina Wavey      | 12 | 1 | Split Lk. | x | 5.9.49  | 90 | 51\u00bd | Working |\n| 102 | Helen Virginia Young | 13 | 1 | The Pas   | x | 3.9.49  | 90 | 54\u00bd | Working |\n| 103 | Yvonne Bear          | 8  | 1 | John Smith|x | 31.8.49 | 90 | 63\u00bd | Working |\n| 104 | Dolores Bear         | 6  | 1 | \"         | x | 31.8.49 | 90 | 64  | Working |\n| 105 | Bernice Bear         | 10 | 1 | \"         | x | 31.8.49 | 90 | 61\u00bd | Working |\n| 106 | Jane Aurora Eninew   | 6  | 1 | Jas Roberts|x | 31.8.49 | 90 | 62\u00bd | Working |\n| 107 | Alice Bird           | 9  | 1 | \"         | x | 1.9.49  | 90 | 64  | Working |\n| 108 | Frances Charles      | 15 | 1 | Peter Ball|x | 31.8.49 | 90 | 58\u00bd | Working |\n| 109 | Isilda Roberts       | 16 | 1 | Wm.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saint's Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 3, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at APR 3 1950\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS                  | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY          | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------|-----|-----|------|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 051             | Adelaide Lathlin                 | 11  | 1   | x    | The Pass                | x                 |                        | 4.9.48                     | 90/51      | Working                                                                                           |\n| 052             | Mildred Spence                   | 9   | 1   | x    | \"                       | x                 |                        | 4.9.48                     | 61\u00bd        |                                                                                                  |\n| 055             | Mary Anne Paul                   | 14  | 1   | x    | \"                       | x                 |                        | 4.9.48                     | 40         | Sick & Working                                                                                   |\n| 058             | Victoria Stewart                 | 14  | 1   | x    | Cumberland House       | x                 |                        | 4.9.48                     | 63         |                                                                                                  |\n| 059             | Elizabeth Cuskin                 | 12  | 1   | x    | Split Lk.               | x                 |                        | 4.9.48                     | 46         | Working                                                                                           |\n| 061             | Amelia Spence                    | 15  | 1   | x    | \"                       | x                 |                        | 4.9.48                     | 55         | Working                                                                                           |\n| 062             | Matilda Minnie Roberts           | 14  | 1   | x    | Jess Roberts            | x                 |                        | 7.9.48                     | 42         | Sick & Working                                                                                   |\n| 063             | Bella Bird                       | 11  | 1   | x    | \"                       | x                 |                        | 7.9.48                     | 49\u00bd        | Sick & Working                                                                                   |\n| 065             | Mary Ross                        | 10  | 1   | x    | \"                       | x                 |                        | 7.9.48                     | 54\u00bd        | Working                                                                                           |\n| 066             | Grace Roberts Bird               | 13  | 1   | x    | \"                       | x                 |                        | 7.9.48                     | 46         | Sick & Working                                                                                   |\n| 068             | Sarah C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, see another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints' Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 3, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at APR 3, 1950\n\nthis Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saints' Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 3, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated: APR 3 1950\n\nthis Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S INDIAN School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30TH 1950.\n\nPrincipal G.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S INDIAN School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30th 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 29 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nJUN 29 1950\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 051             | Adelaide Lathlin         | 11  | 1   | \"    | The Pas        | X                 |                         |                             | 4.9.48     | Working                                                                                           |\n| 052             | Mildred Spence           | 9   | 1   | \"    |                | X                 |                         |                             | 4.9.48     | Working                                                                                           |\n| 054             | Emma Dorion              | 8   | 1   | \"    |                | X                 |                         |                             | 4.9.48     | Arrived from San.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S INDIAN School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 29 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at JUN 29 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S INDIAN School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 29 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON this JUN 29 1950 Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. IA. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 126             | Benjamin Ballentyne      | 15  | 1   |      | Peter Ballentyne | x                  |                        |                             | 6.9.48     | Taken to San May 11.                                                                             |\n| 127             | Louis Nusaskapew         | 7   | 1   |      | Sandy Lk.       | x                  |                        |                             | 6.9.48     |                                                                                                  |\n| 128             | David Charles            | 8   | 1   |      | Amos Charles    | x                  |                        |                             | 6.9.48     |                                                                                                  |\n| 129             | Walter McKenzie          | 9   | 1   |      |                 | x                  |                        |                             | 7.9.48     |                                                                                                  |\n| 130             | David McKenzie           | 12  | 1   |      |                 | x                  |                        |                             | 7.9.48     |                                                                                                  |\n| 131             | Samson Ratt              | 11  | 1   |      |                 | x                  |                        |                             | 14.9.48    | Sick                                                                                               |\n| 132             | Roderick McKenzie        | 12  | 1   |      |                 | x                  |                        |                             | 14.9.48    | Sick                                                                                               |\n| 133             | Norman Dorion            | 12  | 1   |      | The Pas         | x                  |                        |                             | 16.8.48    |                                                                                                  |\n| 136             | Victor Fineday           | 9   | 1   |      | Sweetgrass      | x                  |                        |                             | 9.10.48    |                                                                                                  |\n| 137             | Jack Fineday             | 6   | 1   |      |                 | x                  |                        |                             | 9.10.48    |                                                                                                  |\n| 138             | Clarence B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S INDIAN School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 29, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON this JUN 29, 1950\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 49              | Joe Naytowhow   | 10  | 1   |      | Sturgeon Lk    | x                 |                          | 1.9.48                    | 91         | 55\u00bd In San.                                                                         |\n| 51              | Frank Hunt      | 9   | -   |      | Montreal Lk    | x                 |                          | 24.3.48                   | -          |                                                                                 |\n| 52              | Leonard Whitehead| 13  | 1   |      | Jas.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan 4, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON this JAN 4, 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: JANUARY 4, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON this JANUARY 4, 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance, in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1960.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 4, 1961\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at CARLTON this JAN 4, 1961\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature] 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON this JAN 4, 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL AINT'S RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: JAN 4, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at: JAN 4, 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the All Saint's Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 4, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at: JAN 4 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6315)\n\nFile 655-14, part 1\nThe Pas Agency - Guy Roman Catholic Residential School - Livestock. 1926 - 1928, 1946\n\nFile 655-23, part 1\nThe Pas Agency - Guy Roman Catholic Residential School - Deaths of Pupils. 1937 - 1943\n\nFile 656-1, part 2\nCarlton Agency - Lac La Ronge Day School - General Administration. 1897 - 1898, 1905 - 1906\n\nFile 656-2, part 1\nCarlton Agency - Lac La Ronge Day School - Quarterly Returns. 1942 - 1950\n\nFile 656-2, part 2\nCarlton Agency - Lac La Ronge Day School - Quarterly Returns. 1951 - 1952\n\nFile 656-3, part 1\nCarlton Agency - Lac La Ronge Day School - Payments of Grants - Teachers' Salaries. 1923 - 1952\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the ALL SAINT'S School at PRINCE ALBERT**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended MARCH 31 1952**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS ON STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1               | Percy Bird      | 17' | 1   |      | Sandy Lk       |                   |                          |                           | 27.8.37    | High School                                                                                     |\n| 3               | Lawrence Metoos | 16' | 1   |      | Thunderchild   |                   |                          |                           | 6.11.39    |                                                                                                  |\n| 5               | Absalom Frenchman| 14' | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                           | 12.9.41    |                                                                                                  |\n| 9               | Baptiste Bird   | 13' | 1   |      | New Reserve    |                   |                          |                           | 1.9.41     |                                                                                                  |\n| 10              | Francis Paddy   | 18' | 1   |      | Thunderchild   |                   |                          |                           | 15.9.42    | In San.                                                                                           |\n| 12              | Robert King     | 14' | 1   |      | Little Pines   |                   |                          |                           | 1.9.45     |                                                                                                  |\n| 14              | Ivan Dresymann  | 14' | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                           | 1.10.43    |                                                                                                  |\n| 15              | Howard Bighood  | 18' | 1   |      | Wm.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6315, file 656-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINTS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 5, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON APR 5 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 5, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at APR 5 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                |                    |                        |                           |            |                                                                                                  |\n| 062             | Bella Bird               | 18' | 1   |      |                |                    |                        |                           |            |                                                                                                  |\n| 065             | Mary Ross                | 11' | 1   |      |                |                    |                        |                           |            |                                                                                                  |\n| 066             | Grace R.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL for the Quarter ended MARCH 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 5, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at CARLTON this APRIL 5, 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils referred to in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINTS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended JUN 30 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agency\n\nDated at JUN 30 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita rate. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30, 1951.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: June 30, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated: CARLTON\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL SAINT'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON this JUN 30 1951\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 069             | Betsy M.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30, 1951.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: June 30, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON this JUN 30, 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**CARLTON Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the ALL SAINT'S School at PRINCE ALBERT**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended JUNE 30 1951**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE ON OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                 |     |     |      |                 |                |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 0144            | Elizabeth Peters | 9   | 1   | Gillem | x               |                |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 0146            | Vera Sunshine   | 11  | 1   | Fishing Lk | x               |                |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 0148            | Lillian Pruden  | 14  | 1   | Little Sask | x               |                |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 0149            | Flore Sanderson | 10  | 1   | Jas Smith | x               |                |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 0150            | Mary Agnes Burns| 14  | 1   | \"       | x               |                |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 0152            | Amelia Bird     | 13  | 1   | Jas Roberts | x               |                |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 0153            | Nora Halkett    | 10  | 1   | \"       | x               |                |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 0154            | Maggie McKenzie | 13  | 1   | \"       | x               |                |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 0155            | Flora Morin     | 15  | 1   | \"       | x               |                |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 0156            | Flora Ross      | 15  | 1   | \"       | x               |                |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 0158            | Mary M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALL-SAINTE-THOMAS INDIAN INSTITUTE School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at: AUG 30, 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RONGE AND OJIBWE) School Quarter ended September 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 3rd 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at QGI 10 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE | DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 58             | Albert E Bear         | 16  | *   |      | John Smith    |                   |                         |                           |            | Discharged - Graduation                          |                                          |\n| 59             | H Lawrence Whitehead  | 18  | *   |      | The Pas       |                   |                         |                           |            | High School                                     |                                          |\n| 62             | Samson A Cook         | 12  | *   |      |               |                   |                         |                           |            |                                                 |                                          |\n| 64             | Albert G Lathlin      | 14  | *   |      |               |                   |                         |                           |            |                                                 |                                          |\n| 66             | Eric Bignell          | 15  | *   |      |               |                   |                         |                           |            |                                                 |                                          |\n| 73             | Fred McGillivary      | 12  | *   |      |               |                   |                         |                           |            | Not returned                                    |                                          |\n| 74             | Charles J Lathlin     | 13  | *   |      |               |                   |                         |                           |            |                                                 |                                          |\n| 75             | John Waye             | 16  | *   |      | Split Lake    |                   |                         |                           |            | Discharged - Graduation                          |                                          |\n| 79             | Jack Spence           | 17  | *   |      |               |                   |                         |                           |            | Discharged - Graduated                           |                                          |\n| 83             | Albert S Keeper       | 13  | *   |      |               |                   |                         |                           |            |                                                 |                                          |\n| 84             | Eli J Morris          | 14  | *   |      | Gillam        |                   |                         |                           |            |                                                 |                                          |\n| 86             | Thomas Beardy         | 13  | *   |      | York Factory  |                   |                         |                           |            |                                                 |                                          |\n| 87             | Reg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RONDE AND ONION LAKE) School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal: A.J. Scow\n\nDated: October 3rd 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: OCI 10 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 154             | Patrick Ross  | 8   | 1   |      | The Pas        |                   |                        |                           | 65/4         |\n| 155             | Baptiste Ross | 14  | 1   |      |                |                   |                        |                           | 62 - Not Returned |\n| 156             | Joe A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RONDE AND ONION LAKE) School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 3rd 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON OCTOBER 10 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. L.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**GARLTON Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the PRINCE ALBERT School at PRINCE ALBERT on Reserve for Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30th/51**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 182             | Floyd P.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RONDE AND ONION LAKE) School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal Q J Scrase\n\nDated October 3rd 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Indian Agency this 10th October 1951.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6315, file 656-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAD LA RONDE AND ORCHID LAKE) School for the Quarter ended...September 30th...1951...\n\nPrincipal...O.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, any payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RONGE AND OTTON LAKE) School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 3rd 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: CARLTON OCTOBER 10 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RONDE AND ONION LAKE) School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 3rd 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Indian Agency Oct. 10 1951.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RONDE AND ONION LAKE) School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 3rd 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at OCTOBER 10 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RONDE AND ONION LAKE) School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1951.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated October 3rd, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\nOCT 10 1951\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RONDE AND ONION LAKE) School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 3rd 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Indian Agency this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DAYS OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0345            | Rita Ahensley | 11  | 1   |     | Sandy Lake     |               |                  |                        |                           | 36978      | Transferred ex St.Albans                                     |\n| 0346            | Doris Hyman   | 13  | 1   |     |                |               |                  |                        |                           | 92         | Transferred ex St.Albans                                     |\n| 0347            | Sheila E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 3rd 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated OCTOBER 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residences during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINFORMATION RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: OCTOBER 5TH, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: JAN 10, 1952\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAS LA SORTE) School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: JANUARY 5, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON JANUARY 10, 1952\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FRINGE ALBERT (LAC LA ROCHE) School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: JANUARY 6, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agency\n\nDated at: JANUARY 10, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RENEE) School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: JANUARY 5, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: JANUARY 10, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the RIDGE ALBERT (LAC LA RENEE) School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: JANUARY 5, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: JANUARY 10, 1952\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RENEE) School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JANUARY 5, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nJAN 10 1952\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RONDE) School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: JANUARY 5, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: JAN. 10, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the... PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RENEE) School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31 19...\n\nPrincipal: A. J. Scrase\n\nDated: JANUARY 5 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nJAN 10 1952\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | SEX | CLASS OR STUDY | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|-----|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0158            | Mary M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAG LA ROUGE) School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: JANUARY 5, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON Indian Agent\n\nDated at: JAN 10 1952\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RONGE) School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal Q.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA BORNE) School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: JANUARY 5, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0302            | Sarah Ballentyne         | 18  | 1   |      | Deschambault x |                    |                        |                             | 92         | 65                                                            |\n| 0303            | Ide F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the PRINCE ALBERT (LAC LA RUE) School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31 1951.\n\nPrincipal Q. J. [Signature]\n\nDated JANUARY 5 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JAN 10 1952\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included, on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated January 5, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at this Indian Agency, January 10, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**CARLTON Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the PRINCE ALBERT (LAG LA RONDE) School at PRINCE ALBERT**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1951**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE | DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 0356            | Sarah Lightfoot | 6   | 1   | Mosquito | x               | x                  |                        |                             | 1.7.51     | 92 57\u00bd                                           |                                          |\n| 0357            | Helen Dressman | 7   | 1   | Red Pheasant | x               | x                  |                        |                             | 1.7.51     | 92 65                                            |                                          |\n| 0358            | Lydia Lightfoot | 9   | 1   | \"       | x               | x                  |                        |                             | 1.7.51     | 92 62\u00bd                                           |                                          |\n| 0359            | Alice Crookedneck | 15  | 1   | Island Lk | x               | x                  |                        |                             | 1.9.51     | 92 46\u00bd                                           |                                          |\n| 0360            | Shirley R.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: JANUARY 5, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJANUARY 10, 1952\n\nDated at:\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE | DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 0583           | Laura A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JANUARY 5, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JANUARY 10, 1952\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAC LA RENDE School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31 1932.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated APRIL 4 1932\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at APRIL 8 1932\n\nthis Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the DAGLA NOGE School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated APRIL 4, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at APRIL 8, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 04              | Marina Ahenakew       | 16  | 1   |      | Sandy Lk       | x                  |                         |                             | 9.9.40     | Left School, graduated last June but returned                                                  |\n| 011             | Florence Meetoos      | 16  | 1   |      | Thunderchild   | x                  |                         |                             | 5.10.39    |                                                                                                  |\n| 034             | Daisy M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAG-LA-BORGE School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated APRIL 4, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON Indian Agent\n\nAFR 8, 1952\n\nDated at Indian Agency this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTRATION NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | SEX | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|---------------------|---------------|-----|-----|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 094                 | Lucinda M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the L.C.L.A.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lag La Ronge School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: APRIL 4, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at APRIL 3, 1952\n\nthis Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAC LA ROCHE School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: APRIL 4, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON this APR 2, 1952\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 2 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON JUL 7 1952 Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated July 8, 1952.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at JUL 7 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...LAD-LA-RONGE School for the Quarter ended...JUNE 30...19...\n\nPrincipal...[Signature]\n\nDated...July 3...19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...JULY 7...1952\n\nthis...Indian Agency...19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated July 8, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at JULY 7, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | HAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                            |            |\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                            |            |\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                            |            |\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                            |            |\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                            |            |\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                            |            |\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                            |            |\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                            |            |\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                            |            |\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                 |               |                   |                         |                            |            |\n\n**TOTALS**\n\nTotal number of days in Quarter: \n\nAggregate number of days pupils in residence during Quarter:\n\nAverage attendance of pupils during Quarter:\n\nAmount of per capita grant due for Quarter:\n\n(a) If this is a church-owned residential school, state the number of:\n(i) non-Indian children who are boarders;\n(ii) non-Indian children who are day school pupils.\n\nNOTE\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the EAGLE RIDGE School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 2 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JULY 7 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n|                |                          |     |     |      |                |                   |                         |                            |            |\n| 094            | Lucinda M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30 1952 Principal:\n\nDated July 2 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JULY 7 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAC LA RIGE School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1955.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JANUARY 5, 1956\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JANUARY 6, 1956\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF RETURN TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|------------|\n|                |                 |     |     |       |               |                   |                        |                          |            |\n| 170            | Joseph Recksway | 11  | 1   |       | Gillam        | x                  |                        | 3.9.49                   | 92         |\n| 171            | Mike Morris     | 11  | 1   |       | \"             | x                  |                        | 3.9.49                   | 92         |\n| 172            | Larry S.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAC LA ROCHIE School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JANUARY 5, 1953\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JAN 6, 1953\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonds No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 283             | Stanley Henderson | 7   | 1   | Wm Charles | x              | x                        | 1951                      | 92/58      |\n| 284             | Ronald S.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at: [Date]\n\nthis...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAC LA ROCHE School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1935.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JANUARY 5, 1936\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON Indian Agent\n\nDated JANUARY 6, 1936\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAG LA ROCHUE School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated JANUARY 5, 1953.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Indian Agency this JANUARY 5, 1953.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0294            | Betsy G.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging is No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAG LA ROCHERE School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JANUARY 5, 1953\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JAN 6, 1953\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...LAC LA BORNE School for the Quarter ended...SEPTEMBER 30...1952...\n\nPrincipal...A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAC LA BORGE School for the Quarter ended OCTOBER 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: OCTOBER 6, 1952.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at CARLTON OCT 8, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepaid and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...LAC LA RONGE...School for the Quarter ended...SEPTEMBER 30...19...\n\nPrincipal...[Signature]\n\nDated...OCTOBER 6...19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...OCT 8...19...\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAC LA RONDE School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCTOBER 6 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated OCTOBER 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...LAC LA ROCHE........................................School for the Quarter ended..........................SEPTEMBER 30..................19.........\n\nPrincipal.................................................................O.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA-403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND ON RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                 |                |     |     |     |                |               |                  |                        |                           |            |                                                             |\n| Forward         | 190            |     |     |     |                |               |                  |                        |                           |            |                                                             |\n| 303 Edward Yellowmud | 7   | 1   |     |     | Poundmaker     |               |                  |                        |                           |            |                                                             |\n| 304 Joseph Baptiste | 8   | 1   |     |     | Red Pheasant   |               |                  |                        |                           |            |                                                             |\n| 305 Melvin Morin  | 7   | 1   |     |     | Sioux Wahpaton |               |                  |                        |                           |            |                                                             |\n| 306 Richard Morin | 9   | 1   |     |     |                |               |                  |                        |                           |            |                                                             |\n| 311 Richard Dubois| 16  | 1   |     |     | Pipikisis      |               |                  |                        |                           |            |                                                             |\n| 312 Kenneth Keewatin| 14  | 1   |     |     |                |               |                  |                        |                           |            |                                                             |\n| 314 George Dreaver | 11  | 1   |     |     | Water Hen      |               |                  |                        |                           |            |                                                             |\n| 315 John James Dreaver| 12  | 1   |     |     |                |               |                  |                        |                           |            |                                                             |\n| 316 Peter Paul Halkett| 7   | 1   |     |     | New Reserve    |               |                  |                        |                           |            |                                                             |\n| 317 William Geo.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: OCTOBER 6, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: OCT 8, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAC LA RONGE School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: OCTOBER 6, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: OCTOBER 6, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|---------------|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0192           | Dorian Ahensakew | 14  | 1   |     | Sandy Lk       |               |                  |                          | 2.9.50                      | 86/13       |\n| 0195           | Telsa Ballantyne | 7   | 1   |     | Peter Ball     |               |                  |                          | 1.9.50                      | 85/15       |\n| 0196           | Sarah Naytowhow  | 8   | 1   |     | Wm Charles     |               |                  |                          | 1.9.50                      | 92/20       |\n| 0197           | Emily Henderson  | 11  | 1   |     |                |               |                  |                          | 1.9.50                      | 92/20       |\n| 0198           | Nellie Henderson | 15  | 1   |     |                |               |                  |                          | 1.9.50                      | 92/17       |\n| 0199           | Clara Bird       | 16  | 1   |     |                |               |                  |                          | 1.9.50                      | 62/-        |\n| 0200           | Lillian Neckaway | 9   | 1   |     | Split Lk       |               |                  |                          | 1.9.50                      | 92/21       |\n| 0201           | Catherine Brightnose | 8 | 1   |     | Mile 214       |               |                  |                          | 1.9.50                      | 92/21       |\n| 0202           | Christie Beady   | 12  | 1   |     | Split Lk       |               |                  |                          | 1.9.50                      | 92/21       |\n| 0203           | Rebecca M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6315, file 656-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAG-LA-BANJE School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30/52.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCTOBER 6 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at OCTOBER 6 1952\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LAC LA ROCHE School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCTOBER 6, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated OCTOBER 8, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6315, file 656-2, part 2)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

The Principal states in a letter written to me on the 12th inst. that \"two weeks mail for Lac la Ronge was lying somewhere between Prince Albert and that point\". He adds that \"a new contract has just been let for the mail, and we hope for better service from now on\".\n\n(2) A lack of the proper forms for the \"Returns\". He states that he applied to your Department for a supply of these on November 9th last, but up until January 12th none had reached him. There is, of course, the possibility that the forms may be in the mail which was left somewhere between Prince Albert and the School, and if so you may receive the \"Returns\" sooner than the Principal thought likely when he wrote.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 30, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant and on reviewing our file I find that quarterly return forms were forwarded from here to the Principal of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School on November 25 last. Under these circumstances I am inclined to feel that they must be with the mail which had not been delivered to the Lac la Ronge School at the time you heard from the Principal.\n\nIn order to assist your financing I am arranging to forward to your General Treasurer a cheque for $3500.00, being a part payment on the per capita allowance for the December quarter. The balance will be paid when the December quarter return is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

School, Lac la Ronge\n\nI have just received a communication from our Indian School Administration in Ottawa which says: \"We are in receipt of a letter from the Indian Affairs Branch requesting that the December quarterly return from Lac la Ronge Residential School be expedited.\" The word \"expedited\" touches me on a raw spot; hence this letter.\n\nI am happy to state that the said Return has lately been forwarded to your Carlton agency. What I wish to emphasize is the fact that the return was drafted by January 5, when I told Mr. Indian Agent Jones in person that I lacked sufficient forms to complete it in triplicate. My request for a year's supply of blue forms was noted. During the month I wrote twice to the Agency repeating my request. On February 2 the school was destroyed by fire, and the draft of my Quarterly Return with it. Later in the month, before I was transferred to Gordon's School, I reminded the Agent that I was still waiting for forms, and received a letter, dated Feb. 25, which concludes:\n\n\"Regarding the quarterly report forms, these have not been received to date, however, since we requested these to be mailed direct to you, they will no doubt eventually catch up to you.\"\n\nIn the race I am still leading. Records necessary to the compilation of a fresh Return, which were fortunately salvaged from the fire, came down to me from Lac la Ronge this month, and the much overdue report that I have sent forward was made out on forms borrowed from supplies here. I am still awaiting the promised supply.\n\nIn the circumstances it is hard for one to be expeditious, as I think you will agree.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nActing Principal.\n\nFormerly principal, All Saints School, Lac la Ronge, Sask.\nProvince of SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPer Capita Allowances\u2014Residential Schools\n\nFor Quarter ended December 31st 1947\n\n| PRINCIPAL | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL PER CAPITA ALLOWANCE | AMOUNT DUE |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|------------|\n|           | Aver.          | 96.39                      |            |\n|           | LAC LA RONGE RES. | $ 200.                  |            |\n|           | December Earnings | $ 1,819.50              |            |\n|           | Special Grant   | 361.46                    |            |\n|           |                 | $ 5,180.96                |            |\n|           | Less Advance    | 2,500.00                  |            |\n|           |                 | $ 2,680.96                |            |\n\nVote No.: 77\nSchool No.: 656\nAllot.

Both returns should be forwarded to the Department through the office of Superintendent Jones.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nRev. G.W.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nReferring to your 875-3 (E.6) of 14th January, 1949, addressed to Miss Evans, M.S.C.C., with copy to us, it is noted that the adjustment for the June Quarter for Lac la Ronge School is only $227.70, whereas in the Schedule attached to your 150-2 (E.1) of 30th November, 1948, to us, this adjustment is shown as $675.38. Will you please advise me which of these two figures is the correct one.\n\nIt is noted from your letter of 14th January to Miss Evans that you have not yet determined the adjustment for March and June quarters for Alert Bay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. PHELAN.\n\nThis is the explanation to Canon Cook's question on Lac la Ronge.\n\nThe per capita rate for the June Quarter was paid at $215.00. This rate was increased to $286. which was a difference of $71.00\n\nThe average for the month of June was $38.05. The adjustment for June on this basis would be $675.38. This is the information that was given in the first instance.\n\nThe Auditor advised that there was 17% added to the original rate and as this was already paid, it had to be subtracted from the $675.38. The June statement shows that 17% of the earnings of $2,045.15 amounted to $347.66. Therefore, $675.38 less $347.66 amounts to $327.70 which is the amount of the adjustment.\n\nM.F.

There is arable land 2\u00bd miles across the bay from the school and it is accessible only by water. It is necessary to transport workers back and forth from time to time and also to tow a small scow containing horses or produce. The Missionary Society of the Church of England are willing to contribute $500 towards a suitable launch. Prices have been secured, and the lowest quotation ($1100 f. o. b. Prince Albert) was received from the Peterboro Canoe Company. Dr. Westgate, Acting General Secretary of the M. S. C. C., has approved of this boat.\n\nIt will be necessary to freight the boat, by sleigh, from Prince Albert - nearly 300 miles - and, as the time is very short, the Peterboro Canoe Company received the order by telegram, immediately upon receipt of the Minute number from the Purchasing Commission. $600 will be met from parliamentary appropriation, and I respectfully ask for your approval of the action that has been taken.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nThe St. Lawrence Engine Co.

When these prices were received they were submitted to the Purchasing Commission of Canada, and we were instructed to place the order with the Peterboro Canoe Co. Ltd., Peterboro, Ont., their price being considerably lower than that quoted by you. I may add, further, that both the boat and engine selected are of a type satisfactory to the authorities of the Church of England, who will use the boat in connection with their work at the Lac la Ronge Indian Boarding School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nReferring to your letter of Dec. 15 Re Pump. I will try and give all the information that will be required. Distance from pump discharge to compression tank 225 feet. This is connected at present by 1\u00bd inch pipe. This pipe gives sufficient capacity for discharge for us. The trouble is that the pump we have is not a strong enough built pump, and the engine is not powerful enough to put on the pressure that we require. We use about 800 gal. of water per day. Our well is 18 ft. deep, and the tanks are about 14 ft. above the well. The pump stands immediately over the well, and as I said above, connected with the compression tank by 225 ft. of pipe. It will save time and expense if this piping could be used again. We do not require a big outfit. The present pump which has a capacity of about 18 gal. per minute would be alright if it were stronger built, and if the engine, which is 1\u00bd H.P., were powerful enough to do the work. The Canadian Fairbanks - Morse put out a very good pump and engine. I think the best on the market. I sincerely hope that an outfit may be forthcoming before the freighting season closes. It is very inconvenient working such a water supply system as this is, and it would be very inadequate in case of fire.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(signed) Chas F. Hives.\n\nPrincipal.\nSir:-\n\nIn the absence of Dr. Westgate and with further reference to your letter No. 132-2-5 of the 12th ultimo, and Dr. Westgate's reply of the 15th ultimo, I beg to enclose herewith copy of letter received from the Principal of the Lac la Ronge Indian Boarding School, giving the required particulars.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nOffice Secretary\n\nEnc.\n\nEWM/FEC\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMR. PACET,\n\nA new engine and pump are required in connection with the water supply at the Lac la Ronge Indian Boarding School. The type of machine required will be a 5 x 5 pump directly connected to a 3 H.P. Gas. engine.\n\nThe Principal of the school has specially requested that he be furnished with a pump and engine as manufactured by the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co. I may say that this type of machine is well known in the West, is strongly built, simple and has given perfect satisfaction wherever installed. The Reverend Principal is acquainted with this style of pump and engine, and it would therefore seem advisable that he be furnished with the above mentioned make.\n\nThe estimated cost of the pump and engine complete is approximately $415.00, and I beg to recommend, if the same is agreeable to the Purchasing Commission, that the school be furnished with a Fairbanks-Morse outfit.\n\nThe Purchase of this pump is recommended.\n\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nOttawa, 31st January, 1923.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMR. SCOTT,\n\nYou will remember when Rev. Dr. Westgate called at your office about a month ago, he discussed the necessity of furnishing the Lac la Ronge School with a pump and gasoline engine.\n\nBefore I could determine the style of apparatus required, it was necessary to communicate with the Reverend Principal for the information desired. This has been received, and to make a satisfactory water supply system for the building, it will be necessary to install a 5 x 5 suction pump operated by a 3 H. P. gasoline engine. The Canadian Fairbanks-Morse manufacture a very satisfactory outfit of this nature with the engine directly connected to the pump, all mounted on one base, the cost of which is approximately $400.00.\n\nThe Reverend Principal is thoroughly acquainted with the Fairbanks-Morse outfit which is extensively used in the West. This has been submitted to the Purchasing Commission and they have approved of the above mentioned pump and engine being purchased from the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co.\n\nI beg to recommend that the school be furnished with this pump and engine which will complete an efficient water supply system for the building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Westgate,D.D.,\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nReferring to your letter of Dec.28,\nre laundry, I am, under separate cover, enclosing plans of\nthe present building,in case you have not them in the office.\nMy idea was to extend the wing which accommodates the present\nlaundry, and make the proposed new laundry 20 X 28 ft. This\nto have a basement similar to the basement under the main\npart. To be connected with the main basement by a passage\nwas, and to be heated with a pipeless furnace. This would\nhave a room upstairs which would be used as a drying room,\nwhich would be connected with the present drying which could\nbe used as an ironing room. The whole of the ground floor\nwould be the laundry proper, and should be sufficiently large\nenough. Outside of proper laundry equipment we would require\nboiler connected with the stove, for the purpose of supplying\nsufficient hot water for the laundry. In a previous letter\nI suggested using the present laundry for a bake room. I\nreally think this would be a great convenience for us. Our\nkitchen is small for a school of our pupilage, and it would\nrelieve the congestion during busy time in the kitchen.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(signed) Chas F. Hives\nPrincipal\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of November 28, concerning the provision of a suitable laundry and equipment for our Society's School at Lac la Ronge, along with my letter of November 27, setting forth the major requirements of other Schools, and the Deputy Superintendent General's reply dated December 4, No. 160-2, I now beg to enclose a copy of a letter just received from the Rev. C. F. Hives, Principal of our School at Lac la Ronge, in which he embodies certain suggestions in regard to the laundry in question.\n\nI have carefully studied this and am of the opinion that the alterations and extensions he recommends would meet the requirements of the situation, and I trust that they may meet with your approval also, and the authorization be given for these to proceed.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary & Acting General Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nTBRW/FFC.\nOttawa, February 27, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith accounts for the 3 H.

I would say that I have written to Rev. C. F. Hives, enquiring what the cost would be to build stone chimneys in the Lac la Ronge School building. Nothing of course can be done in the way of building until next summer, but the materials required should be sent out before spring. A quantity of cement will be required, whatever plan may be decided on to ensure making the chimneys as safe as possible. My idea is, that if they were built of stone in the basement up to the ground floor, and then reinforced concrete placed around the existing chimneys from the ground floor upwards, in accordance with the plan that you suggested, they would be quite safe.\n\nThe first plan was a good one if it had been properly carried out, but the concrete outside of the flue pipes is too thin, and sometimes, in the course of construction, the boxing was taken off before the concrete was sufficiently set and hardened.\n\nAs you no doubt understand, each chimney has a pipe or smoke stack, from the floor of the basement to the top, and until these pipes are burnt out, they should be safe, but of course means should be taken, as soon as possible, to avoid all risk.\n\nI shall be glad to do anything that the Department wishes me to do in the matter, but, as the control of the Indian residential schools, is now absolutely out of the hands of the Diocesan authorities, it may be questioned whether it is advisable for me or any other Diocesan agent, to continue any activities in connection with them. Personally however I feel that, as the Department entrusted me with the erection of the building at Lac la Ronge, it is my duty to do what I can towards its satisfactory completion.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nR. Guernsey Orr Esq.\nArchitect for the Department,\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr Scott;-\n\nOn Nov. 27th, 1922, the Rev. Dr. Westgate, Secretary of our Indian Commission, wrote to you with regard to certain requirements needed to complete the Lac La Ronge School. Dr. Westgate has now written to me drawing attention to the fact that unless immediate action is taken on the letter in question it will not be possible to get the supplies through before Spring break-up. On Nov. 28th Dr. Westgate wrote a second letter to the Secretary of the Department with regard to the need of making larger provision for the laundry at Lac La Ronge, and also with regard to the supplying of mechanical equipment for the same. I shall be much obliged if you will let me know what action has been taken in connection with these important matters.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\nOttawa, April 4, 1923.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the requirements at the Lac la Ronge Indian Boarding School. The communications of your Dr. Westgate, dated November 27th and 28th, in this connection, were acknowledged by my No. 160-2 of December 4th; and I am pleased to inform you that arrangements have been made to ask Parliament to vote funds for a proper basement floor, for general repairs to the main building and to enlarge the laundry and equip it. Upon the advice of our architect, it was decided not to consider the erection of a verandah at this time.\n\nI regret that it will not be possible to order the materials and to arrange for the needed alterations and improvements until after our Estimates have passed the House.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

C. F. Hives, Principal of the School:\n\n\"240 feet 2 inch pipe connection required for new pump before sleighing closes. Please wire immediately Manville Hardware, Prince Albert, if purchase sanctioned.\"\n\nFrom the copy of Mr. Hive's letter dated January 15, which was forwarded to you in response to the request contained in your letter of December 12, No. 132-2-5, he states that the size of the pipe at present in use is 1\u00bd inch. It would appear from his telegram, as quoted above, that the pump you forwarded requires 2 inch pipe, and as it was important that this should be forwarded before the trails break up I wired the order to the Manville Hardware people in Prince Albert, to have the piping forwarded at once. The bill for this piping has not yet come to hand, and although I am quite aware that the sanction of your Department is required before payment of bills such as this can be met, I trust that under the circumstances you may approve of the action I have taken, and undertake to meet this bill when presented.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nREVILLON FRERES TRADING CO.

In connection with the accounts for freighting, it will be necessary for you to prepare vouchers, in duplicate, containing itemized statements of the various amounts paid. A pad of forms for this purpose is being sent you under separate cover. This supporting voucher should be made in your favour, certified by you and one copy of the receipts in each case attached thereto and returned to the Department. We require only one copy of these receipts and you may retain the duplicate.\n\nRegarding the account covering the labour and material on the storehouse and stable, I would point out that there is no receipt for the item of windows for storehouse and stables. We are not aware as to whether a cheque in payment of the amount due should be sent to the Hudson's Bay Co. as their account has not been receipted. The certificate attached by the Principal for the labour is satisfactory, but a properly certified account covering the cost of the windows should be forwarded. If payment is to be made to you, it will be necessary to have the accounts receipted by the Hudson's Bay Co. If, however, a cheque is to be sent the Company, a properly certified account from the Principal should be forwarded covering the cost of the windows. As soon as we have these accounts in proper order, as required above, payment will be made.\n\nI may say that, in future, when forwarding accounts for which payment is made to yourself, you should make out, in duplicate, an itemized voucher on the forms which are being sent you and it should be certified by you. The above instructions are in conformity with the requirements of the Auditor General before payments can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B.

Sir:\n\nThe Department has received the enclosed account from the Peterborough Canoe Company, Peterborough, covering the cost of the motor boat shipped to Prince Albert, Sask., for the Lac la Ronge Indian Boarding School. As you were informed in our letter of January 5th, last, the Peterborough Canoe Company was requested to forward their account, in duplicate, to you, and upon arrival of the boat, if found, after inspection, to be satisfactory and according to specifications, you were to certify the account and forward it to the Department in order that payment could be made. As this account has not yet been received from you, it is presumed that the Peterborough Canoe Company did not forward it to you. If, upon arrival, this boat proved satisfactory, you should certify the enclosed account, attach it to proper voucher forms and forward it to the Department in order that payment can be made as soon as possible.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department will pay the entire amount to the above firm. The sum of $500, which amount the Church promised to contribute towards the cost of this motor boat, was deducted from the grant to the Lac la Ronge School for the quarter ended March 31st, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

W. R. TAYLOR, PAYING AGENT FOR TREATY 10, ON HIS RECENT TRIP TO MAKE THE ANNUAL PAYMENTS TO THE INDIANS OF THE ISLE A LA CROSSE AGENCY.\n\nJAMES ROBERTS BAND:\nThis band at Lao La Ronge was paid on the 14th of July. I found this band in good health, and showing an increase of 8 over last year. The people here are nearly all Anglicans. The Residential School here had closed down for the summer holidays, I therefore could not examine the work of the pupils. There is a nice garden in connection with the school, which will produce nearly all the vegetables required. I mentioned in my report last year, the need of safer chimneys in this school, and I would again draw attention to this matter, as I found that no material had been supplied. The winter is the best time to get brick into this place, as the Brooks Transportation Co. do freighting to this point during the winter months from Prince Albert.\nOttawa, September 25, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Department on several occasions, the unsafe condition of the chimneys at Lac la Ronge School. In order to remedy this defect, you are authorized to have built stone or brick chimneys. It is thought, however, that stone chimneys can be more economically built than brick chimneys, using cement mortar, but the Department will leave to your judgment to decide which to use, as this will be governed by local conditions.\n\nIf stone chimneys are built, you should employ a competent stone mason and pay his expenses in and from the school, and wages while working. You may also purchase the amount of cement that will be required for the mortar.\n\nVouchers in duplicate should be submitted to the Department for all expenditures, and when labor is employed, time sheets should be kept showing the number of hours worked and the rate per hour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. F. MACKENZIE)\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nReverend Chas. F. Hives,\nPrincipal, Indian Boarding School,\nLac la Ronge - Sask.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Paying Agent Taylor's report on his recent trip to Treaty 10 making the annual payments to the Indians of the Isle a la Crosse Agency.\n\nI was surprised in reading over Mr. Taylor's report to note that nothing had been done regarding the chimney on the Lac la Ronge School to make it safe as I understood from your letter No. 132-2-5 of the 16th November last that this matter was being attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n(Sgd.)

Principal has been authorized to build stone or brick chimneys, whichever in his judgment would be the most suitable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, Sept. 28, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that certain funds have been provided for improvements at the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School. As freight facilities are best during the winter, I should be pleased if you would make a statement as to the needs at this institution. There has been some correspondence, relative to a new laundry building and to a proper floor in the basement. You should secure from the principal an estimate of the cost of a cement floor in the main building basement and add any information you may have, regarding the laundry requirements. In this last connection I have your letter of February 8th, last, with a copy of a communication from the Rev. Principal.\n\nI have to inform you that, under cover of the 25th instant, Rev. Mr. Hives was authorized to build stone or brick chimneys, to replace those at the institution which are in an unsafe condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter just received from the Rev. C. F. Hives, Principal of our Society's School at Lac la Ronge, he informs me of four very important requirements for that institution. They are as follows:\n\n1. Additional battery cells for the Delco Light system.\n   The following is an extract from his letter in this connection:\n   \"It is very necessary that we should have these during this coming winter. Our plant was supplied with 16 cells. It has been found that that number is insufficient, and the Delco Light Co. do not install any plants the size of ours with less than 32 cells. We need, therefore 16 additional cells, the cost of which will be about $250.00 delivered here.\"\n\n2. Pipe connections for the pump.\n   Last year your Department kindly furnished this school with a new pump, but when it arrived it was found that larger piping was required than what was on hand. As it was greatly desired that this piping should reach the school before the freighting season closed, I authorized the principal to secure it, but through the inability of our freight contractor to get it through to the school before the roads broke up, the school has been obliged to get along as best it could without it all through the summer. It is estimated that this will cost, delivered at the school, about $130.00, and as I have again given instructions for this to be taken through with the first loads of freight, I presume that it will be quite in order for me to submit the bill to you for payment as soon as it comes to hand. In this connection I should like to refer you to my letter of April 14, 1923, where the quantity and measurements of the pipe required are set forth.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs.\n\n3. Fire Hose Equipment.\nIn this connection Mr. Hives writes as follows:- \"We should also have fire hose equipment for our building. We have nothing in that respect at present, but I am more and more convinced that we should have this means of protection\".\n\n4. An Evinrude Engine.\nThe needfulness of this is set forth by Mr. Hives in the following words:- \"It requires a great deal of fish to keep us going, and either we will have to get an assistant fisherman or else get an Evinrude engine to attach to a boat for fishing. The latter I think would be the better as we will have to go farther away from the school in order to get the supply required for daily consumption. I was of the opinion that when we got our gasoline launch that we might be able to use it sometimes for this purpose, but it is really too good to be messed up with fish and would cost so much in the way of gasoline fuel that I do not think it should be used for that purpose.\"\n\nIf you will kindly give these requirements your earliest consideration I shall be deeply obliged.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.B. Westgate\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, Oct. 27, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to certain needs at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I wish to inform you that the Department will order and have delivered to the school 16 battery cells for the Delco light system. When the pipe connections for the new pump at this school have been satisfactorily completed, the Department will give favourable consideration to the vouchers which you will present in this connection. When you have received definite information from the Rev. Principal, relative to the fire hose required, I should be pleased if you would communicate again with the Department.\n\nYour request that the Department purchase an Evinrude engine for the small boat at the school cannot be given favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI am not at all satisfied about our fire escape system. We have a lot of small children in school. Would it be alright to put doors through the dormitory wall leading out to where the proposed veranda would be. This veranda will have to come, as it is the only proper means of fire escape for our building. Until we are authorized to build it, we would put up ladders from the proposed door to the ground. Please let me know regarding this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Chas. F; Hives.\nPrincipal.\nLac la Ronge, Sask.\nOct. 12, 1923.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have this day received orders from the Department of Indian Affairs to build new chimneys. The have left the mode of construction and choice of material to my discretion. We cannot do anything towards it until we get material from town in the way of cement. I am very sorry that the grant for building veranda has not gone through, and would earnestly beg you to place before the Department the absolute importance this erection is as a means of fire escape. At the present time we have no adequate means of fire escape for our children, and we have a great number of little ones. A thousand dollars would do the job, because Mr. Mayo would look after the construction of it. We would get to work at it as soon as we received authority. Please Doctor Westgate place this appeal for the veranda as a necessary means of fire escape very strongly.\n\nNow as we cannot build our new chimneys before the spring, and not being properly equipped as to a fire escape, and also having a school full of children, I think we had better start with a night watchman on the first of November, and continue with one for the five months instead of the four. Kindly let me know what you think of this.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Chas F. Hives.\n\nPrincipal.\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nAt King's College.\n\nHalifax, N.S.\n\nNov. 3rd, 1923\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI enclose copies of letters from the Rev. G. T. Harris, Principal of our School at Lac Le Jeune, and beg to commend his suggestion with regard to the fireplaces and fire escapes before favorable consideration. You may recall that after my visit to that institution many years ago, I visited the Indians as an important requirement, but being now absent from the office am unable to give you the date of any letter on this matter. I am particularly anxious, not only that the children and staff should be safe and comfortable, but also that no preventable misfortune should befall this or any other of the schools under our control which might bring our system of administration into disrepute, or even have so little to consume, and help our...\nTherefore, that the expenditure necessary to provide the\nmandates may be sanctioned.

Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have to bring to your notice the condition of some of the floors of our school. As you are aware, native Spruce lumber was used throughout in building, and in places this is worn so badly that it will have to be renewed next year. Two years seems to be a very short life, and yet two years seems to be the limit where there is very much traffic. When renewing, it would certainly pay to use hardwood. If five or six hundred dollars were spent each year in purchasing hardwood for flooring; it would take only three years to go through the whole building, and a fairly permanent job would be made. Some of the floors are in a bad state. On account of their being so rough, they hold the dirt, which when swept causes a very unsanitary state throughout the building. This aspect should be placed before the Department when writing them about this matter. I would also point out that some of the main rooms are still in an unfinished state. They require paint and Kalsomine. We should require about four hundred dollars for this. The exterior of the building should be repainted next year also. It required about forty gallons of paint for this.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Chas. F. Hives.\nPrincipal.\nToronto, Ontario, Dec. 4, 1923,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq., M.A.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nRE FLOORS AT LAC LA RONGE SCHOOL.\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter just received from the Principal of the Lac la Ronge School, which will speak for itself, but which I regret did not come to hand sooner. I am sending it forward, however, in the hope that you may be able to attach it to Page 6 of the list of requirements of our Society's Schools for next year, which were forwarded to Mr. Scott on the 22nd ultimo.\n\nI may say that I am referring back to the Principal all the points mentioned in this letter for more detailed information, and an estimate of the cost of each item, but would urge to suggest that some provision be made in the estimates for next year - say a round sum of one thousand dollars ($1000.) - for meeting the improvements suggested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nTBRW/FEQ.\nToronto, Ontario, Dec. 4, 1923,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRE CEMENT FLOOR FOR BASEMENT LAC LA RONGE SCHOOL.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of Sept. 28 (No. 132-2-5) in re the cost of a cement floor for the basement of the Lac la Ronge main school building, I beg to state that in a letter just received from the Principal (dated Nov. 1923) he estimates that fourteen (14) tons of cement will be required. In this connexion I may say, for your information, that after carefully discussing with your representative, Mr. Inspector Bunn of this city, the question of utilizing some other flooring material instead of cement, we came to the conclusion that the cement would be the most satisfactory, and the most economical in the long run. Mr. Inspector Bunn recommends that the cement be purchased direct from the Canada Cement Company, Winnipeg, and I am fully prepared to support this recommendation. In order that you might be able to estimate the total cost I asked the Canada Cement Co. for current prices, and received the following quotations:\n\n1 bbl. of 350 lbs (or 4 bags of 87\u00bd lbs ea.) $4.45\n(If Mr. Inspector Bunn were authorized to purchase the cement he might be able to get it at a lower rate.)\n\nIf the bags are returned 20\u00a2 is allowed for each, and a further reduction of 10\u00a2 per bag is made for ready cash, thus bringing the purchase price down to $3.35 per bbl., or a total cost of $1072.00 for the 14 tons.\n\nOf the freight from Winnipeg to Prince Albert I have no certain knowledge. The freight from Prince Albert to Lac la Ronge should be reckoned at the rate of $3.50 per hundred lbs., thus making the cost of freighting the 14 tons aggregate about $980.00\nWith regard to the freighting from Prince Albert, I may say that our Society has a contract with the Indian, Wm. Bear, and this was the rate at which we paid him last year. In the letter from the Principal already referred to, he states that the Revillon Freres are paying a white man named R. D. Brooks at the rate of $3.75 per 100 lbs. freightage this year. I should like to recommend that the contract be given to the Indian as he is a reliable man, and can handle it.\n\nAs all the cement is put up in bags (87\u00bd lbs) it should go through to the school during the winter months, in order to escape as much as possible damage from moisture. The earlier, therefore, the order can be placed, the better chance there will be for the freighting to be done before the roads break up in the spring.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/FEC.\nOttawa, December 12, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to the communication of the Deputy Superintendent General, dated the 19th ultimo, relative to verandahs at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. It has been drawn to my attention that the proposed verandahs should not extend across the front of the building, because of the effect it would have on the lighting of the rooms. You should instruct the principal that the structures which are to be primarily for fire escapes should be at the ends of the building.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, relative to a cement floor in the basement of the Lac la Ronge institution. Before the Department gives consideration to the expenditure, you should state whether there are any drainage arrangements in the basement and what use is to be made of it, if properly floored.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of Dec.12 (132-2-5) concerning fire escapes and cement floor in the basement of the school at Lac la Ronge, I beg to state that I am referring this communication to the Principal for further details. It will, of course, take some time to receive his reply, but I think it necessary to do this as your instructions with regard to the fire escapes being placed at the ends of the building do not appear to me to be the best arrangement. Before making any further suggestion to you on this point I should like to consult the Principal.\n\nYour further instruction that the proposed verandahs should not extend across the front of the building because of the effect it would have on account of the lighting of the rooms is one which will bring keen disappointment to the Principal and the staff as it now brings to me. As the class-rooms are at the ends of the building and are well lighted, a lower front verandah extending between the projecting ends where these are situated, would not be affected, and would be of immense comfort to the staff and the children. But I shall forward to you the opinion of the Principal in this connection when it comes to hand.\n\nWith regard to the basement, this at present is simply of dry earth, the bottom of the area which was excavated for the building. The furnace is there, and a good deal of fire wood will be kept there during the winter months. The engine, dynamo, and batteries are there, and it is difficult to keep these clean without a harder floor. On account of the inadequate space set apart for a laundry with a school of 100 children, part of the basement has to be used for that purpose throughout the winter months. These are some of the reasons why a good floor, preferably one of cement, is necessary, and although I shall\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nshall write to you again when I hear from the Principal, I beg to give you this information now so that you may, if you think well, order the cement in time for it to be sent through before the trails break up in the spring.\n\nWith regard to the drainage arrangements, I may say that a very good septic tank has been installed, and was giving, at the time of my visit last year, every satisfaction. Any further drainage which may be necessary could be installed without incurring any very heavy expenditure.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/FEO.\n| Quantity Ordered | Quantity Shipped | PARTICULARS          | Price | Amount |\n|------------------|------------------|----------------------|-------|--------|\n|                  |                  | Nov. 19 Mds. #6614   |       |        |\n|                  |                  | 1 Set of Batteries   |       | 252.39 |\n|                  |                  | Prepay freight to Pl A. |     |        |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our Society has already supplied the school with a pole saw, but in order to provide the vast amount of wood required it has been necessary for the school staff to borrow an engine from the Manager of the Hudson's Bay Post at that point. Such an arrangement is altogether unsatisfactory both to the school and to our Society, and I shall be grateful indeed if your Department will kindly furnish us with the engine required.\n\nThe Principal recommends a 6 horse power throttle governed kerosene engine, and points out that one of these if purchased from The T. Eaton Co., Winnipeg, (No. 441H-308) could be landed at Lac la Ronge at a total cost of $256.50.\n\nI shall be obliged, therefore, if you will give this request favourable consideration, and remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nVerry Poor Copy\n\nIndian Affairs.

My idea was to extend the wing which accommodates the present laundry, and make the proposed new laundry 20 x 28 ft. This to have a basement similar to the basement under the main part. To be connected with the main basement by a passage way, and to be heated with a pipeless furnace. This would have a room upstairs which would be used as a drying room, which would be connected with the present drying which could be used as an ironing room. The whole of the ground floor would be the laundry proper, and should be sufficiently large enough. Outside of proper laundry equipment we would require boiler connected with the stove, for the purpose of supplying sufficient hot water for the laundry. In a previous letter I suggested using the present laundry for a bake room. I really think this would be a great convenience for us. Our kitchen is small for a school of our pupilage, and it would relieve the congestion during busy time in the kitchen.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Chas. F. Hives.\n\nPrincipal.\nExtract from letter from Mr. Hives dated Jan. 13, 1924.\n\n\"Re proposed laundry:- I do hope this goes through this year. I sent in to you last year a proposition to convert the present laundry into a bake room. Since getting in so many more pupils, and now that we are to have another teacher, I think we can improve on the proposition by converting the present kitchen into a kindergarten room, and having the present laundry as a kitchen. This would make an excellent kitchen. Then I would propose that the partition between the dining room and present kitchen be made of collapsible doors, so that at such times as Christmas the two rooms could be turned into one large assembly room.

I should be pleased if you would indicate why the engine which the Department supplied two years ago cannot be used for this purpose. This engine was formerly used for pumping water and was referred to in your communication of January 26, 1923.\n\nI have also your letter of the 14th instant, relative to your request for a cement floor in the basement and a laundry addition in the case of the same school. I have noted the enclosures and in reply I wish to suggest an arrangement which, if satisfactory to you, might be given favourable consideration by the Department. Will the Rev. Principal purchase, after securing competitive prices, the necessary windows, doors, shingles, paper and hardware for the laundry addition and erect same on a 20' x 28' basement; will he purchase, after securing competitive prices, two tubs and two hand washers for the laundry, two kitchen sinks complete with piping, a laundry stove and a pipeless furnace with necessary leads and floor registers; will he purchase, after securing competitive prices, sufficient cement for the laundry basement and for the floor of the laundry; will he arrange for the necessary lumber and labour and ensure an addition in keeping with the rest of the building - all provided that the Department pay accounts for materials and freight up to $1500? If so, you should communicate with the Department and your request will receive favourable consideration. I wish to inform you that two small, inexpensive hand washers are suggested as a large cylindrical washer is not considered suitable for an Indian residential school so distant from a freight office.

Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI would place before you, for your consideration, the matter of moving our saw mill from its present location to one further away from the main school building. At present it is not more than one hundred and fifty feet away from the main school building, and almost directly in front, thereby spoiling the general appearance of the place. It is moreover a menace to the building on account of fire. There is always a great deal of inflammable material around a saw mill, and if this ever caught fire the school building would be in great danger. The building in which the sawing machinery is housed is only a very temporary affair, and will soon have to be rebuilt. I would point out to you the great value of having such an outfit here. Not only in connection with the school, but also for the Indians at Lac la Ronge and Stanley. They get all their lumber manufactured here, and are therefore able to build fairly decent houses. If we had a help of five hundred dollars, the plant could be moved, and the machinery placed on a good and permanent foundation, and under a safe roof. Would you therefore place this matter before the Department of Indian Affairs, and see if they would do something towards helping to move the plant, and housing it properly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Chas. F. Rives.\nPrincipal.\nToronto, Ontario, March 12, 1934,\n41-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE MOVING THE SAW-MILL AT LAC LA RONGE\n\nYou will recollect that during my recent visit (Feb. 19) to your Department, I mentioned the necessity of having the saw-mill at Lac la Ronge moved to another site, and was requested to furnish you with a written statement in this connexion. In compliance with this request I enclose herewith a copy of a letter from the Principal dealing with this matter, and will be obliged if you will let me know if your Department will honour time sheets kept by the Principal in connexion with labour employed in the moving of this mill, to the amount specified, namely five hundred dollars ($500.00).\n\nI may say that having visited this school I am in full agreement with the Principal's suggestion that the mill should be moved to a site further away from the school.\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.O.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The M. S. C. C. representative explained the matter to me during his recent visit. The saw-mill, which will soon have to be rebuilt, is 150 ft. almost directly in front of the main school building. The appearance of the institution is spoiled and there is danger of fire because of the inflammable nature of the materials in the mill. It is proposed to move it some 200 yards away, to place it on a permanent foundation and under a safe roof. The principal is prepared to undertake the work if the Department makes a grant of $500 for the labour which he will have to employ. May I have your instructions.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, March 30, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the moving of the saw-mill at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. In reply I have to inform you that the Department will allow $500 for labour that the Principal will have to employ in this work. The saw-mill should be moved at least 200 yards and should be placed on a permanent foundation and under a safe roof. The Principal should keep proper time sheets in duplicate for the labour employed and should submit them to the Department with receipts covering the payments to the labourers.

I may say that we have already made extensive preparations in getting out logs &c. The main objection to building the verandah along the whole front of the main building seems to be the fear of shutting out the light. All the rooms affected would be staff rooms. No class-rooms or dormitories would in any way be affected. The building faces the south, and so the verandah would, in the summer, be an advantage in shading the windows. It would moreover be a great convenience to the whole school, as the projection caused by the two wings at the ends of the main building allow for ample space for sleeping porches, in case we may have pupils who require out of doors treatment. One other thing in favor for having a verandah along the whole length of the building is that it makes a very adequate and reliable fire escape. The staff, as well as the children, have to be considered. You will notice it provides a door issuing from the Principal's room. In case of fire at either end of the building, the staff would be able to run along the verandahs and open the doors leading into the dormitories. You will notice by the plan enclosed that the exit is by ladder. After thinking it over I have come to the conclusion that sliding poles will be better. I have not the least hesitation in saying that in every way the full verandah will be a great advantage over the partial ones and as appearances have to be considered, the full verandah will make a very imposing structure.\n\nIn case the Department view this proposal with favor, which I sincerely hope they may, I am enclosing a list of material we shall require for the purpose. I received quotations on prices from Manville Hardware, and comparing these with T.Eaton Company, Manville Hardware, Prince Albert, is\nbelow in price. He is also reliable. I therefore think it would be as well to order these at Manville Hardware as it will save time as well. The season is getting late and we shall have to make a move at once in order to get material here this winter.\n\nThe other part of letter is relative to cement floor for basement. I may say that the sewage pipes go along the basement floor, and that there are arrangements made in the pipe for drainage, in case we should ever get a cement floor.\n\nI may say that if there is any choice in the matter of getting either the cement floor or new laundry, I would urgently advise choosing the laundry. In many ways the building of a new laundry will be a very valuable asset to our work. At present we have to use one of the playrooms for a class-room. This is very inconvenient, and is not fair to the children. If a new laundry is built the present kitchen could be converted into a very convenient class-room, and use the present laundry as a kitchen. I explained all this in a previous letter, and enclosed list of requirements for building. A new laundry is very necessary to the successful working of this institution.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nCHARLES F.

I may say that we have already made extensive preparations in getting out logs &c. The main objection to building the verandah along the whole front of the main building seems to be the fear of shutting out the light. All the rooms affected would be staff rooms. No class-rooms or dormitories would in any way be affected. The building faces the south, and so the verandah would, in the summer, be an advantage in shading the windows. It would moreover be a great convenience to the whole school, as the projection caused by the two wings at the ends of the main building allow for ample space for sleeping porches, in case we may have pupils who require out of doors treatment. One other thing in favor for having a verandah along the whole length of the building is that it makes a very adequate and reliable fire escape. The staff, as well as the children, have to be considered. You will notice it provides a door issuing from the Principal's room. In case of fire at either end of the building, the staff would be able to run along the verandahs and open the doors leading into the dormitories. You will notice by the plan enclosed that the exit is by ladder. After thinking it over I have come to the conclusion that sliding poles will be better. I have not the least hesitation in saying that in every way the full verandah will be a great advantage over the partial ones and as appearances have to be considered, the full verandah will make a very imposing structure.\n\nIn case the Department view this proposal with favor, which I sincerely hope they may, I am enclosing a list of material we shall require for the purpose. I received quotations on prices from Manville Hardware, and comparing these with T.Eaton Company, Manville Hardware, Prince Albert, is\nbelow in price. He is also reliable. I therefore think it would be as well to order these at Manville Hardware as it will save time as well. The season is getting late and we shall have to make a move at once in order to get material here this winter.\n\nThe other part of letter is relative to cement floor for basement. I may say that the sewage pipes go along the basement floor, and that there are arrangements made in the pipe for drainage, in case we should ever get a cement floor.\n\nI may say that if there is any choice in the matter of getting either the cement floor or new laundry, I would urgently advise choosing the laundry. In many ways the building of a new laundry will be a very valuable asset to our work. At present we have to use one of the playrooms for a class-room. This is very inconvenient, and is not fair to the children. If a new laundry is built the present kitchen could be converted into a very convenient class-room, and use the present laundry as a kitchen. I explained all this in a previous letter, and enclosed list of requirements for building. A new laundry is very necessary to the successful working of this institution.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nCHARLES F.

SCHOOL. --\n\nWith further reference to your letter of March 29, (No.132-2-5) concerning the expenditure which may be incurred this year at our Society's Indian Residential School at Lac la Ronge, you state as follows:\n\n\"the Department has already authorized the expenditure of $500 for the purpose of moving the saw-mill and is prepared to give favorable consideration to an expenditure of $1,900 in connection with a cement floor and laundry addition at the school\".\n\nA copy of this letter was forwarded to the Principal for his information, and he has expressed to me his fear, based on the wording of your letter, that you are expecting him not only to build the laundry, but also to put down a cement floor in the school for the sum of $1,900.\n\nAs the building of the laundry will require a good deal, if not all of the $1,900, it is quite clear that the two works mentioned cannot be undertaken for the sum specified. The building of the laundry therefore will be pushed forward with all the vigour possible this summer, and I trust that the expenditure incurred in this connexion, up to, but not exceeding the sum of $1,900, will be met by your Department, and I shall be glad to have a statement from you to this effect. If the full sum is not required, I can assure you it will not be spent.\nThe cement floor in the basement cannot be undertaken this year, but should be done not later than the summer of 1925. In order to do this, the cement should be sent in during the freighting season of next winter.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.O.C.\n\nTBRW/X.\nOttawa, June 28, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, regarding the expenditure authorized in building a laundry and cement floor at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. It is noted that the amount authorized, viz.: $1900, will be required in the erection of the laundry building. An expenditure up to but not exceeding this amount may be used for the construction of the laundry building. Properly certified vouchers in duplicate, with receipted accounts attached for the cost of the material and labour, should be forwarded when the work has been completed.\n\nRegarding the cement floor in the basement, no funds can be provided this year for the purpose, but this requirement will be noted for our next year's Estimates. You may inform the principal of the amount available for the building of the laundry, viz.: $1900.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

I shall be glad therefore, if you will have the engine shipped at your earliest convenience, consigned to the Rev. C.F. Hives, Principal Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, Care of Messrs. Revillon Freres, Prince Albert, who will receive it and give it careful storage until the freighting season opens.\n\nBelieve me, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/K.\nOttawa, July 8th, 1924.\n\nRev.

Revillon Freres, Prince Albert, Sask. Rev. Dr. Westgate, the Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England, 41-43 The Bible House, Winnipeg, has made a request for this engine.\n\nIt is considered that Winnipeg would be a good centre in which to obtain competitive prices, and I shall be pleased if you will undertake the purchase and delivery of this engine. You might consult Dr. Westgate and ascertain full particulars as to the type of engine required. You should then obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers, and place the order with the firm quoting you the lowest price F.O.B. Prince Albert, Sask., sales tax included. Dr. Westgate has forwarded a quotation from the T. Eaton Co., Winnipeg, for an engine of the above mentioned horse power, their Catalogue No. 441M-308. When the purchase has been made, you should arrange to have the engine shipped, complete, to Rev. C. F. Hives, Principal, Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School, c/o Messrs. Revillon Freres, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nYou should obtain an account, in duplicate, from the firm from whom you make the purchase, and you will be good enough to certify the same and forward it to the Department for payment. You should also forward an abstract of the tenders received, showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nWe hope that you will be able to arrange for the purchase and shipment of this engine at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI am enclosing a list of our most urgent needs for next year.\n\nCement for basement floor:\nThis will be a big job, and should not, I think, all be attempted in one year, because the expense will be great, and there are other things that must be dealt with, and also because we shall have to do the work ourselves. I think it will be a little too much for us to tackle in one year. If we asked for three tons of cement for this time, and do as far as it will go, and then complete the job another year.\n\nFlooring for main rooms in building:\nI spoke of this last year. The floors in the main rooms are getting very badly worn, and should, in many places be renewed. Hardwood flooring would be the more lasting and sanitary. The building is worth a good floor. Five thousand square feet of flooring would renew floors in all main rooms.\n\nPaint for Building:\nThe outside of the building was painted two years ago, and should have another coat now. Twenty four gallons of paint would be required for this work. Twenty of pearl grey, four of olive green. The inside of the building has not yet been completed. We need two hundred lbs. of white lead, twenty gallons of boiled oil, five gallons of turps, five gallons of varnish, one dozen pound paint brushes, six dozen packages of Alabastine and three brushes for putting on same.\n\nBatteries for light:\nLast year the Department supplied us with a battery of sixteen cells. These we tried to connect as per instructions from Light people, but the old ones were too far gone to allow us doing this. We had, therefore to remove the old ones, and work with the new ones only. Now that our building is growing, and according to advice from the Delco Light people, we must have another set of sixteen cells, similar to the ones we received last year, if we are to retain satisfactory light. So far our light plant has not given the least trouble, and it has been steadily in operation for nearly three years. I do hope therefore that the Department will allow us this battery, and that it will come in as early as possible this winter.\n\nFlush tanks for toilets:\nThe toilet flush tanks sets procured for our School in the first instance were of a very inferior quality, and have given a lot of trouble in the way of wasting water. We need half a dozen new sets to replace those we have.\n\nIn connection with our compression tank:\nWe were supplied five two inch valves for the purpose of getting water from different parts. There has always been a great waste of water.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 3)\nto Prince Albert to be ground. The mechanic, to whom the valve was sent, said that it was the wrong kind of a valve. That it was a steam valve, and not a valve for a compression tank. The Department bought these tanks for us, and will know from whom they came. We should have these valves supplied as soon as possible. I have had to procure one in place of the one I sent down, and the cost of the new one is $13.50.\n\nOur School pupilage has increased since the School was erected. We now have one hundred and six pupils, and have only four bath tubs for that number. I think we should have two more at least.\n\nSeptic tank:\nWe require thirty sacks of cement to construct a larger septic tank. The one we have does very well during the summer, but when the severe cold weather comes, it is not large enough.\n\nWhile the treaty paying agent was here I spoke to him about a fireproof roof for our building. I do not know if he will do anything about it, but I rather think he will.\n\nNow I think I have mentioned most of our urgent needs, and hope that they may be granted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd.) Chas. F. Hives\nPrincipal\n\nLac la Ronge, Sask.\nSept. 15, 1924\n\n\"Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have a very special request to make which I would be glad if it could be put through as soon as possible.\n\nYou will likely remember our fisherman's dwelling. Well it is a miserable affair, and a disgrace to the rest of our institutions. It was bad enough during the old days, but now it seems, and is entirely out of place. Moreover it is unfit for any man to live in. It is built of logs, and is not weather proof by any means. We have to have a separate dwelling for the Fisherman. Firstly because the present one, who is more or less of a permanency, as he is married to a native of this part, has a family, and secondly it is better to have the fish cleaning away from the school building.\n\nWould you please try and get us six hundred dollars to put up a place for a fisherman's house. That is not a very large sum, but it is sufficient, and we can do very well on that amount.\n\nI would be very glad if this could be negotiated before the cold weather comes.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd.)

C.F. Rives, Principal, Lac la Ronge School who is now in Winnipeg, has brought to my attention, the very urgent need of the 16 Battery Cells for the Delco Lighting System referred to in his letter of September 13th, copy of which was attached to my letter referred to above.\n\nYou will recollect (see your letter December 10th, 1923 No. 132-2-5) that 16 Battery Cells were forwarded to this school at the close of 1923, to supplement those already installed there. When the attempt was made to connect the new cells with the old ones, it was found to be quite impossible, as the old ones, being insufficient in number, were overtaxed, and as a result were practically worn out.\n\nThe same thing will probably happen to the Cells sent in in 1923, unless they are supplemented (before they have had much further use) by the 16 Battery Cells referred to in the correspondence above, and I write to call your attention to this important matter.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nand to ask that steps be taken for the purchase of these extra cells, and their transportation to the School, before the present freighting season closes.\n\nBelieve me,\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/T.\nOttawa, January 26, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of the 16th ultimo, enclosing a voucher covering the cost of glass to repair windows at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. This account is being paid; but I have to request you to discontinue forwarding accounts of this nature. The Department's policy is to ask residential schools to make replacements to windows, except in the event of hail or other catastrophe.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Sixteen cells, costing $252.39, were sent to the school at that time, to supplement the 16 old cells. It is now reported that when they were connected up the old ones had to be discarded. It appears that 32 cells are required for the plant at the school, to prevent over-taxing.\n\nI wish to recommend that 16 new cells be sent to the school, to be used with the present equipment so that satisfactory lighting will result. I fear that the present battery will be run down at an early date if it is not supplemented. The cost will be approximately $250.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, January 27, 1925.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nYou will remember that I placed an order with you in November, 1923, for 16 battery cells, Exide 160 A.H., 8 hour rating (KXC). This Department now requires 16 additional cells to supplement the present equipment. Please make shipment, carefully packed, to Rev. C. F. Hives, Principal, Indian Residential School, Lac la Ronge, in care of Revillon Freres Trading Co., Limited, Prince Albert, Sask. The account, in duplicate, should be sent to the Rev. Principal, so that he may certify to it upon the arrival of the equipment, and forward it to the Department for payment. Shipment should be made as soon as possible upon receipt of this order. If possible, you should arrange to have these cells overcharged, so that they will reach Lac la Ronge at full strength.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H.

Mr. Hives states that it was imperative that these repairs be purchased as owing to the constant leakage there was great danger of the pipes freezing and the water supply being cut off.\n\nI append herewith an extract from a letter received from Mr. Hives some time ago in connection with this matter.\n\n\"In connection with our compression tank:- With the tanks were supplied five two inch valves for the purpose of closing off the water from different parts. There has always been a leakage through these valves, causing trouble from freezing in the winter. This summer I had one taken out, and sent down to Prince Albert to be ground. The mechanic, to whom the valve was sent, said that it was the wrong kind of a valve. That it was a steam valve, and not a valve for a compression tank. The Department bought these tanks for us, and will know from whom they came. We should have these valves replaced as soon as possible. I have had to procure one in place of the one I sent down. And the cost of a new one is $13.50.\"\n\nTrusting that the accounts may receive favourable consideration,\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nEWM/IMC\nOffice Secretary\n| Item Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|----------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Only Fire Hose Brackets          | 5        | $5.00      | $25.00|\n| Nozzles 1\u00bd x 10                  | 5        | $1.37      | $6.85 |\n| Valves 1\u00bd                         | 6        | $3.50      | $21.00|\n| Case                             |          | $1.25      | $1.25 |\n| Freight to Prince Albert         |          |            | $54.10|\n\nTotal: $56.06\n\nEXAMINED and found correct.\n\nCertified Correct\n\nChas.

C.F. Hives, Principal Anglican Indian School, Lac la Ronge, Sask., for hose brackets etc., which were omitted last year in connection with the fire fighting equipment sent in.\n\nSix brackets, six nozzles and six valves were sanctioned but through an error the Company only forwarded one bracket, one nozzle and no valves at all so that the hose sent in last year has been practically useless until the arrival of these extra parts.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst. Secretary & Treasurer\nSir:\n\nI have to bring to your notice the matter of our sewage disposal system conditions, which is a constant menace to proper sanitary state and the good health of pupils and staff.\n\nAt present we have not a septic tank. When the school was built, there was no provision made for the construction of a septic tank, and although this matter was pointed out to the church authorities, (The school at that time being under the control of the Diocese of Saskatchewan,) the matter was not considered to be of much importance.\n\nWith a school pupilage of fifty or sixty as in the old days, it would be possible for a cesspool to handle the disposal, but we have double that number of pupils in at the present time, and if we had the accommodation etc., it would be an easy matter to get half as many again pupils at short notice. A cesspool, therefore, is not capable of handling the sewage from our school without a great deal of filthy work and without being a constant menace to our whole system.\n\nUp to the present time we have been able to look after this matter by being constantly on the watch in attending to the cesspool. But this is no easy matter during the winter months. And now that we have such a large pupilage, the matter becomes more acute.\n\nIf a properly constructed septic tank were adopted, we should have no difficulty in our sewage disposal. What we require is enough cement, the actual septic tank connections, the necessary tile for liquefying after leaving chamber of septic tank, and a man to look after the work.\n\nTreaty Paying Agent saw the present system last July, and could give you information regarding the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Chas. F. Hives.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter from the Principal of our Society's school at Lac la Ronge setting forth the necessity of having a septic tank installed at that institution.\n\nOn page 4 in the List of Requirements which accompanied my letter to the Deputy Superintendent General on the 30th of Oct. last, you will find this item mentioned under the Lac la Ronge School and a further reference made to it on page 8 of that same list where the Principal stated as follows:-\n\n\"We require thirty sacks of cement to construct a large septic tank. The one we have does very well during the summer but when the severe cold weather comes it is not large enough.\"\n\nAs the construction of a proper septic tank sufficient for an institution of not less than 110 children and a staff of 12 is a matter of first rate importance to this institution, I beg to request that steps be taken to have the same completed before the beginning of next winter. You will notice from the second last paragraph in the enclosed letter that in order to have this accomplished the following are required:\n\n(1) A quantity of cement; (2) Septic tank connections; (3) Tile; (4) A man to do the work.\n\nWhile special stress is laid by the Principal in the enclosed letter on the indispensable necessity of having the septic tank provided this year I beg to direct your attention to the other items therein mentioned and to request that those which have not yet been furnished should be supplied during the coming fiscal year.\n\nWith regard to the cement floor in the basement I understand from your letter of June 28, 1924 (132-2-5), that provision would be made for this purpose in the ensuing year's\nestimates and I greatly hope that this provision has not been overlooked.\n\nBelieve me, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Bake Oven for Lac la Ronge, Sask:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of our Society's school at Lac la Ronge in a letter just received from him calls my attention to the great inconvenience which he and his staff are suffering on account of the lack of a proper bake oven for that institution.\n\nIn his letter, which is dated Feb. 11th, he states that the oven which was supplied was too small in the first place even for the attendance of pupils only about half the number of those at present enrolled, and this being the case it is altogether too small for a school of the present size and with the greatly increased enrollment.\n\nAs a lack of a proper bake oven means a waste of flour and as this is one of the heaviest items of the expenditure which our Society has to meet at this remotely situated school, I shall be very much obliged if you will take steps to have a suitable bake oven provided at your earliest convenience.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n**INVOICE**\n\nPRINCE ALBERT: SASK.

I again wrote to him on the 13th of August on the same subject. He replied saying that he wished to expend the $1000.00 in re-modelling the old hospital into a Principal's residence. I gave him authority to do this; at the same time pointing out that the authority was for only $1000.00. He replied to me on the 20th of August, saying that the work would be carried out by his Mr. Hives, and the sum would not exceed $1000.00.\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

He assured me in that letter that they would not exceed the $1000.00 sanctioned by me, and went on to say, if Mr. Hives does not use the whole of this sum in building the new residence he would be glad if I would authorize him to spend the balance in providing equipment. This I would not authorize until I had a list submitted, showing how much money he had saved, and what equipment he proposed to purchase with same. This list he never furnished.\n\nI am today in receipt of a report and vouchers sent direct to me by Mr. Hives, in which you will notice that he has exceeded his authority by $735.14, and I wish to point out to the Department that I take no responsibility in connection with this matter. Dr. Westgate pointed out that Mr. Hives was a practical man, and as the Department instructed me to hand the work over to him, I had nothing further to say.\n\nI did not call for the tenders, therefore, I have not signed the yellow sheets. I will, however, sign the vouchers, and it is for the Department to decide whether the amount of $735.14 is to be deducted or not.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nApril 1, 1925.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI have made a study of the file for the past 15 months, with a view to learning what authority has been directed and what expenditure has been incurred in connection with plant and equipment at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. This school has received quite favourable consideration. The accounts which Mr. Graham forwards under cover of his letter of the 23rd ultimo are alright as far as authority is concerned. We gave Dr. Westgate permission to expend $1900 on laundry. Accounts totalling $1199.15 have already been paid. Commissioner Graham had authority to expend $1000 in connection with the principal's residence at this school. The accounts totalling $1733.14, which he presents now, cover not only the principal's residence but the balance of the expense in connection with the laundry. The total authorization for both laundry and residence was $2900 and all bills amount to $2932.29. Although the expenditure should have been incurred earlier; in view of the distance of the school from the regular lines of communication, the accounts are only now all to hand.\n\nEarlier correspondence presents the urgency of a fisherman's residence ($600) and painting and new flooring for the main building ($1000). These two items are being voted for 1925-26. Replacements to the water system and a fireproof roof have been noted for future estimates. $1600 will be available for the school this fiscal year. $250 has already been expended for urgent replacements to electric light battery. The Church authorities have also requested us to supply a bake oven and to build a larger septic tank. It may be that the management and Church authorities would prefer to have the last two activities undertaken and postpone, if necessary, the fisherman's residence and the painting and new floors for main building.\n**LEMEEDENISON ELECTRIC Limited**\n\n123 STREET EAST\n\nExide BATTERIES\n\nSERVICE STATION\n\nDISTRIBUTOR\n\nDelco KLAXON\n\nREMY\n\nDISTRIBUTOR\n\nBOSCH DISTRIBUTORS and SERVICE STATION\n\nSaskatoon, Sask., Feb. 10th, 1925\n\nSold to C.

C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, April 3, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the advisability of installing a new septic tank at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. In earlier correspondence, you have urged the provision of a fisherman's residence and the painting of the main building as well as some new flooring. There was an item included in the 1925-26 Estimates in this connection and I should now be pleased to learn from you which improvements you consider most urgent.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, I have to inform you that favourable consideration could not be given to placing an item for a cement floor to the basement in the Estimates, as it was doubtful if the expense of such an undertaking was warranted by the benefits to be derived.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C.

Wentgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.U.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Wentgate:\n\nRe yours of April 6th\n\nI have thought over this letter very carefully, and will first of all deal with each item, and sum up with what I think is most important in the way of improvements.\n\nFisherman's Residence. I may say that we have pulled to pieces the old hospital building, and have put up a very compact and convenient house at a convenient site. If we could get the Department to give us $200.00 to finish this off in the way of paint etc., we should manage well. I explained to you and the Department, that the old hospital building was not at all fit for a principal's residence, and therefore we built an entirely new building on the same site, after pulling the hospital away. Then we thought of turning it into a fisherman's residence, but I concluded that it was not very suitable for such a purpose, and so, as it was made of rough lumber, I had it pulled to pieces, the lumber put through the planer, and we have built a very compact, and suitable house for the fisherman.\n\nCement for basement floor. If it will be any help towards getting the other requirements I am prepared to do my best to get along without this.\n\nHardwood flooring. I wonder if we could get this before the close of next trafficking season. That is by next March. This would cost in the neighborhood of $100.00.\n\nPaint for buildings. This is very important, if we are to keep the buildings looking decent, and in a sanitary condition. I may say that a large portion of the interior has never received any paint or color wash on the walls, and that the part finished has been at the expense of the Commission.\n\nBatteries for light plant. These have been supplied and so do not need to be dealt with.\n\nPlugh tanks for toilets. This is very necessary. It is not a very large item, and should not cost more than $100.00. I would urge this.\n\nValves for compression. We shall not require these now, as we have moved our pump and engine into the basement, and therefore done away with danger from frost.\n\nSeptic tank. This is very necessary, and will be the most expensive item. This must be done for the sake of the sanitary conditions. At present it is a great abomination, as well as a great danger.\nFireproof roof for main building. I have been thinking this thing over, and believe that proper spark arrestors for the chimneys could be procured, and as we have done away with the kitchen chimney on main roof, the roof would be protected sufficiently.\n\nFirst then is:\n1. Septic tank.\n2. Paint and color wash for building; -750\n3. Flush tanks for 6 toilets.\n4. $200.00 for finishing fishermen's house.\n5. Spark arrestors for 4 chimneys.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) Chas. F. Hives,\nPrincipal.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nGENERAL SECRETARY\nREV. CANO.

School,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of March 27th last, and your reply of April 3rd (132-2-5) relative to the improvements most urgently required at our Society's School at La Lo Ronge, I beg to state that the delay in communicating with you in this connexion is due to the fact that I considered it advisable to refer your letter to the Principal for his information, and for any suggestions or recommendations which he might wish to make.\n\nHis reply has just come to hand and you will please find a copy enclosed herewith. I would direct your attention to the summary given at the close and, beg to state, that the order, as given by the Principal, in which the improvements should be provided has my full approval. His remarks with regard to the installation of a septic tank in place of the cess pool now in use, are in no wise exaggerated. The situation is such that it would be difficult for any language to over-state it.\n\nWith regard to the conversion of the old hospital building into the Fisherman's residence, the action taken received the approval of your Commissioner.\n\nSeeing that the Principal is willing not to press for the cement flooring for the basement I greatly hope that you may be able to provide the other improvements as requested.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 6, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the requirements of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. I note that you and the Rev. Principal are of the opinion that a septic tank should be provided without delay. As you have been informed, certain funds are available for improvements at this school, but before a decision can be reached with reference to the other improvements, it will be necessary to learn just what the septic tank will cost. The Department Architect is prepared to draw a plan and issue instructions in connection with the installation of a septic tank when more information is to hand. Our officer should know the type and size of cesspool now in use and the nature of its materials. It may be possible to use it as the first chamber of a septic tank. It will also be necessary to have a plan of the grounds showing the position of the buildings, present cesspool, proposed septic tank and its outlet. The nature of the soil should be determined and the fall from the building indicated.\n\nThe septic tank will cost a considerable sum and it can be authorized only after sufficient thought has been given to the installation so that its success will be assured.\n\nYou are authorized to expend the sum of $300 for paint and other materials for the decorating of the main building and the finishing of the fisherman's cottage. The Department has been under heavy expense in connection with this school during the past few years, and I consider that your Society should be responsible for flush tanks for the toilets and spark arresters for the chimneys.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. G.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with your letter of June 6th relative to the installation of a septic tank at the Lac la Ronge School, I beg to furnish you with the following information just received in a letter from the Principal dated June 29th. He writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"RE THE DISPOSAL SYSTEM. The School stands on a south-east slope and facing that direction. The cesspool which is a hole in the ground lined with lumber lies sixty feet east of the building. As far as I can see that direction is the only available one for the septic tank. To the rear of the building, and also north-west the ground rises. The great disadvantage is that the school was built on a slope instead of on the top of the hill.\n\nI do not think the cesspool would do for a first chamber. In fact it would cost more in time and cement to do anything with it than it would to construct an entirely new one. We can utilize the cesspool so as to handle the waste from the laundry, as I understand that the same counteracts the working of the septic tank.\n\nWhile on the way down I had the good fortune to fall in with the contractor who did the work on the Elkhorn (Mr. Wyatt) and he gave me some very helpful suggestions regarding septic tanks. He said that a septic tank with double chambers each 6'x6'x6' would handle the disposal from our School. To construct this with concrete we would require 32 sacks of cement, which would cost $260.00 landed at Lac la Ronge. One hundred and fifty feet of soil pipe, costing $202.00 f.o.b. Lac la Ronge. Pig lead etc. for joints and extra labour...\"\n$200.00. The total cost I estimated would be $673.00. We have the actual septic tank connections, and cast iron man holes and covers. I can look after the work myself, and so do away with expert expense.\n\nMy suggestion is to construct the septic tank thirty feet from the building, the same to handle the bathroom and toilets. Not to have the laundry waste run into it, but to run latter into the cesspool from which it can be pumped when necessary. The outlet from the septic tank would also connect with this. From this cesspool we have drainage through the soil. I think if these suggestions are carried out we should have no difficulty with our disposal system.\n\nThe above information will, I trust, be sufficient for your purpose, but if there is any information which you desire I shall be glad to furnish it on receipt of your request.\n\nI am deeply obliged to you for your authorization to expend the sum of $300.00 for paint etc for the decoration of the main building and the fisherman's cottage, and I have notified the Principal of this authorization and have asked him to undertake the work and submit an account with vouchers in the usual way.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/JF.\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, July 10, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to a sewage disposal system at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. The Department Architect considers that the scheme mentioned in the Rev. Principal's letter to you would be quite satisfactory and you are authorized to purchase, after securing competitive prices, 32 sacks of cement and 150 feet of soil pipe. I note that you estimate the cost of these materials will be $462 at Lac la Ronge, all freight costs paid. You may also authorize the Principal to expend the sum of $200 for expert or heavy labour. Labour returns in duplicate should be kept, showing the time of the men engaged and their receipts. Under separate cover, copies of labour return forms are being directed to you. Please see that no unnecessary expense is incurred in this connection.\n\nFunds are available for a certain amount of flooring for the main building. The Department considers that e.g. fir is suitable for this purpose, and I should be pleased if you would make a recommendation as to the best method of expending $600 in this connection. It will be necessary to know whether expert labour is required and how much flooring is needed for the rooms that are in the worst condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 132-2-5, dated the 10th instant, referring to matters at our Lac la Ronge School. Your letter states that under separate cover labour return forms are being forwarded to this office for use in connection with the work. It would appear that there has been an error made in regard to these forms as the enclosed are those received by us, which do not appear to be correct.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Rives, Lac la Ronge, Sask., and to say that before payment can be made, the account should be certified by the Principal of the School. You can either send it direct to him or to the official who placed the order with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent.\n\nMessrs. Crane Limited,\n602 Eleventh Ave. West,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDear Sir:\n\nLast year, the Department very kindly made a grant towards the fixing up of the hospital building at the Boarding School at Lac la Ronge in order to make it fit for a Principal's residence. This was done, and a very comfortable residence has been built in every way in keeping with the school building. I regret to say, however, that we have very little furniture to put in it.\n\nDuring the fire of five years ago, my wife and I lost all our personal property in the way of furniture, clothing etc., excepting what we happened to be wearing at the time. A few years previous to that I had bought furniture for our rooms in the school, and of course this was all lost.\n\nIf the Department could help towards buying furniture for the new residence, I assure you it would be greatly appreciated. A grant of five hundred dollars would purchase all the necessary furniture needed.\n\nI am at present in Calgary, and would like to buy the furniture before I return to Lac la Ronge next month, as I do not expect to be in civilization again for three years after my return to work.\n\nIf the Department can possibly give this matter favorable consideration, would you kindly communicate this with Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, DD., our Field Secretary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal,\nBoarding School,\nLac la Ronge, Sask.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 6, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to furnishings for the principal's residence at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. The Department has been under heavy expense at this school during the past and present fiscal years, and I regret that the Department cannot add to its responsibilities at the present time.

They stipulate the expenditure of $600.00 in this connection. I have made inquiries re best fir flooring, and find that it is worth $74.00 per thousand f.o.b. Prince Albert. That the weight per thousand is 2000 lbs. Which means another $60.00 so that it is worth $134.00 f.o.b. Lac la Ronge.\n\nI would recommend therefore, that 4000, four thousand be procured, and also nails, paper, quarter round etc. We can do the work ourselves, and therefore do not require any expert labour. My assistant is an expert carpenter, and is well able to do the work properly.\n\nThis should be bought this fall, so that it may go in by the first freight teams.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) Chas. F. Hives.\nPrincipal\nBoarding School,\nLac la Ronge, Sask.\n\nI must say that I received these prices from Cushing Bros., Saskatoon, who have always given very fair rates in our dealings with them. Also re flooring. I recommend that we should use the 4000 ft. of flooring on the floors that most need it, as far as it will go.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nGENERAL SECRETARY\nREV.

C. F. Hives, Principal of this institution, setting forth his suggestions in connexion with this matter.\n\nAs these suggestions have my full approval, I commend them to your favourable consideration and will be glad to receive an authorization to expend the sum of $600.00 in the way suggested by the Principal.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTBW/JF.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, August 14, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to flooring for the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. I note that the Rev. Principal and yourself recommend that the $600 available be expended in the purchase of 4,000 ft. of the best fir flooring and that the school management will be responsible for the labour.\n\nIn reply I have to state that authority for an expenditure not exceeding $600 for flooring is granted. Please secure competitive prices, if possible, before making purchase, and, when you are submitting an account in favour of the firm given the business, attach thereto a memorandum showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. G.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir;\n\nI am enclosing account of paint etc. to the Department for payment. This expense is covered by the three hundred dollars kindly granted by your Department for purchasing of paint etc. for the finishing of the Boarding School interior etc. at Lac la Ronge. The order for this material was awarded to the G.F. Stephens & Company as being the lowest in the quotation called for. Their prices were so much lower than those of the other two firms, that I was able to order more Alabastine, which is greatly needed in the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas F. Heves\nPrincipal\nBoarding School,\nLac la Ronge, Sask.\nOttawa, August 17, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\n(Inc.)\n\nReferring to your letter of the 11th instant I re-inclose herewith the account of $201.85 which you submitted in favour of Messrs. G.F. Stephens & Co., Limited, for paint, etc., supplied in connection with the Boarding School at Lac la Ronge. This account should be in duplicate and should be properly certified before the matter of payment can be given consideration. It should be attached also to abstract of tender forms on which should be indicated the prices quoted before the order was placed. Necessary forms for the purpose are transmitted herewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent.\n\nRev. Chas. F.

Paget\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent\n\nMessrs. Crane Limited,\nMontreal, Que.\nRegina, Sask., Aug. 26th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith my report on the Annuity Payments throughout Ile a La Crosse Agency, Treaty No. 10 for 1925.\n\nLAC LA RONGE.\n\nThe school was closing for holidays, in fact some of the children had already gone, so I did not examine the remaining pupils. I looked through their exercise book work and found it to compare favorably with Beauval school at La Plonge. I went through the school from basement to garret and found it clean and tidy. The basement is wet and needs a cement floor badly. The disposal system is bad and very unhealthy. The present system, as I saw it, is overflowing and lying on the surface of the ground evaporating, ans when the wind blows from the east the smell from this quarter is awful. In winter it freezes up and causes endless trouble. It has to be pumped out on the ground, and the stench might be better imagined than described. The Assistant Principal Mr. Mayo spoke of changing the disposal drain to a muskeg at the back of the school, but in my mind I think the result would be the same. This would overflow on this muskeg and when the wind blows from that quarter the smell would be as bad as it is now. The system is so poor that it cannot carry off all the refuse and children use a number of outhouses which adds to the smell. With a proper system which could carry off all refuse these outhouses could be dispensed with, and the school surroundings look much tidier. I would suggest a septic tank similar to that proposed for the Onion Lake School. This disposal system needs looking after at once, and I cannot urge too strongly the necessity of immediate action in the matter, if we would prevent an epidemic of some disease among the children in this school.\n\nW. R. Taylor\nIndian Agent.\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 8th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a long report on the Treaty 10 trip which was written by Mr. Indian Agent Taylor.\n\nWith regard to the drainage at the Lac la Ronge school. It seems to me the Department should take steps next year to put in a sewage disposal system here.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, Sept. 16, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to a portion of your letter of the 8th instant which covers Mr. Indian Agent Taylor's report on Treaty 10.

Our greatest hindrance in the work and development of the children here is ignorance. They know so little outside of their own life, and therefore their own people have the bigger influence on them, and for that reason the drag on our efforts towards their proper development is tremendous.\n\nFor this reason we have clubbed together and have raised enough to enable us to get the machine. The price being $160.00\n\nAs this is especially for the education of the Indian children, would the Department kindly pay the rentage on one dozen films monthly for six months in the year. I feel sure that this scheme will be a help towards the progress in the school, and help towards our fight against ignorance and superstition which is so prevalent amongst this people. I sincerely hope you may be able to give us some help towards supplying the necessary films.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Hives, the Principal of our Society's School at Lac la Ronge has forwarded the attached letter to me for my approval before submitting the request it contains to you, and I beg to state that I shall be very grateful if you can help him in the way he suggests.\n\nI may say that our Staff at the Mackay School, The Pas, Man, have also secured a safety moving picture machine, and some films were exhibited at the time of my recent visit which proved both interesting and instructive to the children. As the cost of the films at this School was being met by the School management, I should be very grateful if you will make a similar grant to meet the cost of these. The cost of the films at Lac la Ronge would be much greater than at the Mackay School owing to the greater distance and the correspondingly greater cost of carriage, but if your Department can make an annual grant say of $50.00 for the Mackay School and about $100.00 for Lac la Ronge, it would I think be sufficient.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, December 12th, 1925.\n\nRev.

C.F. Hives, Principal of our Society's School at Lac La Ronge, he presents a very urgent request for a bake oven. His letter in part reads as follows:\n\n\"I sent a requisition for a bake oven last year, and pointed out to you how necessary this was. We have managed in a very poor way since that time to make the present one do, but we get a lot of very bad bread, and in fact it is an utter failure as a bake oven for such an Institution as ours. I would therefore urgently request that something be done to replace it with something decent.\" He has not mentioned the particular kind of bake oven which would be the most suitable, but as the School has a capacity of 100 children, I am of the opinion that an oven similar to the one installed in the Elkhorn School would be the most suitable. It should be borne in mind that the fuel used in that part is wood only, and that the fire box should be made accordingly. As it is important that the shipment should be made during the freighting season, which closes somewhere about the end of March or the middle of April, I should be grateful if you would give this matter early and favorable consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nMB.\nOttawa, January 15, 1926.\n\nJ.

New floor in main building.\n\nTotal estimated cost $3,000.00\n\nWith regard to the bake oven you have already authorized the transfer of the one now at the Elkhorn School to Lac la Ronge, and I beg to thank you on behalf of our Society for your kind consideration in this matter. The Staff were experiencing much difficulty in the preparation of the school's supply of bread without it, and its installation will be a great relief and comfort to them.\n\nIn a letter just received from the Principal he reminds me of the need of the other items mentioned in the list given above and as the transportation of the materials required will not be possible before the end of this year or the beginning of next, unless they are forwarded during the present freighting season which cannot be expected to continue beyond another six or eight weeks at the most, I shall be very grateful if you can let me know if these items have been\nsanctioned and the action which will be taken by your Department in providing the same.\n\nIf Mr. Inspector Bunn your representative in this City were informed of the amount which might be expended in connection with the above items and authorized to purchase the materials required, they might be delivered at the school before the present freighting season ends.\n\nI commend this suggestion to your favourable consideration and have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF.\nFebruary 18, 1926.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThere are items totalling $3,000 in the Main Estimates 1926-27, to provide cement floor for the basement and for other comprehensive repairs and improvements at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. Dr. Westgate in a recent letter pointed out that the improvements cannot be effected during the present year, if the materials are not shipped within the next six or eight weeks.\n\nAs I hope to have all accounts for the coming year's activity paid off a year from now, I recommend that Dr. Westgate's request be granted. The materials to be purchased are chiefly cement and lumber and I should be pleased if you would approve of having the purchase placed in Mr. Inspector Bunn's hands. I would suggest limiting the accounts to $1,800.00. The rest of the appropriation will be required for freighting.\n\nRussell J.

Certain funds will be available as from April first for this purpose, and, if you will let me have an immediate requisition, showing the materials in detail which could be purchased now in Winnipeg and shipped to the school, favourable consideration will be given. The list should show, not only the materials required, but the purpose for which they are intended.

This material, an account of which I forwarded to you a few days ago is in connection with our septic tank, a grant for which was made last summer. I explained in letter accompanying account, that we had not sufficient cement to complete the tank. Also, in order to make a good job, I thought it best to take out the rocks. This could be done only by blasting. For that reason, I purchased dynamite. The coal is for forge for sharpening our tools in digging.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nLac la Ronge, Sask.\nApril 1, 1926.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI enclose herewith freight accounts of cement and lumber which has come to hand in good order. I may say that this part of our freighting has been done in a way specially commendable. The ground from Prince Albert to Lac la Ronge is practically bare of snow, and yet William Bear came through with that great weight on sleighs. Wagons on such a road are entirely out of the question. How, to deliver this freight, which he was forced to do, or have it stored on the way, has taken him sixteen days. Ordinarily, it would take eight or nine days. I am asking, therefore that he be allowed freightage at the rate of $3.50 per 100 lbs. If he is not allowed this rate, he cannot help but lose out in this part of his business. Again, I would like to say that I consider the freighting of this cement and lumber from Prince Albert to Lac la Ronge over roads of which over one hundred miles were practically bare of snow is a feat that few freighters would have attempted. William Bear is a Treaty Indian. He employs other Treaty Indians who live around him to help him in this work. Not that he makes very much out of it himself, but it gives those men work during the winter. I do sincerely hope, therefore, that you will recommend that he be allowed the rate of $3.50 per 100 lbs.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Chas. F.

A. Bear aggregating $1070.65 and will be obliged if you will forward the same to him to the Imperial Bank, Prince Albert, Sask., and ask them to credit his account. Along with the bills I enclosed in duplicate a certified statement from the Principal. I should state for your information that the usual freighting charge made by Mr. Bear under contract with our Society is $3.00 per hundred pounds. From the enclosed covering letter received from the Principal you will note that he recommends, owing to the great difficulty experienced and the unusually great length of time required to bring this freight through to the school, owing to the break up of the roads, he recommends that the rate on this freight should be $3.50 per hundred, and this recommendation has my full support. For a time it looked as if these could not be taken through at all, and it is only through the special effort on the part of the freighter and with increased expenditure to himself that it was landed at the school and in good condition.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In a letter just received from the Principal he states that gravel and sand have to be brought from different parts of the lake by canoe, and estimates that the cost will approximate $800.00 over and above the labour which the school management will have to undertake.\n\nAs this sum cannot be met from our Society's funds I should like to know if your Department can render assistance in this connection. Should you be unable to do so I fear the installation of the cement floor may have to be postponed.

Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI beg to place before you for your consideration certain conditions in the girls' section of our School, relative to toilet conveniences. At present we have two water closets inside for the girls. One for each of the dormitories. There are over sixty girls. There are no water closets on the ground floor, and unless those upstairs are used for daytime, which you may understand is a great inconvenience, the outside toilets have to be used, which I consider are not only a nuisance, but also a great danger, especially during the winter months. You may very well see that it is impossible to allow over sixty girls running up and down stairs at all times during the day, at the same time the danger from an outside toilet is very great during the extreme cold weather of our winters.\n\nI would therefore urgently recommend that two inside combination water closets be installed on the ground floor. We have the space for this conveniently near the girls' recreation room, and closeted so as to be private and not offensive.\n\nWe can do the work ourselves if we have the following material.\n\n- 2 combination water closet sets complete to floor.\n- 2 lead bends.\n- 60 ft. 4\" soil pipe.\n- 50 lbs. pig lead.\n- 25 \" oakum.\n- 80 ft. 3\" gal. iron pipe, in ten ft. lengths, and couplings for same.\n- 2 union couplings 3\"\n- 3 soil pipe tees 4\"\n- 2 45 degree soil pipe bends.\n- 1 doz. 3\" gal. iron elbows.\n- 1 \" 3\" \" 45 degree\n- 1 \" 3\" \" tees.\n- 2 only 3\" waste cocks.\n- 1 doz. bushings assorted \u00bd\" to 1\u00bc\"\n\nI most sincerely trust that this may be granted, as I do consider that the outside toilet is a great menace to the health of our girls.\nIf this receives favourable consideration, would you kindly order the above and instruct shipping in the usual way, at the same time notifying Wm. Bear, who will see it through.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Chas. F. Hives.\n\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter received from the Principal of our Society's School at Lac la Ronge in which he points out the need of two inside combination water closets for this institution. As the School management will undertake the installation if your Department will supply the material required, I trust that an authorization to purchase and forward the material may be granted.\n\nI commend this matter to your sympathetic consideration, and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 4)\nThe Church authorities request that the Department allow a grant for labour in connection with the placing of a cement floor in the basement of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. There is an item in our Estimates for the current year for the purpose. However, no funds were specifically provided in the Governor General's warrant. If you wish to authorize the activity, funds could be found in the general item \"Buildings under Contract, etc.\" You will remember that there is provided $96,750 for last year's building contracts and obligations.\n\nDr. Westgate states that the labour costs will approximate $800, as gravel and sand will have to be brought from different parts of the lake by canoe. The correspondence shows that, if we don't allow the grant, the installation of the cement floor will have to be postponed. I believe the cement is already at the school.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, July 28, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, concerning the labour costs of the cement floor in the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. I note that gravel and sand can be brought with difficulty from different parts of the lake. I believe this activity should be proceeded with, and any hauling costs which cannot be handled by the school management will receive favourable consideration by the Department. It must be understood, however, that the expenses should be kept as low as possible.\n\nI have also your letter of the 15th instant, requesting two water closets to be installed on the ground floor.

The Department kindly made a grant of $200.00 for this work. I am sorry to say that it has been quite impossible to keep within this amount. Although I have tried to be as careful as possible and have done much of the work myself and staff. Owing to the rocky nature of this land through which we had to carry the overflow, the work was exceedingly slow and difficult, and therefore more labour was engaged than would have been had the land been less difficult to dig.\n\nI may say that an excellent job has been done, and that we now have a disposal system that will do the work, and which complies with the law.\n\nThe men were all paid by order on the Hudson's Bay and the Revillon Freres trading posts.\n\nI beg to say again that I am sorry we were not able to keep within the limits of the two hundred dollars but I am very thankful of the results of our work, and hope that the Department will be able to meet the extra expense entailed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas.

We spent Sunday at the boarding school. We thus had an opportunity of observing the children and how they were kept. I found everything very satisfactory. Children were well fed and were happy. The school was closed for holidays, so I did not do any class room inspection. The disposal system of refuse had been completed and was a great success, or I should say, is, a great success.\n\nW. R. Taylor,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT OF DR. H. C. GEORGE\nTREATY TRIP NO.10, 1926.\n\nThere is great need of an infirmary in connection with the LaRonge Mission school, as at present there is no opportunity of isolating sick children from the well. This revealed itself very plainly during the last couple of years during which time, three children died, in the school, of Tuberculous Meningitis - members of the staff giving up their individual rooms for the treatment of these cases.\n\nH.

The cheque for $122.18, the amount involved, may either be forwarded to me or to Mr. A. G.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, relative to an account for the expenses in transporting electric light repair parts from Montreal Lake to the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School to the amount of $122.15.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform you that cheque No. 1420, dated June 18th, last, was drawn in your favour and sent you. We are informed by the Finance Department that this cheque was presented to the bank, properly endorsed, and returned to them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.,\n1-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWe here try to do our best, but we have no medical diplomas. We run up against illnesses that are baffling to us. We are in the ordinary way seven days away from the nearest medical doctor. We just grope in the dark, and often have to sit down and watch the poor little sufferer die. I speak from experience.\n\nWhat we need is a good strong man or woman; not necessarily a brilliant doctor, but practical and with little fear of discouragements, and with a small hospital to isolate cases.\n\nWe have a saw mill where we can manufacture lumber for building. We have the stone for foundations and the lime stone for plaster. A small hospital could be built for a reasonable sum of money, at a convenient and safe distance from the school, and still receive its light and water from the school supply.\n\nA doctor could board and if necessary room at the school, and I feel sure that such a scheme would prove its worth.\n\nAt present we are isolating cases in the kindergarten classroom, and overcrowding the junior classroom. It is the only arrangement that can be made, and in any case we would have to build in order to have an infirmary.\n\nI beg to say sir, that the suggestion of a hospital and doctor is the only recommendation that I would consider worthwhile, and also urgently beg that the same may receive due consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nwould undoubtedly have succumbed to that sickness had we left them. I mean that the Whooping cough had developed into Pneumonia, a disease that these people are incapable of fighting when the bed is just a blanket on the cold damp ground. All of these children are now doing well and regaining their former health.\n\nIf these people are worth saving, and I think there can be no doubt on that matter, then my first and I really believe the only worthwhile suggestion and recommendation is a small hospital with a qualified doctor, either man or woman in charge of it.\n\nThe same could have our Jas. Roberts band, William Charles band, Amos Charles and Peter Ballendine bands under his care. Lac la Ronge is central to these bands mentioned. The Jas. Roberts band, Amos Charles and Peter Ballendine bands are fairly healthy Indians. If a medical man were placed in charge of them now, before Syphilis etc. work havoc amongst them, they may not only preserve the race, but also be the means of saving them from the suffering ultimately from the scourges of these terrible diseases.\n\nOf one thing I am confident: A medical doctor will in the near future have to reside here, and maybe more than one. Not only for the sake of the health of these Indians, but also as a safeguard to the white population. Why wait for that time?\n\nWe have over one hundred pupils in school at the present time. I am safe in saying that eighty five percent have never been vaccinated. Times I have written about this matter, and promise has been made that the Treaty doctor will be given instruction to vaccinate during his visit. He has never yet brought vaccine with him. Moreover he informs me that it is hardly fair to the children he vaccinates or to the doctor to vaccinate so many at one time, and not be able to stay and attend in case of complications.\n\nSmallpox is bound to, sooner or later, find its way into our midst, and then woe betide us. It is fifteen years since Whooping cough last visited these people until this year, and then it found fifteen years of progeny awaiting its arrival. Is it to be the same with Smallpox or Diphtheria?\nLac la Ronge, Sask.\nOct. 16, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your communication of the 27th ultimo, letter No. 132-2-5, I beg ye say that it will afford me a great deal of pleasure to respond to your inquiry of a matter so important.\n\nWhile Doctor George of Treaty party No IO was here he expressed himself as being shocked at the poor accommodation we have for a school of our size, and especially in face of the fact that we are so far away from medical help, and hospital facilities such as they have nearer civilisation. May I therefore be permitted to emphasize this point of our need of a hospital and attendant. Not only for the sake of our own pupils, but also for the sake of the whole band of Jas. Roberts, and the adjoining bands of Amos Charles, Peter Ballendine, and William Charles.\n\nAs no doubt you are aware sir, the Jas. Roberts band have heretofore been one of the healthiest bands of Indians, and a glance over the statistics of the past ten years will show a substantial increase in the population. Six years ago they had a setback when the Spanish Influenza invaded us, and it took some years to regain their normal health and vigor. I was through that time with these people, and known not only how they suffered, but also how great was the value of expert and practical help at such a time.\n\nThis year we have had a repetition of a somewhat similar nature. During the months of July and August of this year there were eleven death resulting from Whooping cough. At least ten out of the eleven deaths were direct resultant of whooping cough. Had these people been able to receive proper care, I have no doubt that most of them would be with us still. I carried three little children into our school, Children who had been given up by their parents as too far gone, and who\nThe Secretary\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am much obliged to you for your letter of the 6th inst (132-2-5) and regret that through an oversight I was not informed that your Department had paid the sum of $128.18 for repairs to the electric lighting plant at the Lac la Ronge School before I submitted my request. The oversight was due to my absence from the office for a long period, and the absence of our Assistant Sec. Treas. at the time my letter was written.

In this connection I beg to return herewith three receipts which accompanied the Hudson's Bay Company's account namely receipt from John Bell for $47.50, Hector McKenzie for $20.00 and Norman Charles for $20.00.

His letter reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"At the present time we have a little family power washer, worked by a one and a half power gasoline engine. This is a very small affair, and certainly not able to do the work required. Hence we have to resort to hand washers and the old-fashioned scrub board. This would not be so bad had we the big girls, but you will notice by the roll, that the great majority of our pupils are under the age of twelve years. This is a very urgent request.........\"\n\nOn page 4 of the list of requirements forwarded by our Society to be provided by your Department next year, you will see that under this school modern laundry equipment has been included at an estimated cost of $1,500.00. As there can be no question whatever as to the necessity of this item of equipment in so large a school, I beg to request that provision of the same be given favourable consideration, and supplied as suggested by the Principal, in time to reach the school before the close of the present freighting season.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have to inform you that we are having trouble without pump and engine. The trouble seems to be general. That is there are parts of the pump badly worn, and the cylinder of the engine is cracked, and lets in the water, so that there is great difficulty in starting it, and in keeping it going. It should by rights be sent out to be properly repaired by welding. This we cannot do, as it would leave us without any means of getting our water supply.\n\nThe only thing to be done is to ask the Department of Indian Affairs for a replica of the outfit that we have at present. Then send the old one out to be properly repaired, and returned to be on hand in case of trouble.\n\nThe present one is a Fairbanks-Morse 3 H.P. engine and Typhoon pump, with two inch discharge.\n\nI hope this matter will be attended to as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:- Re - Water pump and engine for the Lac la Ronge School.\n\nThe enclosed letter from the Rev. G. F.

Please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Department will be unable to purchase and forward the heavy laundry equipment for this school before the freighting season ends, but hopes to be able to purchase and have same forwarded early next winter.\n\nI have also your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the water pump and engine at this school. I am today writing to Mr. Inspector Bunn, of Winnipeg, authorizing him to purchase the equipment mentioned by the Reverend Principal. You might telephone to him and explain the advisability of immediate shipment.\n\nI believe that the Reverend Principal would be well advised to have the old pump and engine repaired. The geographical situation of this school is such that it would be wise to have a second unit available in event of trouble in the future.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

Many of the sacks were damaged and for this reason the amount refunded is not larger than that specified.\n\nMr. Inspector Bunn informs me that you will find your order in this connection in a communication dated March 6, 1926 and voucher numbered Z658.\n\nBelieve me\n\nSir\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nEnclos.\nTBRW/IMC\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit to our Society's School at Lac la Ronge the Principal directed my attention to the following urgent needs in the way of improvements and equipment, and having presented the same to our Commission at a meeting on the 14th instant, I was instructed to submit the same to you for your consideration. The requirements are as follows:\n\n1. Paint\n   - 60 gallons grey paint.\n   - 10 \" green for trimmings.\n   - 5 \" white for window sashes.\n\n2. For inside decorating. 720 lbs. galsmine in the following quantities:\n   - 2 doz. packages buff (5 lb. packages)\n   - 2 \" white\n   - 2 \" rose pink\n   - 2 \" azure\n   - 2 \" ivory\n   - 2 \" grey\n\nIn connection with the above the following is also required:\n   - 5 gallons Spar varnish\n   - 10 \" paint oil\n   - 3 \" turpentine\n   - 2 doz suitable brushes\n\nThe school management gave me to understand that they would\nundertake the work if the materials were supplied not later than the end of July or early in August.\n\nIn addition to the above 3 complete sets of wood burning furnace grates are required for the furnaces installed in the basement. The furnaces are McClary #419 Famous Magnet. For estimate of cost see statement below.\n\nA complete cobbler's outfit for repairing boots. For estimate of cost see statement below.\n\nA welding outfit. For estimate of cost see statement below.\n\nFare box for the bake oven, capacity 100 loaves. For estimate of cost see statement below.\n\nHot water heating tank, treble the size of the one installed which holds 90 gallons. For estimate of cost see statement below.\n\nWith regard to the cost of the above items I have secured the following estimate from firms who could supply the same:\n\n1. Paint, kalsomine, etc. Winnipeg Paint and Glass Co., f.o.b. Prince Albert $129.00.\n\n2. Sherwin Williams Co., f.o.b. Winnipeg, $123.00. In addition to this cost of freight on approximately 1100 lbs. would have to be reckoned at summer freight rates of 7\u00a2 a lb. or $77.00. The total amount asked under this heading in our list of requirements presented to your Department to be supplied this year was $300.00.\n\n3. The estimated cost of the 3 sets of furnace grates as given by the McClary Mfg. Co., is approximately $15.00 a set f.o.b. Prince Albert or $45.00 for the 3 sets. To this must be added freighting charges from Prince Albert to the School. The 3 sets weigh approximately 204 lbs. and this at 7\u00a2 a lb. would be $14.28.\n\n4. The T. Eaton Co., of Winnipeg have estimated the cost of the cobbler's outfit at $10.15. This estimate includes cement, awls, hemp, bristles, ink, rivets, tacks, etc., but omits hammers, nails, and certain other essential items. I am unable to give the weight or an estimate of the freighting charges but this would not be more than say $3.00. The estimates should be increased to $12.00 for the items omitted plus $3.00 for freight.\n\n5. Estimated cost of a suitable welding outfit f.o.b. Winnipeg as given by the Hudson's Bay Co., is $72.00. An additional $10.00 would be sufficient for freight.\nCast iron fire box with cast iron collar $14.00 f.o.b. Prince Albert. The bake oven for which this is required was in use for some time at the Elkhorn School but transferred to Lac la Ronge when Elkhorn was supplied with a new bake oven. It had originally a black iron fire box with cast iron collar which cost only one-third of the cast iron fire box which is now supplied by the J. J. Daoust Ltd., St. Boniface, Man. The weight of this is not given but the freight may be estimated at about $3.00.\n\n6. Hot water heating tank. The Hudson's Bay Co., Winnipeg quote one tank with a capacity of 192 gallons at $125.00 f.o.b. Prince Albert. To this would be added the sum of approximately $25.00 for a range water jacket, pipe connections, couplings, elbows, etc. The weight of this is not available but being a bulky item the freight will probably approximate $50.00.\n\nAs all of the above items are urgently required and should be supplied at the earliest possible date, I shall be obliged if you will undertake to provide the same or authorize our Society or Mr. Inspector Bunn of Winnipeg to do so.\n\nWith regard to the other requirements which our Society requested your Department to supply this year to the Lac la Ronge School, I shall be very glad to know what sum is available. The estimated total amount required was given in our list as $4,000. As all of the above mentioned items can be provided for a sum not exceeding $600.00 a very considerable balance should be available for other improvements and items of equipment.\n\nA new class-room approximately 22' x 50' would be of immense service to the school as it could also be used for meetings, entertainments, gymnasium purposes, etc., if provided with a full size basement. The cost of this apart from the furnace, door and window frames, glass, shingles, locks, hinges, nails, etc., would not exceed the sum of $2,500. This is one of the two other urgent major requirements of this school. The other is fully modern laundry equipment and which the Commission trust that, if provision has not been made for the same requested in our list forwarded to the Deputy Mupt. General through our General Secretary towards the close of last year, to provide the laundry equipment during the current fiscal year, necessary steps may be taken for provision of the same during the next fiscal year.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYours obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nIndian Affairs.

You are authorized to purchase the paint and kalsomine, varnish, etc., mentioned in your letter, at an estimated cost of $139. I note that the Sherwin Williams Company, of Winnipeg, have quoted the lowest price. You may also purchase three sets of furnace grates at an estimated cost of $45, a cobbler's outfit at a cost of $10.13, a welding outfit at a cost of $72, a cast iron firebox with cast iron collar at a price of $14 and a hot water heating tank at an estimated cost of $125. You should get competitive prices for any of the more expensive materials. I understand that freight costs will be added to the above estimates.\n\nThe other requirements will receive consideration when presented to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

As this paint is really urgently needed an order has been placed for the same with The Sherwin Williams Company so that it may be forwarded in the same shipment with the other items mentioned in your letter of July 4.

T.B.R.Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nOn July 24th and the two or three days following we had quite a narrow escape from being wiped out by a bush fire, caused by lightning which struck about three miles west of the school.\n\nThe day following there came a very hot dry wind which drove the fire toward the school. I have always considered ourselves fairly well protected from bush fires. You will no doubt remember the long stretch of muskeg at the back of the school. You did not go over this place as I considered it too wet, although our fuel for next winter was over there. Well, the wind swept the fire across the muskeg at a terrific rate right straight for the school buildings. The building nearest the fire was the gasoline and coal oil house. But we were ahead of it there, as we had all the barrels rolled down to the lake when we saw the danger approaching. We were also very well prepared with hose over all the important buildings, and saturated the roofs with water. At times the smoke was so dense around the buildings, the school could not be seen from the lake shore just in front, where the ladies were waiting with their suit cases. It was a very anxious time for awhile, and I shed many tears on account of the smoke, but, thank God the buildings were kept safe.\n\nAll that night and the two days following we were on duty putting out fires, and even now as I write, it is still burning in the muskeg. The wind has changed, , the fire is going West.\n\nI am sorry to say that a great deal of our wood supply has been burnt up, and especially the beautiful big pile of short wood, which the boys and Buster Brown took such pride in cutting. It was all destroyed.\n\nI am enclosing an account for orders paid out to fire fighters. I am sorry to say also that I shall have to ask for another $175.00 to replace the wood we had burnt. I may say that we did our best to save this wood,\nbut it was utterly impossible.\n\nFor miles to the West of us, it is a black waste.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Chas.F.Hives\"\n\nPrincipal.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing for your information copy of a letter just received from the Rev. C.F.Hives, principal of our Society School at Lac la Ronge.\n\nYou will note from this letter that this School had an extremely narrow escape from complete destruction by a bush fire which was caused by lightning, and we can all, I feel certain, join with the principal in thanking God that the buildings were kept safe. It seems to me that he and his staff, and the helpers he engaged to protect the building and adjoining property, are deserving of the highest commendation, and I feel certain that a short message from you to this effect, addressed to the Principal direct, would be very pleasing and encouraging to him and his staff.\n\nYou will note from his letter that he enclosed an account, amounting to $88.50, made up of Orders given to the different Indians who helped in protecting the School property, and I am enclosing this account in duplicate in the hope that your Department may be able to meet this unexpected expenditure out of your contingency fund.\n\nYou will note also from the latter part of his letter that a great deal of the School's wood supply has been burned up, and especially the short wood which was ready for the kitchen range, and that he is asking our Society for a special grant of $175.00 to meet this loss.\n\nAfter the generous assistance which you have already given our Society towards meeting the necessary repairs and improvements at this School this year, I am reluctant to ask you to come to our Society's assistance in meeting this request, but it has come so unexpectedly, and at a time when\nAugust 25th, 1927.\n\nThe Secretary, Dept. Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nI am at a complete loss to know how this amount is to be found, that I am obliged to ask you if you can come to our assistance in this connection by providing a part at least, if not the whole, of this amount.\n\nWe have a similar request from the Hay River School, where a bush fire has also destroyed practically $200.00 worth of wood, which was cut ready for next year.\n\nDuring my approaching visit to your Department, I contemplated taking up the question of a special grant to meet the loss sustained at Hay River, but the need is so urgent at Lac la Ronge that I felt it my duty to lay the situation before you without any further delay.\n\nTrusting you may be able to meet the enclosed bill, and to furnish the help requested with regard to replacing the wood which was burnt, I remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/K\n\nENCLOSURES 3.\nOttawa, September 6, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, concerning extraordinary expenditure at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School because of a bush fire, I have to inform you that the Department is paying the Hudson's Bay Company account of $58.50. This action is in harmony with the promise made by Mr. Ferrier at the time of your visit on the third instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

Westgate.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 28th. The list price of the\n160 ampere, 32 cells battery cells is $262.50. We have always\ngiven the regular dealers discount to Rev. C.F. Hives, and therefore,\nit would cost you $196.50 f.o.b. Saskatoon plus transportation\nto Prince Albert which would be $6.90 making a total of $203.40.\n\nThe old batteries are only worth 2\u00bd\u00a2 per pound for the lead\nthat is in them this amounts to about $12.00 per set. It would\ncost more than that amount to bring them in to Saskatoon so we\ncannot make any allowance on these old batteries.\n\nThe three Kilowatt plant with the crank case broken and the\nfield torn out. It would cost more to repair this than what you\ncould sell it for secondhand and this would make the plant useless\nto us for which we are very sorry.\n\nThe reason the life of the batteries is so short is because\nthey have a very heavy lot to carry and they get a very heavy charge\nand discharge and this shortens the life of any battery.\n\nWe trust that this is a satisfactory explanation and thanking\nyou in anticipation of your order for a new set, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLEMERY-DENISON ELECTRIC LTD.\n\nOLL/CML\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn September the 12th last the Rev. C.F. Hives, Principal of our Society's school at Lac la Ronge wrote to me as follows with regard to the light plant at this school:\n\n\"I beg to place before you our need of a new set of batteries for our Light plant. Some of these have been on the go now for nearly three years. Others for over four years, and all are getting into bad state. Unless they are removed, we may have difficulties during the coming winter. We require thirty-two cells, Exide type, and have heretofore received these from the Lemery-Denison Electric Company, Saskatoon.\n\nI would suggest that they be asked to take back the present batteries as part payment. Also we still have the Delco Light plant here. The dynamo and engine are in good repair. The crank case needs renewing and we have had to rob it of a few small parts in order to install the present light plant. It would, nevertheless, be worth something, and would bring down the cost of the new batteries, if the Lemery-Denison people would take it as part payment.\"\n\nAs soon as I received the above letter I wrote to the Lemery-Denison people in Saskatoon and enclose herewith for your information a copy of their reply.\n\nWhen I visited the Lac la Ronge school last May the Principal informed me at that time that he felt certain the batteries would have to be renewed in the near future. I asked him to watch them carefully for the next few months and then to\nfurnish me with a specific recommendation in this connection. As he has recommended that thirty-two new battery cells of the Exide type be provided I shall be obliged if you will either undertake to have these purchased from the Lemery-Denison Ltd., Saskatoon at a total cost of $203.40 f.o.b. Prince Albert or authorise me to make the purchase and forward the bill to you for payment at a later date. The battery cells cannot now be forwarded to the school until the winter trail opens which will be some time in the month of December.\n\nBelieve me Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, October 10, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, informing the Department that new batteries are required for the lighting plant at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, and stating the cost of same.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and forwarding to the school of 32 new battery cells of the Exide type. We note that these can be purchased from Lemery-Denison, Ltd., Saskatoon, at a cost of $203.40, F.O.B. Prince Albert. Please obtain an account, in duplicate, which you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nIt is noted from the copy of the letter which you forwarded from the above firm that it would cost more than the old batteries are worth to have them returned to Saskatoon, and this firm is not, therefore, prepared to make any allowance for the old batteries.\n\nYou should inform the Principal of the School that he is to see that no electrical attachments, such as toasters, washing machines, etc., are used in connection with the lighting plant, as, by doing so, the batteries would soon become exhausted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Laundry equipment for Lac la Ronge school\n\nWith further reference to my telegram of March 11th last and your reply to the same on March 12th (No. 132-2-5) relative to the purchase of laundry equipment for our Society's school at Lac la Ronge I beg to state that in a letter just received from the Principal he informs me that the need for modern laundry equipment for this institution has become quite acute and he greatly hopes that this equipment may be purchased and forwarded to Prince Albert in time to be conveyed to the school immediately after the winter trail opens. So far as we are able to tell at present this will be early in December.\n\nIf this laundry equipment is to be purchased and forwarded at the time suggested above I shall be obliged if you will notify me to this effect as the Principal states that he would like to build an engine house attached to the laundry before the severely cold weather sets in and I am anxious to give him as much notice as possible. He states that the building of the engine house can be accomplished without any expense to your Department beyond the cement for the floor. The amount which will be required for this purpose he estimates to be 12 sacks and I should like to have an authorization to purchase and forward the same and submit the bills to you for payment.\n\nThanking you in advance for a prompt reply to this letter, I have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, October 11, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to laundry equipment for the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. It is true that there was an appropriation for laundry machinery at this institution, amounting to $1500, but I have to inform you that this amount has already been exceeded in connection with the following items: Engine and pump, washing machines, sawmill, belt, paint, etc., hot water tank, other mechanical plant and freight. I regret, therefore, that the Department cannot give favourable consideration to the shipment of laundry machinery this early winter.\n\nI should be grateful, however, if you would let me know just what machinery is required and how it is proposed to run it. This information is necessary for our file so that, when funds are available, early shipment can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

We aim to sell only where a Unit is really needed; the profit on any one sale is not so great as to tempt us to load you up with any machinery you cannot use to the best advantage.\n\nIf a summer club can pay for its entire laundry equipment in one short season out of its own and its guests laundry work, then it would seem that every institution should be able and anxious to install one of our five Units and make it a source of real profit.\n\nIn case you have mislaid the folders which we sent you giving full information on the five Units, we will gladly send you others showing the adaptability and cost of each Unit. One of the Units, No. 3, is illustrated on the back of this sheet. There are four others, and if you will give us an idea of how much work you have done each week, we will indicate which of the five will be best for your use.\n\nThe money which you have been paying for your work outside, added to the extra work you can do, will pay for the machinery you need.

I have placed an order with the Manville Hardware Co., Prince Albert, for 12 sacks of cement for the Lac la Ronge School, and will, in due course, furnish you with a statement of their account. The building of the frame part of the engine house can be effected during the winter months, but it may not be possible to utilize the cement before spring. This, however, can only be freighted through in the winter, and this will explain why an order has been placed for immediate shipment.\n\n2. With regard to the laundry equipment required for this School, I may say that I have asked the Principal for a specific recommendation in this connection. As some weeks must elapse before this can be received, I am wondering if the fact that the School has a capacity, and an enrolment of 100 pupils, should not furnish sufficient information to decide the kind of equipment required. The items will include -\n\n(a) Cylindrical washer.\n(b) Extractor.\n(c) Drying tumbler, and\n(d) Flat-work ironer.\n\nThree of the above are illustrated on the enclosed advertising circular from the Beaver Laundry Machinery Co., and further particulars could be received from them.\n\nBeyond this suggestion I am not in a position to offer\nyou any further information until I receive the Principal's recommendation, except to state that the operating power will be a gasoline engine.\n\nThanking you for your kind consideration of the needs of this School, I remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nEnc.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFunds are available for the purchase of laundry machinery for the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School.

His letter reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"We also require a bed-room suite for one of the staff rooms. We have never had sufficient, and now that we have to accommodate the Nurse, we really require a bed, dresser, bed-room table and chair.\"\n\nHis letter does not give an estimate of the cost of these items, but they are listed (walnut finish) in Eaton's Catalogue at the following prices:\n\n| Item          | Price |\n|---------------|-------|\n| Single bed    | $22.50|\n| Dresser       | $2.50 |\n| Bed-room table| $2.00 |\n| Bed-room chair| $1.50 |\n\nThe buffet would cost approximately $20, while the larger window blinds would cost $1.25 each, and the smaller ones $1.15 each, making the total cost of the blinds $49.00.\n\nA bed-room suite and buffet of inferior quality could, of course, be purchased at a lower price, but I am unable to recommend the freighting to so remote a centre, of any furniture of less value than that which I have quoted.\n\nThe prices given are f.o.b. Winnipeg. The total cost\nof freight from here to Prince Albert would not exceed $5.00. The freight from Prince Albert to Lac la Ronge at the rate of 3\u00a2 a lb. would not exceed $20., making a grand total of approximately $187.00, for these furnishings delivered at Lac la Ronge.\n\nAs it is important that they should reach the School during the present freighting season, I shall be obliged if you will kindly let me know what assistance your Department will be prepared to render in providing the same.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nOttawa, December 19th, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to furniture for a staff bedroom at the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School.

This tends to absorb vibration, allows the Machine to balance easily, and to pick up speed quickly.\n\nThe Wide Square Base distributes the weight over a large area, and allows this Machine to be operated at higher speeds than is possible with a small or round base.\n\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO., LIMITED\nTORONTO\n\nWESTERN AGENTS THE BEAVER SOAP AND CHEMICALS, LTD., WINNIPEG\nBeaver Heavy Duty Extractor\u2014Continued\n\nThe Basket is of Perforated Copper, heavily tinned and strongly reinforced by steel bands. The Oversize Steel Spindle operates on a hardened ball point and button running in a long bronze bearing. The bearing is supported by two large rubber springs, so arranged and designed as to make this Machine self-balancing. A large amount of working space has been provided round the bearing, making very easy and quick adjustment or changing of the rubber springs.\n\nThe Beaver circulating oil system ensures complete lubrication of the main bearing at all times. The oil well is very accessible for inspection of the oil level and refilling. From the oil well the oil is led to a sump in the base of the machine, whence it circulates through the bearing, returning to the sump. Owing to the large capacity of the oil well only occasional attention is required.\n\nAll Beaver Extractors have countershafts attached to the curb, and may be for straight or angle drive. The angle drive, as shown in the cut, costs a little more than the straight drive, but effects a saving in floor space, and allows the Extractor to be placed in line with the washers. All Extractors have our improved adjustable friction clutch pulley, which gives a gradual increase in speed without strain to any part of the Machine. Motor drive extractors are direct connected with push button control.\n\nA Galvanized wire safety cover is fitted and so arranged that the cover must be closed before the Machine can be started.\n\n| Size | Drive   | Speed of Counter R.P.M. | Diam. of Counter | Floor Space inches | Shipping Weight |\n|------|---------|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| 26\"  | Straight| 550                     | 7 inch          | 36 x 60            | 1550 lbs.       |\n| 26\"  | Angle   | 550                     | 7 inch          | 36 x 36            | 1600 lbs.       |\n| 26\"  | Motor   | \u2014                       | \u2014               | 36 x 40            | 1700 lbs.       |\n| 30\"  | Straight| 500                     | 7 inch          | 40 x 60            | 1750 lbs.       |\n| 30\"  | Angle   | 500                     | 7 inch          | 40 x 40            | 1800 lbs.       |\n| 30\"  | Motor   | \u2014                       | \u2014               | 40 x 44            | 1950 lbs.       |\n\nThe Beaver Laundry Machinery Co., Limited\nToronto\n\nWestern Agents: The Beaver Soap and Chemicals, Ltd., Winnipeg\nBeaver Roller Bearing Washer\n\nHeader on End\n\nThis is a very strongly constructed washer, built for heavy duty. The material throughout is of the best grade and no pains have been spared to produce a machine that can be relied upon to give many years of satisfactory service.\n\nThe Main Trunion Journals operate in roller bearings. Less power is required to drive the machine and wear is almost entirely eliminated, with the result that all gears are always in correct mesh and alignment. Broken gears, worn trunion journals and bearing replacements are never necessary on this washer. The main bearings are entirely separated from the tub by packed stuffing boxes, which absolutely prevents oil and grease from entering the washer or water from coming out.\n\nThe Reversing Movement is our Beaver Ball Bearing type in which all the thrust of operating the belt shifter slides is taken by hardened steel balls. The movement is designed so as to give a positive even shifting of the belts, irrespective of wear, so that the cylinder...\nBeaver Roller Bearing Washer\u2014Header on End\n\nruns the same number of revolutions in either direction. The gears are machine cut from solid blanks and the main gear is thirty inches in diameter. The gear has a split hub to facilitate easy removal. A combined gear lock and hand wheel is provided.\n\nThe Cylinder is of the best grade all heart stock long-leaf yellow pine with hard Maple ribs. The three lifting ribs are extra deep to ensure rapid washing. The trunions are bolted to heavy brass rings. The hinges are of brass bolted through a brass battion with an enclosed brass lock.\n\nThe Outer Case is of the finest clear Cypress and is furnished with a brass apron at the door opening. Inspection plates are provided in each end so that trunion bolts may be tightened without removing the upper half of the case.\n\nThe Inlet and Outlet Tees are connected by a 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inch pipe into which steam can be injected. When steam is being used to heat the water this construction gives a rapid circulation and absolutely prevents any steam from coming in contact with the wood of the cylinder or case. The water inlet is 2 inches in diameter. The steam inlet is \\(3\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch. A 3 inch plug type discharge valve is supplied.\n\nThis Washer can be arranged for motor drive, in which case it is driven from the motor through short belts. The motor is carried on a substantial cast iron base bolted firmly to the frame of the machine.\n\nAt a small additional cost these machines may be equipped with a Beaver 6 inch foot operated discharge valve, Beaver Water Level Indicator, visible anywhere in the wash room, Beaver Soap and Soda filling doors, and Monel Metal Lifting Ribs in the cylinder.\n\n### SPECIFICATIONS\n\n| SIZE   | NUMBER OF DOORS | NUMBER OF COMPARTMENTS | PULLEYS | BELTS | SPEED | FLOOR SPACE | WEIGHT |\n|--------|-----------------|------------------------|---------|-------|-------|-------------|--------|\n| 36 x 36 | One             | One                    | 16 inch | \\(1\\frac{1}{4} \\times 1\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 225 RPM | 44 x 72     | 1500 lbs. |\n| 36 x 52 | One             | Two                    | 16 inch | \\(1\\frac{1}{4} \\times 1\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 225 RPM | 44 x 88     | 1650 lbs. |\n| 40 x 40 | One             | One                    | 16 inch | \\(1\\frac{1}{4} \\times 1\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 225 RPM | 48 x 76     | 1600 lbs. |\n| 40 x 52 | One             | Two                    | 16 inch | \\(1\\frac{1}{4} \\times 1\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 225 RPM | 48 x 88     | 1750 lbs. |\n\nSINGLE GEARED ONLY\n\nThe above are our standard sizes.

We have at present the sliding pole fire escape system, and if we had the proper sliding brass poles, it would be almost perfect. We have just the spruce pole now, which is alright until it becomes polished by constant usage. Then it becomes dangerous for the smaller children, on account of their not being able to control their descent.\n\nI would be therefore glad if this matter were placed before the Department, and requisition them for three brass sliding poles, eighteen feet in length each one, and proper mats for landing.\n\nWe have our fire drill, and the last time, we were able to empty all dormitories from the time the fire gong sounded until all were on the ground in two seconds over the two minutes.

Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nWill you kindly look up the correspondence with the Department in connection with the pump. This correspondence took place last end of Feb. or beginning of March. They authorized the sending out of the pump to be repaired. I asked at that time that a replica of the one we had in use should be sent. This was not done, and we had to make a new cement base for the new pump and engine. (I may say that the pump and engine which was sent in was of a newer type.) At that time the Department authorized the sending out of the old one to be repaired so as to have one on hand in repair.\n\nThe freighting season had really come to a close before the new one came in, and so I was not able to send the old one out for repair. I am sending it now, and would urgently recommend that a duplicate of the new pump be sent out in place of the one I am now returning. I have explained above that a new base for the pump and engine had to be made. That the pump in use now is far superior to the one we had before.\n\nWill you therefore kindly see if the Department will agree to our having a new pump, (pump only, not engine) Self oiling, Typhoon pump. Capacity, 2500 gal. per. hr. Sold by Fairbanks-Morse Winnipeg. The old pump will be sent to Revillion Freres, Prince Albert, awaiting further instructions from you. I sincerely hope that this matter may be put through successfully both on account of convenience in regard to installing pump, and also in regard to efficiency in our water supply, which is a very important consideration in our institution.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) C.F.

In your letter referred to above, you recognized the need of this important item of equipment owing to the geographical situation of the school and I beg to recommend that authority be given to Mr. Inspector Bunn of Winnipeg, to purchase the pump suggested by the Principal.\n\nWith regard to the disposal of the old pump, particulars as to the condition it was in were set forth in the Principal's letter of February 14th last, a copy of which was forwarded to you on March 9th. As this pump is a different model from the one which was sent in by Mr. Inspector Bunn, the Principal is of the opinion that it should not be returned to the school, but disposed of in some other way, and I beg to recommend that this action be taken. In the meantime the used pump which requires repairs, will be deposited with the Revillion Freres at Prince Albert awaiting further instructions from you with regard to its disposal.\nI commend the question of the purchase of the new pump requested to your sympathetic consideration and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, January 3rd, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School relative to the supplying of a second pump of the same type as was supplied in March, last. We are requesting Mr. Inspector Bunn, Winnipeg, to purchase a pump similar to that supplied last year from the Fairbanks-Morse Co. Ltd., Winnipeg. He has been requested to telephone you regarding shipping directions.\n\nWith regard to the disposal of the old pump and engine which you state will be deposited with Revillon Freres, Prince Albert, I shall be pleased if you will arrange for the sale of same in their present condition. The amount received should be forwarded to the Department for credit of the Receiver General. It may be that you could arrange with Revillon Freres for the sale of this old equipment, obtaining a fair price for same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, January 3, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to purchase one (1) only self-oiling, belt driven, Typhoon pump of the same type as the one supplied in March last, for the use of the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School. The pump which you obtained for this school at that time was supplied by the Fairbanks-Morse Co., Ltd., Winnipeg. It is considered that owing to the geographical situation of this school it would be wise to have a second unit available in the event of trouble in the future. It might be well to telephone Rev. Dr. Westgate concerning shipping directions. You should obtain the pump at the lowest possible price, and forward a certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCommercial Bldg.,\nSt. Boniface St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nLac la Ronge, Sask.\nDec. 26, 1927.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nIn reply to your letter of Dec. 6th, which came to hand on Christmas Eve at the same time as the ladies arrived.\n\nI have, for some time considered that we were entitled to the full laundry equipment, consisting of:\n\n- Cylindrical washer\n- Extractor,\n- Drying tumbler,\n- Flat iron worker,\n- and kerosene engine of sufficient horse power to operate same.\n\nI hope that this equipment may come in the near future. As soon as I hear particulars regarding the above, I will get to work on the engine house.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Chas. F. Hives\nPrincipal\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:- Re: Laundry machinery for the Lac la Ronge School.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of Nov. 30th last, (132-2-5) and my reply to the same on Dec. 6th, relative to laundry machinery for our Society's School at Lac la Ronge, I now beg to enclose herewith a copy of the letter which I have just received from the Principal embodying a list of the machinery which he considers is necessary. I suggest that steps may be taken immediately in order that this equipment may reach Prince Albert in time to be freighted through to the School before the present freighting season.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, January 9, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with enclosure, concerning laundry machinery for the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that on the 21st ultimo an order was placed with the Canadian Laundry Machinery Company for a washer and an extractor with the necessary pulleys, shafting, etc. This equipment is being shipped to Lac la Ronge in care of William Lear, Prince Albert, Sask., and the accounts are being forwarded to the Principal of the School along with complete instructions concerning setting up and operating the machines.\n\nIn connection with Principal Hives' letter of the 26th ultimo, I note that he is awaiting instructions with reference to the building of an engine house. If you will refer to my letter of November 30th last, you will find authority for this improvement. In earlier communications it was mentioned that the laundry machinery would be operated by a gas engine. The Principal's letter to you suggests that an additional engine for this purpose is required. Will you let me know if this is the case, so that, if action is taken, it can be done immediately. I may say that there have been several engines supplied for the use of this School during the past few years and the Department wishes the management to use one of these to run the laundry machinery if at all possible.\n\nI regret that the Department cannot favourably consider the supplying of a drying tumbler and a flat iron worker for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

The engines we have, supplied by the Department are as follows: 1/2 H.P. gasoline engine supplied with first pumping outfit to supply water for building. This has been used of late years for driving a small washer. The Fairbanks-Morse will know whether or not this size is large enough to drive the new laundry machinery. The next engine is one which came with the second pump and which has recently been discarded for a more up-to-date one. The discarded pump has been sent out, but I have kept the engine, which is a 3 h.p. kerosene. Again you could enquire of the Fairbanks-Morse if this is of sufficient power to drive the new laundry machinery. Then we have a six h.p. kerosene engine, which we use for sawing wood. I do not quite see how we can use this engine for wood sawing and laundry work too. We also have the engine which drives the generator. This is down in the basement in the electric light room.\n\nWe have a great number of engines when one counts them up, but unless the 3 h.p. is large enough, I do not see how we can get along without another for the new laundry machinery.\n\nThere is one suggestion I would like to make here. These engines are really a great expense on account of the great quantity of expensive fuel used, and it seems to me that each year brings an increase in the quantity used. I am not quite sure, but I rather think that one year's supply of fuel for these engines would almost pay for a steam engine of sufficient size to drive the generator, pump and laundry machinery. Then we would have the central powerhouse. Wood would be our fuel, and I believe the fuel expense would be greatly reduced. Of course it would require a man with steam engineer's certificate. I have that myself, and I believe Hastings would quite easily get his certificate.\n\nIf this suggestion does not appeal to you as feasible, and at the same time do not feel it right to get more engines, we could bring the electric light plant out of the basement, establish it in a new powerhouse attached to the laundry, and run the generator and laundry machinery with the one engine. If this were done we should require two hundred dollars for building a proper powerhouse.\n\nWe regard to my reason for keeping the 3 h.p. engine and sending the pump back. The new pump is run by a 3 h.p. engine of the same make and style and in case of a breakdown, it is an easy matter to substitute the one for the other.\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) C. F. Hives\n\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. I may say that the new laundry machinery has not yet arrived, or I would be able to find out what H.P. would be required to run it. But this can be obtained from the people who supplied the machinery, The Canadian Fairbanks-Morse.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nTORONTO ONT X Feb. 28th, 1926.\n\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of Jan. 9th last, 132-2-5, relative to laundry machinery and an engine for operating the same at our Society's School at Lac la Ronge, I beg to submit herewith for your information a copy of a letter just received from Mr. Hives, the Principal of this institution, embodying the information you request with regard to the need of an additional engine. You will observe that the Principal is uncertain as to whether the 3 H.P. engine which he has on hand will be capable of handling the laundry machinery, and as I have not been informed of the size of the washer and extractor which you are supplying, I am unable to reach a decision in this matter. I shall be glad, therefore, if you will take the matter up with the Fairbanks-Morse people, and if you learn that the 3 H.P. engine will be incapable of handling the laundry machinery, have a suitable engine purchased and forwarded at your earliest convenience. It should be consigned to the Rev. C. F. Hives, Principal Anglican Indian School, Lac la Ronge, c/o Revillon Freres, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nMr. Hives' suggestion with regard to the construction of a central power house and the installation of a steam engine appears to me to be worthy of careful consideration, but as it will take some time to build the power house and install the engine and machinery, his suggestion should, I think, be left for further consideration at a later date and immediate action taken with regard to the provision of a gasoline engine to operate the laundry machinery.\n\nAs letters from all our Schools in the Northern parts of the country express the opinion that there will be an early Spring, it is important that any equipment which is to reach these points should be forwarded at once for transportation.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Since despatching that letter I received yesterday a further communication from the Principal of this school, and enclose herewith a copy for your information. As the laundry machinery had just reached the school when the Principal wrote his second letter, he felt it his duty to submit a different recommendation with regard to the method of operating this machinery from that which he had set forth in his letter of February 8th. And as this recommendation seems to me to meet the needs of the situation much more satisfactorily than the one made in the earlier letter, I have just despatched to you the following telegram:\n\n\"Please defer action on my letter 28th. inst. relative engine for Lac la Ronge pending receipt of further letter being addressed to you today.\"\n\nI shall be glad to know, therefore, if you agree to the Principal's recommendation that a new building be erected to accommodate the laundry machinery and the electric light Plant, and that the engine which now drives the generator be utilized to drive the\ngenerator and the laundry machinery as well. You will note that his estimate of the cost of the building is $500.00, but I am unable to guarantee that the total cost including freight on cement, lime, shingles etc. will not exceed this amount. I can assure you, however, that no unnecessary expenditure will be incurred and will be glad to have a reply to this communication by wire, setting forth your decision in the matter and furnishing me with an authorisation to proceed with the erection of the building, should the Principal's recommendation receive your approval.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.

For these reasons I authorized the substitution of steel for brass, and trust the action may meet with your approval.\n\nAs the fiscal year is drawing to a close, and there will not be another mail from Prince Albert to Lac la Ronge before the first Tuesday in April, I have certified the enclosed bills myself instead of waiting fully two months, as I would have to do, to have them certified by the Principal, and trust you may be able, on my certification, to pay the same.\n\nThis bill does not include the freight from Prince Albert to Lac la Ronge, and another account will be submitted.\nto you in this connection at a later date.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, March 20, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a voucher in favour of the Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works, Ltd., covering the cost of 3 polished steel fire escape poles and freight on same, for the use of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. This account is being paid and a cheque has been directed to the above company.\n\nI would point out, however, that the receipt, covering the prepaid freight charges of $3.54 on these poles from Winnipeg to Prince Albert, did not accompany your voucher. As the Auditor General may require this receipt, I have to request that you will obtain same from the above company and forward to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nIt is noted that you will forward another account covering the cost of the freight on these sliding poles from Prince Albert to Lac la Ronge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This institution is under the Anglican church administration. The Principal is Rev. Mr. Hives who has had fourteen years of work at this place. The school authorities have one of their best men in charge here. Mr. Hives does not just boss the job; he operates the saw mill and can do all construction work himself; he makes all the lime, draws the plans, etc., and turns his hand to every sort of work. Under a Principal of this sort there is no trouble with the staff; they all seem cheerful and busy.\n\nA laundry has just been built here; it is well constructed. Mr. Hives tells me it cost the Department about $500.00; it would have been considered cheap at $3000.00 in some places, but the staff here supplied most of the material and labour.\n\nThe building is heated by hot air furnaces, is lighted with electric light, and has a good quality of water throughout. The fire escapes are in a good location; doors to same unlocked and children given frequent practise in using the escape system.\n\nThere is a garden here and the boys are employed in working it in the summer. The girls get the usual training in kitchen, laundry and sewing room, and in addition are taught weaving and basket making.\n\nJ. W. Waddy,\nPaying Agent.\nRegina, Sask., Aug. 25, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to your instructions to me to pay annuity and report on matters in Isle a la Crosse Agency, I have the honor to report as follows:\n\nLAG LA RONGE SCHOOL\n\nThe dormitories are short of beds, some 17 boys sleeping double. At least ten beds should be sent as soon as possible to this school.\n\nJ. W. Waddy.\nAgent.\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 18th, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the annuity payments made in the Isle a la Crosse Agency by Mr. Indian Agent Waddy of the Pas Agency, who made the Treaty 10 Trip this year.\n\nYou will note what the Agent says regarding the boys sleeping double at the Lac la Ronge school. This is not as it should be, and I would recommend that the extra beds asked for should be supplied at once.\n\nW. M.

The Principal asks for metalic ceiling for it. A plan is attached.\n\nMr. Hives also asks if the Department would give him a grant to purchase 38 seats, 10'6\" suitably stained to place in the church used at the school.\n\nHe also asks for a mower and rake which are necessary and $155.00 grant for shingle stain.\n\nJ. W. Waddy,\nAgent.\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 18th, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the annuity payments made in the Isle a la Crosse Agency by Mr. Indian Agent Waddy of the Pas Agency, who made the Treaty 10 Trip this year.\n\nI doubt if we could get made tables up in that district. I am afraid they would cost too much money.\n\nIt might be economy to send metallic ceiling up for the purpose of covering the V-joint ceiling in the dining room although V-Joint itself should make a perfectly good ceiling.\n\nYou will note Mr. Hives is asking the Department for assistance in procuring furnishings for the church at the school. I do not know that the Department will see its way clear to grant this.\n\nW. M.

Please purchase 12 - 6 ft. institutional beds, 2\u00bd ft. wide, complete with springs, from the best source of supply. You should also order 18 Preston, ball-bearing, single school desks from the Christie School Supply Company, of Brandon, the nearest representatives of the manufacturers of these desks. There should be six of each of sizes 3, 4 and 5. In due course, properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded to the Department for payment.

These will be shipped at an early date.\n\nI understand that the dining room ceiling should be repaired.

You might let me have an estimate of the cost of the lumber necessary for the construction of dining room tables and benches and indicate in your answering letter if you would be prepared to build these if the Department supplied the materials. Battleship linoleum would be a good top for these tables.\n\nI regret that the Department cannot give favourable consideration to the purchase of chapel benches at the present time.

(RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 4)\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of our Society's School at Lac la Ronge has forwarded to me a copy of your letter, dated October 5, 1928, No. 132-2-5, requesting information with regard to the cost of a metallic ceiling for the dining-room at this School, the cost of lumber necessary for the construction of dining-room tables and benches, the type of mower and rake which would be most suitable, etc.\n\nImmediately after receiving Mr. Hives' letter with a copy of your letter enclosed therein, I consulted Mr. Inspector Bunn, and he advised me to apply to various firms for quotations. The replies I received are enclosed herewith as follows:\n\n1. Re the metallic ceiling.\n   Western Steel Products Ltd., Winnipeg, estimated cost F.O.B. Prince Albert, $96.09, to this should be added freight from Prince Albert to the School at 3\u00a2 a lb., or approximately $20.00.\n\n2. Re tables and benches.\n   (a) The Cusson Lumber Co., Ltd. St. Boniface, Man.\n   If made of oak $271.68, F.O.B. Prince Albert, if made of fir, $215.82. To this would have to be added the cost of battleship linoleum, as the oilcloth mentioned is not serviceable. A further sum of approximately $75.00 would have to be added for freight from Prince Albert to the School.\n(b) The Acme Sash & Door Co., St. Boniface, Man.\nEstimated cost F.O.B. Winnipeg $223.95, to this must be added $41.00 for freight from Winnipeg to Prince Albert and approximately $75.00 from Prince Albert to the School.\n\n(c) Cushing Bros., Saskatoon, Sask.\nQuotations not yet to hand.\n\n3.

If they are made by any of the firms who have given the quotations set forth above, and sent to the School, knocked down, the School Management will be able to put them together.\n\nAs it is very important that the above equipment should reach the School before the winter freighting season ends, I shall be obliged if you will kindly give the quotations submitted your earliest consideration, and either authorize Mr. Inspector Bunn of Winnipeg or our Commission to place orders for the same.\n\nWith the compliments of the Season,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office\n(b) The Acme Sash & Door Co., St. Boniface, Man.\nEstimated cost F.O.B.
