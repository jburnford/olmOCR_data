Samples of the water were taken and tested and found to be unfit for use. This being the likely source of infection it was urgently requested by the Ontario Department of Health that a new source of water supply be installed immediately and on the recommendation of Dr. J. C. Gillie and Dr. G. W. Houston, a pump and point etc. was purchased and shipped to the Mobert reserve, and arrangements made for the immediate installation of same.\n\nThe pump was purchased from the Coslett Machinery and Equipment Co. of Fort William, the only immediate source of supply at that time, at a cost of $27.85.\n\nI trust my action in this matter meets with the Department's approval and I would be pleased to receive authority to pass this account on to Ottawa for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

GREENING, School Inspector, on his inspection of the MOBERT Indian Day School\n\nOriginal on 9-14-6\n\nMr. Douglas, however, seems to be dissatisfied with the fuel situation. Really, the Indians do not seem to be particularly anxious to cut the school wood; they can make more with the pulp companies. He thinks that the most satisfactory and economical fuel for use at Mobert would be fuel oil. I do not know much about this problem myself, but perhaps the Agent has it in mind already.\nOttawa, May 17, 1946.\n\nMr. J. G. Burk, Indian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Robert Indian Day School, Inspector Greening states that Mr. Douglas seems to be dissatisfied with the fuel situation. Apparently there is considerable difficulty in having Indians cut the wood that is required. Mr. Douglas expressed the opinion to Mr. Greening that it would be more satisfactory and economical to use fuel oil.\n\nPlease let me know your opinion on the above suggestion and, if you approve, you should state if a suitable oil stove can be purchased in Port Arthur and, if so, at what price.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Item Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|----------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| Cal. neptulac clear varnish      | 1        | $4.56      | $4.56       |\n| Ct. white shellac                | 1        | $1.44      | $1.44       |\n| Cals.

The building is situated on top of a hill, and unfortunately, it has not been lined with rock wool. Consequently, it is extremely cold.\n\nIn order to make this building warm and comfortable, it will be necessary to line it with rock wool and insul brick siding. The cost of this material as per account enclosed herewith is $318.45. It will also be necessary to purchase linoleum for the kitchen which will cost approximately $30.00. I would also recommend the purchase of paint, varnish, oils, axe, saw frame etc., which I have listed and which will amount to approximately $36.28.\n\nOn my recent visit to this school, I found that the cess pool which the kitchen water drains into, will have to be rebuilt and dug-out, and this will cost approximately $25.00. There are minor repairs in connection with the rebuilding of the porch steps, putty windows etc., including repairing crack in the basement wall. The chimney is also badly in need of repairs and will cost approximately $75.00 to tear it down and rebuild. The approximate cost of labour in connection with putting on the brick siding, rock wool and rebuilding chimney etc., at $.68\u00a2 per hour, would be approximately $200.00.\n\nI would be pleased to receive the necessary authorization to start this work immediately.\n\nJ.

Phelan\n\nNo doubt you will recall, on my last visit we discussed the building of two schools, one at Mission Road, and one at Lake Helen. Unfortunately, material and supplies cannot be purchased for these two schools and consequently, we will have to wait until next year.\n\nHowever, I have just received a phone call from the Fairbanks-Morse, who assured me that the oil heaters I ordered for the Mobert Indian Day School, should reach Port Arthur not later than the 15th of this month. He said that he would set aside two for the Pic School and two for the Mobert School. The approximate amount of oil which I presume each school would use would be ten barrels. It will cost approximately .17\u00a2 per gallon, f.o.b. Schreiber, so the cost of the heating will be just about on a par with fuel wood, which is so hard to get. I was looking through my files but cannot find any letter from you authorizing the purchase of the oil heaters.\n\nIf our funds are getting low, we could eliminate the two heaters for the Pic Indian Day School. Fairbanks-Morse advise they will let me know the approximate cost very shortly. I believe the stoves will cost in the neighbourhood of $75.00 each. This price, of course, includes a reduction of 25% on cost price. Fairbanks-Morse promised to let me know the exact cost in a few days and I will drop you another line. I thought possibly I should write direct to you, as I had taken the matter up with you personally.\n\nI do hope I will be able to get down sometime later this fall and have a good long talk with you, as there are many things I would like to discuss. With very kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The porch floors need to be given two coats of gray paint.\n\nI have the paint on hand at present to do this work. However, I would estimate I would need about a $100. grant for this for labour purposes, and for the under-mentioned. (It is slow work doing these windows, frames, etc.\n\nThe bed-room and living room require re-finish-ing also. For this purpose, I would require the following:\n\n6 pkgs. Muresco (Ivory),\n4 pkgs.

Not a pencil in the school. I sent a requisition in to the Dept. two weeks ago through Mr. Burke's office. Could you do something about these books? Nearly all the books we had here were thrown into the lake. They fished some out\u2014three weeks ago. They don't know...\nhow the books got there. Please see to this matter personally. I guess you will have to go to the Printing Office or perhaps you could phone them.\n\nThe going is real tough here. I am doing my best to hang on but everything seems out of order. Our well dried up and we have to drink the lake water. Don't know what to do about it. I have been cleaning and painting ever since I came so you can see by the receipt. I got a cord of wood $6.00 and paid out $28.00 for cleaning, painting and wood. I hope they will refund. Thanks.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our well dried up and we have to drink the lake water. I don't know what to do about it. I have been cleaning and painting ever since I came as you can see by the receipts.

You should prepare and forward the usual vouchers so that her expenditures may be refunded.\n\nThe Department is disappointed that Mrs. MacNeil appears to be dissatisfied as we were under the impression that you had arranged for cleaning the building before Mrs. MacNeil arrived and for the purchase of wood. As a matter of fact, we have already paid accounts for these two purposes.\n\nThe Department feels that you should either visit this school yourself or have the clerk visit it at as early a date as possible and make certain that Mrs. MacNeil will be comfortable for the winter. We do not wish to lose her services at the present time.\n\nPlease forward the vouchers requested above and also let me know when you have taken the action outlined in this letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES  \nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to Mrs. M.

Upon receipt of this estimate we will communicate with you further.\n\nAnother item Mrs. MacNeil has requested is the painting and kalsomining of the residence and for this she estimates $20.00 will be expended in wages and $10.00 for paints and kalsomine.\n\nIt may be stated, in conclusion, that Mrs. MacNeil appears to be none too happy regarding her posting to the Mobert School. She constantly remarks about the Shubenacadie School in a nostalgic manner, impressing upon us the fact that this school had running water, electricity and modern in all respects. These comments are made notwithstanding the fact that the Mobert Indian Day School is in first class state of repairs.\nthough it may be admitted that some kalsomining could be done of course, there is no electricity nor running water. It is wondered if she had been apprised of these latter two deficiencies prior to her accepting the appointment. Another point raised by Mrs. MacNeil is the fact that the caretaker of the Shubenacadie School was paid at the rate of $65.00 per month for services. She is considerably disturbed at the payment of only $5.00 per month for caretaking duties at Mobert, stating that the discrepancy is too great, considering Shubenacadie is only a two-room school. Unquestionably, we shall have to have your consideration to pay the caretaker of the Mobert School an amount of $15.00 to $20.00 monthly. The amount of $5.00 monthly paid in the past was satisfactory to Mr. Douglas while teaching, for he was not adverse to undertaking a large share of the caretaking duties himself such as shovelling snow, bringing in water and wood, putting on storm windows, etc., and these duties cannot be undertaken by Mrs. MacNeil, who appears to be in rather fragile health.\n\nWe trust that the morale of Mobert Reserve will not deteriorate in any respect through the presence of Mrs. MacNeil for it appears that she is commenting to the Reserve Indians about the fine homes in Shubenacadie with light and water. As you know, no such centralization programme is in effect in Ontario (insofar as I know) and I do not consider it very judicious for one to come from one Reserve to another, to make remarks of a deprecating nature, for it is bound to cause a certain amount of dissention.\n\nYour authority to make the purchases as requested and also for the increase of caretaker's wages to an amount as stated, will be welcomed, please.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

She anticipates that the bishop from North Bay will be visiting the school in early April and is anxious to have the school looking trim for his arrival.\n\nApart from the above reason, and from my own knowledge of the class-room at this school, it really is in need of a kalsomining job, for it seemingly has not been done in recent years.\n\nIndian labour can be employed to carry out this job, and in materials the requirements would be about ten packages of kalsomine and 1 gal. of vernish stain, which should also leave enough varnish to do the desks.\n\nIt is recognized that our funds must be low right now, so this job will be held off until after the 1st of April, and we would welcome your authority to undertake this needed work (in the meanwhile).\n\nN.V.

McNeil has expressed considerable dissatisfaction over difficulties involved in running off the fuel-oil for use in the oil burners. She has asked if an oil suction pump with hose could be obtained for this purpose. We have inquired around and have found that we can obtain this outfit locally for $22.25, though there are cheaper ones available but it is felt they would be prove satisfactory in the long run. We are gradually having all things at this school comply with Mrs. McNeill's peculiar likings, though we do not mean this in a derogatory sense, for it is she who has to live there and to be comfortable.\n\nWe would also like to purchase a \"tri-sure\" wrench, or equivalent for opening of the oil barrel caps for they are using a medieval system of hammer and spike to loosen the caps at present. I have phoned the Imperial Oil to supply one -but they state they have none to spare.\n\nIf you authorize the above purchases, I will withhold the actual buying until new funds are available after 1st April.\n\n(for) J.G.

Sir,\n\nApplication having been made to the Department for the establishment of a school for the benefit of certain Indians that are located near the Tadanac Club property in the township of Freeman, a little inland from Partridge Bay, inquiries were made and it is found that there are some ten children of school age living there and the Department has been advised that a building could be obtained which would answer for school purposes temporarily.\n\nBefore deciding on any definite action in regard to this proposition the Department would be pleased to learn from you, as you are in the best position to furnish the desired information, whether you think there would be a sufficient attendance of children to justify the establishment of a school there. If so, kindly state what accommodation could be found for a teacher and whether you know of a suitable person to take charge of this school, if established. Mr. Joseph Partridge, at present temporarily in charge of the Henvey Inlet school, might be asked whether he would be willing to take charge of this school, as the Department is to put a qualified white teacher at Henvey Inlet. If your answer is favourable the Department would be disposed to give a school at this point a trial.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Wallace Nesbitt has spoken to me several times about setting apart a reserve for certain Indians who are living near the property of the Tadanac Club.\n\nI was assured that you would take an interest in this matter, as you knew something of the circumstances.\n\nWe would be willing to establish a school for these Indians and I have that matter now under consideration. I think it would be advisable to give them a small reserve. Would you kindly take this matter up with the Minister of Lands & Forests?\n\nThe amount of land suggested as a reserve for these Indians would be, to my mind, altogether too extensive a tract; it was mentioned as to extend from Moose Deer Point to Moon River and the borders of the Tadanac Club property.\n\nThe Province of Ontario would hardly be willing to set apart such an area in that district; I\n\nHon. W. J. Hanna,\nSecretary & Registrar,\nProvince of Ontario,\nToronto, Ont.\nthink 200 or 300 acres of land would be all that would be required.\n\nWould you give the matter your kind consideration? I would appreciate it.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have before me your favour of yesterday, with regard to the setting apart of a Reserve for certain Indians who are living near the property of the Tadansc Club.

The action which the Department had taken after I discussed the matter with you was to seek a report from the Rev. David Menomenee, Parry Island Reserve. At that time it was thought it would be necessary for the Department to engage the teacher. Rev. Mr. Menomenee has not made any report as yet, and I gathered from our conversation that he might have left a wrong impression on the minds of the Indians. I therefore, thought it best to tell you we do not wish to interfere with the present arrangement. If the teacher is qualified and will furnish us with the usual returns.\n\nJ. G. A.

You are quite all right in going on teaching. The Deputy-Minister gave me a list of books, etc., which he thought would be of the greatest value to you in the early stages, and which you can read over and you will no doubt understand upon reading them. I have bought them and am sending them as a present to Joe, but for the use of all the children, and I hope you will find them of great assistance. The Deputy-Minister of Education was greatly pleased at your doing what you are, instead of taking any objection to it. The Indian Department at Ottawa, I understand, are very much in favour of a school at Moose Point, and Joe will tell you that Mr. Creighton, who was with me this Summer, is doing what he can to help them along. I will be glad if you will get Joe to learn to read as well. I am sure that his little girl, Janie, will be very quick to learn.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

This I will ascertain and let you know. I understand from Mr. Wallace Nesbitt that he had discussed the matter with Mr. Colquhoun, the Deputy Minister of Education for Ontario, and that the latter fully approved of Miss Tobey continuing to teach.

First I want to relate that my two girls Kate and Alice had been attending school all winter and proved themselves to be quite intelligent and ready to learn, but during their attendance in this school I always took particular notice as to their slowness in their efforts to reach their expected promotion until they were somewhat tired and discouraged, for in fact, they had studied hard enough to deserve credit of promotion.\n\nAnd three weeks ago I placed Alice at Barry Island Indian School and after a full week's attendance she was placed or promoted to another class.\nAnd on inquiring here how her fellow pupils are getting along, I am informed that they are still hitched to the same class, proving therefore, that the school and the teacher mainly, are very unsatisfactory to me.\n\nFirst I beg to ask, are you going or intending to place that same teacher for the next term? If so let us know, for there are the majority of us who do not appreciate her services.\n\nDoes the Indian Department intend to purchase our house for school purposes?\n\nIf so, let me know before the first of next month as I intend to move in there soon. We do not gain anything on our house being used as governmental property, or public use. If Joe Sandy had tried to say anything to you when you passed here last in regard to our public affairs and the school I beg to say that it is all lie. Furthermore I beg to inform you to never ask Joe Sandy any question in regard to our affairs in our settlement.\nAnything in particular that you wish to know that regards the welfare of our Indian folks. Please write to our own address.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nMrs. Archie King\nAlexander Dock\nMoose Point\nOntario\nSir,\n\nMr. Archie King get regarding the price he wanted for his house, but if necessary I can find out by going over personally. If the Dept. does not see his way to secure that building the Indians will have to build another one during the holidays. Please advise & oblige.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nC. P. Vizette\nIndian Agent for\nChristian Island\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.\nActing Deputy and Sec.\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nPlease find enclosed school report for Indian Harbour Moore point. I had the occasion of visiting that school about June 6th and found a very fair building and equipped with good desks and seats; the Indians supply their own books; the house belongs to an Indian living near by, and he never intended to use it himself, so it was finished inside with lumber and is very suitable as it is, and the teacher thinks she would like to rent this and save the walking from her boarding house specially in the winter. Now the owner of that building has been ill-advised by someone, and I received a letter some times ago which I enclose for your consideration, I answered her, being told her if she would state what she wanted for the house the Dept might consider the question of buying, but I had none of her questions to answer.\n\nI also told the Indians that if she made a list of what was wanted for myself I would send it to the Dept.\n\nThere is a daily attendance of 10 to 12 children and they seem to be doing very well considering the school material they have; the blackboard is not very good, and they have no maps of any kind. I received no answer from...\nMr. Benson\n\nThe teacher at Kanonsyo School, Moose Point, Miss Lucy Toby, Moon Falls P.O., requires\u2014\n\n2 yards of white oilcloth for the wall and\na box of white pencil erasers, at your\nearliest convenience.

I have made the arrangements to carry on the Evangelistic work among the different reserves lying near by where my services may be called for; beside that I have enrolled two or three courses of study by correspondence that will keep me busy for the coming months.\n\nSchool teaching is a nice work I can recollect very well the time when I was sent to Henvey Inlet to teach there in 1888-1889. by permission of the school Inspector Rev. Geo. Grant, and Dr. Thom. Walton who was visiting Indian Superintendent at that time. I don't think would be a wise thing to do to change my plan of work after making known to my intentions to the public. Mr. Scott just the very thing I am taking now to prepare myself so I can be a teacher and preach as well should I go back in the active work in the future where the mission is connected with a school. As I am left without a station at my own request, I like to be near where I can get an assistance by the school teachers for the courses that I have enrolled. Moose Deer Point is out of the way who is taking this kind of study. Moose Deer Point is located about midway between Parry Sound and Penetanguishene, that is, about thirty miles each way and to the railroad of C.P.R. almost twenty miles walk. I trust that a year from now will be well prepared to take charge of any school under Mr. Logan's superintendency like Henvey Inlet school because its near the railroad and easy to get down to town.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department considers that more satisfactory results would be obtained if you assumed the responsibility of the oversight of this school, and it has, therefore, been decided to add this work to the duties of your agency. We are informing Mr. Agent Picotte, at Christian Island, that he will be relieved of this duty in future.\n\nYou should draw the attention of the Department to the repairs and alterations required, at a time, next spring, when you will be in a position to attend to the purchase of the material required and have the work done. It is considered that the school can carry on this winter without any expenditure being put on the building.\n\nThe Department will take up the question of having a public school inspector visit this school next spring.\n\nI have to thank you for the promptness and attention which you gave to our communication of the 25th ultimo, and for your report concerning the conditions and requirements at the school, and the distance between the different points mentioned by you.\n\nYou should forward a properly certified voucher covering the cost of the trip from Parry Sound to the school.

This change will date from the 1st instant. It will not, therefore, be necessary for you to attend to any matters concerning this school in future. It is considered that oversight of the school can be better attended to from Parry Sound than from Christian Island. Besides, the school is located within the boundaries of the Parry Sound Agency.\n\nThere is one point, however, on which the Department desires definite information, and you will be good enough to reply to our letter of the 24th ultimo, and state definitely what disposition was made of the paint purchased from M.

I am quite willing to go to teach in this isolated school. I should teach the matter by the method prescribed by the Department of Education, which, I understand has not been sufficiently followed by the present teacher. I should help these ambitious Indians in their religious and social affairs as they might require.\nI have completed the teacher's training course at the North Bay Normal School and should receive a Second Class Certificate.

They, the Indians, would like a qualified teacher.\n\nWhen they first spoke to me, I said that it was difficult to get a qualified teacher to go to Moose Deer Point and stay all the winter and suggested that if they could find a teacher who would I would bring the matter before the Dept. This was done.\n\nEnclosed is the application of Miss Jewel Arnold, who has been recommended to me. Miss Arnold went to High School with both my girls and was the smartest girl in school. She has just completed her normal course and in my opinion would be suitable to teach at Moose Deer Point as her home is within ten miles of the school. I would ask the Dept. to seriously consider the appointment of a qualified teacher. Mr. Sullivan is a fine fellow but the Indians know that he is no teacher and they are desirous of having their children taught as far as the fourth grade anyway. The last time I visited the Reserve, Mr. Sullivan seemed to think that he would not be teaching very long by the way he spoke to me.\n\nMiss Arnold promises to stay a couple of seasons at the salary of $350.00 per year, and I recommend her for the position.\n\nTrusting that this will be approved,\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

In the meantime, Mr. Bert Sullivan should arrange to open the school on September 1st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.M.

Gwyn, 48 Bloor St. East, Toronto)\nre Indians of Moose Deer Point, Georgian Bay\n\n\"The record of the King family, no school, no iodine, three children, all showing pronounced enlargement of the thyroid would almost speak for itself. These are the only children in the family, and for some reason have absented themselves from school:\n\nAmelia, aged 17\nAnnie, aged 5\nEl-Jane, aged 10\"\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nShe that she attends\nOttawa, October 8, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nDr. Norman B. Gwyn, of Toronto, who recently visited Moose Deer Point, has drawn attention to the case of three children of the King family, viz.: Amelie, aged 17; Annie, aged 5; and El-Jane, aged 10, who do not attend school. The first named is over school age and Annie has not yet reached school age.\n\nPlease take this matter up with the parents and use your utmost endeavour to see that Jane attends school regularly. If the other two children will attend, you should endeavour to have them do so. You will, no doubt, receive further instructions from Mr. Agent Daly regarding this matter. Please report to the Department whether Jane is attending regularly and whether the other two children named are attending school. The Department will expect to hear from you later regarding the attendance of these children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nBert.

Gwyn, of Toronto, who recently visited Moose Deer Point and made an examination of the Indian children in attendance at the school, states as follows regarding the King family:\n\n\"The record of the King family, no school, no iodine, three children, all showing pronounced enlargement of the thyroid, would almost speak for itself. These are the only children in the family and for some reason have absented themselves from school: Amelia, aged 17; Annie, aged 5; and El-Jane, aged 10.\"\n\nI have to request that you will take up with the parents and the teacher the matter of the attendance at school of the last named child. You should endeavour to see that this girl attends school regularly. The eldest girl is over school age and Annie has not yet reached school age. Unless their parents are willing that they attend, no action can be taken to compel them to do so.\n\nIf, in the course of your duties, you visit Moose Deer Point this fall, please take up the matter of the attendance of these children and report to the Department the result of any action taken to have El-Jane attend, also if the other two attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gwyn's report on the condition of the children at Moose Deer Point Reserve, I have to state that I have written to Dr. Scott about this matter.\n\nI intend to visit the Reserve as soon as I get through with my Fall payment, weather permitting and shall take Dr. Mason with me.\n\nWould the Dept. please instruct me as to how I am to arrange about furnishing the iodine. Last year I explained to the various families about getting iodized salt as requested by the Dept. upon the recommendation of Dr. Gwyn, and have been informed by the Indians that they are using same.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir:\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D.

I saw all the school children and then visited the homes, where I examined the children under school age. The king children referred to in your letter are not on the reserve, but I presume they belong to Christian Island. Among the children I saw no case of goiter nor did I see any marked case or noticeable one among the adults.\n\nOne married woman told me she had had an enlarged thyroid, but that it had \"gone away.\"\n\nOne little lad from Fairy Island had tubercular glands; another had had very much enlarged cervical glands. Some of the people needed medical attention, but none were near in a condition to cause any alarm.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Rankin Nesbitt and Mrs Wallace Nesbitt and Mr. Beatty, the in-law, of Mr. Nesbitt, will back up this request.\n\nThe reason for this change of mind here is that the Indian children, who are there at Moose Point are not attending the school, and the Chief of the Band there Samuel Isaac, is very dissatisfied with the teacher. This I think you know.\n\nI have been to Moose Point recently and find that there is a great desire on the part of the Indians there for a qualified teacher. I would like to discuss this matter with you when in Ottawa at the Exhibition, and will be able to go more fully into the details. I think it would be an easy matter to arrange for a teacher to board there, but as I stated, we can go into this matter when I get down there.\n\nYour consideration will be greatly appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As soon as I have arrangements completed I will then arrange for the teacher according to instructions.\n\nWould you please notify me at your earliest as to salary and if there will be a grant for board as the teacher will have to board out. The teacher's house will have to be fixed up, and roughly speaking this would cost about $300.00.\n\nIn the meantime I am arranging that the teacher will stay with white people who are the caretakers of Honourable Wallace Rossit's place, which is quite convenient.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, September 13, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, informing the Department that you have notified Mr. Bert Sullivan, teacher of the Moose Deer Point Indian Day School, that his services will not be required after the end of December next.\n\nIn this connection, it is noted that you will arrange to obtain a qualified teacher to succeed him and also for boarding accommodation. The Department will allow salary at the rate of $85 per teaching month if a teacher having the necessary qualifications is obtained. It is expected that the teacher will provide the cost of board, as the above salary is the full amount we allow. It is noted that you will arrange for boarding accommodation for the new teacher with white people.

Sim, whose present address is c/o The Fred Victor Mission, 141 Jarvis St., Toronto. He is a very interesting case. He is about middle age, an old country man, and he has adopted a boy about ten years of age. The boy is very bright and they are evidently attached to each other and do not wish to separate. Mr. Sim tells me that he was a Roman Catholic, but that he has left that Church and joined the Anglican Church. For several years he worked in Residential Schools in western Canada as teacher, and he would like an appointment in a school among the Indians on a Reserve if such an opportunity opens. I think he is the type of man who would serve an isolated district very well. If there is such an opening in your territory, you might correspond with him. You can secure from him all particulars and then use your own judgment.\n\nWith kindest wishes,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAB:NEF\nParry Sound, Ont.\nJune 20, 1931.\n\nT-3182.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to yours of June 15-22-7-1 re Miss Isabelle Pelletier the lady who has been passing her time as teacher at Moose Deer Point Indian Day School, enclosed find letter from the Rev. Arthur Barner, Superintendent of Indian Missions for the United Church in Canada, which I have kept on file handy because I knew that Miss Isabelle Pelletier would not be teaching next term. I had my mind made up to that effect, and I would certainly have tried to persuade the Department that I was correct in my consideration of the case.\n\nI have come to the conclusion re teachers in this agency, the less we have to do with the Indian teachers, the better for the pupils.\n\nI am enclosing two letters received from the Rev. Arthur Barner, one on May 26th and the other in reply to mine of June 9th. I think, according to Mr. Barner's letter that this is the solution to the problem of a teacher at Moose Deer Point. I don't think it is a place for a girl to be. You have Mr. Sims record, if you think he is the man for this position please let me know. I have a few applications from Roman Catholic teachers, but the Indians down there are Protestants and would object to a Roman Catholic teacher being there.\nWhen taking the census I find that there are about ten Indian children who will attend school in the fall, if we have a teacher, and about five whites.\n\nPlease return the enclosed letters from Mr. Barnet.\n\nOn receipt of a favourable reply to Mr. Sims, I will write to him.

Sim as teacher of the Moose Deer Point Indian Day School to succeed Miss Isabelle Peltier.\n\nIn reply I have to say that Mr. Sim was previously in the employ of the Department as teacher of the Garden River Anglican Indian Day School from January to June, 1930. His services were unsatisfactory, and the Department had to dispense with same. We are not prepared to approve of his appointment as teacher at the Moose Deer Point School or at any other Indian school.\n\nI would, therefore, request that you endeavour to obtain the services of a teacher for this school, forwarding the name, qualifications and experience of any applicants for the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I had Dr. Mason along with me, to Moose Point. He examined all the people there and he will make a report to this office as to his findings which I will forward to the Department as soon as I receive.\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised at the great improvement in Moose Point School. The deportment of the children was excellent. The examples of the children's map drawing and hand sewing were good, and the sanitary arrangements as laid down by the teacher for teeth cleaning drill were the best that I have seen in any school.\n\nThe teacher and pupils seem very happy together and she has complete control of the children.\n\nThe building is very much in need of painting both inside and outside. The attendance is the best that has ever been in that school, and some of the boys and girls who have missed school a lot, I have persuaded to attend school and brush up on the instructions that they have had in the past.\n\nI will send in an estimate of the probable cost of painting the school outside and inside in time for the March Estimates in the House.\nOn my visit to Honey Harbour Combined School, I was very disappointed at the attendance and at the condition of the school. I could see no improvement in the building. The building is the same as when visited by Inspector McGeekin and myself. The Rev. Henry Black of Parry Sound, who is secretary of the school board, is not at home at the present time. I have been trying to get him for the last two weeks, and have asked that he ring me up. I expect to have conversation with Rev. Collins this afternoon, or this evening some time, re this matter and will report later, as to the reason why some of the grant from the Department of Indian Affairs was not used for the fixing up of the building as it was intended for this purpose.\n\nThe number on the roll is 31, and the average attendance for October is 16. There are four sick at the present time.\n\nI will write later as to the condition of this school, when I get more information from the Rev. Collins, or the Rev. Black.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nAgent.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed please find resignation of Miss Donald at Moose Deer Point School.\n\nAs stated in Miss Donald's resignation she intends attending Normal School to try and obtain her Teachers Permanent Certificate. I have been endeavouring to impress on Miss Donald the advisability of having her permanent certificate and I am pleased to see that she is minded that way. There was a time when I thought she was liable to lapse back into the life of the reserve. You know that Miss Donald was a pupil in the Chapleau Residential School and owing to her being a little orphan girl I am very much interested in her.\n\nIn conversation with her, I have come to the conclusion that she is not going to be any too flush of cash. If there is any way whereby the Department can assist this Indian girl, who is desirous of improving her education and equipping herself for a life of usefulness, I would appreciate it very much if they would let me know. The position I would like to be in, is this, that if this girl should run short of cash before she would get through in Normal, could the Department help out. She is an Indian orphan girl, and if the Department could arrange to help her, in the event of help being required, I am sure it would be very much appreciated by her.\n\nMiss Donald does not know that I am asking this, but it is because of looking ahead that I think she will be short. It is because she is so anxious to\ntry that I would like the Department to help her if necessary.\n\nThe consideration of the Department would be very much appreciated.\n\nI should also state that I have been receiving applications from a teacher, Miss Mary E. Sharpe, of Ida, Ont., for the last two years. I have various applications for positions, but this girl seems anxious to teach in an Indian Day School. Her application was sent to the Department in mine of August 5th, T-3228 and enclosed is a letter received from her on April 26th, 1932.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if the Department would let me know if they think it advisable for this girl to send forward her references.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/BK.\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, June 11, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your T-3527, enclosing the resignation of Miss Donald, teacher of the Moose Deer Point Indian Day School. Her resignation is accepted, and the Department will see that she receives a further trial at one of its schools in September, 1933. You will receive a separate communication concerning any assistance that can be given to her as she completes her normal course.\n\nI have examined the application from Miss Mary E. Sharpe, of Ida, Ont., which you forwarded. I am returning her letter, with the comment that she would, no doubt, be quite suitable. However, the Department is interested in a young Indian man, Peter McGregor, 21 years of age, of Maniwaki, Que., and would like to examine his suitability for the vacancy at Moose Deer Point. He has just completed his matriculation course at Ottawa University, and, while he has no professional standing, he is the right type and I believe might be quite successful at a small Indian school. As he is a ward of the Department, it is desirable that he be given the preference if you think he could fill the position. He is Roman Catholic in religion, but I understand that the religion of the teacher is not of real importance at Moose Deer Point. The Department would be grateful for an immediate reply, stating whether you think Mr. McGregor would meet the requirements at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I have noted your comments re the application of Miss Mary E. Sharpe, and re Peter McGregor, an Indian of Maniwaki, Que.\n\nIn reply I have to state that if Moose Point were more accessible, I would be delighted to have Peter McGregor, but as we can only reach this place by boat, and only in the summer months, most of the time when there is no school being held, I have an idea that Peter McGregor starting up in his career as a teacher would require a little supervision. However, if it is the wish of the Department to send this young man here, I shall be pleased to do all I can to assist him and explain to him what is required in this school.\n\nI have to statethat the Chief of this Band will not like to have an Roman Catholic teacher in this school, but under the circumstances I do not think it will be necessary to explain to him anything about it if the Department are satisfied. I will be going to Moose Deer Point School some time this week, as it appears the weather will be suitable, and I will explain the matter to the people down there that there will be a man teacher coming, providing the Department sees fit to send Peter McGregor.\nA school such as the one at Lower French would be a good school for a young man like this to start up in, where I could see him once a month or keep in touch with him better than I could do at Moose Point, but the desire of the Department is quite satisfactory to me.\n\nWould the Department please reply by return mail and let me know if this is a final decision re appointing Peter McGregor for this school, as I will be going to Moose Point about the end of this week.\n\nI thank the Department for granting the ball and bat for this school, and as I promised the children that they could get a swing, I am providing the swing myself, and would appreciate it very much if the ball and bat could be sent here so that I could take them down to the school with me when I go. I have sent to Eaton's for the swing and expect it here on Wednesday.\n\nThe consideration of the Department and a reply by return mail, will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn M.

When this information is received, we will be prepared to advance him a grant on his salary, sufficient to pay the cost of his transportation. It is considered that he would not require any large outfit of clothing at Moose Deer Point. The Department would not be prepared to grant him a loan to be repaid by instalments from his salary. He could arrange to pay the University of Ottawa for the amount he owes them, from the salary he will receive as teacher at Moose Deer Point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

He should advise Mr. Daly at least two full days before he arrives, so that arrangements can be made to take him by motor boat to the school. If Mr. McGregor calls at the Department on his way to Parry Sound, full instructions will be given him, but he should communicate with Mr. Daly at once and tell him when he expects to arrive in Parry Sound.\n\nThe Department will make Mr. McGregor an advance on his salary to cover the cost of his transportation expenses, and a cheque will be handed to him when he calls at the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Between the two families there are 7 children of school age, and the parents would like to know if their children would be given admission to this school (immediately). These R.C. people, by the names of Lepine and Carri\u00e8re, are of very moderate means, and decent.\nConditions have forced them & seek refuge in this district.\n\nThe school, I might say, has a capacity of 16 pupils, 8 of which are at present occupied; seeing that there remain 8 vacant seats, I deem it appropriate in asking an opportunity on their behalf, and feel sure the humble newcomers would be very grateful.\n\nBeing able to speak French myself, I would undoubtedly make out quite alright.\n\nPlease consider the question, and kindly acquaint me with your decision by return mail.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPeter McGregor.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed please find communication from Peter McGregor, School teacher of the Moose Point Indian Day School, asking if seven children of two French Roman Catholic families may attend the Moose Point School.\n\nThere is no organized township there and according to what I understand about the situation these people would be expecting to have their children attend the school without paying any fees. Would the Department please let me know if these children may attend the school and what fees would be charged. There are eight vacant seats in the school and they are likely to be vacant because I do not know of any increase in the Indian population ready for school at Moose Point, in the meantime.\n\nA reply from the Department at their very earliest will be appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/RRK\n\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, May 12, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing a communication from the teacher of the Moose Deer Point Indian Day School requesting authority to permit the seven children of two French families to attend school. It is noted that there is seating accommodation.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, if these white children would not interfere with the instruction given the Indian children, the Department would have no objection to their attendance, provided the teacher is willing to give them the regular classroom instruction. Permission is granted on the understanding, however, that if at any time the accommodation is required for Indian children, the attendance of the white children would be discontinued.\n\nThese children may attend for the balance of the present school year without payment of fees. However, if you consider fees should be charged when the school reopens after the summer holidays, I would request that you make a recommendation in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I had quite an interesting conversation with him. When Chief Sam Isaacs of the Moose Point Band was here some time ago I made enquiries about the school and how things were getting along. He told me that the attendance was not good, and the number of children was not likely to increase for some time.\n\nI had conversation with Peter McGregor and following is a list of the names and ages of the children who are attending school,\n\nNorman Williams, age 13\nAlfred Williams, age 7\nNelson Isaac, age 7\nLena Williams, age 5\n\nand Manley Martin, age 12, a white boy, son of the caretaker of the Honourable Mr. Jesuit's place. That is four Indian children and one white boy. In talking to Mr. McGregor he informs me that there are four children under five years of age on the Reserve, over and above these children; that would be four Indian children attending school and four Indian children under school age.\n\nI advised Peter McGregor to call at the Department on his way home to Manawaki and advised him that perhaps the Department could not see fit to carry on this school because of the lack of attendance. It seems hardly reasonable to keep the school going for four children and one white boy.\nPeter McGregor has been very successful in this school and if the Department should see fit to close the school I would recommend Peter McGregor as a good man for any other outlying school. I think that he is a very conscientious young man.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if the Department would give me their opinion about this so that if the Superintendent General Dr. McGill should come here before the end of the month on his visit, I would be able to make an explanation to the Indians if the Department thinks that this school should be closed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, June 27, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the Moose Deer Point Indian Day School. While your letter mentions only five Indian children and one white boy in attendance, the March quarter return showed an enrolment of 11 and an average attendance of 8. Is the Department to understand that the children mentioned in official letter of May 12, 1933, are also attending this school?\n\nIf the school was closed, there would be no provision for the education of the Indian children. Would it not be possible to arrange with the Provincial Department of Education to bear part of the expenses of this school, in view of the number of white children attending it? This would mean that the school would be a joint Indian and white school. Please take up this matter with the Public School Inspector in the district and advise the Department as soon as possible if he would recommend this arrangement. When your reply is received, this Department will communicate with the Department of Education, Toronto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJohn M.

He will\nexplain the situation to you.\n\nThe white children who were at the school\nhave left and gone to Penetang and it is Mr. McGregor's\nfigures of the children attending the school that\nI have given you. I thought it was only proper that the\nDepartment should know.\n\nUnder the circumstances it would be no use\ntaking the matter up with the Public School Inspector.\nThe fact of the matter is the Public School Inspector\nhas never called at that school. I thought it was only\nright that the Department should know the number of\npupils attending the school. I will be going down\nthere soon with Dr. Mason to vaccinate the children\non the Reserve and have my semi annual visit and will\nmake a check up myself and later on report to the\nDepartment.\n\nTrusting this is the information required.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nUnderstanding that the Dept. is at present contemplating on closing the Moosehead Point School where I was a teacher, I have been home here in Maniwaki & discover that prospects of other work are by no means in view.\n\nThe purpose of this letter is therefore to beg that be considered in your decision as to whether the school will be closed or not.\n\nI understand figures would show a gain by closing the school and sending the children elsewhere, but I suggest and am willing to resume duties in dept. under a reasonable reduction of salary for the purpose of seeing me occupied, at the same time earning...\na salary which would mean a decent living for myself as well as a contribution for the upkeep of my younger brothers and sisters. Please consider the help that would be given me should I be granted the privilege of resuming duties at the school.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nPeter McKeague\nManiwaki, July 13th, 1934.\n\nSir;-\n\nPeter McGregor, of the Maniwaki Reserve, who has been teaching school at Moose-Deer-Point for the last two years, has informed me that on account of the decrease in number of the children of school age in that locality, the school will probably not be opened in September. As this young man is anxious to work, would it not be possible to employ him in his former school at a reduced salary, or give him a position as assistant teacher in some other school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nA.

I find in checking up on the children who could attend school that there are seven Indian children and four white children that would attend if there was another teacher.\n\nMiss Donald who has been teaching there, and who is now at the St. John's Indian Residential school, Chapleau, has written me stating that she has applied for a school in the Department. As far as I can make out by the comments of the Indians and the whites down there, Miss Donald will be quite successful if she got the appointment.\n\nThere is also a Mr. Garrett a very fine type of man applying for the school, but I understand he has no certificate. However according to the information that I have he would have made a better teacher than Mr. McGregor.\n\nW. R. Nesbitt Esq., is very much interested in the school, and has been in conversation with Dr. McGill re this school at some time, and I think he is writing to Dr. McGill about the school.\nI would strongly advise that another teacher be got for this school, as the old teacher, Peter McGregor does not seem to have been a success there.\n\nTrusting this communication will receive the earnest consideration of the Department\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/BK.\nAgent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nFor the past two years, an Indian named Peter McGregor has been in charge of the Moose Deer Point Indian Day School on Moose Point Reserve #79 in the Electoral District of Muskoka-Ontario.\n\nThe Indian Agent now advises that there has been a lack of cooperation between Mr. McGregor and the parents of the children who attend this school and, under these circumstances, Mr. Daly considers that it would be advisable to dispense with Mr. McGregor's services.\n\nTo replace him, the Indian Agent recommends Miss Emily Donald. She is an Indian and holds a second class Ontario certificate. She has had experience in teaching at the Chapleau Indian Residential School.

McGill, Esq., M.D., M.C., V.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI have been approached through several of the adult Indians in regard to the school question at Moose Point Reservation. I understand that representations are being made to close this school on account of lack of attendance. I hesitate to write the following in anything but a desire to see this small band whom my father was so interested in, have anything but the best considered acts done on their behalf.\n\nThe teacher who was there last year was, I think, unsuitable and on his account to some degrees the attendance fell off considerably. After a very careful check, I find that there are 14 children anxious and ready to receive tuition. In addition to this, I think given the proper teacher, several of the older ones who have already attended, would return with little pressing, partly owing to lack of other employment and partly through a degree of interest in the benefits they have already received.\n\nThe small band, I know you will agree, are at present reflecting the past years of the school's existence since it was started by Dr. Scott at the instigation of my father and it would be a pity to allow this to be dropped when the material, i.e., buildings, are there already and the actual teacher's remuneration is the only required outlay.\n\nAgain let me add that I am writing in an endeavour to see that you receive as accurate an impression of conditions in that locality as possible and not in a spirit of interference, but I would suggest that if possible, you might secure the services for that position of the former teacher, Miss Donald, who made a very real impression on the children but left for a period of further study. I understand that Miss Donald is available and would accept this position if it were offered.\n\nPlease excuse my having bothered you with this problem, but every time, I have been at our house near the Village, I have representations made to me to use my influence in bringing the subject to your attention.\n\nTrusting that I may have the pleasure of calling on you when I am in Ottawa next.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.

Apparently the new school at Twelve Mile Bay is approximately three miles away from the village and the Chief says the younger children are unable to attend school in the winter because the distance through the bush under winter conditions is too far and hard for small children. Will you please give Mr. Nesbitt all possible details concerning this matter in a letter for my signature. I would appreciate receiving an extra copy of this letter for transmission to Mr. W.K.

Nesbitt, Esq., M.P.,\n14 Pinkle Street,\nWoodstock, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Nesbitt:\n\nI have now received a report from our departmental officers regarding educational facilities for the Indians of the Moose Point Band.\n\nI am advised that there is a school building at Moose Point which was erected some forty-five years ago. It belongs to the Band and is now used as a dwelling by the Chief. This school was operated by the Branch until several years ago when because of disrepair and the difficulty of obtaining teachers it was closed.\n\nDue to no school facilities being available, the non-Indians who had sent their children to the Indian school made representations to the Provincial Government and a small provincial school was erected less than ten years ago. This is known as \"Twelve Mile Bay School\". It is a well constructed building, well equipped, good lighting, good blackboard space and inside toilets. At the present time, there is only one non-Indian attending this school. The remainder are Indian pupils and their tuition is paid for by this Department. Due to taxation of the numerous rather expensive summer homes in the area, the school finances are in very good shape and they are not dependent on the grant received from the Department for the Indian children in attendance. However, if the Indian children did not attend this school, the Department of Education would ask the School Board to close it.\nIt is felt that the present arrangement provides most adequately for the education of our Indian children, and it is questionable if we could improve on the instruction presently available to these children.\n\nThe provincial school requires the pupils to walk about two miles, and transportation is somewhat difficult during the winter months. However, our field officers are making arrangements to see that the trail from the Reserve to the school is kept open, and it is not anticipated that these children will encounter any difficulties due to heavy drifts of snow.\n\nI trust that this will explain the situation satisfactorily, and that you will agree that the old Goose Point School should not be re-opened.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Miss) R.C.

It belongs to the band and is now used as a dwelling by the Chief. This school was operated by the Branch until several years ago when because of disrepair and the difficulty of obtaining teachers it was closed.\n\nDue to no school facilities being available, the non-Indians who had sent their children to the Indian school made representations to the Provincial Government and a small provincial school was erected less than ten years ago. This is known as \"Twelve Mile Bay School\". It is a well constructed building, well equipped, good lighting, good blackboard space and inside toilets. At the present time, there is only one non-Indian attending this school. The remainder are Indian pupils and their tuition is paid for by this Department. Due to taxation of the numerous rather expensive summer homes in the area, the school finances are in very good shape and they are not dependent on the grant received from the Department for the Indian children in attendance. However, if the Indian children did not attend this school, the Department of Education would ask the School Board to close it.\nIt is felt that the present arrangement provides most adequately for the education of our Indian children, and it is questionable if we could improve on the instruction presently available to these children.\n\nThe provincial school requires the pupils to walk about two miles, and transportation is somewhat difficult during the winter months. However, our field officers are making arrangements to see that the trail from the Reserve to the school is kept open, and it is not anticipated that these children will encounter any difficulties due to heavy drifts of snow.\n\nI trust that this will explain the situation satisfactorily, and that you will agree that the old Moose Point School should not be re-opened.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Miss) M.C. Hoey,\nAssociate Private Secretary.\nHouse, Ottawa, October 17, 1956.\n\nWoodstock, Ontario.\n\nOctober 12th, 1956.\n\nMiss Wallace Nesbitt, Esq., M.P.,\nSecr. 14 Finkle Street,\nMin. Woodstock, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Nesbitt:\n\nI have received your letter of October 12, 1956, concerning educational facilities for the Indians of the Moose Point Band.\n\nI am taking this matter up further with departmental officials in the light of the representations which you have made.\n\nWhen I have received their report, I shall again write you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Miss) M. C. Hoey,\nAssociate Private Secretary.\nMINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n\nOTTAWA, October 17, 1956.\n\n22/25-1-411 (E1)\n\nTO: Deputy Minister.\n\nFOR: Director of Indian Affairs.\n\nPreparation of reply for signature of Associate Private Secretary\n\nDiscussion with\n\nPerusal and necessary action\n\nReport\n\nto attached letter dated Oct. 12, 1956, from Wallace Nesbitt, Esq., M.P., 14 Finkle St., Woodstock, Ont., dealing further with the question of educational facilities for the Indian of the Moose Point Band and stating that there is really no trail through the bush from Moose Point Village to Twelve Mile Bay where the present school is located. He states that the children must go through swamps and high rocks and even in the winter time he does not see how this path could be kept open.\n\nPerhaps we might indicate to Mr. Nesbitt that attendance of the children concerned at Twelve Mile Bay school has been good.\n\nI attach copy of interim acknowledgment.\n\nENCL. MCH/PG\n\nAssociate Private Secretary.\nOttawa, October 24th, 1956.\n\nWallace Nesbitt, Esq., M.P.,\n14 Finkle Street,\nWoodstock, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Nesbitt:\n\nI refer to your letter of October 12th, concerning educational facilities for the Indians of the Moose Point Band.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that the Superintendent who has recently been appointed to the Parry Sound Agency has personally investigated the trails to which you make reference, and states that it is not the intention to use these but two old logging roads which can be improved and connected to the Indian settlements. He reports that the Mactier Council intends to spend $500.00 in work on the roads. He has also reported that a team of horses can be secured to provide transportation during the severe weather in the winter.\n\nI attach a photostatic copy of a rough sketch which indicates that there are three Indian settlements in the area which the provincial school is able to serve. If, however, the school is reopened at King's Bay, the provincial school on Twelve Mile Bay would undoubtedly close for lack of enrolment. This would deny educational facilities to the three children who live close to Martin's Saw Mill and the six pupils who live on the reserve which borders the Twelve Mile Bay.\n\nI should also add that the Inspector of Schools reports that he examined the register at the provincial\n\n....2\nschool and \"was surprised at the high attendance of our Indian pupils\".\n\nYou will appreciate, I am sure, that it is most difficult, if not impossible, to secure teachers in the middle of the school term.\n\nAlthough the majority of the children reside on the reserve at King's Bay, it would hardly seem that the department is justified in taking steps to open the school there when it would result in lack of school facilities at the other two points.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Miss) H.C. Hoey,\nAssociate Private Secretary\nVol I closed\n\n4/11-1\n\n22-7-1 CLOSED\n\nFROM 12/10/16.\n\nTO 31/12/34.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6145)\n\nFile 411-1, part 1\nParry Sound Agency - Moose Deer Point School -\nTeachers - General Administration. 1916 - 1934, 1956\n\nFile 411-3, part 1\nParry Sound Agency - Moose Deer Point School -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1917 - 1934, 1941\n\nFile 411-5, part 1\nParry Sound Agency - Moose Deer Point School -\nEstablishment - Building Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1917 - 1934\n\nFile 411-5, part 2\nParry Sound Agency - Moose Deer Point School -\nBuilding Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts.\n1949 - 1950\n\nFile 411-8, part 1\nParry Sound Agency - Moose Deer Point School -\nTeachers' Residence - Building Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1920, 1928 - 1929, 1943\n\nFile 412-3, part 1\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Fort School -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1937 - 1948\n\nFile 412-5, part 1\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Fort School -\nBuilding Maintenance - Supplies -\nAccounts. 1907 - 1912\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nMoose Deer Point\n\nKegs for teachers salary\nProvince of Ont.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFor Quarter ended Dec 31/6 & Mar 31/9 17\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount Due | Address to which Cheque is to be sent |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Lucy Tobey      | Moose Point    | $400                   | $200       | Teacher Moon Falls Ont.               |\n\nNo. of School days in quarter ...........................................\nNo. days School was open ..................................................\nNo. holidays .............................................................................\nGrant asked for ..........................................................................\n\nRemarks:\nThis school was opened for the benefit of the Indian children residing at Moose Point.

The Department is paying him salary in full for both these quarters and a cheque has been sent him care of Capt. William Martin, Penetanguishene. You will be good enough to have the teacher make out new returns for both the above quarters and have them sent to you for transmission to the Department.\n\nIt is expected that you will give this matter your prompt attention and see that these returns are properly made out by the teacher and forwarded to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nA cheque for the bonus due the teacher is being sent to you and you will be good enough to see that he receives this cheque.\n\nA supply of blank quarterly school return forms have been sent to the teacher as requested by him and when he receives instructions from you to prepare new returns as directed above, there should be no delay in him doing so.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nC.

I visited the school, which was open. They are now in an old log house, just a single room, in which they have a stove and some desks and benches. I saw all the children put through their paces, and I was very much pleased to see how they are getting on; one or two of the children could read quite long words like \"returning,\" and other words of three syllables. The main result, however, of starting the school has been the very marked improvement in the elders, who seem to take more interest in keeping their houses tidy and doing a little gardening; whether this is the effect of the atmosphere of the school, etc., or of prohibition I do not know, perhaps a combination of both.\n\nAs to the reserve - I hope you will be able to stop any possibility of the cutting of any of the little hardwood under the old timber license; I think this is under the old timber license that many years ago covered everything, but there would be no hardship whatever in the Government, so far as the reserve is concerned, refusing to renew the license as to that part; if they do not they might as well not give the reserve. I should think it would be sufficient if the grant\nwas made to include the portions south and west of Twelve Mile Bay, but if you send somebody up, he had better get hold of Joe Sandy, who will show him all about by boat; he will find Joe most intelligent.\n\nThe Indians are very anxious to have a little school built which will give proper accommodation and air, etc., and they are clearing a little space at the end of a bay where it would be convenient. I told Joe Sandy to tell the others that I would ask you to say that you would pay towards the school, say, $500, which I think would buy the lumber and shingles and the Indians themselves could do the work. Joe had a quotation from Napoleon Payette for the erection of a school, and my recollection is it was $925, but I think if the Department would, on the certificate of your agent there that the school had been erected, say that you would pay for same to the extent of $500, that the Indians might well do the rest.\n\nTo my mind, the interest you have taken in this group, if the school is built and the reserve is set apart, will result most beneficially in making a number of Indians good citizens, and sober and industrious. There is a little bickering from some other Indians at Parry Island, and elsewhere, largely I think instigated by religious rivalry. Miss Tobey is a Catholic but does not attempt to bring religion into the school, and I fancy that one or two outsiders, who are strong Methodists, think she might attempt to introduce religion. I warned her against having any dispute of this kind.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSeptember 24, 1917.\n\nDear Mr. Nesbitt,-\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant and am pleased to learn of the improved conditions among the Indians at Moose Deer Point, also that the children are making progress in their school work. With regard to a more permanent building, I have to say that, when we have the matter of the reserve finally settled, I shall be pleased to make a reasonable grant to provide better accommodation.\n\nMr. White, Surveyor of this Department, is leaving for Toronto to-night; he will consult with the Department of Lands, Forests & Mines and then proceed north to make a selection of land for the reserve. He will also call upon you and any help you can give him will be greatly appreciated.\n\nWith regard to the timber license, I hope that we will have sufficient influence with the Hon. Mr. Ferguson to have the lands selected for the reserve eliminated from the timber license.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, 11th October 1917.\n\nReport on school at Moose Point, King's Bay.\n\nSir,\n\nWith regard to the school at Moose Point, King's Bay, which has been named \"Kanonsiyo\" or Happy Home I may say that the building in which they held school last year was not available and the school was moved to Mr. Joe Sandy's house on lot 55, Con. 7. There were eleven children in attendance the day I was there and everything seemed to indicate that especially good work was being done. Children who did not know a work of English a year ago had learned to speak it fluently and were reading well from the Second Book. Nearly all the pupils could count to 100, they were doing small sums and some of them were learning to multiply.\n\nThe teacher, Miss Tobey, likes her work very much but finds that the long walk to the school in the Fall and Winter has so impaired her health that she considers handing in her resignation. As she appeared to be making such splendid progress and seemed exceptionally able, I used my best endeavours to induce her to reconsider her plan and she said that if a school were built with a room in it in which she could live, she might stay all winter.\n\nD.C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAfter completing the survey I exchanged what portion of the hardware I could for the following articles which are needed at the school,-\n\n1 snow shovel\n1 hammer\n1 round spade\n1 fire shovel\n1 galvanized pail\n1 short axe\n2 panes glass\n\nFor the stove I obtained a credit of $3.75 in the name of Joe Sandy from M.A.Gendron. This will be very useful to procure little articles required in the building of the school; in any case the stove would only have been a waste.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6145, File 411-5, part 1)\nOttawa, October 11, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that it has been decided to build a school at King's Bay, Moose Point, also known as Alexander or Partridge Bay. This work is to be proceeded with at once so as to enable the Indians to carry out their part before leaving for the woods.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a list of material required for a school 16' x 32'; it is to have a stone foundation placed 2' below ground and 4' above, and two rooms for the teachers use, and a small porch in addition to the main room.\n\nKindly submit this bill of materials for prices to all the lumber firms in Penetanguishene and Midland, and get their tenders in writing for the materials delivered at Alexander Bay in the place directed by Joe Sandy. For their information I may say that the boat can land very close to the school site.\n\nYou will kindly attend to this work at once, and order the lumber and other materials from the lowest bidder with the understanding that it is to be shipped immediately.\n\nBe good enough to inform the Department of the lowest price received and from whom, before making the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.J.

It will be 16' X 32', with a small porch, the walls will be 12' high and there will be two rooms for the teachers' use. Instead of being sheeted on the outside it will be shingled, and no half inch lumber will be used. A sketch plan and outline specifications for your guidance in building are inclosed.\n\nYou should set your men to work at once getting the stone on the site for the foundation, and if possible, it would appear to be advantageous for you to consult Mr. Picotte and hasten the matter in any way possible. In this connection it will be advisable for you to get the lime at your earliest opportunity and have the wall built when the lumber arrives. The wall will be 16' X 32' outside, and 3' high, that is 2' below ground and 1' above and 2' thick, and you will use lime instead of cement.\n\nIt is hoped that there will be no delay so that the school will be ready to be occupied not later than the middle of November.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nIndian Affairs.

These items are not specified on list but as they are required we have figured accordingly.\n\nThanking you for the inquiry and hoping to have the pleasure of booking the order for prompt shipment, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNHA/H\nSir,\n\nPlease find enclosed orders for material in school at Cononigo.\n\nIn looking over the orders I notice that the lowest order does not specify the quality of lumber, while the others are doing so.\n\nI did not go to the Georgian Bay stock mills the second time as they were much higher in the first place than the others.\n\nThe Fleming planing mill made a difference of $6.50 on the second listing. Mr. Payette spoke for them.\n\nI did not give the lowest for the reasons given above, and thought it would be better if you could see the orders yourselves. Please advise.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nC. P. Nicoll\nIndian Agent for\nChristian Island\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.\nAct.

Meet Mr. White, Canada House, Penetang, Thursday, one p.m.\"\n\nIt is noted in the tenders for material for the Kanonsiyo School at Moose Point submitted by you that no tender was received from the Gropp Bros., or it may be J.H.C. Gropp, Penetang. You are especially requested to obtain a tender from him as he was the man who submitted the lowest tender to Mr. Joe Sandy when he was making inquiry.\n\nMr. White expects to arrive in Penetang on Wednesday evening and will be staying at the Canada House until he can make arrangements to get to Moose Point to complete a survey partly done a short time ago.\n\nIt is intended that he, in conjunction with yourself, will arrange to have the material for this school shipped. Kindly meet him and give him all the assistance in your power.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nC.J.

Mr. Sullivan, from his letter dated June 1st, 1922, I told Sullivan last summer to get the measurements of the painting required and that Mr. Gordon would figure how much paint was needed but he did not get it last summer. This spring he was down and got the paint which account I include he presumably covering the cost of painting of the school and house. Regarding the fence we could do the same if the teacher will state how many rods of fencing he wants I could order the fence and he could get it when he goes to town. I have not seen the Moose Point school for about three years because I am not authorized by the Dept. to do so.\n\nYour humble servant\n\nC.P. Beville\nIndian Agent\nChristian Island\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, June 1, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, enclosing an account for the paint, etc. supplied for the use of the Moose Deer Point Indian Day School. In reply I beg to say this account has been paid.\n\nRegarding the fencing, you should communicate with the teacher and ascertain the quantity of wire that would be required and you could arrange for the purchasing of the same. It will be necessary to obtain competitive prices, if possible, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Please submit properly certified vouchers in duplicate covering the expense incurred. Besides the wire, it may be necessary to supply one large and one small gate. If needed, you may arrange for their purchase when the wire is being procured.\n\nWe understand that the Indians have hauled out the necessary posts. If the wire is furnished, the teacher and the Indians should perform the labour of erecting the fence, without cost to the Department. Only a small plot of ground around the school should be fenced, as it is not intended to incur a large expenditure for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. J. Picotte, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChristian Island,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of June 1st regarding the fencing at Moore Point school as there are only a few days more for the summer holidays and the teacher will probably be coming down I may arrange to see him. If the teacher's house is built where I think it should be, he may want to have his residence enclosed with the school lot, and that would make more fencing.\n\nRegarding competitive prices, I may say that only one man in town keeps wire on hand but two hardware men supply it on order and it sometimes delays so much that it is too late to use. I doubt if the Indians have handled out the dust unless they are sure of getting the wire.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nC.J. Neville\nIndian Agent\nChristian Island\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of June 1st, last, and your reply thereto of the 16th of the same month, regarding this matter. The Department cannot understand why you have not purchased and had delivered at the school the quantity of wire required. The teacher and Indians would have performed the labour of erecting the fence, but they have been waiting for the wire. Kindly ascertain from the teacher the number of rods required, and purchase the fencing as soon as possible, and have it sent to the school, in order that the fencing can be completed before the extreme cold weather sets in.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will ascertain whether the teacher used the paint which was supplied in May, last. If not, you should report what he did with it, and you should instruct him to have the work done at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. J.

I don't know if the house bought for him has been erected, I have been living all summer on the Reserve but I sent word to the teacher that if he gave Mr. Sanderson of Pembury the dimension of the rooms he would supply him with the necessary paint but he never came for it, the only way to get supplies there is for the Indians to come for it themselves, and I think if they don't come they are not in very great need of the supplies.

Your remark that the teacher never came for the paint is not understood. In our letter of the 2nd instant you were asked to ascertain from the teacher whether he used this paint or not. You should do this at once, and inform the Department as to whether the paint supplied in May, last, was used for the purpose of painting the teacher's house or not.\n\nYou should also state whether you have taken any action in the purchase and delivery of the wire required for fencing. It is too late this season to forward the fence wire, if you have not already done so.

Since this school was opened a few years' ago all matters requiring attention in connection therewith have been under the charge of Mr. C. J. Picotte, Indian Agent, Christian Island.\n\nIt would appear from the map of the locality that this school is nearer Parry Sound than Christian Island, and I shall be pleased if you will state whether you could arrange to visit this school, say, twice each year and report regarding the condition of the buildings, the work being performed in the school and any other requirements. Please state the distance from Parry Sound to this school, and also the probable cost involved in making the trip, and whether it would be convenient for you to visit that point this present fall and enquire into school matters and conditions there.\n\nI shall be pleased to have an early reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6145, File 411-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nReplying to yours of Oct. 25, 6-23, I beg to state that I went to Moose Deer Point, the following morning, and found out the following:\n\nThe distance between Parry Sound and Moose Deer Point is about 35 miles by gasoline launch. There is a winter trail 16 miles from Barnsdale station on C.F.R., to Moose Deer Point.\n\nThe distance between Christian Island and Moose Deer Point is about 30 miles by Gasoline Launch. The distance from Penetang to Moose Deer Point is about 15 miles by gasoline launch, and about the same distance from Midland.\n\nThe cost of the trip from Parry Sound was:\nGasoline Launch $20.00, and meals $3.00, making $23.00 in all.\n\nThe school building is one and a half stories 30 X 18 with porch 10 X 10, built on ceder posts. The land is all sodd.\n\nThe building seems in good condition but very much in need of cleaning up\u2014that is to be painted. There is a cement foundation required 2 ft. high by 6 in. thick. The outside and inside are badly in need of paint.\n\nAt the end of the building inside, there has been a portion partitioned off for the school master, this should be pulled down and the whole space utilized for school purposes. There should be another light put in, 6 by 3. Ventilation seems good. The ceiling is about 11 ft. high.\n\nThere should be an addition put on back of building 10 by 18, which could be used for a wood shed and for other purposes.\n\nThe eaves and gable ends of the school have never been caised in, and to give the building a completed look, this should be done.\n\nThe shingles should be stained and a belfrey built, and a bell provided as the building is used for church, for Protestants and R.C. religious purposes, also community hall.\n\nThere are homemade desks and seats in the building, which should be replaced by modern school desks and seats.\n\nThe seats and desks required are as follows:\n\n| Grade       | Number |\n|-------------|--------|\n| 4th grade   | 1      |\n| 3rd         | 2      |\n| 2nd         | 4      |\n| Sr. Ist.    | 1      |\n| Jr. Ist.    | 2      |\n| Primer      | 10     |\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6145, File 411-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI think it is too late in the season to put in a foundation, but the other repairs could be gone on right away. The school-master tells me that he can carry on in his house while the alteration would be going on inside.\n\nThe supplies such as lumber, nails, cement, paint, tarpaper, windows, and so forth, can be procured at Midland, Penetang or Parry Sound.\n\nI can get a man, an Indian of Parry Island qualified to superintend the work, and who would do all that is required and pay the men employed for $400.00, all materials to be supplied by the Department. This, I think is the better way of getting work done, as the Indian, when put on time without somebody being responsible, I have found that he is careless of his time and not too attentive to his work. The labour could be procured at Moose Deer Point, so that all wages would be spent among the Indians.\n\nThe teacher's house which is a log one should be chinked and plastered, also the eves and gable boxed in, and the shingles stained, also the gable ends painted and the logs part lime-washed.\n\nThere is a fence required for the school grounds as cattle and horses stampeded through the grounds, when the children are at play and are a source of danger to the children.\n\nThe grounds are about one and a quarter acres in extent. The land will provide the fence posts, if the Department will provide the fencing and staples.\n\nThis school is situated in a nice bay and is the source of attraction for tourists in that vicinity, so much so that some of the summer residents provide prizes for the pupils.\n\nShould the Department want to add this school to my agency, I will do all that is in my power to see that it gets the attention that it requires.\n\nI would recommend that a school inspector be asked to visit this school at least once a year, either from Muskega or Parry Sound District.\n\nTrusting that this will meet with the requirements of the Department,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, Nov. 10th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has decided to transfer the charge of the Moose Deer Point Indian Day School from your Agency to that of the Parry Sound Agency. This change will date from the 1st instant. It will not, therefore, be necessary for you to attend to any matters concerning this school in future. It is considered that oversight of the school can be better attended to from Parry Sound than from Christian Island. Besides, the school is located within the boundaries of the Parry Sound Agency.\n\nThere is one point, however, on which the Department desires definite information, and you will be good enough to reply to our letter of the 24th ultimo, and state definitely what disposition was made of the paint purchased from M. A. Gendron, Penetanguishene, in May, last, an account for which was paid to the amount of $57.45. Please state whether this paint was delivered to the teacher, or whether it is still at Penetanguishene. The Department will expect an early reply giving full information regarding the disposition made of the paint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. J. Picotte, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChristian Island,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of Nov 15th I may say that I have seen Mr. Lendmore and he tells me that the teacher at Moose Point got his point for the residence and the account was sent after the point was delivered. But the teacher applied to get more point and wire for the school, and that was the material that I said he never came for consequently it was never purchased, but he got the point for the house, and he must have used it.\n\nYour humble servant\n\nC.J.

The Department considers that more satisfactory results would be obtained if you assumed the responsibility of the oversight of this school, and it has, therefore, been decided to add this work to the duties of your agency. We are informing Mr. Agent Picotte, at Christian Island, that he will be relieved of this duty in future.\n\nYou should draw the attention of the Department to the repairs and alterations required, at a time, next spring, when you will be in a position to attend to the purchase of the material required and have the work done. It is considered that the school can carry on this winter without any expenditure being put on the building.\n\nThe Department will take up the question of having a public school inspector visit this school next spring.\n\nI have to thank you for the promptness and attention which you gave to our communication of the 25th ultimo, and for your report concerning the conditions and requirements at the school, and the distance between the different points mentioned by you.\n\nYou should forward a properly certified voucher covering the cost of the trip from Parry Sound to the school. A receipt for the payment made for the services of the gasoline launch should be attached to your voucher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nJ. D.

I am getting everything in line to follow out instructions given to me last fall.\n\nShould the Department arrange to have this school started, I am in a position to furnish a good teacher and, in that case this boy could be looked after. I will be able in about two weeks time to furnish all particulars of this boy.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if the Dept. would say if arrangements are being made in the estimates for the improvements to Moose Deer Point School and for purchasing a building and fixing it up at Maganetawin or Byng Inlet for a school.\n\nPlease reply at your earliest as owing to checking up of log stovewood cut I am busy but anxious to look after the school part of this agency.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) John M. Daly,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 11th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the last instant, regarding the repairs, painting, addition, etc., required to the Moose Deer Point Indian Bay School building, I beg to say it is regretted that we were unable to provide in our Estimates for the next fiscal year an amount sufficient to carry out these improvements, and they will therefore have to stand over for another year.\n\nRegarding the fencing, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the quantity of woven wire fencing and staples required, and have the fence erected. It will be necessary for you to obtain competitive prices, if possible, and you should purchase the wire and staples from the firm quoting the lowest price. If any gates are required, competitive prices should also be obtained before the purchase is made. You should first ascertain the quantity of fencing required, and also whether the Indians will provide the posts and any labour. As soon as you have this information, you may arrange to purchase and forward the wire. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred, to which should be attached a memo showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nI may say that last summer a quantity of paint was supplied the teacher for the purpose of painting the teacher's residence. You might enquire as to whether he used the paint for this purpose or not.\n\nIn your letter of October 29th, last, regarding the improvements required, you stated that new desks were needed. If you still consider that these are absolutely required, you should furnish full shipping directions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\n\nJ. D.

The three gates and one roll of wire, he delivered at the school's grounds. He informs me that when the weather moderates he will try and fish the fencing out. He has marked the spot and expects to salvage it. His charge for the trip was to be fifteen dollars ($15.00). Shall I allow him anything for his time in salvaging the lost fencing? The weather was rough when the boat capsized.\n\nAwaiting a reply.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJune 12th, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant reporting that when Harry Meduayosh, an Indian of Parry Island, was conveying wire fencing by water to the Moose Deer Point School grounds, the boat capsized and the wire fell into the water, and in reply I may say that it would appear from your letter that the accident was the result of rough weather. If such was the case, and if the Indian was not careless in handling the boat, the Department is prepared to consider the question of allowing him payment to a reasonable amount for salvaging the lost fencing. It is observed you have stated that his original charge for transporting the fencing was $15.00.\n\nA voucher in his favour may be submitted for payment. It should be made out for the amount which you consider he is entitled to receive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D. McLean)\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn M.

I note that you have secured prices. Please submit to the Department for consideration prices from at least two local firms on the 20 desks that are required. If the lowest quotation is satisfactory, the Department will consider allowing local purchase.\n\nYou may purchase, after securing competitive prices, the lumber, nails, lime, cement, paint, stain and floor oil, listed in your letter. When you are submitting properly certified accounts, in duplicate, attach thereto a memorandum showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted. One item - that of 150 bags of cement - seems large for repairs to the foundation. Before making purchase of all of this cement, you should satisfy yourself that it is required, as no expense which is not absolutely necessary should be undertaken.\n\nI note that all labour will be done by the Band, without cost to the Department, and that you can make reasonable arrangements for the freighting of the equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

This school is used as a Church and Community Hall. It needs painting badly both inside and out. The box stove at present in use is cracked and worn out. A new one should be installed. Three new window blinds are required. A teacher's desk is needed. There is a table in use at present; it is unsuitable. Three window lights are broken. The closets are dirty and badly in need of repair. Both closets are under one roof. The building needs to be sheeted outside and a new roof put on. The boys' section requires a new door and urinal. Both closets should be thoroughly cleaned out and scrubbed. This school, at present, is in charge of Bert Sutherland, with no academic qualifications. I understand a new teacher is being appointed at the end of this year. There are 16 children of school age in this section, only 5 on the roll.\n\nThos. McGookin.\nInspector.\nOttawa, September 30, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McCoockin, in a report on his inspection of the Moose Deer Point Indian Day School, states that the box stove at present in use is worn out and recommends that a new one be installed. He also states that three new window blinds are required and that a teacher's desk is needed; also that three window lights are broken and that the closets are dirty and badly in need of repair.\n\nYou should arrange for the purchase and delivery at an early date of a stove of the type considered by you to be satisfactory to heat this building. If any stove pipe is required, you may also supply same. You may arrange for the purchase and installation of three window blinds of the sizes required, and for the supplying and installing of the three window lights. Relative to the teacher's desk, you may purchase and forward a desk of an inexpensive type.\n\nYou should arrange to have the closets thoroughly cleaned and placed in a good, sanitary condition. The Inspector states that both closets are under one roof and that this building needs to be sheeted outside and a new roof put on. The boys' section requires a new door and urinal. You should arrange to have the repairs required made to the closets.\n\nThe purchase of the above supplies, and repairs to the closets, should be carried out as cheaply as possible, and accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the school building requires to be painted, both inside and outside. It is thought that this work might stand over until next Spring, but if you consider that it should be done this Fall, I shall be pleased to have an estimate of the cost of the material and labour required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I tried to go to Moose Point, but the boat livery people refused to take me. It wasn't Mrs. Gingras fault, that the weather was so boisterous, neither was it mine, and as I had instructions from the Department to look after Mrs. Gingras, and as I considered it my duty as an official of the Department to do so, therefore I think it is reasonable that the Department should defray the expenses, which were kept at the lowest possible figure.\n\nIt has been customary since I came here to look after the little children going to the schools, and I have kept them in the house with me here, but I do not think it is reasonable to expect that I should accommodate the teachers in my house. I would therefore return the bill and ask the Department to reconsider their decision in this case, as I told Mrs. Gingras when we were held up by the storm that the Department would look after the bill. I told her this because I thought it was the only reasonable thing to do. If the Department think I was wrong in making this statement, would they please say so, and I will see that the bill is paid, as I think it the only gentlemanly thing to do.\n\nMrs. Gingras was prepared to go on the 5th to Moose Deer Point. We could not make arrangements for her to go\nbecause of the storm, we went on the 7th.\n\nI cannot see why the Department should not pay this bill.\n\nTrusting this explanation will be satisfactory, and that a cheque will be sent forward to Mr. Gilchrist to pay this bill.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn M.

G.

If you consider it more advantageous, you may arrange for the purchase of the paint, etc., from a firm on the list to receive consideration and engage the men to do the work. It is noted that the lowest quotation you received was that of C. L. Falstrem, for the painting of the school buildings and toilets, for $195. In this connection I would refer you to the estimate of $110, which you submitted in your letter of May 19th, last, for the painting at this school.\n\nIf you consider Mr. Falstrem's quotation to be reasonable, you may arrange with him to perform the work - he to supply all material and labour. However, if you believe it would be cheaper for you to purchase the materials and arrange for the labour, you may do so. You should see that all costs are kept as low as possible. It is understood that the buildings are to receive two coats of a good grade of paint, outside and inside.\n\nAfter the work has been completed to your satisfaction, please forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands, to make the best arrangements you can to have the work carried out at the lowest possible cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Neary, I had advised him that the new Township school on Twelve Mile Bay, close to the Moose Deer Point Reserve, had been opened and a teacher installed shortly after the first of the current month and that I had notified Lena Williams, who has been carrying on to the best of her ability the teaching of the younger children on the Reserve, that she should now close up her school and let all the Moose Deer Point people of school age attend public school.\n\nI find that there has arisen some objection to this amongst the Indians and have had some correspondence with Mr. Wallace Rankin Nesbitt of Toronto on the subject. Mr. Nesbitt has a summer place close to the Moose Deer Point Reserve and has always been very much interested in the welfare of the Indians there. His father took a leading part in having the Reserve established some 30-odd years ago and Mr. Nesbitt himself has been prominent for the last few years in an endeavour to have the Department provide these people with educational facilities. I am enclosing a copy of a letter which I have received from him on the matter of the children attending the new school.\n\nWe have for several years canvassed all the possibilities at this point and finally decided that the establishment of a public school there would solve our problems and since this has now been done, I cannot see any reason for making any other arrangements. A number of the Indian children live on the side of the Reserve which borders Twelve Mile Bay and are within very reasonable distance from the school. It is a fact that most of\nthe younger children live on the other side of the Reserve but not at a distance very much more than one mile from the school and in such an isolated community, I do not think that this should be any disadvantage.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Superintendent.\nSamuel Devlin, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Devlin:\n\nI have yours of January 10th and quite appreciate that Lena Williams is not qualified to do any teaching beyond the very elementary and kindergarten grades, also that the Department would prefer to have the children start in the new school at Twelve Mile, but the old school house at the village is still in my opinion sufficiently serviceable to handle the very young children, and it is immediately adjacent to their living quarters, as against the new school being well over a mile which means a long hike for the babies.\n\nWould it not be possible for you to continue the smaller ones under Lena at the old school house and advise the more senior ones which she is not capable of dealing with and to whom the long walk through the woods is not as arduous to the new school. I think that if you adopt this you will find no difficulty with the Indian objections that are there at the moment. The small cost to the Department to continue the babies in the old school under Lena would I think be negligible alongside the satisfaction that the Indian population there would obtain. If you require any backing in Ottawa for this suggestion I of course would be only too delighted to do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. R. Nesbitt.\nJanuary 17, 1950.\n\nMr. S. Devlin,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nMoose Deer Point Day School\n\nReference your 25-1-411 Of Jan. 12\n\nAs you are aware, our decision not to operate the Moose Deer Point Day School but to have the children attend the provincial school was in accordance with the recommendation of the Parliamentary Committee that Indian children be educated in association with other children.\n\nI do not believe Miss Williams has been teaching more than 5 or 6 children at the most. It would hardly be fair to expect the Department to continue paying for her services when she will possibly have only 2 or 3 children.\n\nI note that the greatest distance which would have to be walked by these children is a little over a mile. There are today many other Indian and White children of similar age walking this distance or farther daily to school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/MMcN\nCol. B. F. Neery,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs Branch,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAn inspection of the Moose Deer Point Indian reserves was recently made and during the course of my visit I walked through from the Twelvemile Bay Indian settlement to the new Twelvemile Bay School. It is a good half-hour walk through the bush to the school from this point and I presume for small children it would take them proportionately longer. The trail is in fair condition in some places but at several points is wet and swampy and needs brushing out. The time and distance from King's Bay or Weh-Wah-Teysee settlement is longer but the trail is in fair condition.\n\nAt the time of my visit, there were five Indian children and three white children in attendance and two more Indian children will begin school September 25th, when their parents' work at a nearby Lodge is completed for the season. At the present time, the residents of King's Bay are employed in the fruit areas but on their return, I hope to be able to persuade them to have their children attend as well, of which there are at least five of school age.\n\nIn an effort to promote and maintain a good attendance, as well as assist the younger children, would it be possible to obtain authority to purchase cocoa, milk, sugar and possibly soup to provide a hot beverage at noon for them during the winter months. As there is no way of getting these supplies in at minimum cost during the winter, it would be necessary to make the purchase of sufficient supplies for say five months, sometime during the latter part of October.\n\nIn addition, I believe, for an expenditure of approximately\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6145, File 411-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n$50.00 arrangements could be made with two or three of the older men to brush out the trails and fill in the swampy sections. This, of course, would fulfill the dual purpose of helping the progress of the small children and also provide a small amount of employment for a few of the Band who have little means of obtaining a livelihood and would assist in providing them with a \"grub stake\" this fall. The latter suggestion is more of a welfare project than an educational one.\n\nSchool Inspector, Mr. Roy C. Cassie, was rather hesitant this fall about making any arrangement to place a teacher at this school, due to the fact that there are only about four white children in the neighborhood this year to attend. However, at my request, and on the promise I would endeavour to have at least seven Indian children attend, he has very kindly placed a young married woman, Mrs. Conah Crawford, and resident of that area, in charge of the school. While not a certified teacher, she is apparently qualified to some extent to teach and appears to be doing good work.\n\nMay I please have your comments and recommendations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWard L.

Ont.\n\nI have about 8 more children starting to school and therefore we have to enlarge our class-room. We have to use the teacher's living room to enlarge the classroom. Therefore the teacher will have no stopping place. There is no place for clergymen or inspectors to stop. The chief would like to know if you would build a small cottage with about 4 rooms. I spoke about getting out timber but they have it. All of that is the licencees. We are putting a stone foundation under the school this summer. We have no material for repairs at all. In the first place there was not enough to finish the school.\n\nBert Sullivan,\n\nTeacher.\nOttawa, April 29, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Bert Sullivan, teacher of the Moose Deer Point Indian Day School, in his annual report for the fiscal year ended March 31st, last, states that it is necessary to enlarge the class-room, as there are a further number of children who will attend in the near future. He states that it is necessary to use the teacher's living room to enlarge the school-room. The Department understands from his report that the Indians would do the work of enlarging the school, if they were supplied with the necessary material, and the teacher would like to have a small four roomed cottage built to provide living quarters for himself. He also states that they intend to put a stone foundation under the school this summer.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to furnish a report setting forth your views as to what you consider would be required to be done to the present building to provide class-room accommodation for all the Indian children who would attend, and also to provide suitable living quarters for the teacher. As the timber on this reserve is under license, you should state where the necessary material required for the above purpose could be obtained and also state the approximate cost of supplying the quantity of lumber and other material required.\n\nGood results are being accomplished at this school and the Department is anxious to assist in any way that it can to provide educational facilities for the Indian children.\n\nYou will be good enough to look into this matter thoroughly and report at an early date, giving full particulars as requested. It is presumed that any labour required would be performed by the Indians, if the Department supplies the necessary material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

You were asked to furnish a report as to the work required to enlarge the present school building to provide the class-room accommodation and also to provide living quarters for the teacher.\n\nThe Department is anxious to have a full report concerning this matter, in order that, if it is decided to go on with this work, it can be completed this summer. You should give full particulars regarding the material required and approximate cost of the work. The Department will expect an early reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.J. Picotte, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChristian Island, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter dated June 16th regarding the enlarging of school at River Point I may say that I visited the school on July 1st and found that the class room is certainly too small. The whole building is 14' x 22' outside, and the teacher's room or kitchen takes 12' x 16', leaving only about 20 feet of class room. There are two rows of double seats, four in all, with the teacher's desk, and a stove; the maps and blackboard are on the walls over the seats and very difficult to get at.\n\nThe upper part of the building is not finished and cannot very well be used by the teacher, and I presume he should have some kind of residence independent of the school. The teacher told me the Indians are willing to put up a suitable log house of about 18' x 24' which would provide for a kitchen and his small room and would be large enough for a married man if needed. The upper part would not need to be finished, just put a good floor, and the inside well painted on the logs could be finished with fibre board and a step on the joint; the Indians are willing to do the work if the materials are...\nSir,\n\nRegarding the material required and the approximate cost this will give you an idea of how the main part is built. I have the following:\n\n- Shingles 2x4 for roof: 50 sq ft at $4.00\n- Shingles for floor: $11.00\n- Flooring matched: $11.00\n- 2nd \" Ground floor maple: $87.50\n\nThe floor upstairs would be good enough if that part of the house were to be finished in future, and the ground floor must be double to make the building comfortable.\n\nThere are enough shingles left from the school to use on the floor.\n\nIt would also require about 7 square of shingles at $5.00. I believe these are the prices of material around here.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nC.J. Heath\nIndian Agent\nChristian Island\n\nJ.D.

When this is done the part of the school that is now used as a teacher's room, or kitchen, can be taken into the present class-room, which should then be of sufficient size to provide accommodation for the Indian children.\n\nIt is understood that the Indians will get out the logs and do the necessary work in erecting the house, and I have to request that you will ascertain the exact quantities of the other building material required, such as scantling, sheathing, flooring, shingles, window frames, doors, etc., and obtain prices from a number of dealers in Penetanguishene for which they will supply the material required. The dimensions of the house as given by you, namely, eighteen by twenty-four feet, are considered to be a suitable size for the purpose. You should estimate for sufficient material to finish the upper part of the house. You should give this matter your prompt attention and ascertain the quantity of material required and obtain the prices for which the same will be delivered to Moose Deer Point and submit these prices to the Department as soon as possible. It would be well for you to furnish a sketch plan of the proposed house.\n\nAs soon as the above information is received the Department will be in a position to consider the ordering of the material and the carrying on of the work.\n\nC.

You should obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers handling these supplies, which prices should include delivery of the material at Moose Deer Point, and you should purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. The Indians should be instructed to proceed with the erection of the log walls of the building of the dimensions mentioned by you, namely 18 by 24 feet. You should see that the logs are laid in a substantial manner, with provision for windows and doors. As soon as the above material arrives the balance of the work should be proceeded with, in order that it can be completed and the building finished as soon as possible. You should oversee this work from time to time and see that it is being properly performed.\n\nWhen the material is purchased and delivered you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, to which you should attach the prices received by you with the names of the various dealers whom you asked for a quotation.\n\nThe Department will expect you to see that the Indians hurry on the work and that there is no delay in having the building completed. It is not considered necessary to forward a plan of the building. The building inside should be suitably partitioned off to provide quarters for bedrooms, dining room, kitchen, etc.\n\nYou should also arrange for the removal of the partition between the kitchen and the class-room in the school building, in order that the class-room can be enlarged by the part now used as the kitchen to provide sufficient accommodation for the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nCJ J. Picotte, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChristian Island, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI met the teacher of Moore Point school on the 27th and he said the Indians are unable to secure the logs & build the teacher's house. The pine and lumber belongs to the Bayley Company and it not to be cut.\n\nArchie King who lives here has a house at Moore Point Rd. which he took down to move to Christian Island. It is the house used for a school before the present school was built; it is on the site where the teacher's house is to be, and he wants $100 Dollars for the logs and the rough lumber, and I think this would be cheaper than frame to make a warm house.

You should prepare and forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the expenditure in the purchase of the logs from Archie King, when, if satisfactory, a cheque for the amount due will be sent.\n\nThe Department is anxious to have this building erected before the cold weather commences and you should see that the Indians start the work in putting up the log walls promptly and as soon as the amount of the other material required is received from you, instructions will be given regarding their purchase.\n\nIt is hoped that there will be no further or unnecessary delay in having the work of erecting the building.\n\nC.

In the same year a school was established, and in 1918 the Department supplied materials and the Indians erected a new building. The teacher at that time was an Indian girl who lived at home. Last year a teacher named Mr. Sullivan was appointed, and he has been residing in a portion of the school-room which was partitioned off for teacher's quarters. This space is now required for the accommodation of the children, and it is proposed to erect a small residence near the school for the teacher. The Indians will do the work and the Department has obtained prices for materials which will enter into the construction amounting to $588.\n\nI would ask your approval of this expenditure.

You should arrange for the purchase and delivery of the quantities of lumber, flooring and other material as mentioned in the list of the same quoted on by Mr. Tessier, in order that it can be delivered in time for the Indians to complete the work, when the log walls have been laid.\n\nIt is hoped that there will be no delay in having the work of erecting this building completed and that it will be ready for occupation by the teacher before the cold weather sets in.\n\nYou will be good enough to forward properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material and delivery of the same from Mr. Tessier to the above amount.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nfor Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nC.

I got an Indian and walked through the bush to Mr. Martin and saw the teacher and gave him orders to start the work which he said he would and the logs being ready it won't take long to erect the Wall. I told him the rest of the material would be sent in as soon as they start work.\n\nAs I wanted to meet the Head man, on the 20th I went to Padenae to see him, but he was away guiding and I could not meet him, and I came back. The teacher is to let me know as soon as the work starts; he is interested and the Indians are willing to do the work.

In the same year a school was established, and in 1918 the Department supplied materials and the Indians erected a new building. The teacher at that time was an Indian girl who lived at home. Last year a teacher named Mr. Sullivan was appointed, and he has been residing in a portion of the school-room which was partitioned off for teacher's quarters. This space is now required for the accommodation of the children, and it is proposed to erect a small residence near the school for the teacher.

I have made arrangements, as stated before for Mrs. Gingras to board with the Martin family, who are the caretakers of the Honourable Wallace Nesbitt's place.\n\nWhen going through the teacher's house at Moose Point, Mrs. Gingras let me know that she would prefer to have her own place. I took a rough estimate of what would be required to make this house habitable. I have to state that this is a log building and has been allowed to go into disrepair. It has been painted with green paint in the inside and beaverboard has been used to line the walls, but owing to the house not being in use, this beaver board has buckled up and would have to be torn off. There would have to be a stairway put in and the inside of the place altered.\n\nEnclosed is an estimate of the material that would be required to put this place in first class shape. There would have to be a foundation put in which I estimate would take about 25 bags of cement. There is lots of sand right there. By putting in this foundation the Department would be justified in the expenditure for the repairs.\n\nI think it would be wise to have this house fixed up as soon as possible so that the teacher may get settled down to her business. As near as I can estimate it, it would cost $328.10 to fix up the teacher's house and I would like to state that when this place is fixed up, it will be good for ten or fifteen years, perhaps longer.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We understand that suitable boarding accommodation can be obtained for a single teacher. Should Mrs. Gingras terminate her services and another teacher be engaged, it may be doubtful if a new teacher would care to do her own housekeeping rather than board.

His idea is to wreck this old building and salvage whatever material possible for use in building a house, which he intends to erect for himself on the Reserve. He has made me an offer of $40.00 for the building and will be prepared, in the event of his offer being accepted, to pay cash.\n\nThe building referred to is a log house of two stories and is in a very tumble-down condition. It has not been in use, I believe, for seven or eight years, as the former teacher had not resided in it, but had made her home with a nearby white family who are caretakers of a summer place in the neighborhood. In looking this building over last year, I had come to the conclusion that should a school ever be reestablished on the Reserve, it would be more practicable to build a new residence for the teacher, rather than attempt to repair the old building.\n\nWith regard to the offer of $40.00, I do not think that the material it might be possible to salvage for rebuilding would be worth any more than this sum.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 10, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI attach, for your information, a copy of a letter received from Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ont.

I note that you now suggest the appointment of a Mrs. Jeffries to act as teacher for the balance of the current academic year.

In regard to the item above mentioned, I think I can do no better than quote from the letter received from the audit firm this morning:\n\n\"While you were absent in Saskatoon, I was inquiring from Mr. Forward about the receipt of the Dominion Government Grant for the Indian day school at Moose Factory. It is necessary to obtain the amount of this grant in order to prepare our financial statement for the Moose Factory day school in connection with the Province of Ontario Grant to the school.\n\nMr. Forward inquired from the Treasury Department of the Indian Affairs branch and they informed him that for the year 1946 a grant of $620.00 was paid in connection with the grant to the day school. Mr. Forward was not able to trace the receipt of this money at the Ottawa office, and we could find no trace of receipt of it at M.S.C.C., Toronto. Mr. Forward wrote to me that the Treasury Department had informed him the cheques were made payable in each case to the school teacher concerned at Moose Factory, and sent to Bishop Renison for distribution, and he has requested the Department to endeavour to lock up the cheques and see who endorsed them and where they may have been deposited. It is possible that the cheques were either cashed at Moose Factory and used locally on behalf of the school affairs or that they were turned over to Bishop Renison for use in the finances of the Diocese of Moosonee.\n\nIn any case, if Mr. Forward has not informed you of the situation, could you make further inquiries from the Indian Affairs branch, so that if possible there will be some definite information of this matter when I arrive in Ottawa next week.\"\n\nI would appreciate very much if you could give me by Monday the information which the auditors desire.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. R. Turner,\nfor Superintendent.\nOttawa, October 7, 1947.\n\nGovernment Grant -\nMoose Factory Indian Day School\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nAs requested in your letter of October 1, we have traced down the last cheque cashed by the teacher of this school.\n\nAs you are aware, we make a grant of $63.00 a teaching month to Miss Louise F. Hooper of the Moose Factory Residential School staff, to conduct a day school for those children living near the residential school.\n\nFor the quarter ending March 31 this cheque amounted to $189.00 and was drawn in favour of the teacher and sent to the Right Reverend R. J. Remison, Bishop of Moosonee. This cheque was No. G 194/17 and was dated April 25, 1947. It was cashed at the Canadian Bank of Commerce in Ottawa on June 17, 1947. It was endorsed by Miss Hooper and bore the stamp of your Indian School Administration below her name.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor General G. R.

This cheque was cashed at the Imperial Bank of Canada, Timmins, Ontario, on April 26th, 1947. It is endorsed by Miss Louise F. Hooper and carries a rubber stamp reading \"Diocese of Moosonee\" endorsed by R.S. Cushing.\n\nYou will note that this cheque covered the September and December quarters of 1946. No return and no payment was made for the June quarter 1946.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMaj.-Gen. G.R.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nGovernment Grant\nMoose Factory Indian Day School\n\nI regret very much the need for troubling you again on the above subject.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of 15th October, I sent a copy to the Auditors in Toronto hoping that it would give them the information they want but I have now received a reply from which the following are extracts:\n\n\"The information from Colonel Neary concerning the cheque for $252.00 appears to cover the last two quarters of 1946, although the phrasing \"for the period September 30th to December 31st, 1946\" might cast some doubt as to whether one or two quarters are involved. It would be of interest to know why no Return and therefore no payment was made for the June quarter 1946 as I believe some grant should be expected for that quarter. Also, there is no mention of what grant was paid for the first quarter of 1946 to complete our information for the calendar year of 1946.\n\n\"Mr. Forward wrote us on August 23rd of this year that he had learned that the grant for 1946 was $620.00 but I have no information as to how this amount was made up and it does not seem to tie in with the information we have recently received from Colonel Neary's office.\n\n\"As the grant for 1946 must be shown on the Return to the Province of Ontario which we are at present...\"\npreparing, I am anxious to confirm whether this amount of $620.00 is the correct grant for 1946.\n\n\"If you can make further inquiries from Colonel Neary's office, I will be most obliged because this Provincial Return should be made as soon as possible in order that the Administration can obtain the proper grant for 1947.\n\n\"The situation created by this grant of course only makes more clear the necessity for your office to have a detailed list of what grants are to be expected from Indian Affairs and Provinces in order that the proper amount of grants are received at the Ottawa office.\"\n\nIf, therefore, you can let me have some information that will finally satisfy the Auditors, I shall be obliged.\n\nReferring to the last paragraph of the quotation from the Auditors' letter, I am only too aware of the difficulties caused by lack of information in this office on the normal grants that you make us during the course of a year. I am endeavouring to compile a list but it is a slow business and I have no guarantee whether it is complete when it is compiled. If you could let me have, at your convenience, a list of such grants with their amounts, it would be of very great help.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\n\nGRT/BF\nOttawa, October 30, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nRe: Moose Fort Indian Day School\n\nWe have your letter of the 22nd inst., with reference to payment of salary of the teacher at the above mentioned school.\n\nIt is regretted that official letter of October 15th, 1947 read \"September 30th to December 31st, 1946\". This should have read \"September 1st to December 31st, 1946\", or in other words, it covered the amount we allowed towards the teacher's salary for the September and December quarters. Monthly payment of the teacher of this school was $63.00 or $630.00 a year.\n\nIn official letter of October 7th we advised you of the payment of $189.00 for the quarter ended March 31st, 1946. This amount plus the payment for the September and December quarters made a total payment for the calendar year 1946 of $441.00.\n\nWe did not make any payment for the June quarter 1946. The return for the quarter ended March 31st, 1946 was signed by Miss Alice Davies. September and December quarterly returns were signed by Miss Louise F. Hooper.\n\nWe reviewed our files and find that we received a return for the quarter ended June 30th, 1946 but it was signed by the Rev. Henry J. Cook. We do not appear to have been advised of\nhis appointment as teacher of the day school and consequently no payment was made at that time.\n\nWe will arrange to have a cheque for $189.00 in payment of the June quarter 1946 forwarded to your office. When this is received it will mean that the total payment of $630.00 for the year 1946 will have been made.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMaj.-Gen. G.R.

Sorry to say that he is still very ill, and we have cabled for his release.\n\nAs you will see, I have corrected the accts. as made out by Mr. Oxley, and am sorry to find that they are especially the provision acct.\u2014double the sum he made out. In his anxiety to make the accts. appear reasonable, he has left out the amt. on the addenda. You will also see that I have changed the accts. for buildings by making out the list of material for school, which includes all the lumber, windows, doors, &c., stated in the first acct. The \"additional buildings acquired\" too, I have withdrawn, being the large store & woodshed in connection with the School, which are not new\u2014these placed entirely at the disposal of the School. I can assure you that after thoroughly overhauling the Hudson's Bay accts. I am more than ever perplexed as to how they managed to spend the sum they have, and still more indignant with the Hudson's Bay Co. for advancing, without my authority, to this amount. I distinctly told Mr. Oxley and Miss Johnson that not more than 12 to 14 children were to be taken in, and that the expenses were to be kept down. From Miss-Anable in Aug. last I sent them down a $50.00 outfit of provisions, which is not included in the provision acct. enclosed.\n\nAltogether\nAltogether the expenses of Moose Fort School will not be covered by $2000, apart from the school grant of $500. There are many details in the H. B. C. acct. which I have not included, and besides these there are many other items such as servants' wages, firewood, planting, hay, etc. The expenditure was simply reckless. If I am privileged to get down to Ottawa this Winter I will bring the H. B. C. a/c with me and I think you will, like myself, be disgusted with them for allowing accts. to run up to such figures. Their only excuse, when I remonstrated with them was that they were under the impression the Indian Dept. were supporting the school, but even supposing they were, they had no right to presume upon that.\n\nFrom an educational standpoint very good work was done, but the cost was cruel.\n\nAfter deducting the grant kindly made by the Dept. of $1500. for equipment the Diocese will be responsible for over $1000. including the extra items mentioned above, but for this the H. B. C. will have to wait.\n\nHad I done in Athabasca what Mr. Holland and Oxley did at Moose I should have been made responsible for every cent I had spent over the sum allowed.\n\nThe only fault I found with Mr. Oxley's work was the outrageous expenditure.- As you will see from the details of the accts., nothing was spared. And I was assured that the two Indian girls they had in the kitchen were carrying off provisions and other things wholesale. In no other way could they have used all the flour and sugar but especially 113 gall. of coal oil.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nGeo. Moosonee.\nTo the Deputy Minister\nfor Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report that the new day school has been begun and will I hope be finished early in July. It will be a solid log building lined inside and outside with dressed lumber.\n\nThe size is 42x21 and I hope to have accommodation for eighty children at least - when the Indians arrive this summer the new building will be quite full.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd.

Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Ven. Archdeacon Renison B.D. has instructed me to furnish you with the cost of the new day-school here, which is herewith enclosed.\n\nThis new day-school is just being finished and furnished so that it will be opened to receive pupils at the beginning of the New Year.\n\nThe new building is 42 ft. x 21 ft., and will accommodate 120 pupils. It is a very substantial building, being of solid logs, and lined both inside and outside.\n\nThe total cost of this day-school, as per enclosed memorandum, is the sum of $1364.61 and towards this expenditure the Depart. of Indian Affairs has already Made a Grant of $500.00.\n\nIn reference to said cost of building, I have considerable experience in such matters, and I think that the same building out at the LINE would cost at least $2000.00.\n\nThe Archdeacon wishes me to ask your Depart. of Indian Affairs for a supplemental Grant of $864.61 to meet this outlay.\n\nThere are over 100 pupils' names now on the school register and many more entries could be made if we had accommodation for them.\n\nI beg to inform you that the quarterly Report is herewith mailed you under separate cover.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRev.

Now this same man was convicted and sentenced for twenty-three months and served his time in the Central Prison Toronto and I would state too that he committed the horse theft while he had the advice to what he now apply for.\nWould the Indian Department allow such evil example under into their charge as would it, or such privilege extended to a criminal record tend to set a very bad example to our young generation and hence result in the snatching or training young ones who have no regard for laws of the land, as it is now the reverse are bad enough for loose execution of laws.

I wish to see Edmonton yet and so cannot send you the original bill perhaps Monday. The Agent too has a copy but my brother Albert has applied to him for his son Reuben whose only qualification is having passed the oral examination and taught on the Six Nation Reserve for about a year some four years ago. He it seems had his paper out over a week ago but I believe Isaac Hill is the only one who signed for I have\nhere all on the Reserve besides\nthe widows. A few are about\nat work but there are only twenty\nvoters on the whole Reserve.\n\nNo one refused but Albert\nfor Louis and Wash Jacobe.\nAlbert and John both have sons\nwho have passed entrance exams\nand Wash has promised to help\nNeil M. Evans daughter.\nIsaac Hill who signed Reuben's\npaper says he would not have\ndone so if I had let him know\nI wanted to teach.\nI really did not know\nso many would so gladly give\nme their names.\n\nGratefully Yours,\nWillie Nicholas\n\nP.S. Mr. McDonald has written to Ottawa for it\nbeing he wishes more control in appointing\nthe teacher.\nThe Hon. the Minister of the Interior,\nDepartment Indian Affairs.\n\nHere be:\n\n1. An appointment of Teacher for the Reserve School in the Moravian Reservation, Kent Co., has to be made, to fill the place of Mr. Wm. McFarland who leaves at end of this year.\n\n2. The enclosed correspondence from Mr. Tobias seems to indicate that every Indian on the Reserve (except the few who have candidates of their own) desires to have Mr. Tobias reappointed.\n\n3. Mr. Tobias while teacher in 1893 was convicted of horse stealing and served 13 months in Central Prison. This is the solitary objection to granting the unanimous wish of the Indians on the Reserve.\n\n4. In favor of granting their petition I beg to submit the following facts:\n\n   Mr. Tobias was convicted on purely circumstantial evidence and many thoughtful persons believe that he was not guilty, though he may have been mixed up in the matter. The Rev. Mr. Hartmann, resident minister and myself believe he is innocent.\n\n   His conduct from his boyhood until that time, his conduct during his confinement and his conduct...\nsince then both parent and child have been most exemplary.\n\nHe is an active church worker and a leader in the Christian Endeavour Society.\n\nIII. He received his training under Rev. W. Ashton at the Mohawk Institute and at Bradford Collegiate Institute graduation as a regularly qualified school teacher in the schools of Ontario, and he is an excellent disciplinarian and a skilful instructor. He is eminently better qualified for this particular school than any one else available as he is a native with reserve and humor every parent and every child and speaks their language, as well as being a good English scholar and an all-round clever fellow, as you can judge from his correspondence enclosed.\n\nIV. I think the school will do much better under Mr. Tobin than under any inexperienced white person; he was very successful when there before, and he secured a far better attendance.\n\nI am of the opinion that the crime charged against him 5 years ago, which I do not believe, and which evidently the Indians do not believe, I think it would be wrong to keep him down by still punishing him when he paid the penalty and been discharged, with very high credit for his conduct by the authorities.\nVI I believe that the appointment of teacher in an Indian school is made by the Indian Agent on the recommendation of the School Inspector and is ratified by the Indian Department. I shall, if you deem it advisable, recommend Mr. Tobias for the Moravian Reserve School for the ensuing year.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nHon. Sir, Your obedient servant,\n\nW.G. Coller, M.P.,\nCabinet Secretary.\nDear Mr. Brown,\n\nPlease act in this manner unless you want to submit any question to me. If so, send back to me with your views.\n\n[Signature]\n7-12-54\nMoraviantown\nNov. 30, 1847\n\nWe the undersigned ratepayers of Orford beg to request that Willis W.

If I should have addressed them to some other official instead you had better write and state that there have been no forwarded - also make application directly to the Department lest that one should not reach the proper authority.\n\nI think you should make application also to the Board of Examiners of this bounty for a renewal of your Certificate; There will be no difficulty in getting the renewal. You should state to the Department that your certificate will be renewed. You are at liberty to forward this letter with your own if you wish, in explanation of your position.

We did so.\n\nI have the pleasure to send you herewith copies of two petition (one by the Indians, one by the prominent white people as well as those in the immediate neighborhood of the Reserve) that I be appointed Teacher of the Reserve School here.\n\nI have written on the recent examinations held in the County Model School, Chatham to obtain a renewal of my 3rd Class Provincial Public School Teacher's Certificate. My original certificate...\nobtained in Brantford Collegiate Institute has been in the possession of the Indian Department since 1870 or 91, and as it is customary to hand in the original for indorsement would you kindly return me the original certificate sent you by Mr. Beattie, then Indian Agent.\n\nI believe I am the only Indian in Western Ontario who obtained a regular Provincial Certificate and by appointing an Indian when he becomes qualified a strong inducement is placed before the eye of other Indians to strive for a higher educational plane. Besides that with me just now it is a case of great need, more so than with my white folk competitors.\n\nI suppose the appointment rests with the Agent and Inspector. If from the favorable reports of my efficiency as teacher sent you (1892-93) when I was teaching this school before, you can mention me favorably to Mr. Agent McDonald you will confer a lasting benefit on me. Besides the petitions\u2014which mark the people's confidence in me here are testimonials also. I have written to the Trustees.\nPraying that your wise and kind policy will sustain my application.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYour most obedient humble servant,\n\nWillis J. Tobias.\nMoraviantown,\nKent Co.

I shall have traveled over two hundred and fifty miles sometimes taking but one meal per day, besides being at times much exposed. The support of a man in your position to one in mine is worth much greater effort than the little I have made. If you had not opened the door I would not have started, so whether I win or lose I shall be grateful to you. Your letter will go with my papers to Ottawa tomorrow.\n\nI shall be glad when it is over. Would you kindly let me know the result as soon as possible, but I know you are very busy so do not write till then. I suppose it is the anxiety and worry over this that has taken away both my appetite and much sleep yet I shall rest now for my work is nearly ended.\nIf I fail in getting this one where my own people want me, I shall not try again among strangers. Five testimonials have been subscribed, and if necessary I can get more.\n\nTo Mr. McDonald it may be merely an appointment, but not only a position nor a salary to me. It is everything.\n\nHopefully yours,\nWillie F. Tobias.\nThe Secretary: Dept of Indian Affairs: Ottawa.\n\nOctober 17th 1897\n\nIn reply to your letter (151868) of the 15th inst., I beg to say that I sent the original petitions with signatures of the Indians themselves and of the white people in the vicinity of the Reserve, including the Rev.

Doubtless you have received them by this time.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter from Mr. Tobias to me in order that you who have not had an opportunity to know him may have more means of judging of his character and his ability.\n\nI enclose also a renewal Certificate of Qualification to teach, which our Board of Education, knowing all the circumstances, granted him without hesitation.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nW.H.G.

Considering that all of the teachers on Walpole Island have nothing but Entrance Standing, those on Muncey the same excepting one who has a Third Class Certificate and nearly all of the teachers on the Tuscarora Reserve, Bradford (I believe excepting only one) have only Entrance Standing I cannot see why I am specially singled out for the axe if the Agent has always reported favorable of my school.\nDuring the past year I have discharged my duties to the best of my ability and the attendance during the year has been much larger than it was last year under my predecessor and my certificate is just the same. I have the support of the entire Reserve and apparently of both Trustees, my certificate for 1877 is alright, and last but not least I am the only Indian teacher in Western Ontario (perhaps in Ontario for Miss Hardie and Miss Latham are not Public School Teachers) who attained Third Class Standing, so I cannot understand why I am dismissed as an Indian school teacher, while other teachers with only Entrance certificates are retained.\n\nThis blow will fall particularly hard on me just now for I have not yet finished paying for my place and will lose it if the school is taken from me and on account of my plans for the future a house means more tome now than it ever did before.\n\nBegging you to send my certificate with your support to Mr. McLean, Indian Department, Ottawa.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours gratefully,\n\nWillis W.

In the last place you cannot believe anything he tells you and his present added bad manner of living is such a good example to the children he is endeavoring to teach as he is living with three white women for the landlord or a little better.

I am not at liberty to express my own private feelings in reference to the conduct of others, but the proceedings in this case were Antonio to proceed against him, but I encouraged them because of his standing as a leader.\n\nI have been informed that a man by the name of Mr. Collins lost a single harness in the same county, and that the track of the horse and buggy with the tracks that were followed, quite a number of sets of harnesses have been stolen all within or Saturday night, which appear to be all taken by the same party.

The notice from whom the names who took said that they tracks corresponded exactly with those of Willis and in no way resembled the shoes worn by Delos but it is immaterial which of them did the stealing they were in company and equally guilty and I think it is worth while we make a change in our leader this is only an instance there was a similar one in 1896 although no action was taken on account of his bad teaching.

If Tobias' statement is correct in this, that he does not owe Gillis the full amount of the cheque for advances, then Gillis should certainly hand over any balance.\n\nI trust this will be satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I then showed him with the papers and after reading it he said he would not pay he would be there. I told him what the consequences would be if he did not sign and began to explain matters to him and he cut me off short by saying that I had done my duty by showing the papers and I left him and you can do with him as seems fit.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6146, File 413-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nA.R. McDonald Esq. \nDept. of Indian Affairs \nDec 21st\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRegarding Jacob Logan's fabrications of which you spoke to Mr. Huff the other day and for permitting which he (God) was rather severe on me. I would state that if you feel any doubts in this matter a letter to Mr. Douglas, magistrate, or to Mr. Coulter (who made the arrest) both of Melbourne P.O., Middlesex Co. Ont will convince you that I had nothing to do with the matter. A letter to Myles Mc Donald would show at what time I arrived at his place and went to bed. There was a full house of grown up people and three children.\n\nI myself will make no statement whatever unfortunately for myself I incurred the suspicion having stolen a location ticket from your P.O. There is no satisfaction in footing a bill of $20 dollars for a lawyer letter ordering him Jake, shut up. I attempted a case once paid the lawyer telling me I would have to prove damages before I could claim any and paid Joe Huff for delivering a useless lawyer letter. I get all the damage that such cur's tongues can inflict thus have the pleasure of footing a bill for getting some professional to tell them not to say such nasty things about me, without a cent of expense smile quietly at their success in causing me a deal of annoyance and outlay.\nIt's much more satisfactory to give him a good punching and then pay out money in a just legal fine for he then has a few bruises to console a better tongue.\n\nBoth Isaac Hill & Job Whiteloon (who brought the news here) as well as Jack have passed and re-passed barely one block from the magistrate's and constable's house in Melbourne and I dare say have never stop asked about the truth of their statements, possibly for fear they would have nothing to talk about.\n\nIf I get a handle to by which I can cause them any expense or financial loss in a law suit or send them to prison I'll use it to the very last inch.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nWilliam Hobbs\n\nP.S. I am told that you are going to money. If so you will find out the name of the farmer who lost the straps. I think he said Thompson or Johnson or Lomas. I may yet be able to ask to take up a case of slander. I am told that I paid $30. If I can nail such a statement down I will do so.\n\nW.M.T.\nDear Nephew,\n\nYour letter was received last night as soon as possible to get my cheque. I will send you some money from Smith's daughter in London now. I will likely have a few but not enough to cover the bill.\n\nYesterday I don't know exactly how I will make out. Someone charged me with helping him and keeping him while women on the Reserve. It is none of their business. I had a summons to appear before McCrae at Duart again at Leominster House, London again, and at Bowater Hotel and again in London. On Monday I did not go to any of them and didn't go to the Leominster House unless they pay my way next Monday. However, as I am not working, I will try to help you to get the cheque.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Thompson also said that the shoes worn by Sobias on the day of the arrest were not such shoes as would make the tracks that were made by the party who stole the harness. Thompson said he had information before me against Sobias for stealing the harness, but in the boy's behalf I did not think we could at that time convict Sobias.

Riley\nLondon, Ont., January 22nd., 1900\n\nSCHOOLS.\n\nFEB 2 1900\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honor to report in respect to Willis Tobais late teacher in Moraviantown Reserve, that I found upon visiting Mr. MacDonald's agency, that he had not suspended Tobais, but that he had upon the 22nd. of December 1899 come to an agreement which terminated Tobais' services. Upon that day Tobais told him that he would not teach the school any more.\n\nI had notified Mr. Tobais to meet me in Muir Kirk, and not finding him there at the hour I arrived\u2014though he had been there earlier in the day\u2014I sent a conveyance with a request that he would come over and see me. He sent an equivocal answer and did not come.\n\nOn a subsequent occasion I endeavored to bring about an interview with him, but fruitlessly. So I took measures to compel his coming under pain of being punished for contempt, until by declaring that he did no longer consider himself a teacher of the Department, nor had he any claim to be the teacher of the Moraviantown school, he withdrew his conduct from what would be a proper sphere of inquiry.\n\nI enclose herewith a memorandum addressed to me by Mr. Tobais which shows that he no longer claims to be a teacher of the Department and under such circumstances I cannot see that there is any necessity to further investigate his conduct, which would more properly be the subject of criminal proceedings.\nI enclose for the information of the Department two letters dated respectively December 4th., and December 26th. 1899 from A. Douglas, Justice of the Peace, addressed to A.K. McDonald and would say from my inquiries, that it is clearly the general opinion that Tobias has been mixed up in theft and other sharp transactions. I have seen the boy referred to in these letters, Angus De Lauch, who is in jail here serving 90 days hard labor, and although he will not confess that W. Tobias was an accomplice of his, by the way that he speaks of the harness theft in which he was concerned and about Tobias suggests strongly that he is shielding the latter.\n\nI found that Tobias is living in a small house with a white woman and her two daughters, whom he is said to maintain, and the circumstances which certainly give the gravest reason to suppose that there are improper connections.\n\nI quote from the \"Highgate Monitor\" of Thursday, January the 11th. 1900, the following passage,\n\n\"Every effort was put forth by ex teacher Willis M. Tobias \"to find errors or even dishonesty, but the public considers the \"Toronto Record and that possibly he may take a degree at Kingston\".\n\nThe reference to the \"Toronto Record\" is to the incarceration which he suffered there, of which the Department is aware, and the suggestion that he might take a degree in Kingston made in this public manner is made in respect to the theft of the harness and other articles which had taken place in the vicinity of the Reserve in which he is supposed to be in some way connected.\nI think there is no doubt that Tobais' unwillingness to meet me was because he feared that a meeting might probably lead to a criminal prosecution, such as he had some difficulty of escaping in connection with the theft of the harness.\n\nI recommend that the matter be allowed to stand in the position in which the agent put it, that is to say,- That Tobais, by agreement, ceased his teachership in December 1909 and is not under suspension or in any way connected with the school of the Department.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo the\n\nDeputy Supt. of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nInclude some further documents bearing on this subject.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 3rd February, 1900\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the matter of the charges against Willis Tobias, I beg to say that his resignation as teacher of the Moraviantown school is accepted.\n\nThe Department would like to be advised as to the qualifications of the teacher who is at present temporarily in charge of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

I find that he had charge of No. 6 school, Six Nations, during the year 1892, but we have no record as to his success or failure while there. I do not know what he has been doing in the meantime, but, as the Indians who pray for his appointment pay the salary, he might be taken on trial, and, if the Public School Inspector's report is favourable, he might be kept on, and, if not, his services need not be retained after June 30, next.

His permanent appointment, however, will depend on the report of the Public School Inspector when he next visits this school, and the Department would like you to ask that gentleman to report specially as to his qualifications and ability to manage the school.

The Department is in no way compromised by the action of Mr. Agent McDonald, and I think it would be in the best\ninterest of the school to retain the services of Miss Ross, as the Agent reports that he does not think that Mr. Tobias has any scholastic qualifications. He suggests that, if he has, he should produce them or stand an examination. He further states that Mr. Tobias applied to Mr. School Inspector Colles last fall for the position but that he would not consider it, and that Tobias is no better qualified now than then.\n\nIn view of the Agent's explanations I would recommend that Miss Ross should be kept on and that Mr. Gordon should be informed that the position had been filled prior to the receipt of the petition by a teacher recommended by the Public School Inspector.\nOttawa, February 30, 1867.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst., with reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Moravian Indian school, and in reply I beg to say that, had you notified the Department of the engagement of Miss Murray by you, Mr. Tobias would at once have been told that there was no vacancy instead of being led to suppose that he would receive the appointment, if his qualifications fitted him for the position.\n\nUnder the circumstances Mr. Tobias should be asked to produce his qualifications, and if they are satisfactory, the question of his appointment will be reopened.\n\nIn the meantime Miss Ross's services will be retained.

General,-\n\nMr. Gordon, M.P., who forwarded a letter addressed to him last month by Mr. Nethercott, asking for the appointment of his son as teacher of the Moraviantown Indian school, which is vacant, at a salary of $500, was informed that if Mr. Nethercott was willing to take the school at the salary at present available ($400.00) the Department would be pleased to avail itself of his services.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Nethercott, the Methodist Missionary at Moraviantown and father of the young man, has written the Department, saying that Mr. Gordon had sent him its letter and that his son would not accept the school at less than $500 a year. He is said to have a First-Class Certificate but the only recommendation the Department has is from his father. The Band pays the salary and, if it were increased to $500, they should be consulted, if it was to be charged against them.\n\nJ. Pliny S. Nethercott, for whom the application is made, is at present teaching at Shetland, Ont., and I do not see how he could take the Indian school at once as he would be required to give reasonable notice.\n\nThere is ample opportunity for a good teacher to make a success in the Moraviantown school. There are about sixty children of school age on the reserve, all living within easy access of the school. The last quarterly return shows that\nthat there were 48 pupils enrolled, with an average attendance of only 25. Nearly all the pupils are in the lower standards, 35 being in the third or lower standards. The Moraviantown Indians are all Methodists and with the Father as missionary and the son as teacher they should be able to secure a regular attendance and better results, if they were sufficiently interested in the education of the children to exert themselves. On the other hand, as this young man is the son of the Missionary, it might be difficult to keep him up to his work, if he was inclined to be negligent.\n\nIt seems to me that the Department should have further information about this young man before engaging him at this rate, which would be the highest salary paid to any day school teacher by the Department. It would not be too much to pay to a teacher who had proved himself successful, but until we have evidence of his ability and earnestness, the Department would be taking chances. I would suggest that he be asked to apply by letter under his own hand, stating his age, experience, physical condition and inclosing his testimonials. He should also state when he could take charge of the school, if his services were accepted. It is for the Department to say whether it would pay $500 as an initial salary. The school is closed, and immediate action should be taken.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am a Canadian of Scotch\ndescent. In the school at Spragge (north\nshore of Georgian Bay) there were a number\nof Indian children in whom I was very much\ninterested.

General,-\n\nIn pursuance of instructions sent him on the 26th ult., Mr. Agent McDonald advertised for a teacher for the Moraviantown school, which has been closed since the New Year. He now forwards the Department five applications which he received, as follows.\n\nOne from Miss Dora Graham, who holds no certificate; and has had no experience;\n\nOne from Miss Nora Coveny. Miss Coveny also has no certificate but she taught the Bear Creek Indian school for a time.\n\nMr. Malcolm Kidd makes application. Mr. Kidd holds a second-class professional certificate and has had a number of years' experience. He is well recommended by Public School Inspectors Odell and Stratton.\n\nMary Stirrett, who has a second-class non-professional certificate, with Model School training, and two and one-half years' experience applies. She sends in no testimonials but refers the Agent to former Public School Inspector Moshier.\n\nThe fifth application is from Mr. A. MoF. Mustard. He holds a second-second class professional certificate.\ncertificate and has had five and one-half years' experience. He is well recommended by the Trustees of the schools in which he has taught.\n\nOf the five applicants I should say, judging from their letters and recommendations, that Mr. Mustard would be the most suitable one to employ.\n\nAn up-to-date school house is to be erected at Moraviantown and should be ready for application after next summer holidays. This would be an excellent point to give an improved Indian day school a trial, if a suitable teacher can be obtained. In filling the vacancy the appointment should only be temporary, and if the teacher proves to be fitted for the work, the question of providing a larger salary can be dealt with. The present salary of $400 is hardly large enough to induce a really good teacher to remain permanently.\n\nIf you will state which of the five applicants is to be appointed, Mr. McDonald can be notified at once.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nReferring to the Department's letter of yesterday's date in regard to the application of Mr. George A. Snider for the position of teacher at the Gibson Indian school, I beg to say that there is at present a vacancy at the Moraviantown school. On the 16th ult. the position was offered to a gentleman living in Toronto, but he has written stating that the acceptance of his application came too late and that he has other employment.\n\nThe members of this band are all Methodists and the Department proposes erecting in the spring a modern school building, and it would like to obtain the services of a teacher who would particularly interest himself in educational work on this reserve, where there is a promising field.\n\nMr. Snider might consider this school preferable to that on the Gibson reserve and, if so, the Department would be pleased to give him a trial. It will pay an initial salary of $400.00 per annum and, if his services prove satisfactory\n\nRev. A.

Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, with reference to securing the services of a teacher for the Moraviantown school who was recently recommended by him for another position.\n\nAs soon as the Department hears from him you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.R. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuart, Ont.\n\nSecretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 12th instant #151868/1, suggesting the possible appointment of Mr. George A. Snider to the Moravian town School instead of the one at Gibson, I beg to say that if the way is open I think such an appointment would be very suitable. One point, however, has to be considered. Is there a dwelling in the Moravian town settlement which the teacher can occupy, as Mr. Snider is a married man? To rent a house would, I suppose, be impracticable, and it is not desirable that the teacher should live at any great distance from his work. I will communicate at once with Mr. Snider and let him know what is proposed, and when I hear from him will promptly notify the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 16, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the vacancy existing at the Moraviantown Indian school, I beg to say that the Department has in view a married man whose services might be obtained as teacher.\n\nIn case that it might be possible to engage this man, the Department would like to know whether there is a house available which could be rented and, if so, at what rate.\n\nBe good enough to reply to this letter by return mail, if possible.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA. R. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuart, Ont.\nSir,\n\nRe Moraviantown School.\n\nOn receipt of your former communication as to the possibility of appointing Mr. George A. Snider to the Moraviantown School I immediately wrote to the missionary in charge enquiring if there was any house which a married teacher could occupy. I have just received Mr. Nethercott's reply and enclose a copy herewith. From this I infer that there is no house for a teacher and that it might be very difficult to get an Indian house that would be at all comfortable. There is an old house on the mission farm occupied by a farmer and may be so occupied again, but this is some two and a half miles away from the school house. As I understand it is the intention of the Department to improve educational facilities at Moraviantown, partly by the erection of a new school house, it has occurred to me that possibly the Department would also consider the advisability of building a house for the teacher to live in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Office\n\nMarch 18th, 1909\n\nReferring to your letter No. 157868/1 of 16th instant, relative to house for teacher. I have seen a man who owns a house within one mile of the school house, and can rent it for four dollars per month. It is situated near the settlement, six miles from Northwell Station C.R.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th inst. in further reference to the question of accommodation for a married teacher at the Moraviantown Indian school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the copy of the letter received by you from Rev. Mr. Nethercott was apparently not inclosed with your communication. On the 16th inst. the Department wrote its local Agent, Mr. A.R. McDonald, in this matter and has received a reply, in which he states that a comfortable house, situated in a white settlement and within a mile of the school, is available. It is six miles from Bothwell station. There is a good well on the premises and the rental asked is $4.00 per month. Firewood can be had for $2.00 per cord.\n\nThis would appear to be suitable accommodation and the Department would be pleased to hear from you again at your earliest convenience. I may add that the Department is not prepared at the present time to undertake the erection of a dwelling for a teacher at this point.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRev. A.

Sir,\n\nReplying to your letters of the 6th and 7th inst., I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that Mr. Snider leaves today to take charge of the Moraviantown school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, June 1, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Public School Inspector Colles has again drawn the attention of the Department to the number of children on the Moraviantown reserve absenting themselves from school without any reasonable excuse.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of October 28, last, and to ask what action you have taken with a view to having the Truant Officer perform his duties more carefully.\n\nIn that letter the teacher was to be asked to furnish that officer with a list of absentees. In order that he may do so, the teacher should have a list of all the children of school age on the reserve.\n\nA modern school building is being erected for these Indians and an experienced teacher has been secured. The Department would like to see full advantage taken of the opportunity for the children on this reserve to receive a liberal education, and it will expect the hearty co-operation of yourself and others on the reserve interested in their welfare.\n\nKindly let the Department have your views in this matter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA. R. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuart, Ont.\n\nSecretary.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, June 9, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that, at the request of Dr. Sutherland, the Department is sending you under separate cover a cheque for $40.00, being one month's salary as teacher of the Moraviantown Indian school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nGeorge A. Snider, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMoraviantown, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing this to tender my application for the position of teacher of the Moraviantown school, on the Moravian town Reserve, for the ensuing year, at the salary mentioned previously by the Department through Dr. A. Sutherland of Toronto, namely, five hundred dollars per annum.\n\nI also request that the kindness of the\nDepartment in paying my salary monthly, he continued to me during the first quarter, namely July 1st to Sept. 30th\u2014 and that this be considered as one of the terms of the engagement.\n\nI shall write you relative to my experience thus far in the school, and endeavor to give a few of my plans for the future, should my application be accepted.\n\nAt first my task seemed a very difficult one, owing to the apparent inability, on the part of the\nDepartment in paying my salary monthly, be continued to me during the first quarter, namely July 1st to Sept. 30th\u2014and that this be considered as one of the terms of the engagement.\n\nI shall write you relative to my experience thus far in the school, and endeavor to give a few of my plans for the future, should my application be accepted.\n\nAt first my task seemed a very difficult one, owing to the apparent inability, on the part of the\npupils to understand me when I spoke to them, having for more than five months listened to, and spoken, almost exclusively, the Indian language. This difficulty has become less and less.\n\nI set myself the task of learning their language. I found that even a few words that I could speak to them in their own tongue, seemed to open the door wide, to the hearts of both pupils and their parents. I am still studying the language occasionally, as I am able.\nI give parts of a lesson in the Indian tongue, and require one of the pupils who understands English quite well, to give what I have said in English. I find this delights the pupils, and they never forget that information, and its expression in English. I never allow them to answer in their own language during school hours.\n\nIn developing my method of teaching the English language thoroughly, I have repeatedly felt the urgent necessity for a library.\nin the school. I would like to put in an urgent plea for the installation of a library, of the correct type, even though small at first - if no more than fifty volumes. If it is my privilege to return to the school, I would humbly request the privilege of giving some expression, as to what books are suitable to the needs of a school such as this is.\n\nI might say, that there is scarcely any help towards the development of the habit of independent research and study, in a settlement like\nthis, where books are so very scarce.\n\nMr. MacKenzie, while here mentioned the matter of supplying occasional lunches for the children. I had previously made no investigation in this respect, but have done so since. I found that while some were amply provided for, others, in my judgment, had not what was adequate nor sufficient for a child in need of physical vitality and mental activity.\n\nMy purpose, if return to the school, is to spend a considerable portion of the\nholidays, after we are moved and settled here, in visiting every family on the reserve. I hope thereby, with my wife's assistance, to stir up greater interest in the things that make for the improvement and elevation of the race.\n\nI hope that you will pardon the length of this letter. I will excuse myself by saying that I endeavored to be brief.\n\nI remain,\n\nsincerely yours,\n\nGeorge A. Snider.\n\nPermanent address: Mapanee, Ont.\nTemporary address: Mbramantown, Ont.\nReferring to your letter No. 1868/1 relating to Mr. Collins' report - I must say that he had very little idea of report and wanted to get his eight dollars and must have some things.\n\nHe was at the school the day Mr. Smith started and the children were not aware that there was school so could not be there for his inspection. The agent's office is trying to do his best and teach every child in school or has been in at least once since the school opened but it is impossible to keep them there regularly. A number of them are off the reserve playing truant for the present. We are doing all we can for the children and they are doing fairly well for Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6146, File 413-1, part 1)\nOttawa, July 2, 1909.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nIn accordance with instructions received I visited the Moraviantown Indian school on the 16th ult.\n\nThere are 62 children of school age on the reserve and out of this number 31 were in attendance, 14 boys and 7 girls. During the previous week the attendance had been as high as 39 and not lower than 30. The falling off was due to many of the parents having left for Hamilton with their families to engage in berry picking.\n\nIt is not necessary to make any remarks on the building. There is seating accommodation for all the children of school age. Before the desks are placed in the new school-house they should be revarnished. They have a good supply of books, maps, etc., of which good care seems to be taken. The room was very clean and tidy and the children were neatly clad.\n\nThe teacher, Mr. Snider, is a married man. He holds a second-class non-professional certificate and a Model School diploma. I spent part of both the forenoon and after noon in the class-room and was fairly well pleased with the work being done. One feature is commendable; that is the attention paid to Nature study. I had the pleasure of listening to a lesson on \"The Rose\", taught with the flower before the pupils. This was a combined observation and language lesson, the children being required to express their observations in complete sentences, which were then written on the board. If Mr. Snider is retained in the\nposition he expressed his willingness to conduct a garden in connection with the school next summer, which is something the Department has been trying to encourage in its schools for some time past. The writing and drawing of the pupils were good and a brief examination of their reading, arithmetic and geography showed that these subjects were not being neglected. Of course, allowance has to be made for the four and one-half months the school was closed and the short time Mr. Snider has been in attendance.\n\nThe usual diffidence of Indian pupils was very marked in this school. It is a most difficult matter to get them to speak distinctly and loud enough to be heard. Some suggestions in this respect were offered the Teacher. In regard to discipline Mr. Snider's work would bear improvement. In his efforts to obtain the confidence and goodwill of the children he has allowed them, in my opinion, too much latitude. Naturally timid, they did not, I was given to understand, take very kindly to a male teacher. For some time the teachers in this school have been ladies. One can appreciate the difficulty of Mr. Snider's position; on the other hand he appears to have been too lenient, and seemed it is a hard matter to correct the evil. He seemed to be quite conscious of the defect, to which his attention was called, and I hope to see an improvement in this respect.\n\nMr. Snider has so far, on account of boarding some two miles from the school, taken no interest in the home life of the Indians. The importance of this work was impressed upon him, and, should the Department retain his services,\nI think he can be relied upon, when he takes up his residence near the reserve, to make an effort to interest the parents in the education of their children, and in this respect there is apparently a field for his labour.\n\nHe impressed me as being enthusiastic and energetic. He is a man evidently imbued with the missionary spirit and in work of this kind activity in that direction may more than counterbalance any deficiencies in his capabilities and methods as a teacher, provided he exercises a proper control of the school-room.\n\nIn this connection I think the regulations should, if possible, be enforced on this reserve. The school is centrally situated, and there is no reason why nearly all the children should not receive the benefits of the education offered. As one of the Indians said to me, \"With a $3000 school-house and a high salaried teacher, the parents should be compelled to send their children to school\". The same view was expressed by the Secretary of the Council. It may be that Mr. Snider's efforts and work among the parents will produce good results and that the existing indifference will to some degree at least disappear.\n\nOn the whole I am of opinion that the Department could not do better than engage Mr. Snider as teacher of this school on the terms already offered.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

If such there be, I would request that the Department would kindly give me information regarding it, as I would prefer going to such a reserve to returning to Moramantown. I may say as well...\nthat I was disappointed in not being able to secure a suitable place to live in on the Moravian Reserve.

As you are aware, it was closed for some months last winter, and it is desirable that there should be no delay in reopening it after the summer holidays.\n\nThe Department will be prepared to pay a liberal salary to the right person.

The letter must have been kept in the mails, either at Moravian Town or some other office. All of this time I have been in uncertainty, not...\nknowing what I was going to do, nor what was the decision of the Department relative to my application.\n\nI wrote to Dr. Sutherland telling him that it did not appear as if we were to return to Moravian town\u2014i.e., my wife and I\u2014I also mentioned the difficulty I had experienced in endeavoring to secure suitable accommodations in the way of a house to live in, and asked him to let me\nknow, if he heard of any other Indian school, as I had become quite attached to the Indian work.\n\nI did not send him any resignation, neither did I tell him we had decided not to return. I only wrote as I have mentioned above, the reason for which will, I think, be evident to you. Hence my surprise at receiving a letter such as that which you wrote me on the 12th inst., saying that my resignation\nOf the position was accepted, whereas I had sent no resignation, and was wondering whether my application was accepted or not.\n\nYou will see from this the position in which I have been placed as to the school, the cause for the misunderstanding of the state of affairs which seems to have arisen in the minds of the Department.\n\nI have confidence in the Department, from the entirely satisfactory manner in which they have\ndealt with me in the past, that they will do what is best, at this late hour to rectify matters. I do not know that anyone in particular can be blamed, for it seems to have been a case of complete unintentional misunderstanding.\n\nI remain, sir,\n\nin sincerity.\n\nYours,\n\nGeorge A. Snider\nOttawa, July 28, 1908.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. George A. Snider, dated the 26th inst., in which he states that there is some misunderstanding with reference to his resignation from the Moraviantown school, as he did not contemplate leaving, if his application was accepted. On the 2nd inst. the Department wrote Mr. Snider, offering to continue his services at Moraviantown, but he did not get the letter till the 26th inst. In the meantime the Department took action on your letter of the 9th inst. and advised Mr. Snider that his resignation was accepted. This latter letter reached him before the one dated on the 2nd, which was sent to Moraviantown.\n\nThe Department is not altogether satisfied as to Mr. Snider's fitness for the position, and would be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience in the matter of sending him back to Moraviantown.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

I beg to say that the Department is in communication with the Rev. Dr. Sutherland with reference to the vacancy at the Moraviantown school, and when a reply is received from him you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nGeorge A. Snider, Esq.,\nNapanee,\nOnt.\nDear Sir,\n\nI regret that illness has prevented earlier reply to your letter of the 28th ultimo, referring to Mr. Geo. E. Snider and his unsatisfactory work at Moraviantown. A few days ago I received a letter from the Rev. Mr. Nethercott, missionary at Moraviantown, stating that he had just been informed by Mr. Snider that he intended to return to the work of teaching at Moraviantown if I did not give him work elsewhere. It was evidently a case requiring prompt action and I felt justified in writing to Mr. Snider that his resignation had been accepted, and I had no reason for thinking that the Department would change their mind in the matter. Moreover I informed him that his course had been so very unreliable that I could not consider the question of nominating him for any other place.\n\nI hope to resume my duties in the near future, but in the meantime am endeavoring by advertisement and otherwise to get a suitable application that I can confidently submit to the Department. I understand that in all the places mentioned the Department would prefer a married teacher, and we would also, but in case of necessity would the Department consent to an unmarried teacher, male or female, possessing suitable qualifications being appointed temporarily at one or more of the places concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., and in reply I beg to say that Mr. Snider has been advised that the Department must adhere to its decision to accept his resignation as teacher of the Moraviantown Indian school.\n\nIn reply to your enquiry with reference to the temporary appointment of unmarried teachers to the vacancies at present existing in schools conducted under the auspices of your Church I beg to say that, realizing the difficulty of obtaining married men for these positions, the Department would be willing to engage temporarily single teachers, either male or female. At Moraviantown accommodation can be had within a reasonable distance of the school it is thought, and the same at Gibson. At Chemong, where a house will be available, if not used for the Missionary, the Department would like to have a married man, but in official letter of the 23rd ult. you were advised as to its wishes in this matter.\n\nIt is particularly desired to reopen the\n\nRev.

In reply, I have only this to say. The Department must surely know the Regulations of the Education Department of the Dominion of Canada, relative to teachers and schools. From these it is evident that an agreement such as that signed by the Department of Indian Affairs on July 2nd may not\nbe terminated until the expiration of the first quarter, and then only by a one month's notice so as to terminate on the last day of the month. This makes it impossible for the Moravian town School to be vacant until Oct. 31st., and the Department of Indian Affairs is held responsible for the salary of the teacher with whom they made their agreement, until that date.\n\nI remain,\n\nin sincerity, yours,\nGeorge A. Snider.\nOttawa, August 12, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th inst. with reference to the Moraviantown Indian school, and in reply I beg to say that, when official letter of July 3, last, was written, the Department had not been advised by Dr. Sutherland of your decision not to return to Moraviantown, as expressed in a letter to him.\n\nAs soon as Dr. Sutherland was heard from, your resignation was accepted.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nGeorge A. Snider, Esq.,\nNapanee, Ont.\n157868/1. To the Secretary\nSubdept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 2nd inst. I have called your attention to the legal aspect of the case relative to the Moraviantown Indian School. I would say further as explanatory of my position, that I would not have written again to Dr. Sutherland had I received your letter of the 2nd. ult. on time; neither would I have written\nagain to the Department,\nsaw to have acknowledged\nwith thankfulness the\nreceipt of their letter of\nacceptation, and agreement\nwith the terms of my\napplication.\n\nHad I desired at\nany time to tender a\nresignation of the position,\nI would have written\nsuch resignation to the\nDepartment, as it was\nto them I had sent\nmy application.\n\nI waited several\ndays after the closing of\nthe school, hoping to\nhear definitely from the Department, so that I could conclude, if possible, some arrangements for a return after the holidays. In the meantime I travelled on foot over a considerable portion of the Reserve, visited twenty Indian families, and got the outlay of the land, position of roads, location of families etc. etc.\n\nI drew the attention of the Postmaster, at Morainatown to the fact that I was going to Napanee, and supposed that he would forward my mail as other rural postmasters.\nat other places had done.\n\nI wrote a card to the S.M. about the matter, upon receiving your letter of the 12th ult. I received yours of the 2nd as a result. It has but one postal mark besides those of Ottawa and Napane.\n\nPost Offices. It is \"Bothwell July 23, 1909.\"\n\nDr. Sutherland had written previously about another position, on an Indian Reserve, which from his representations appeared even preferable to Moravian town. I wrote to him about it, in view of the\ndubiousness attached to the Moravian town position. He made no reply to my letter, but evidently wrote immediately to the Department, from which came your letter of the 12th ult.\n\nFrom these facts it will be evident to you whether I wanted the school at Moravian town or not. I have sought to do the square thing as far as I knew it. I fail to understand the Dr.'s attitude in the matter, unless it is from the fact that my religious views are different from his, for which I am very thankful. I remain sincerely yours, George A. Snider.\nOttawa, August 19, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th inst., and in reply I beg to say that, as there appears to have been some misunderstanding in regard to your re-engagement as teacher of the Moravian-town Indian school, the Department has decided to employ you for the current year ending June 30, 1910, at a salary of $500.00 per annum.\n\nThe school should be reopened immediately and the Department will expect you to be at Moraviantown not later than the 25th inst.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nGeorge A. Snider, Esq.,\nNapanee, Ont.\nOttawa, August 19, 1908.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 11th inst. and previous correspondence relative to the appointment of a teacher for the Moraviantown school, I beg to say that Mr. Snider, who had charge of it for a portion of the June quarter, claims that he had no intention of resigning unless transferred to another school, and as no such transfer has been made he insists on holding the Department to its letter of July 3, last, re-engaging him.\n\nAs up to the present time you have not submitted the name of another teacher and as the school should be reopened at once, the Department has decided to continue Mr. Snider's services for another year and he has been so informed.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

On receipt of your communication I again advertized extensively and already some applications are coming in. As soon as I obtain the necessary information in regard to the applications I will promptly notify the Department. But in regard to this whole matter I find myself face to face with what seems to be an insuperable difficulty, namely, the impossibility of securing properly qualified teachers for the salaries now offered. In illustration of this I need merely mention the fact that the salaries offered by the Department are only about half, and in some cases less than half, what the grade of teachers asked for can readily obtain in the Public Schools of the country.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant #151868/1 setting forth that Mr. Snider who had charge of the Moraviantown School for part of the June Quarter, claims that he had no intention of resigning unless transferred to another school and that the Department had decided to continue Mr. Snider's services for another year of which he has been informed.\n\nI can only say that I regret this decision by the Department. There was no stipulation expressed or implied that Mr. Snider should be transferred to another school, though in his letter expressing his intention not to return to Moraviantown he asked if there was any other work that I could give him. While recognizing that the final authority in such matters is with the Department it is unfortunate that an appointment should have been made that will likely prove to be a disturbing element as between the work of the Church and the School.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nNAPANEE, August 28th, 1909.\n\nNo. 151868/1.\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa; 350402\n\nSir:\n\nI have just received your letter of the 19th inst. today.

Snyder\nOttawa, 2nd September, 1909.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo stating that owing to delay in receipt of the Department's letter of the 19th of that month you had accepted a position as teacher of another school, but that you can leave on giving two weeks notice and would then be prepared to take charge of the Moraviantown School if the Department will pay your transport.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that while the Department cannot pay your travelling expenses from Napanee to Bothwell, it is willing to advance you the amount necessary to cover the same on its being assured that you will take charge of the Moraviantown school at the earliest possible moment. If you will send the Department an acceptance of your resignation as teacher of the school you are now engaged in, and state the exact time you will be prepared to leave for Bothwell, a cheque for $35.00 to cover your travelling expenses will be sent you as an advance on your salary.\n\nIn regard to your request to be paid monthly during the first quarter, I beg to say that this matter will be considered after you have entered upon your duties. The Department trusts that nothing further will occur to delay the re-opening of the school.

I\nleft school in Portland Friday\nthe 3rd inst. Succeeded in\ncompleting preparations for our\ndeparture from Napane. By\nThursday a.m. as anticipated\nyour letter and cheque\nhaving been sent to Hartington,\ndid not reach me in Napane\nuntil 10:30 a.m. Saturday.\nHence our departure was delayed\nuntil 1:26 a.m. Monday. Reached\nmoraviantown H.P.M. School\nopens at 8:30 a.m. Wed. a.m. the 15th.\nI remain, in sincerity,\nyours, George A. Snider.\nNo. 151868/1.\n\nThe Secretary Department of Ottawa,\n\nSir,\n\nI am writing to ask that the Department will do me the kindness to send me a payment on my salary at the end of the present month, Nov. 30th. I am loath to do this, but it is evidently a necessity, both for our own needs, and also on account of some to whom we are indebted.\n\nI am minded also to write somewhat relative to the school work here. I had hoped on returning to secure a place to rent on the Reserve, so that we might live amongst the people whom we hoped to benefit.\nIn this I was disappointed; but secured a house off the Reserve, a mile from the school building.\n\nI am endeavoring to find a solution of some of the problems connected with Indian education, two or three facts have come under my observation, which have led me to contemplate a change in the modus operandi in connection with the school here.\n\nI find that many of the young men and women, who have gone through the school, are unable to converse in English, and are consequently evasive and reticent in demeanor. This also hinders their progress, and helps to keep them among their own people.\nSome of my best pupils in book work are handicapped in this way. To elicit a conversation from them is apparently an impossibility.\n\nThere are two or three families of which the parents have been off the Reserve a considerable portion of their lives, and consequently speak English in their homes. Their children come to school and learn the Indian language through playing with their schoolmates.\n\nThese, with a few other considerations, and my desire to overcome these difficulties, have led me to a conclusion with the permission of the Department; I would turn this school temporarily into a kindergarten, not in building houses, etc., with blocks, but in building\nsentences, words and phrases in oral expression in English. I would take my children to the real objects with which they have to do in everyday life. I would point them out to them and the facts relative to them about which we are to speak. I would speak the words of the conversation, in English first, and require my pupils to repeat them after me; individually first, then in unison. And then I would require all who can to write them.\n\nOutside of the regular language lessons, I have had two lessons of this nature, of one hour each, and have met with marked and noticeable results, which have encouraged me to continue with hope of success. I would continue this practice.\nregularly until my pupils could converse with me readily upon any subject of common everyday interest.\n\nOf course this would necessitate frequent departures from the regular routine of school work. I would have to take my pupils to the neighboring fields where grow the different crops, to the many groves nearby in search of the different kinds of trees; to the barns of nearby farmers, who were willing to observe and converse about the different kinds of stock, grain, and fodder, etc., etc.\n\nThis work would be interspersed with a sufficient amount of other work, in mathematics, the theory of language, reading, word recognition, Geography, and the other subjects on the curriculum. A school garden in the\nSpring would also be very helpful in furnishing additional material for this work.\n\nThe prosecution of the plan of work outlined above, I believe, contribute much towards the present greatest necessity of the pupils of the school here, the development of the power of oral expression in English\u2014the language of this land\u2014and would be effective in overcoming one of the greatest barriers to Indian progress\u2014their inability to understand fully, and express themselves fluently, in English.\n\nI remain,\n\nsincerely yours,\n\nGeorge A. Snider.\n\nPlease address me at Highgate;\nOnt.\nG.A.S.\nOttawa, November 19th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant with reference to the teaching of English on the Moraviantown reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say the Department considers that your proposal to teach the children the English language, in the use of which they are now deficient, by means of object lessons is a good one. Much of this work can, however, be done in the class-room, but the Department would approve of your devoting, say, one afternoon each week to outdoor work.\n\nThe Department would also like to have you cultivate a garden next spring and will make the necessary arrangements to have the land ploughed and seeds and implements furnished. You will be good enough to [underline] this matter up in due time with Mr. Agent McDonald.\n\nIn reference to an advance on your salary for this quarter I beg to say that one will be sent you now.\n\nThe Department is pleased to learn that you are meeting with success in your work at Moraviantown.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nGeorge A. Snider, Esq.,\nHighgate, Ont.\nHighgate Dec. 9, 1809.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir: As you are doubtless aware by this time, I received the enclosed letter as advance on the present quarter. Thank you. I do not want the Department to think that it is my purpose nor desire to continue asking for advance payments on my salary contrary to their custom. Neither is it in my mind in any wise to find fault with the Department's plan of procedure or method of operation. I consider that the Department has dealt kindly with me thus far, a fact which I appreciate.\n\nI am writing simply to state the facts of my own case, and to ask...\nthat the Department will do what they can for me during a period of temporarily restricted circumstances, financially.\n\nAs mentioned at another time, I came to Moraviantown first, at the terminus of a year of unusually heavy expenditure, with no counterbalancing income. I was obliged to sell my horse, and a buggy and harness to meet expenses, and was still considerably in debt. Upon returning to Wapaneau for the holidays, I was unsuccessful in my endeavors to secure other employment, and was obliged to meet two months' further constant outgo, with no income. I lost two weeks' time and pay by leaving my other school to return to Moraviantown in September. My expenses in moving and settling...\nhere, have amounted to nearly fifty dollars above that which I had planned in my estimation, when I wrote the Department my decision to return.\n\nAs it is now, it will be impossible for me to be free from debt before the first of April, 1910; and in justice to those to whom I have of necessity become indebted, I should make payments at the end of each intervening month\u2014that is, Jan. 1st, Feb. 1st, Mar. 1st, and Apr. 1st. I am writing this to the Department, because I feel that I should make some honest endeavor to meet my financial obligations as soon as is possible.\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nGeorge A. Snyder\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am doing this with the authority and advice of the Superintendent, or Inspector of Indian Schools, Mr. McKenzie, who advised this on account of the delay which so frequently attends the sending of the reports the roundabout way. It seems to have taken from three to four weeks for them to reach the Department, after having been submitted by the teacher to the Local Indian Agent. I am sending my report direct this time because I have a note to meet on the first day of January 1910, and I desire to have the cash on hand with which to redeem it.\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nGeorge A. Snider.\nOttawa, December 28th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, covering the quarterly return from the Moraviantown school for the December quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the authority given you in June, last, to send your return direct to the Department was only for that particular occasion owing to the urgency at the time. The permission given you at that time was not intended to form a precedent; however, in view of the necessity of your receiving your cheque promptly at this time, it will be sent you today, but in future the department will require all your returns to be certified to by the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nGeorge A. Snider, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMoraviantown Indian School,\nHighgate, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI received your communication of the 14th inst., which is quite satisfactory. I had not thought of asking to have salary paid in advance. I also received the two copies of the book entitled \"The People of the Plains,\" which were presented to Rufus Huff and Albert Tobias\u2014both of Standard 6\u2014for regularity in attendance, and faithfulness with work at school. The former pupil was absent 2 days, the latter 4, of the session just closed.\n\nI am sending herewith the report for the present quarter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6146, File 413-1, part 1)\ntogether with Requisition for School Material. I am doing this with the authority and advice of the Superintendent or Inspector of Indian Schools, Mr. W.C. Stemple, who advised this on account of the delay which so frequently attends the sending of the reports the roundabout way. It seems to have taken from three to four weeks for them to reach the Department, after having been submitted by the teacher to the Local Indian Agent. I am sending my report direct this time because I have a note to meet on the first day of January 1910, and I desire to have the cash on hand with which to redeem it. I have no envelopes of the correct size, but have remodelled one for the occasion.\nreceived today through the Indian agent Mr. A.R. McDonald, the primes asked for at the close of the September quarter, so that they are scored from the list of requisites.\n\nRelative to the requisition for stories of other nations than our own, I may say further, that in my judgment, that is not true education which tends to limit the breadth of the child's vision; I would have him acquainted with all nations, and in sympathy with their struggles and conquests, as they relate to political liberty, equity and justice. I can conceive of no method likely to be more effective in contributing to the cause of universal peace and harmony, and of hastening that time,\nso long hoped for, when men shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks, and learn war no more?\n\nThanks to the Department for the concession made in my favor, as per letter of the 14th inst.\n\nI remain,\n\nsincerely,\n\nyour humble servant,\n\nGeorge A. Snider\nHighgate Feb. 25th 1910.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa:\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith the Report as requested. I use Highgate as my Post Office, because our mail is brought to us regularly from there. It is three miles from here to the Moravian town Post Office, which necessitates a walk of six miles for mail addressed to me there.\nI beg to call the attention of the Department to the fact that, according to Official letter of Dec. 14th, 1909, I was to have received my salary at the end of each month during this quarter. This has not been done. My returns for January were handed to the Indian Agent, as requested.\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nGeorge A. Snider.\nOttawa, February 23rd, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, and in reply I beg to say that your returns for the month of January did not reach the Department.\n\nA cheque for $75.00, advance on your salary for the current quarter, is being sent you and the balance will be forwarded upon receipt of your quarterly return at the end of March.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nGeorge A. Snider, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMoraviantown Indian School,\nHighgate, Ont.\nHighgate, March 26, 1910.\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nSir:\n\nI am forwarding today the returns for the past quarter, to the Indian Agent at Quart, for transmission to the Department at Ottawa.\n\nI am also forwarding herewith to you, a few available samples of the written work in English during February and March. They are really among the first tangible\nproofs of success in the employment of many and varied means to secure development along the line of this, the greatest barrier to progress among the people and their children on the Reserve. There have been many others since.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGeorge A.

And then he can fly around\nnight time. And say whoo whoo whoo.\nHe has sharp nails, any mouse can not get away\nWhen the owl gets a hold of him.\nAnd some times he sits up on a big tree, and when he\nsees a rabbit! And the rabbit comes along under the\ntree and sits down. And then the owl flies down after\nthe rabbit, the rabbit cannot see the owl.\nAnd the owl gets his big sharp nails on him.\nThen the rabbit cannot get away.\nThen the owl starts to eat the rabbit. When he gets the part of\nthe rabbit up, up. And then he flies to his nest.\nAnd gives it to her little owls.\n\nGimmer E. Noah\nAge 13.\nCertified.\nG. A.

Flowers grow in gardens, in houses, in flower-pots, in flower beds out doors, to make the yard look pretty. And all these flowers have some sweet honey in them. And the bee comes and gets it out and makes sweet honey. Honey is a kind of a Medicine, for a cold. When I get cold in fall, the frost comes along, kills all the pretty flowers, and we have no flowers till the next summer.\n\nAlbert Tobias\nAge 13\nCertified\nJ. A. Smither\nTeacher\n\nFeb/10\n\nA Story of a hickory nut\n\nA hickory nut grows on a tree. On the top it has a green shell, and inside it has a white shell, but it's very hard. It is not altogether round. But its top shell comes off very easy in the fall, after the frost comes and freezes it a bit, and it falls to the ground. It lives on a tree when it has other brothers and sisters which fall with it. And when they all fall boys and girls come and pick them up, and put them in bags and take back the top shell off, and put them by the stove to dry, and then they put them into the cellar and keep them in the winter.\n\nThe white shell of the hickory nut is like coals, for it makes a good hot fire. A hickory nut has something inside of it which is very good to eat. Sometimes three or four hickory nuts grow on a bunch.\n\nThe hickory nut trees are mostly made into handles.\n\nAlbert Tobias\nAge 13\nCertified\nJ. A.

But I am going to write about Summer to tell you what I do in Newmarket. In the summer I play about barefooted and sometimes go to the river and fish and many a time I bath. Once caught a fish seventeen inches long. I'll tell you I had a hard time pulling him out\u2014a bass mind you. Of course some boys have caught bigger fish than that\u2014I guess. But this fish he broke one hook and one line before I caught him. I have caught fish every time I have gone out to fish. I am sad to have good luck every time I go out fishing. One day my father and I crossed the river and fished. He beat me being seven to six. Why I like fishing so well that I'll never stay home on Saturdays down to the river I must go. So of the people on this reserve fish on Sundays but I don't. Sometimes I play ball run and jump and sometimes hot corn and other things I need not mention.\n\nSo this is all I need to say about Summer. Let me tell you next what difference there is between Summer and Winter.\n\nWinter\n\nIn the winter I go out hunting rabbits and things like that, and in winter there is snow on the ground and ground is cold but in summer time you would never see snow but land would be hot as any. Bare feetboys have to keep out of the hot dust in the summer. But in the winter time the barefoot boys have to have warm shoes on, and I suppose they would like to have a stove with them when they go out of the house. They need warm clothes, warm houses and warm beds. But in the summer time you need cold bed, cold air, cold bath\u2014and last of all you need thin clothes. In the summer I think I'll tell you what I do in winter. I play snowballing and throwing snowballs at something to learn how to throw straight. Sledding is most important one for me many a time when men would go past our place with a load of wood to the oil wells and when coming back I either jump on the sleigh or take my own little hand sleigh and sit it to the big sleigh and sometimes I have a coast down a hill and now I will close.\n\nRufus Jacobs Age 12.\n\nCertified\n\nG.A.

Official letter of the 23rd also received this 25th.\n\nThe situation regarding the pupils preparing for the Entrance Examination is this.\n\nThey were desirous of writing on the exam. This furnished an additional incentive to closer application to study.\n\nTwo of the parents of the pupils concerned, interested themselves sufficiently, to make request that their boys be prepared for the exam.\n\nI replied that I would do what I could for them.\n\nI shall give them my Saturday forenoon from May 1st until June 18. This will give them additional drill.\nEven the three days' experience among better conditions as to civilization and education will be of benefit to them.\n\nI have secured Entrance Examination papers for the past five years.\n\nIf any one of them passes the examination, I shall be greatly surprised.\n\nNevertheless, if it were possible to give them one year at the High School, among people who speak the English language only, where they would be favored with better educational advantages, where their minds' eye might be opened to better things; it would be of inestimable benefit to them; especially while they are at an age when they are more impressionable than they will be later.\n\nBy giving my Saturday forenoons to my Entrance Class, I shall have time left to give the rest.\nIf the school some additional training in location preparatory to a school concert at the end of May. The school will likely lose more than half its regular attendants during June. They will not return until September.\n\nAs to dialogue and recitation books, I do not know of anything better than those for sale by the Educational Publishing Co., Toronto. I am enclosing a page descriptive of what they have. I have checked those which would do us for a time. I would be glad if the Department sees fit to furnish them, or something similar, for the use of the school here.\n\nI am also making my application herewith, for the position of teacher of the school for the ensuing year, July 1st, 1910 - July 31st, 1911, at the same salary, namely, five hundred dollars per annum. A reply from the Department at their earliest convenience will be greatly appreciated.\nappreciated.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nGeorge A.

Snider\nHighgate, Ont.\nOttawa, May 4, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo applying for the position of teacher of the Moraviantown Indian school for next year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to continue your services at the rate of $500.00 per annum.\n\nThe recitation books, published by the Educational Publishing Co., asked for will be ordered to be sent with as little delay as possible.\n\nAs stated in a previous communication the Department is much interested in your efforts to fit some of the pupils to pass the Entrance Examination to a High School. If, however, you are in any doubt as to their capabilities would it not be better to try to induce them to remain at school for another year, when they would be reasonably sure to be successful? Should they fail on the examination this year it might have a deterrent effect on both themselves and other pupils. This matter, however, will be left to your own discretion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nGeorge A.

(RG 10, Volume 6146, File 413-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI have received Official Letter of the 4th inst. giving notice of the Department's acceptance of my application. Thank you. I have also noted the remarks made re Entrance Pupils. My policy may be wrong but I have always been loath to hinder a pupil from that which, of his own volition, he would undertake. An important part of our education is the knowledge of ourselves. And what agent has been more effective in contributing toward this end, than failure? Other aims towards the civilization of which I have striven, are the development of strength of character, independence and self-help, and the production of that generally scarce commodity, the power of independent thought. So that, even if these pupils \"fail\"\nas to the examinations, in my judgment, their education continues its progress.\n\nThere is another matter which should have been mentioned in connection with my application. That is, the Summer Holidays. I do not know what has been the Department's arrangement in this respect. But I beg to make request hereby that it may be found in the wisdom and goodness of the Department to grant, that the Summer Holidays for the Norwintown Indian School be from July 1st to September 1st, inclusive.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nGeorge A. Smither,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, May 26, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, and in reply I beg to say that, on further consideration, the Department thinks it might be well to allow the pupils to whom reference is made to try the coming Entrance Examination.\n\nIn regard to the holidays I may say that if you will refer to the quarterly return froms you will see that Indian schools are required to be kept open 216 days in the year. This will not permit of two full month's holidays, so that if you close the school on June 30th it must be reopened not later than the third Monday in August.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the semi-annual report from the Public School Inspector on this school and I must say that it is very disappointing, as it shows that there has been a lack of interest in the work on your part and that very little progress has been made by the pupils during the year. The first report received from the Inspector and also that from an officer of the Department gave grounds for the hope that your appointment to this school would prove satisfactory, but it is quite evident that the enthusiasm with which you took up the work has very much diminished. When you first took charge of this school a lack of discipline was in evidence and your attention was particularly called to the need of firm control over the\n\nGeorge A. Snider, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMoraviantown Indian School,\nHighgate, Ont.\npupils, without which progress is impossible. Apparently, however, there has been no improvement in this respect, with the consequent results.\n\nThe Inspector, in his report, states that the pupils had not been using pen and ink since the removal from the old building, the reason given being that the ink wells were locked up in the old school-house. This is a most absurd excuse to give for the neglect of this work and leads the Department to think that you have lost practically all interest in the work.\n\nOn May 4th, last, you were informed that the Department would continue your services at the rate of $500.00 per annum, but, unless the next report shows a decided improvement in reference to discipline and class-room work, the question of making a change will have to be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nI received Official letter of the 26th ultimo. With regard to the sick wells, I beg to say that they have been missing since our removal to the new School building. I did not have charge of the removal of the school furniture. Upon my return to work after the Xmas holidays, I made the discovery that the bottles were missing, and reported the same to the Indian Agent. I also placed them upon my Requisition Blank for the Quarter. This was returned to me with the request that I score these out, with a few other items. This was done, and a new Blank made out. It was explained to me that the bottles would be sent over. They have never arrived, and the fact is, as I discovered at New year's, they cannot be found, having disappeared from the scene altogether.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 9, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is astonished to receive so lamentably weak an excuse for the neglect of an important exercise like writing in your school. The facts as stated by you should have been made known to the Department when the necessary steps would have been taken to have you supplied with writing requisites.\n\nYou have made no reference whatever to that portion of the Department's letter of the 26th ultimo dealing with the results of your work as teacher, as reported upon by the Public School Inspector. I beg to call your attention to the last paragraph of the letter referred to in which you were informed that unless the next report shows a decided improvement in discipline and class-room work the question of dispensing with your services will have to be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeorge A.

(Season for re-engagement of teachers is now on.)\n\nI made my application early in the spring because of matters which came up for consideration upon which I could not decide intelligently without knowing the attitude of the Department in the matter of the school\u2014one of these being the cultivation of a garden on land adjoining the house in which we lived.\n\nI asked that the summer holidays be extended to two months, because my past experience in school work has led me to believe that this is a necessity to me for the full recuperation of the forces in\npreparation for the coming year's work. I have generally had it arranged for me in this way. Besides, I believe it to be in the best interests of education both from the standpoint of teacher and pupil, and the nation and the race that are to be, that at least this portion of the year be left for relaxation and freedom from concentration of nerve forces and confinement of physical energies.\n\nThis is in harmony with the opinions of the teachers and educators of Ontario, as expressed by their resolution passed at the session of the Ontario Educational Association at Toronto in the Spring.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeorge A. Smider\nHighgate, June 28, 1910.\n\nSecretary, Dept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa;\n\nSir:\n\nWe are leaving this week for our\nhome in Wapance, as it is our\ncustom to spend the greater portion of\nthe summer holidays there.

As to the report to which you refer, I beg to submit to the Department a few of the facts in the case, from which will be seen the incongruity of the situation.\n\nA part of the work done by grades three, four and five has been written work with pencil and paper. It has filled between three and four dozen scribblers of two hundred pages each.\n\nThree times daily, preceding each intermission, the teacher's desk is piled with a pile of slates, one and a half to two feet high, some filled on one, many on both sides, with written exercises on the subjects taught in the school. This comprises another portion of the work done here.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6146, File 413-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nThis excludes all the oral work, in reading, spelling, memorization, conversations preceding the written exercises, study with text books, etc., etc.\n\nAfter a year's application to work such as described above, it is reported that \"very little progress has been made by these pupils.\"\n\nOther things in the report as given to me in official letter & the 26th ultimo, appear to me to be equally as incongruous.\n\nNone of these things were even mentioned to me when the Inspector visited my school, which was the time when they should have been mentioned had he been jealous for the welfare of the school, or had there been any occasion to call them forth.\n\nAs to the missing ink-wells, it was I who called the attention of the Inspector to the matter, and desired him to report the same to the Department in the hope that something...\nmight be done. I should have reported the matter to the Department at the time of its occurrence. But I had just received an injunction from the Department; Official letter Dec. 28, '09\u2014to the effect that no reports would be recognized in future without the agent's signature. None had been sent without, to my knowledge. He refused his signature to this portion of my report. I desisted, and have been put to much inconvenience since.\n\nAs to the position, it is in the hands of the Department. Let them do as they see fit with it. Why should I have anything to say about that? I am willing to continue on the basis of conscientious and faithful endeavor after the welfare of the interests committed to my trust. On any other basis, I assure you, it is far from me to desire this or any other position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeorge A. Snider.\nOttawa, July 26, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant in reference to your re-engagement as teacher of the Moraviantown Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in official letter of May 4th, last, you were advised that your services would be continued at the rate of $500.00 per annum. Subsequent to this re-engagement very adverse reports upon your work were received by the Department and you were informed in letter of May 26th, last, that, unless the next report shows a decided improvement in reference to discipline and classroom work, the question of making a change would have to be considered. Your retention, therefore, in the position of teacher of the Moraviantown Indian school will be dependent upon the reports received on your work during the next term. Whether you remain there the whole year or not depends, therefore, upon yourself. If you now consider it in our best interests to resign your resignation will be accepted and as little time as possible should be lost in definitely notifying the Department of your decision.\n\nWith regard to the holidays I may say that, as you have already been informed, the school must be re-opened not later than the third Monday in August.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeorge A. Snider, Esq.,\nNapanee, Ont.\nSecretary.\nIndian Affairs.\n\nSir,\n\nI received Official Letter of the 26th inst., in reply I beg to notify the Department of Indian Affairs that it is my intention to return to the position of teacher at the Moravian Town Indian School for the next term.\n\nI shall begin school on the 15th of August as you request.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGeorge A. Smider\nOttawa, November 29, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI regret to have to inform you that the report recently received from the Public School Inspector on your work at the Moraviantown school shows that little or no progress whatever is being made and it has been decided, in the interests of education on the reserve, to dispense with your services.

I would also ask you to advise the Department as to whether suitable board for a single teacher can be obtained and, if so, at what distance from the school and at what rate. If the services of a married teacher can be secured is there a house available either on or off the reserve, at what distance from the school and what rental would be expected.

T. E. Egerton Shore, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, Toronto, forwarded to the Department correspondence he had with you in reference to a vacancy which then existed as teacher of the Scotch Settlement Indian School. That vacancy was filled by the appointment of a lady teacher, but this Department will have a vacancy in the school conducted on the Moraviantown Indian Reserve, Kent County, Ontario, on April 1st, next. A residence for the teacher is not provided, but accommodation can be had at a distance of 14 miles from the school in a dwelling occupied by the present teacher, who is a married man. At this school the Department would pay an initial salary of $500.00 per annum and would like to know whether you are in a position to consider taking this appointment.

McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuart, Ont.\nHighgate Dec. 29, 1910.\n\nEx'd\n\nNot having received blank forms for school report for December quarter as yet, I am writing this informal letter to the Department of Indian Affairs. I received official letter of the 24th ultimo. I appreciate the willingness of the Department to extend the time limit of my stay here, notwithstanding the evident determination of the Inspector of Public Schools, to oust me from my present position forthwith.\n\nI have enjoyed considerably my past year's work in the school here. I have been able to gain a firmer grasp of the situation, a better knowledge of the needs of the work, and a more thorough understanding of the people, their customs, manner and ways, etc., etc. The results achieved among the school children have been...\nI think even more satisfactory than during the preceding year. I think that the degree of sympathy with the school work, manifested by the Indian people, has been considerably increased. I think that without exception, I have the affection, confidence, and respect of my pupils.\n\nAs to the report of the Public School Inspector for West Kent, to which reference is made in official letter above-mentioned, I beg to repeat that which was stated in my former letter; that the Inspector's marked change of attitude towards my work, as well as his two later deleterious reports thereon, are due to considerations which have no bearing whatever upon teaching, teaching ability nor school work.\nAnd I think that the facts at my disposal are sufficient to warrant me in coming to this conclusion.\n\nIt is not my purpose to lay claim to exceptional ability as a teacher. Nevertheless, in addition to the facts, as already stated in my former letter, I beg to say, that previously to any reports, favorable or unfavorable, issued by the Inspector of West Kent; five competent Inspectors of Public Schools in the Dominion of Canada, had made inspections of my work as a teacher and all reported favorably. Three of them are college graduates (with degrees), and teachers of experience in both public and high school work.\n\nThe cause underlying these schemes and intrigues to wrest from me my present means of making a livelihood, is simply\na matter of religious prejudice, or misguided religious zeal. The fact is that the standpoint from which I view religious truth, is one that is distasteful to the authorities on religion in these parts, of whom the Inspector of schools is one.\n\nMy attitude in these matters is this. My faith, worship, and service are toward God. But I am not a believer in, nor a worshipper of the \"ism\" that prevails throughout the land, which has become to some, the Diana of the Ephesians, declared in ancient days to be so \"great.\" Acts 19:26, 27, 28.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nGeorge A.

I shall be pleased to forward copies of testimonials if you so desire.\n\nWishing you the season's completest,\n\nI am, Sir,\nYours very respectfully,\nJ. H. H.

The present teacher at Moraviantown is a married man and pays a rental of $4.00 per month. The Department has written for further particulars and will be glad to advise you when this information is received.\n\nSatisfactory work in Indian schools is always appreciated by the Department and every encouragement possible is given to teachers.\n\nThe salaries paid are not graded. In the case of the Moraviantown school a salary of $500.00 is allowed. This salary compares favourably with that paid in the best rural schools in the province of Ontario.\n\nThe Department will be prepared to engage you as teacher of this school from April 1st to June 30th, next. During these three months you would have an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the work and would then be in a position to decide as to whether you would care to continue at this school, provided conditions are acceptable and your services during that period satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Shider, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nHighgate, Ont.\nOttawa, March 3, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nSometime ago the Department advertised for a teacher for the Moraviantown Indian School, but no applications were received. It has been decided, therefore, to continue Mr. Snider's services till the end of June, in the meantime the Department would like to have a full report from you in regard to his work in the school and on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuart, Ont.\nHighgate, Mar. 9th 1911.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa:\n\nSir:\n\nI received official letter of the 28th ultimo. Thank you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeorge A. Snider\nSir,\n\nI beg to add another to the list of informal letters already forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs relative to the work here in connection with the school. I am not writing this to give occasion of annoyance to the Department, but rather to avoid further unnecessary annoyance.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6146, File 413-1, part 1)\nIt will be remembered that a requisition was sent in to the Department some time ago, asking for ink-wells for the school here. Specifications were given as to diameter at the larger extremity. When the ink-wells arrived, none of them would fit. All were too large. It was decided, that to avoid further delay, it would be better to have the apertures in the desks enlarged.\n\nAccordingly an Indian carpenter was engaged to do the work. He\ngained access to the school room, on a Saturday, soon afterwards, secured the ink-wells, took them home with him, and then reported to his chief that he had no instrument with which to do the work. Efforts have been made by both the Indian Agent, and the Chief of the tribe, to secure an instrument for this work, but without success as yet. So that the work of the school is being conducted, as formerly.\nindependently, as far as ink-wells, or the authorized copy-books are concerned.\n\nLet it not be supposed by the Department of Indian Affairs that the exercise of writing has been neglected in the school because of this. Writing is, in my judgment, but a medium of expression, as is language. So that, in the teaching of writing, I give my children something to write, and they write it. The method in detail, as far as it...\ncan be given here, is something like this:\n\nA \"story\", of some three, four, or more links, is \"built up\"; the pupils of the class furnishing the material, which the teacher writes on the blackboard, as each child gives it to him. The whole story is then read aloud by the class, sometimes individually, and sometimes in unison.\n\nIt is then erased from the black-\nboard, and the pupils are simply told to \"write it;\" which they generally do, with an approach to accuracy, which is often quite remarkable. The pupils receive commendation for doing so well. The \"story\" is then re-written by the teacher for the pupils to write, and re-write until the work is accurately done.\n\nIn favor of copy-books it may be said that they are additional aids to the correct formation of individual\nletters; whereas against them it may be charged that they contribute somewhat to the formation of the habit of tracing rather than writing.\n\nI enclose a few samples of work done in pencil by pupils from 7 to 10 years old, who but a few months ago could not write a letter nor read a word. I might say, as a postscript, that the subjects chosen in the beginning are always\nthose with which the children are most familiar, and in which they are most interested, as \"cat\", \"candy\", \"bird\", \"mouse\", \"play\", etc., etc., etc.\n\nOur chief barriers to progress are irregularity, and prejudice, about which I may write later.\n\nI remain, sincerely,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nGeorge A.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe King's Printer,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 17, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the report recently received from you on the Moraviantown Indian school I beg to say that the Department endeavored to obtain the services of a properly qualified teacher for this school at Easter, but there was no response to the advertisement, which was inserted in the Toronto Daily Globe. Mr. Snider has been informed that his services will not be required after the end of this quarter and another advertisement is being placed in the paper. I should be glad to know whether you are aware of any person who would be willing to take charge of this school at a salary of $500.00 per annum. Any assistance that you can give the Department in obtaining a teacher will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. G. Colles, Esq.,\nPublic School Inspector,\n31 Wade St.,\nChatham, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6146, File 413-1, part 1)\nAs intimated in my former letter, I am writing to enumerate a few of the difficulties to be met with in connection with the school work here at Moravian town. Of course the chief obstacle to progress is irregularity in attendance. This is a weakness which might be said to characterize all the phases of Indian life.\n\nBut there are a few who have ventured sufficient confidence in the teacher, to give expression to their candid and sincere reasons for not sending their children regularly to the school. A few of the objections, as they have been given to me, are these.\n\nIt is claimed that the \"best-educated\" Indians are the laziest ones; that the \"biggest rogues\" among them have been...\nhighly favored in the way of educational advantages; and that the children who study much come to think more of books than of toil.\n\nTheir girls are increasingly irregular after they reach the third book, Standard four. They either \"hire out,\" or stay at home to \"keep house\" for their mothers. They, with the latter, also assist in the putting in of the crops.\n\nA man living just across the road from the school building has three children of school age. They are all quite clever. He seldom sends them to school for more than half a day at a time. They are kept at home for periods of from one to three weeks. They can be seen daily playing in their own yard just in front of the school building, while the other Indian...\nchildren sit at their tasks in school. Sometimes they are all three taken with their father to the field when he goes to work, which is generally about nine or ten o'clock A.M., and two P.M.\n\nHis argument is this. 'He lost his best child through sending him to school, and he is going to save the lives of the rest if he can.' It seems that their eldest, a boy of eleven, died, some three or four years ago. It is said that the Doctor claimed, that his sickness was due to over-study at school. It is said that the boy was proficient in music, as well as in school work. They are very affectionate towards their children. The father teaches them vocal and instrumental music at home.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeorge A. Smith\n\nMoravian Town, Ont.\nChatham, Ont., May 20th 1911.\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 17th instant I beg to say that I do not at present know of a professionally qualified teacher who would engage to teach the Moravian School at $500.00.\n\n(1) The location of the school is a mile or more from the residence of any white family whose board could be obtained and is therefore not suitable for any except a male teacher.\n\n(2) As the minimum salary for a Class teacher in this county is $500 there is no inducement to take the Moravian School.\n\nI think I could get a capable and ambitious young man who has had model school training and III Class certificate. I shall make inquiries and if he be...\nChatham, Ont.,\n\nI shall have him make an application. His brother teaches in our free schools and is a rousing good man. His name is Pengelley.\n\nI shall let you know if I can get the brother.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H.G. Colles.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Then I would be able to\nmake some preparation for my work\nnext fall.\n\nAwaiting your reply I am,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIsaac Brock Pengelly.\nSir,\n\nYour favor of the 5th Inst. to hand. On receiving same, I acknowledged it at once, by wire, stating I should be pleased to accept the position as teacher of the Moravian town Indian School.\n\nAlso I had a letter from Mr. Collie a few days ago telling me of the vacancy. In answering his letter I said I thought there was little use in applying for the school, as I expected to go to Peterboro Normal next fall. But with my past experience, teaching on my Model School Certificate, I feel quite competent to accept the position.\n\nConcerning my character and\nOttawa, June 13, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant confirming the telegram forwarded by you on the same date in which you accept the position of teacher of the Moraviantown Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased that you are undertaking this work and trusts that you will be quite successful.\n\nThere is a splendid field on this reserve for an energetic teacher. A new modern building has been erected and all the conditions are favourable. The work differs little from that in the ordinary rural public school in Ontario, but a teacher requires special tact in dealing with Indian pupils and Indian parents. One of the most common obstacles to success is the apathy of the parents and the consequent irregularity of attendance by the pupils and the experience of the Department shows that this can only be overcome by the personal efforts of the teacher.\n\nI may say that the Department has no special directions to give you, but would be very pleased to afford you every assistance possible after you commence your duties and I shall be glad to have short monthly reports from you on your work. The Indian Agent, Mr. A. R. McDonald, who will visit the school monthly, will be informed of your appointment and also asked to afford you any help that he can.\n\nI. B. Pengelly, Esq.,\nBailleboro, Ont.\nThe Department would like to conduct in connection with this school next summer a garden and I would ask you to take this matter up with Mr. McDonald after the holidays in order that the necessary preparation of the ground may be made this fall. It is thought that a good garden at this school would be an object lesson to the parents on the reserve as well as prove of interest to the children themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, June 13, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Mr. I. B. Pengelly has been appointed teacher of the Moraviantown Indian School, his duties to commence after the summer holidays, and I have to ask you to be good enough to give him every assistance in your power.\n\nThe Department wishes to take up promptly after the summer holidays the matter of the preparation of a portion of the school grounds for gardening purposes and would like to have a report from you in the meantime as to what would be necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

When I taught before I was brought in touch with the Indians; having one in my school, also. He got along very well, his attendance being quite regular, but in their own school at Alderville I was informed that it was poor.\n\nI feel sure I shall like the work and with proper support should make a good showing. My aim will be to turn in a better report each successive month and trust my work shall be rewarded.\n\nAs to the garden in connection with the school I think it a very good idea and shall be pleased to take up the matter with Mr. McDonald. I intend writing him at\nonce he has not doubt been\ninformed of my appointment before this.\n\nyour respectfully\n\nD. Bengelay.\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find Quarterly School Return for Moravian Town School and also Requisition Sheet for same.\n\nAs no agent has yet been appointed in place of the late A.R. McDonald I deem it my duty to forward these myself. Quite a number of articles are required for the school but our supplies seem to have had rough usage. Anything I have ordered quite necessary, the First and Second Readers being in a hopeless state.\n\nRegarding standing of pupils in classes it is not what it should be. Children enrolled in Third and Fourth Classes cannot do Addition and Subtraction with accuracy, at alone speed. Most of children are bright and their standing should be better than what I found it on coming to the school. I trust if I remain here I can make a marked change but it will\nTake some little time.\n\nAs to the building, I like it very well but blackboards are rather thin and I would like more space. Most of the basement windows are broken and nearly all door-locks damaged. For a new building such should not be the case. Had I the materials I could soon put things in shape myself.\n\nThe grounds are fine and could be made quite attractive. Still I cannot say things are as I expected to find them. I had hard work to get a boarding house and when I did could not get nearer than 1 mile from the school. Then I only have the promise of board till Christmas and people around here seem to be too independent or have too much work. I am paying $3.00 per week now and if they keep me on after Christmas they want $3.50 or over.\n\nI like the work very well but unless I get more than $500 per annum it would not be worth while staying here owing to existing circumstances and travelling and other necessary expenses. If the Department\nsee its way clear to pay me at the rate of $60.00 per month omitting July and August I'll take the school on.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon and to receive a cheque.\n\nI remain\n\nyours respectfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Please forward Requisition Blanks\nOttawa, October 3, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo and also a requisition for school supplies, and in reply I beg to say that the stationery asked for will be ordered from the Government Stationery Office and you may purchase the slates, towels, soap, combs and looking glass.\n\nThe cheque for the salary due you at the rate of $500.00 per annum will be forwarded.\n\nWith regard to your salary I may say that, in view of the fact that you are not the holder of a permanent certificate, the Department is not prepared at the present time to increase your salary from $500.00 to $600.00 per annum. At a later date, however, should your services prove satisfactory and should you wish to remain in charge of this school the matter of granting you an increase will be considered.\n\nWith regard to the broken windows I may say that you may arrange with the Chief to have these replaced and the Department will pay the account. You may also have the door locks repaired if this is possible, if not new ones should be purchased, and the accounts forwarded.\n\nIn regard to the blackboard space I would ask you to be good enough to state definitely the dimensions of the board which you consider necessary and an order for\n\nI.

Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nYours of the 3rd Inst received. Also cheque for \u00a34 3s in which I feel a mistake has been made. Formerly when schools opened the 3rd Monday in August there may have been 216 teaching days in the year but they did not open till September this year. Therefore as I understand on fairly reliable authority there are only 200 teaching days in this year, I should not have been paid at the former rate. This error can easily be rectified later on. I hope it is customary to pay monthly as that is the way I wish to be paid.\n\nIn a previous letter you asked for a monthly report. Have you special blank forms for such, or shall I make out a report myself?\n\nRegarding broken windows, lock rep...\nEtc., I'll have all attended to as you suggest, and later on will send in size of blackboard required. For the present I can get on as things are.\n\nAs to raise in salary I am willing to teach till Xmas at present, but there is another matter I would like to draw your attention to. Were it possible to combine the office of Indian Agent with that of teacher, it would make it worth while remaining here. I do not see why it could not be managed if no appointment has yet been made. I could be here all the time and could look after the affairs as well, or perhaps better than someone living at a distance. I would devote all my time to the work and with a permanent teacher better results would be attained.\n\nEnclosed please find application for position as Indian agent.\n\nI am very respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Pengelley has already expressed his dissatisfaction with the amount of salary received, owing largely to the fact that he is charged a high price for his board and has to walk over a mile from his boarding house. The first report of the Public School Inspector, which is most commendatory, has just come to hand. In this report the Inspector states that we cannot expect to retain Mr. Pengelley's services after Christmas unless we increase his salary to $600.00 per annum. Mr. Pengelley has not a permanent professional certificate, but he has a non-professional certificate and also had a course in the model school. He was appointed on the recommendation of the Public School Inspector. The salary at present received by him is the largest paid in the province of Ontario, but as from all the information we\nhave on hand it would appear desirable to, if at all possible, retain Mr. Pengelley's services, I would recommend that his salary be increased to $600.00 per annum, $500.00 to be paid, as at present, from the band funds and the remainder from the school vote.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

J.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, requesting payment of your salary as teacher of the Moraviantown school for October last, as well as payment of an account of $2.03 for supplies purchased by you for this school.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that a cheque for $75.00 being an advance on account of your salary for the current quarter together with the cheque covering the amount of your account for supplies, is being sent you. As you were informed by official letter of October 13th last the Department does not pay teachers salaries monthly. The salaries of all teachers are paid only at the end of each quarter upon receipt of quarterly returns. When your return for the December quarter is received the balance of salary due will be paid.\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter in which you request an increase in your salary, I beg to inform you that this will be dealt with in a separate communication. The envelopes asked for have been sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nI.B. Pengelley, Esq.\nTeacher\nHighgate P.O.\nOnt\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nExtract of letter received from I.B. Pengelley, teacher at Highgate, Ont. dated December 9th, 1911. Original on file 151868-3.\n\nI may as well mention also that I could not think of staying on here after the New Year for any less than Sixty Dollars per month ($60.00). The work in the school is becoming heavier and I consider it worth far more to teach an Indian school where the work is so up hill than to teach in the average white school. One has far more to contend with.\n\nFor the past three weeks the attendance has not gone below thirty-six, and has been as high as forty seven. It is becoming better all the time and the tone of the whole school has improved. The children are taking more interest in their work and the parents seem to be sending them out better. But I keep the Truant Officer moving and that may have something to do with it.\n\nI remain\n\nYours respectfully\n\n(Sgd.) I B. Pengelley.\nOttawa, December 19, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 9th instant and also previous correspondence in which you ask for an increase in salary to $600.00 as teacher of the Moraviantown Indian School I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot comply with your request. If you have definitely decided to discontinue your work on this reserve unless upon the condition that you receive the increase asked for I would ask you to send in your formal resignation by return mail in order that the Department may take steps to secure the services of a successor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nI. B. Pengelley, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nMoraviantown Indian School,\nHighgate, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nCheques for $75.00 advance on Dec. 21st salary and $253 supplies for school received with thanks.\n\nReports are both made out and being forwarded at once; also Requisition Slips. I trust you may find all quite satisfactory.\n\nAs to staying on in the school, I have mentioned before that I desire a raise in salary. I cannot remain here till next summer for less than $60.00 per month $180.00 being paid the term ending March 31st and $180.00 the term ending June 30th. If raise is not forthcoming I shall feel at liberty to leave at any time. There are more congenial places than this and the present salary alone is no inducement in itself to keep me on. I could do better elsewhere.\nSo there are 59 teaching days in the quarter and 200 teaching days in the year.\n\nAmt. due for quarter = \\(\\frac{59}{200} \\times \\$500 = \\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{295}{2} = \\$147.50\n\\]\n\nDeficit for Sept. Quarter: \\(352\\)\n\nTotal Amt. due: \\(\\$51.02\\)\n\nReceived Cheque: \\(\u00a375.00\\)\n\nBalance due: \\(\u00a376.02\\)\n\nI remain very respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Janitor desired me to ask Dept. to have balance due for his rent beginning of year. The work has not been satisfactory but he claims he is only paid for sweeping every other day and scrubbing in the summer vacation. Unless there is an improvement brought about in some way I should advise a change if a more suitable one could be had.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, December 28, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nOn the 19th instant the Department wrote informing you that it could not increase your salary as teacher of the Moraviantown Indian School. Your letter of the 22nd instant has just been received and I would ask you to state whether the Department is to take the last paragraph of your letter as a final decision not to return to Moraviantown.\n\nA cheque for the amount due for the December quarter is being sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nI. B. Pengelley, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nBailleboro, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nYours of the 28th Inst. to hand, also cheque for Seventy-Six \u2014\u2014 $60. Dollars for which accept thanks.\n\nIn reply, I have decided to return to Moravia town and assume my duties there. I was offered a school here since coming home but did not feel justified in leaving the Reserve on such short notice.\n\nBut as travelling expenses run up so rapidly I have decided not to return home again till summer so will remain here till the end of the New Year week. School will re-open Monday Jan. 8th. This will give me three more holidays which I will make up by teaching during the Easter week.\n\nThis in no way should interfere with the school work and should prove\nsatisfactory to the Department. I am also sending a notice to the Mohawk town P.O. and also to the Chief.\n\nI remain very respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The arrangement whereby you will open the school on the 8th instant and make up for the lost time during the Easter holidays is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nI. B. Pengelley, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nBaillieboro, Ont.\nSir,\n\nThe teacher for the Moravian School request an increase of salary so that it be increased to six hundred dollars per annum. Enclose the resolution of the Moravian Council endorsing the same.\n\nI would recommend that the increase be granted as Mr. Peggelly is an exceptionally able teacher for an Indian School and is well recommended by the Inspector.\n\nIt is important that Mr. Peggelly be retained as he has the confidence of the School and also the Indians, and has the knack of bringing the children along.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEdwin Beatty\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs.

That the teacher's salary be increased to six hundred dollars per annum from the date of January 1912.\n\nCarried.\n\nAlbert Stone,\nSecretary.\n\nMarch 6th 1912\nSir,\n\nI am requested by the General Division Council for a statement from the Dept. as to the terms of the agreement under which the Band held the old school grounds consisting they state of two acres.\n\nIt is stated that Peter Hill, deceased, granted the land for school purposes and when not used for school purposes to revert to him.\n\nAs School is now placed on another plot the heirs are now claiming the two acres.\n\nKindly let us know promptly.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nEdwin Beattie\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6146, File 413-1, part 1)\nMr. Pedley,\n\nOn November 14th, last, a recommendation was made to you by the Superintendent of Indian Education that the salary of Mr. Pengelley, teacher of the Moraviantown Indian School, be increased from $500.00 to $600.00 per annum. Mr. Pengelley's application was not approved at that time. In a recent communication he states that he must again ask for an increase and you will find herewith a letter from the Agent, Mr. Beattie, enclosing a resolution from the Moreviantown Council that the teacher's salary be increased to $600.00.\n\nIn the previous memorandum reference was made to the very favourable reports of the Public School Inspector. Mr. McKay has just returned from a visit to this reserve and he states that there is marked improvement in the school generally. The enrolment has reached 95 per cent of the children of school age on the reserve, with an average attendance of 57 per cent. Mr. Pengelley is popular with the parents and pupils, which is a great consideration, as popular and efficient teachers for Indian\nIndian schools are rare. It would be greatly to the advantage of the school to retain his services, which can only be done by paying him a liberal salary. Conditions are such on the reserve that Mr. Pengelley has to walk a mile and a half to the nearest white farmer's home, where he obtains his board. The former teacher, who proved himself a failure after two years trial, received the same amount as Mr. Pengelley.\n\nThe Moravians appreciate Mr. Pengelley's services and can well afford to pay the increased salary. In view of their resolution and the excellent results obtained as shown by the reports received I would again recommend that he be paid at the rate of $600.00 per annum from the first of the present year. It is so seldom that an Indian Band makes a recommendation of this kind that the Department would do well to give its approval when it would be justified in doing so, as in the present case.\n\nOn referring to the last report of the Minister of Education for the Province of Ontario I find that the highest salary paid to male teachers in the rural schools in the County of Kent was $1000.00, female teachers $600.00 and the average for the 140 teachers in the rural schools of that county was $548.00. Conditions in an Indian school are not very congenial and the only way to offset the disadvantage is by offering a substantial salary to a deserving teacher.\nIndian Agent's Office,\n\nMarch 27, 1912\n\n400461\n\nSir,\n\nAs the question for Mr. Penzley's salary for school teacher for the Reserve of the Shawnee will be made out in a few days, I have to ask the Department what is their decision in regard to the matter asked for by Mr. Penzley and endorsed by the Indian Council.\n\nAs the resolution stated the salary &c. from the first of the year, we would be in a position to make out pay-list for teachers' salary in accordance with your decision.\n\nI may add, kindly give Mr. Penzley our very kindest consideration.\n\nYours Res.,\nEdwin Beattie\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 30, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the resolution of the Council increasing the salary of Mr. Pengelley, teacher of the Moraviantown Indian School, to $600.00 per annum from the 1st of January last, is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nEdwin Beattie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nHighgate P.O.\nApr 4th/2\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince making out my report I have received word from home necessitating my plans for the holiday being changed. I have to go home at once. Though I advised the department to send my cheque to Cedar Springs I trust this reaches you in time to have it forwarded to my home address. As the Agent informed me today that the raise was granted me, salary due will be $63 x 6 = $189.00\n\nI am very respectfully yours,\n\nJ.B. Pengelley\n\nHome Address:\nJ.B. Pengelley\nBaileboro\nOnt.\n\nP.S. I'll be leaving home April 12 for Moraviantown.\nOttawa, April 15, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, and in reply I beg to say that before the receipt of the same by the Department the cheque for the salary due you for the March quarter had been forwarded to Cedar Springs, as previously directed. I regret that your letter did not arrive in time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nI. B. Pengelly, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nHighgate P.O., Ont.\nHighgate, Ont.\nApr 15/12\n\nSecretary Dept Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn returning to the Reserve from home, I came around through Cedar Springs Saturday Apr 13th and received the cheque for $89. As I shall be unable to get to town before Saturday 20th it will be impossible to present cheque at bank before that date.\n\nIt was a source of great pleasure to me on entering the school this morning to find the appearance of the place transformed. The change of janitor is the cause and I feel sure that the school will be properly cared for now.\n\nAs to gardening I hope to make a start at once and should like to know...\nTo whom I should look for seeds etc., last year a spade, hoe, and rake were purchased for the school. The hoe and rake are on hand but I've been unable to locate the spade. It was missing when I came to the school. I suppose I should look to the Agent for a new one, and for anything else I may find necessary.\n\nI remain very respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

My plans might have been changed.\n\nBut now I give my final decision not to return after the summer vacation. To stay here and teach without better qualifications would always be against me in regard to a raise of salary. Also it would bar me out elsewhere.

Although the nomination for the position of teacher for this school has not always in the past been made by the Church, the Department desires to offer you the privilege in this case. It will be necessary to obtain a thoroughly qualified teacher and for such a salary of $500.00 per annum will be allowed. The salary will depend upon the qualifications.

I wrote on both Junior Matriculation and Junior Teachers certificate at the same examination. I failed to make the required amount on the total to give me Junior Teachers standing and those subjects that are cancelled on the Matriculation paper are recorded in the Junior Teachers' paper and this I have mislaid and so could not forward it to you also. However I was given Junior Matriculation standing and began university work. The second certificate records those subjects I took in Fourth Form before beginning work at Queen's University.\n\nI would rather take the school at Moraviantown as it is nearer my home for one reason. The other reason is, that I believe it is an established centre for anyone writing Queen's examinations elsewhere than at Kingston. I have been doing work extra-murally this year and would like to write on the papers this fall on which I have been working all summer, and so you see why I would like to get such a school as Moraviantown.

Ostrander, Picton, and Mr. A. Beith Gardiner, of Thamesville.\n\nThe certificates of Miss Ostrander accompany her application, but as you will note by Mr. Gardiner's letter, it will be necessary for him to secure a permit. For that reason, and for the further reason that Mr. Gardiner's home is within easy reach of the Reserve, and therefore his time and influence will not likely be so completely given up to the children of the school, I am placing Miss Ostrander first in my recommendation for the position, but have no hesitation in endorsing the applications of either one.\n\nThese are all the applications for Moraviantown which we have received in answer to advertisements.\n\nAwaiting your decision in the matter,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nJHA-VS\n\nJ.

Keith Gardiner, of Thamesville, for the position as teacher of the Moraviantown School.\n\nIn the interests of discipline and owing to the fact that the boarding house is situated at some considerable distance from the School, the Department considers that a male teacher could give better service. But, as neither of these applicants has any professional training, the Department is of the opinion that a salary of $500.00 is reasonable, and is not prepared to give more. If this is satisfactory you may notify Mr. Gardiner of his appointment and then advise the Department.\n\nWith regard to Miss Ostrander, could she not be sent to the Chawong School, where living conditions are more favourable. I should be pleased to hear from you in regard to this suggestion.\n\nIn conclusion I would add that it is not necessary to have any permit to teach in an Indian School, as this is a matter which lies wholly within the jurisdiction of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In order to have school opened on time, we close to the end of the holidays wrote you that if the school or your agent had not secured a teacher, I could secure the teacher.

A school of 60 pupils (there are 65 on the Reservation) requires a trained teacher with experience. The Agent could advertise when a teacher is needed and secure the best available instead of hiring an untrained and inexperienced youth with no record but that of being unsuccessful in his academic examinations.\n\nThis school could be made to afford a great opportunity for the improvement of the Indians themselves as well as their children. Elementary agricultural teaching, with experimental plots and garden should be provided. We should have as teacher a man who has had some instruction at the Ontario Agricultural College at Guelph and he should teach the principles of Agriculture, which the Indians are greatly in need of. There is ample ground in and around the school lot that could be used for that purpose.\n\nI am strongly of the opinion that the truant officer has become careless as to his duty.

COLIES ON THE MORAVIAINTOWN SCHOOL.\n\nTeacher,- George Gillard.\n\nMr. Gillard's \"success\" is hard to estimate. Out of 64 eligible pupils, a mere 11 choose to come to school. Mr. Gillard's own explanation is,- \"They say I'm only a kid and ain't got no influence over them.\n\nThe number of children of school age is large- 64- and the one opportunity to influence them for good and mould their characters is in providing a teacher with strong individuality and moral force.- a person of experience, maturity and sense of responsibility. But here we have an innocent harmless young man, whose personality and influence are nil, and instead of being able to hold the school together and impart some degree of enthusiasm to his pupils, he merely accepts such as choose to come and spends his time teaching them. Though a well meaning young man, Mr. Gillard is not the kind of teacher, who should be chosen for such a school. He does not appear to be taken seriously by the people on the reserve, though he does his best according to his light. The Inspector should be consulted in the selection of a teacher for this school. It will take a long time to overtake what the children are now losing, with 11 present and 53 absent. The school has retrograded since Mr. Gillard- since Mr. Gardiner left it.\n\nMr. Gillard probably does the best he can, but this school should be in charge of a man of a different type. No teacher of character and standing will teach such a school for $500.00 a year.\n\nDate of Inspection, -Feb. 12th, 1915.\nOttawa, February 25, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that, in view of the unsatisfactory manner in which Mr. Gillard is conducting the Moraviantown Indian School, as shown by a report lately received by the Department, it has been decided to dispense with his services on the 31st of March next and I have to request that you will be good enough to advise Mr. Gillard that his services will not be required after that date.

As the Methodist Church claim the privilege of nominating a teacher for this school, as you will see by their letter of the 22nd of October, last, is it your wish that they should be consulted? When Mr. Gardiner resigned at the end of the June quarter, last, the Methodist Church was consulted and failed to nominate a teacher up to the time of the appointment of Mr. Misner. Unless the nomination is left wholly in the hands of the Methodist Church I would suggest that Mr. Agent Beattie be given express instructions to consult the public school inspector. The Inspector claims that a man suitable for the position cannot be obtained for the salary now paid, $500.00\n$500.00, and if we can secure a qualified teacher the salary might be increased to $600.00. The band is paying the whole of the present salary.\n\nMartin Beavertail\nMarch 1st, 1915.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nYou will recollect that in November last, after considerable correspondence Mr. George Gillard was appointed teacher of the Moraviantown Indian School, being nominated by the local Indian Agent, Mr. Beattie.

The Inspector said the only thing he had against me was my certificate. I do not understand why he should not be satisfied with mine when a number of the former teachers had no certificate at all.

McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have just received a letter from Miss Isabell McTurk whose appointment to the Indian School at Moraviantown was made by the Department as per your letter of April 24th.\n\nShe states that she has received a letter from Mr. Gardiner, who, she says, is the present teacher in the school, informing her that he has been asked by the Indian Council and the Indian Agent there to stay another year at a salary of $650.00 for the year. I presume that Agent Beattie had not yet been definitely informed of Miss McTurk's Appointment and that he did not attempt to make a definite appointment, but merely negotiated with a view to securing Mr. Gardiner provided we would nominate him for the position, which we should have been quite pleased to do had we been informed in time that he was available. In any event however, the receipt of this letter from Mr. Gardiner by Miss McTurk is rather embarrassing to her, and I trust that the Department will at once make it quite clear to the Indian Agent at Moraviantown that Miss McTurk's appointment has been definitely made and may be considered final. I am sure you will recognize how essential it is that the Indian Agent should at once make it quite clear to the Council that the question is a closed one and that he also should do his best to make the entrance of Miss McTurk to her new duties as easy as possible for her. It still remains a mystery to us how Mr. Gardiner happens to be in the school at the present time. We believed that the present teacher was a Mr. Gillard.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 151868 of April 24th\n\nState the Indian Council prefer to retain Mr. Bilt Gardner's Services for one year at a salary of $650.00\n\nThis work a man should teach this school. That is my opinion as it is also of the Inspector to whom I was talking yesterday.\n\nYou might let me know if you will or are in a position to accept Mr. Gardner's Services.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss McTurk, who is a nominee of the Methodist Missionary Society, having accepted the Department's offer, her engagement must stand and you will be good enough to inform Mr. Gardiner and the Indian Council accordingly. You will be good enough to advise the Department of your having carried out these instructions.\n\nIf Mr. Gardiner is anxious to continue teaching in an Indian school I would suggest that he make application to Rev. Dr. Endicott, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, Toronto, as you were informed in official letter of the 13th of April, last. There are still some schools in Central Ontario conducted under the auspices of this society which will require new teachers after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo stating that you have received a letter from Miss Isabell McTurk, who was appointed by the Department to take charge of the Moraviantown Indian School after the summer holidays, in which she states that she has received a communication from Mr. Gardiner, the present teacher, stating that he has been asked by the Indian Agent and the Indian Council to remain on at a salary of $650.00 per annum.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Beattie was informed on the same date as you were written to accepting Miss McTurk as teacher of this school that her appointment was to take effect after the summer holidays. He was requested to do all in his power to assist her in carrying on the work of the school. Since the receipt of your letter Mr. Beattie has again been written to and told that Miss McTurk's appointment must stand and he has been instructed to inform the Indian Council and Mr. Gardiner accordingly. I trust that there will be no more trouble in regard to this matter, as Mr. Beattie must carry out the wishes of the Department in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nRev. James Endicott, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMissionary Society of the Methodist Church,\n33 Richmond St., West,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nChatham, Ont. June 2nd, 1915.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to submit for the consideration of your Department a special supplementary report upon the Indian school on the Moravian Reserve, Orford Township, Kent County.\n\nUpon the 1st instant, in company with Mr Abraham, Field Agent for the Department, I visited this school and Reserve for the purpose of starting a School Garden and arranging for teaching and experiments in Elementary Agriculture and Horticulture.\n\nThe Forenoon was spent in the School where addresses were made to the Pupils by Mr Abraham and by me, and in the school ground, where the location of the garden was discussed and plans proposed.\n\nIn the afternoon we made special observations of the agricultural conditions on the Reserve in order to learn what are the needs of these people and how best their condition can be improved.\n\nI was glad to observe that the chief recommendations in my former report have been carried out and that there are radical changes for the better in the school, proportionate I judge to the increase in the attendance from 11 to 58, the number present on that day.\n\nThe teacher Mr A Beith Gardiner has the confidence of the Indian people and the children are getting the benefit of the school instead of lying about home as they did under some of the former teachers. Mr Gardiner is much interested in the work and would like to\ncontinue for another year, but I am informed that a lady has been engaged to take the school after midsummer, and I would say that unless she be very much better than the average she will not be able to keep this school together as it is now. And unless she have special training in Agriculture she will not be able to carry out the work which we are now starting by means of a school garden, and which the children are quite eager to take up. Where you have an Inspector that takes a lively interest in the school I think he ought to be consulted as to the teacher who shall be employed.\n\nOur observations outside the school lead me to suggest that the Government be asked to construct main drains to which tile drains can be run through the farms, as most of the land is \"sour\" and will never yield profitable crops until it is tile drained.\n\nSecondly that say four teams of horses be furnished by the Department, to be used in turn, under the direction of the Indian Agent, as few of the Indians have horses of their own. Implements also would have to be lent in the same way for a while.\n\nThirdly a teacher's residence should be built near the school and a married man permanently engaged to teach the school and look after the school garden. There is great need to promote industry and better methods among these people, whereby they could well become self-supporting and even prosperous.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nSince writing you on the 5th instant the Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Public School Inspector Colles, Chatham, Ont., submitting a supplementary report upon the Indian school on the Moraviantown Reserve. In this report Mr. Colles states that Mr. A. Beith Gardiner, the present teacher, has the confidence of the Indian people and the children are getting the benefit of the school instead of lying about at home, as they did under some of the former teachers. Mr. Gardiner is much interested in his work and would like to remain on for another year and Mr. Colles states that it would be advantageous to allow him to do so, as he doubts if a lady teacher without special training would be able to carry out the work which the Department is undertaking by means of the school gardens which the children are quite eager to take up. I may add that the Indian council have also requested that Mr. Gardiner's services be retained. The Department considers that it would be to the advantage of all concerned if he were allowed to remain on.\n\nMr. Agent Beattie was, as you have already been informed, told that Miss McTurk was to be placed in charge of this school after the summer holidays.

L. Leeson as teacher of this school, at a salary of five hundred dollars ($500) per annum. This is $100 less than my latest information led me to believe the previous teacher was receiving from the Department. Without giving any assurance that the amount would be the same I, of course, informed Mr. Leeson that the salary now being paid was $600. I further understood that the Local Council had paid Mr. Gardiner an additional $100 per annum on account of special instruction in agriculture which was carried on in connection with the school, and intended to take up the question of the possible continuance of this grant on behalf of Mr. Leeson.\n\nWith the one exception of teaching experience I have every reason to believe that Mr. Leeson's qualifications are equal to those of the previous teacher. On this account I beg to express the hope that the Department's statement as to the reduction of the salary at this point is not final. Owing to the very great difficulty which has been experienced in securing a male teacher for this school, I hope that it\nwill be possible at least to make Mr. Leeson a conditional offer at the same rate of salary as that paid to the previous teacher. I would suggest that the lower figure apply only if he resigns from the position, or his services are found unsatisfactory within six months, but that in case of his continuance for the full year the rate of $600 should apply.\n\nI am today notifying Mr. Leeson of his appointment at a salary of $500, and on receipt of his reply will at once inform the Department as to whether he accepts the position at that figure.\n\nFor further explanation of this question, please refer to my letter of August 28th.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ.

Peattie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nNovember 16th, 1916.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will recall our correspondence touching the salary of the teacher, Mr. H. L. Leeson, at the Moravian-town Indian Day School. I negotiated with Mr. Leeson on the assumption that the salary paid would be the same as that received by the former teacher, namely $600. When word came from the Department that on account of the applicant's lack of experience the salary would be reduced to $500, Mr. Leeson hesitated about accepting the position. On further representations the Department agreed to engage him at a minimum rate of $500, and the assurance that if he rendered satisfactory service the question might again be raised of returning to the figure paid to the former teacher.\n\nSome time ago I met Mr. Leeson, who told me that the Inspector, W. H. G. Colles, had visited his school and expressed himself as well pleased with the results being attained. I do not know whether the report of Inspector Colles has yet reached the Department. If it should prove satisfactory I beg to express the hope that the Department will give favorable consideration to paying Mr. Leeson at the rate of $600 per annum. At the present scale of wages in almost every direction, I think we are particularly\nfortunate in securing the services of a young man of this type for one of our important Indian Day Schools, at what is after all a very reasonable rate of remuneration.\n\nIn this connection I beg to state that a note has come to hand from Mr. Leeson saying that he has received no salary to date after some two months of service. I had of course assumed that the amount earned in September would have been included in the third quarter of the year, and paid early in October.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esquire,\nAss't Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in regard to the salary of Mr. H. L. Leeson, the teacher of the Moraviantown Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has received a report from the Public School Inspector, Mr. Colles, on this school, which he visited about a week after Mr. Leeson took charge. In his report Mr. Colles states as follows:\u2014 \"Mr. Learn Leeson, Academic standing is Part I Honour Matriculation. Professional standing, none. Has had no professional training and no previous experience. Mr. Leeson is a bright, energetic young man and should become a capable teacher. Mr. Leeson's age is 19. This people should have a successful married man with experience of at least 5 years, and residing near the school, on the reservation.\"\n\nThe Department would not be justified in increasing Mr. Leeson's salary on this report, but, if, after the Inspector's next visit to the school, a favourable report is received, the question of increasing his salary will be taken up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

It is just possible however that these trespassers may do some damage to the property or may conduct themselves in such a way as to render themselves liable to an action for their conduct or for the damage done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAas.

He has looked after the interests of the section and we respectfully recommend him to any Board of Trustees as an energetic, progressive and conscientious teacher.\n\nWe also found him to be a young man of irreproachable character and one whose moral influence over his pupils is good.

Mathers, whose address is Blyth, Ontario, R. R. No. 1.\n\nIn addition to non-professional standing of the First Class, together with his Junior Matriculation, Mr. Mathers holds an interim Firstclass Public School teacher's certificate, and an interim Assistant High School certificate, both obtained at the Faculty of Education, Toronto, in 1916. Prior to taking professional training he had taught in public schools of North Wellington and West Huron for two years. During the past year he has been again engaged in successful public school work, concerning which testimonials are enclosed. He also submits for reference the names of the following:\n\nRobt. Galbraith, I.P.S. North Wellington,\nMount Forest, Ont.\n\nJ. M. Field, I.P.S. West Huron,\nGoderich, Ont.\n\nW. A. Clarke, M.P. North Wellington,\nPalmerston, Ont.\n\nI have had a personal interview with Mr. Mathers and very heartily recommend him for the position of teacher in the Indian School at Moraviantown. In accordance with the suggestion received from the Department last year, I beg to\noffer a suggestion in the matter of salary. In my experience we have not secured for one of our Ontario schools a male teacher with qualifications and experience equal to that of Mr. Mathers. Last year he received a salary of $650. He was asked to return and was promised a raise in salary, but resigned his position at the end of the year in order to enlist for overseas military service, but was rejected. He was naturally expecting to receive a salary of $700. I told him of the salary ($600) which had been paid in this school during the past years, and told him the circumstances of the Department as set forth in your letter to Mr. Leeson. He then agreed to submit his application subject to the matter of salary being satisfactorily adjusted. I beg to suggest that Mr. Mathers be appointed at a salary of $650, which I believe he will accept.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esquire,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 23rd, 1917.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th, instant, forwarding the application of Mr. Stephen J. Mathers for appointment as teacher of the Moraviantown day school.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the appointment of Mr. Mathers is approved and he will be allowed a salary of $650.00, a year. He should commence his duties at this school on September 5th.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev. J.H.

J.H. Arndt, Assistant Secretary Foreign Missions, Methodist Missionary Society, Mr. S.J. Mathers has appointed teacher at a salary of $650.00, a year.\n\nHe has been notified to begin duties on September 5th.\n\nIt is hoped that there will be a good attendance on the opening day of the new term and that this attendance will continue during the year. No doubt, you will put forth every effort to make the coming year, successful.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nE.

Four years of the seven were spent in one school near my home.\n\nI have always been successful with my entrance pupils. I had a class every year and had only one failure in the lot. One year there were five in the class.\n\nIf you fail to secure a teacher with qualifications I shall be much\nobliged if you will consider my application at $550.00, and secure a permit for me. I am a Protestant in religion.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\nMargaret Petty.\nOttawa, Aug. 31, 1917.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th instant in which you inform the Department that Mr. Thos. Jones has accepted another position and will not therefore assume duties as teacher of the Christian Island Day School, and recommending that Mr. Stephen Mathers, who was recently appointed as teacher at Moraviantown, be offered the position at Christian Island.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of Mr. Mathers being transferred to Christian Island at the same salary as was offered him at Moraviantown, namely $650 a year, and it is hoped that you will be able to have Mr. Mathers commence duties at Christian Island on, or as soon after, the 5th September next as possible.\n\nWith reference to securing the services of a teacher for Moraviantown I beg to say that the Department has had an application from Miss Margaret Petty, R.R. No. 1 Durham, Ont. for a position as teacher in an Indian School in the Parry Sound Agency, but having secured another teacher was unable to accept her services. She has 7 years experience, having taught 5 years on a Limited Third Class Certificate and 2 years on a permit, and in her application stated that she required a salary of $650 a year. Miss Petty is a Protestant. If you have no teacher in view for the Moraviantown School you might communicate with Miss Petty, and if you are satisfied with her qualifications you can appoint her to the position of teacher at the Moraviantown School at a salary of $600 per year. The Department will also write Miss Petty informing her of the vacancy at Moraviantown and requesting her to communicate with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAust.

The service of a teacher, however, is required for the Indian Day School at Moraviantown, which is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church. If you are still in the position to take up the work as teacher in an Indian School, you should communicate with Rev. J. H. Arnup, B. A., Methodist Missionary Society, Wesley Building, 229 Queen St., West, Toronto. Mr. Arnup is being informed of your application for the Ryerson School and that your services might be available at Moraviantown.

Beattie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR COLLIS ON THE MORAVIANTOWN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nNumber of pupils present........9\nNumber of children of school age...55\n\nThe school appears to be completely disorganized since the last term. The parents and the children need to be awakened to their duty and some compulsion should be used where truancy is persisted in. The Agent could bring this matter before the Council. I do not know that the present teacher has or exercises any influence whatever in the matter.\n\nThere should be a teacher's residence and a permanent teacher engaged if possible. A mature married man. There will no doubt be many qualified disabled returned soldiers after a while.\n\nThe school garden on the east side of the school outside has not been well attended during the summer. The vegetables were not thinned out in the spring, the result this year is disappointing and tends to discredit our teaching in this matter. The garden is unfenced from the rest of the field. It should be enclosed and should have a gate to and from the school.\n\nThere is lack of effective work by the truant officer.\n\nDate of Inspection,-October 13th, 1917.\nOttawa, October 23rd, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has just received a report from Inspector Colles, who inspected the Moraviantown school on the 10th instant, and this report shows that the attendance at this school is most unsatisfactory.\n\nThe truant officer should be instructed at once to use every means in his power to increase the attendance, in order that, when the new teacher takes charge, she will have an opportunity of properly organizing the classes. The Department will also expect you to assist the teacher in every possible way and at the next meeting of the Council, you should bring this matter to their attention and point out to the Indians the absolute necessity of their sending their children to school, regularly.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the school garden was not well attended to during the summer and, as a result, the yield is very disappointing. Kindly bring this matter to the teacher's attention so that the necessary arrangements may be made to avoid such a failure next year.\n\nIt is hoped that your interest in this matter will increase the attendance and the Department will expect a report from you on the steps you are taking to carry out these instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nE.

But we want to suggest that the manner of engaging teachers for the Board School is not satisfactory. We have a teacher who has taught weekly, started, then he was promoted to another field, and there may be a few days when the school will be closed until the new teacher gets here and succeeds in getting a place to board.\n\nAgain I wrote Mr. Armstrong of Toronto protesting against having a female teacher here. She will have to go one mile to two miles for a place to board.\n\nThis lady teacher coming will love a time exceedingly, owing to the conditions here.\n\nOct 29 1917\nSir,\n\nOwing to these conditions the Indians decided to prefer and state they want a male teacher.\n\nIt is impossible at this juncture to secure a teacher through Mr. Smith.\n\nThe teacher should be secured by the Inspector in person, with the agent.\n\nThe Collie Inspector tells me he can furnish a teacher and is willing to do so.\n\nIn fact the Collie wants to go to the expense of building a house for a female teacher.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the suggestion of some of his friends at Moraviantown, I wired to Mr. H. L. Leeson, who taught this school last year but was then in Manitoba. Just at that time Mr. Leeson arrived from the West rather unexpectedly and after some delay has consented to supply the school for the present at least.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. McGibbon, Inspector of Indian Agencies, had phoned me from Parry Sound, urging the early transfer of Mr. Mathers on account of the long vacancy which had already occurred at the Christian Island school. In view of this urgency and of the fact that only a temporary provision was involved, I took the responsibility of making provision to supply Mr. Mather's place at Moraviantown. This action is now reported in the hope that it will be satisfactory to the Department.\nMr. Leeson's engagement must be subject to the requirements of the Military Service Act. For most of the time since he came of military age Mr. Leeson was unable to enlist because of the effects of an accident. Although quite recovered from this he has recently been classified by the medical examiners as unfit for combatant service. This being the case, it is unlikely that he will be called in the near future, but in fairness to the young man and the Department, I thought this explanation was in order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJHA/M.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ.

He has replied to the effect that he is willing to accept the appointment later on at the terms offered, but would prefer to be free during the spring in order to do what he can to increase production on the Reserve. He further states that Miss Brodie is somewhat averse to taking Moraviantown, as it is not so convenient to her home, which she can now reach quite easily from Muncey every Friday night.\n\nI am advertising again. At best we must lose a few days at Moraviantown, but I beg to make the suggestion to the Department that if a suitable application is not received by the end of the present week Miss Brodie and Mr. McKenzie be both influenced by the Department to accept the proposed re-arrangement at once. If the situation could be covered even temporarily in this way it would enable us to take further steps toward securing a suitable supply, or\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nbetter still, a permanent appointment for Moraviantown School.

This is exactly the same rate as Mrs. Yarwood has been receiving in a school from which she was willing to transfer in order to re-enter the Indian Work.\n\nMy understanding with Mrs. Yarwood is that the present appointment is only for the balance of the school year in order that if possible the wish of the Department to secure a married man for this point may be carried out in time for the opening of the fall term.\n\nMrs. Yarwood is now ready to proceed to Moraviantown, and as the school has been closed all week I suggest that the reply of the Department should be addressed to me by telegram tomorrow.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJHA/M\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nP.S.

As stated that Department will pay her salary at the rate of $650.00 per annum. It is hoped that you will be successful in securing the services of a qualified teacher to take charge of this school after the summer holidays.\n\nIn reference to that portion of your letter of the 8th instant, in which you state that you wrote to Rev. O. W. McKenzie, B.A., at Oneida, suggesting that he should take charge of Oneida Day School No.3, in order that the present teacher, Miss Brodie, might be moved to Moraviantown, I beg to say that the Rev. Mr. McVitty, Principal of the Mount Elgin Institute, called at the Department recently, stated that, if Mr. McKenzie were placed in charge of the Oneida No. 3 School, he would take Miss Brodie to teach in his school. The Department would like to know whether Mr. McVitty is still willing to do this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Colles\non the Moraviantown Indian School dated May 31, 1918.\nOriginal on 151868/6.\n\nTeacher, - Mrs. Mary Louisa Yarwood\nQualifications,- III Class, expired 30 years ago, all traces vanished.\nExperience,- About 12 years, mostly in the remote past.\nAge,- I should judge 60 or more.\nCondition,- Vigorous for her years.\nSuccess,- Given time Mrs. Yarwood should be fairly efficient, especially if the children be compelled to attend school regularly. Truancy is the chief hindrance to progress, and changes of teachers is next.\n\nThe general management of the school is satisfactory. Mrs. Yarwood is an experienced teacher, but that experience has been carried down from a rather remote period and much has been lost, or forgotten on the way. Mrs. Yarwood promises to be more systematic in her work, and I believe she can and will do so.\n\nMrs. Yarwood has sensible ideas as to the condition of the school and premises, and as to what is required. The school garden is in good condition and is well planted, but the teaching of Elementary Agriculture should be more systematically taught. I am making an effort to have the teacher give more attention to this feature of the work.\n\nThe standing of the school is not as high as formerly, there being only 4 pupils in higher than I Form.\nExtract from report of Inspector W. H. G. Colls on the Moraviantown Indian School dated May 31, 1918.\n\nThe people and their children are indifferent to the advantages of an education. The children are kept home to work or allowed to absent themselves upon trivial excuses, and spend much time fishing or playing in the woods. The truant officer should be more prompt in attending to cases of absence from school. It is not reasonable that 20 children only should be in school and about 35 absent every day. A forceful married man should be employed as teacher and a residence provided for him.\n\nThe attendance has been so erratic that there has been little opportunity for improvement. A teacher must have personal influence in the reservation in order to have the children come to school and take an interest in the work.\nOttawa, June 10, 1918.\n\nMadam,\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. Inspector Colles, in a recent report on your school, states that the general management of the school is satisfactory. He also states that you promised to be more systematic in your work and that he is making an effort to have you give more attention to the teaching of Elementary Agriculture.\n\nThe Department would like you to carry out any suggestions made by the Inspector in connection with your work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

He also states that the truant officer should be more prompt in attending to cases of absence from school.\n\nWhen the school re-opens after the summer holidays you will be good enough to inform the truant officer that he must see that all the children attend school regularly and action should be taken under the Regulations against any parents who neglect or refuse to send their children to school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

What the children learn is the important feature.\n\nThe Moravian Missionary Society left a splendid farm of 60 acres with two good houses and fine barns and stables.

The property is worth $6000, or a yearly rental of $400.

The Indian Department might advertise for such a man after the men return. Meantime you might procure Miss Glenn, teacher, Sarnia, Ont.

ONTARIO\n\nREMARKS.\u2014The school work is too heavy for one teacher to do justice. The majority of pupils do not attend regularly and consequently are backward and very restless. As there is so little they can do without the teacher's constant attention, I have done the best I could under the circumstances but am not satisfied with results although a number of pupils have made fair progress during the year. Many times I have felt the need of help but could not afford to get any at the salary I have been getting. There are many inconveniences with which I have to contend make the work much harder. It seems to me if the mission and educational work were combined and a settlement house built and three workers associated there viz:- one for the mission work; one for the educational and a social service worker to visit the homes and give instruction in housekeeping and thus try to uplift the home life, results might be better. I just mention this as it seems practical to me. I feel interested in the people and would like to see their home life conditions improved as I believe it is the foundation of any race or nation.\n\n================\n\nMary L.

He was the last one of ten applicants called upon because I was not entirely satisfied with him from his application. I find him an honest young man, anxious to get on and fairly competent as a teacher but he has not and never will have the influence upon the Indians that our teachers should possess.\n\nHe lacks virility and self-confidence and is consequently a little lax in discipline. I fear that if we get the children back to school he will have poor order. Meanwhile we must help him as much as possible. He may improve. I showed him what he requires and showed him how to govern his school, and I shall try to visit the school again before the end of the term.\n\nI would advise making an agreement with him terminable upon a month's notice, and if he do not show himself capable I shall look out...\nfor another. I should like to have the man John Ames whose application I sent you. His city address was upon that application and I do not recollect it. Could you return the application?

She taught for a short time in one of the schools in the Munsey Reserve. She is anxious to secure a school where she would have a residence to live in. I am not sure, but understood some time ago that the Moraviantown school, where we are building the new teacher's residence, will be vacant, but have not heard definitely regarding this. Mrs. Corman would, no doubt, be satisfactory for this school. I phoned Mr. Inspector Colles and he did not know whether the school was to be vacant or not, but said that he expected a letter from the present school teacher within a few days and would advise me. If this school is to be vacant I will let you know in the course of a few days.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgr. Rep. Indian Affairs.\n\nD. C. Scott Esq.,\nDpty. Supt. General,\nDept.

There is, therefore, no vacancy at this school.\n\nThe only vacancies at present in the Protestant day schools in Ontario are at Gibson and Shawanaga in the Parry Bound Agency, New Credit on the New Credit Reserve and Georgina Island. The schools at Gibson and Georgina Island are under the auspices of the Methodist Church, while the Agent has been authorized to advertise in the Toronto papers for a teacher for the New Credit School. Mr. Superintendent Logan is endeavouring to secure the services of a teacher for Shawanaga. There is no teacher's residence at New Credit and a boarding place for the teacher is difficult to obtain.\n\nIt might be well for Mrs. Corman to communicate with the Methodist Church authorities or with the Agents referred to above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Original on 15-1-6.\n\nJohn Ames, III professional, Salary $700.00 and bonus total $850.00. Not strong physically. Has the appearance of a man over 75, Age 58.\n\nMr. Ames is fairly successful in his own way. I recommend that he be retained up to the end of the school year June 30, 1921. Beyond that I would not now say. If I can find a more capable man I shall recommend him to the Department. It would be better to have a married man next year if a suitable man can be found.\n\nW.H.G. Colles,\nInsp.\nSir,\n\nI write you about Murray LaBelle, a pupil who frequently prevents the other pupils from doing their best work at school.\n\nHe is an nuisance disturbing discipline and nothing at night. We have no authority to send him away. I am forced to resort to the criminal code.

If, however, he is unable to do so, it might be possible to have this boy placed in a residential school. I shall be pleased if you will state his age and the names of his parents and whether they are living or dead. You might also communicate with the Principal of the Mount Elgin Institute, Muncey, and ascertain if he can provide accommodation and will accept this boy. If so, upon receipt of a further report the Department will be prepared to consider placing him in that institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE.

I propose to take that step.\n\nKindly let me have your consent to the same.\n\nYours, Resp.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

After some weeks the mother brought him back, and was most unreasonable, if not insulting, in her language. I told her to take him back with her which she did.\n\nHe is an idle, lazy, cigarette smoking boy, who really ought to be sent down to Mimico.

This has not been very satisfactory in the past because sometimes they were unable to secure a teacher, and also not always a satisfactory one.\n\nAnyway, I consider it my duty to see that a teacher is provided no matter who lives there.\n\nMr. Caver also wants to know whether he is to be re-engaged or not.\n\nSo I write you if you are satisfied with the present teacher and have no objection to him being fired again, I am writing Mr. Beattie also on this matter so he go quite often at the Department and the Department often soliciting for information.\n\nMay 18th, 191\nSir,\n\nPersonally, I am satisfied with Mr. Angel.

I believe Mr. Ames is willing to do his best but he is not a strong man for the position and if a better man with more personal influence could be procured it would be an advantage to the school.\n\nI was not aware that the Indian Council had authority to determine any questions to the conduct of the school nor did I know that anyone except the Department had the appointment of a teacher, unless specially commissioned by the Department to do so.\n\nIf you have not heard from the Department on the subject, possibly the Secretary has no instructions to communicate.

Mr. Joblin is a married man, and as there is now a teacher's residence provided at Moraviantown, the Church authorities state he would be a good man to take up the work as missionary teacher.\n\nI am today writing the Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, in connection with this matter, and as soon as the Department is informed of the decision arrived at by the church authorities regarding the transfer of Mr. Joblin to Moraviantown, you will be advised.\n\nThe Agent is being instructed to furnish the seeds required for the school garden, and to instruct the teacher to have the children plant the same as soon as possible.

Heinz Co.\nSir,\n\nReceived the enclosed letter this morning, and now reading the same thought I would write the Department about school attendance on the Reserve.\n\nI have been in the habit of granting two weeks permission off-season from school in order that children might earn some money to buy food, clothing, stock etc. They usually feel that it is necessary for the children to do some work. Say to provide decent clothing and footwear.\n\nDon't think I abuse the privilege.\n\nChief Emerson Snake thought that it was a little too free in granting permits. So the Council and Chief thought it best that the granting of permits be done by the teacher and not the Agent, also that no permits were to be granted at all.\n\nSept 9th 1922\n\n574699\nSir,\n\nI am skeptical if the Councils stand would be endorsed by the Band at say a General Council.\n\nIt is said sometimes that some Indians are able to send their children to school without letting them work in the fields or in the factories.\n\nBut I think quite all of them need a little help from the whole family at times. Some of us Indians financially well off on the Reserve.\n\nRegarding the enclosed letter I have written the lady that she must apply to Mr. Jobbie for a permit.\n\nWhat has been done has been in a friendly spirit all around. And they another difficulty will have. Some families move off the Reserve altogether to quite\nSir,\n\na distance as per party in the enclosed letter. They take the children with them.\n\nI have no particular object in writing this letter to you, only to show you that it is difficult to have matters run smoothly in the matter of attendance.\n\nI have refrained from bothering the Department with these matters, preferring to settle them myself. But I thought it no harm to drop you one letter on the subject of school attendance.\n\nPersonally I think the permit system should be used, but it has been taken out of my hands largely by the Chief although done in a friendly way.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Before such leave is granted, however, the teacher and yourself should decide the merits of each case, and, if you are satisfied that it is advisable to grant such leave, it may be given. The requesting of leave of absence by the parents and children should be discouraged as far as possible, and only in the most urgent cases and when you and the teacher are satisfied that good reason has been given, should leave be granted. As you are both on the ground you should be in a better position to form an opinion regarding the merits of each request for leave of absence than by referring the matter to the Department.\n\nThe letter which you enclosed from Mrs. Annie Stonefish for leave of absence for her son, Norman, may be dealt with by the teacher and yourself as you see fit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Vot. & Car. that the Moravians in General Council, go on record as protesting against the present arrangement or agreement of the Methodist Mission Board and the Indian Department, whereby the teaching and the preaching were combined, we consider, that the Missionary Board has broken faith entirely with the Moravians, under the present arrangement. If from financial stringency or for any other reason, the Mission Board are unable to carry out the terms and conditions under which they were granted the use of the Mission Farm in 1902, why do they not acknowledge their default, and surrender any claim they might have to this property? Instead, they rent to a superannuated Methodist minister at a rental that he can well afford and does sublet to another at a good profit, while he himself resides in Bothwell, some 6 or 7 miles away. The house on this farm is unoccupied, as the party to whom Rev. Nethercott sublet this property occupies his own house. We consider Frank J. Joblin an excellent teacher and one of the best the Day School has ever had, but it is impossible for one person to make good in both professions, and we feel that both are suffering under the present arrangement, and would ask the Dept. to speedily re-arrange these matters, so that more progress might be made in both Church and School on this Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nNelson Stone,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 11, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to a resolution of the Council of the Moravian Indian Band, dated the 2nd instant, relative to the position of missionary teacher at the Moravian Indian Day School.

Manning, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary of Home Missions,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nWesley Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of June 24th, re appointment of Earl A. Knechtel as Missionary Teacher at Moraviantown, I beg to say that when he was in my office a few days ago, he accepted the position as Missionary Teacher at this place, subject to the approval of the Department of Indian Affairs. I have notified him by wire that the Department has approved of his appointment. It is, consequently, settled that he will be the teacher at Moraviantown for the year 1924-25. He assured me that he would be back from the Old Country in time to undertake the duties at Moraviantown at the time for the opening of the school after the summer holidays.\n\nOwing to the disorganized condition of the mail service we have had very little mail at the Mission Rooms for the last ten days and, consequently, I am not in a position to say whether Mr. Joblin will serve in connection with any other school, or not. I have written him enquiring whether he is available for work in connection with any of the schools for next year, and hope to hear from him as soon as mail delivery begins again.\n\nI am,\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E. Manning\n\nMr. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing Report, of the Indian Day school of my agency, for quarter ending June 30th, 1924.\n\nAnd can assure you, that I regret very much, that the Dept., has decided or consented to release Mr. Frank, J. Joblin, and engage a single man, Mr. Joblin.\n\nI am convinced, has made better progress in this school than has been made by any other teacher in many years.\n\nThe parents and pupils all like him as a teacher, and all vouch for his ability in this capacity. We have the year's wood supply for his residence, already on the ground.\n\nThe Residence and stable, recently erected for this purpose, will now be unoccupied by the new teacher, as being single.\n\nHe will board elsewhere. The residence on the Mission is also empty, and has been for two or three years, and is fast falling into decay. If Department have decided to combine these two professions on this Reserve, What was the idea of building the two residences?\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone,\nAgt., for the Moravians.\n\nSEC.

ONT.\nOttawa, July 7th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing the June quarter return of the Moravian Indian Day School.\n\nRegarding the appointment of a teacher for the next school year, I beg to say that as this school is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Missionary Society the change in teacher has been made upon their recommendation. Mr. Earl A. Knatchel has been appointed as missionary teacher to commence duties on or about September 1st, next. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $700 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nNelson Stone Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Moraviantown School, October 2, 1924.\n\nThe school is in charge of an energetic, thoughtful young man, a graduate of Stratford Normal School and apt as a teacher. With experience and a study of teaching Mr. Knechtel would make a very competent teacher.\n\nThe duties of Missionary, however, take up much of Mr. Knechtel's time and attention. He is doing satisfactory work nevertheless.\n\nWhere the teacher has missionary duties to perform we cannot expect him to excel in his work as teacher. Mr. Knechtel will do his best under the circumstances.\n\nW. H. G. Colles,\nInsp.\nSir,\n\nJoe Whiteye, an Indian boy of my Agency, has not attended school since last mid-summer; he will be fifteen years old in June next, is only in first form of public School, and Mr. Joblin, the former teacher told me, that it seemed impossible for Joe to learn and also that he kept other members of the class back. Before my appointment, I am told, Jameison Whiteye, the father was fined eight dollars for failing to compel Joe to attend school. The new teacher, Mr. Knechtel, and the Truant Officer have complained to me and wished me to authorize the Truant Officer to hunt Joe up, compel him to return to Reserve and School. Joe has been absent from the Reserve since mid-summer; he is, I understand, an honest industrious Indian boy.\n\nI talked to Joe and his Father, on this matter, and I am convinced that the boy left home and the Reserve to escape being compelled to attend school. He is so backward at school, that he detests attending and being branded a dunce, besides, there are seven children in family, and the Father complains, being delicate, that he can not provide food and clothing for this family unless the older children are permitted to work and earn their own food and clothes. I feel that it would not be in the best interest of Joe Whiteye, Whiteye Family, or the School to compel this boy to return to Reserve and School, and yet I do not like to allow the School Regulations to be broken, although, I think the teacher, Truant Officer and Agent should exercise their good judgement in these individual cases.\n\nSee next Page.\nAnd do not think we would be justified in going off the Reserve and expending money in locating any pupil of this Reserve and compelling them to return to school.\n\nWould The Department approve of sending a pupil of this age and school standing to an Industrial School?\n\nKindly advise me in this regard.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone,\nNelson Stone, Agent for The Moravians.\n\nSEC. DEPT. OF IND. AFF.\n\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOttawa, January 12, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, relative to the case of Joe Whiteye, an Indian boy of your Agency who is not attending school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the circumstances in connection with this boy, the Department is not prepared to approve of his being placed in a residential school. As he is at present absent from the Reserve, it will not be necessary to have the truant officer bring him back in order that he can attend the day school. Unless he returns and resides on the Reserve, no further action need be taken in his case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nNelson Stone, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nMoved, voted and carried that this Council would request the Dept. if possible to have Mr. Knechtel remain as teacher for another year.\n\nI know Mr. Knechtel is giving good satisfaction but I question if he will consider remaining for another year.\n\nNelson Stone.\nAgent.\nOttawa, March 6th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to resolution of the Council of the Moravian Band requesting that the Department retain the services of Mr. Earl A. Knetchel as teacher of the Moraviantown Indian Day School for the next school year, I beg to say that, provided the Methodist Church authorities, who nominated Mr. Knetchel for the position, are satisfied that he remain for another year, the Department will be pleased to approve of his re-appointment for the school year beginning September 1st, 1925. You should ascertain from Mr. Knetchel in June, next, whether he intends to remain or not, and inform the Department accordingly. We note that Mr. Knetchel is giving good satisfaction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nNelson Stone, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nMoved by Jameson Whitey and Simmons Hill,\n\nBE IT RESOLVED THAT we as a congregation of the Wesley Church of Moravian Indian Reserve do hereby extend a hearty invitation to our Missionary and school teacher, Mr. A.

E. Knechtell as since he is working amongst us the Church has made a wonderful stride towards betterment and I am sure if he be allowed to remain with us for a time longer this field of Christian work will outgrow anything we ever experienced before, owing to his untiring effort to do that which he knows to be his duty. And we hope you will consent to this one plea of ours for once and allow him to stay with us, as he is willing to remain subject to your approval.\n\nI remain ever yours in the work,\n\n(SGD.) EMERSON SNAKE,\nBothwell,\nR.R.#3 Ontario.\nMarch, Nineteenth,\nNineteen-twenty-five.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE MORAVIANTOWN.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Emerson Snake, Bethwell, Ontario, and a resolution passed by the congregation of the Methodist Church on the Indian Reserve at Moraviantown - copies of which are enclosed herewith.\n\nWhen Mr. Russell Ferrier was in my office some time ago he discussed with me the situation at Moraviantown, and seemed to be of the opinion that the present arrangement of having Mr. Knechtel there as Missionary Teacher was not very satisfactory. His view seemed to be that we ought to have an ordained missionary on the Reserve.\n\nI rather lean to his view of the matter, but am wondering whether - in view of the attitude of the Indians toward Mr. Knechtel, as expressed in Mr. Snake's letter and the resolution referred to - it would not be as well to allow the present arrangement to continue for another year. What is your judgment in regard to this?\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC. E. Manning\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with enclosures, with reference to the Moravian Indian Day School. I note that the adherents of the Methodist Church would be pleased if arrangements could be made for the incumbency of the present missionary teacher for another academic year. I have to inform you that the Department has learned that the Council of the Indian Band has requested that Mr. Knetchel remain as teacher for another year. Mr. Indian Agent Stone states that Mr. Knetchel is giving satisfaction. I am informing our local representative that the Department will be pleased to retain Mr. Knetchel's services for the academic year 1925-26 provided your Society are satisfied with the arrangement.\n\nAs you are aware, there are reasons why it might be advisable to maintain an ordained missionary on the Reserve. The public school inspector and the Indian Agent have expressed themselves as in favour of a teacher whose whole time and energy would be released for the day school activity. These facts should guide you when you are determining your policy for this Reserve in the future. However, as the present arrangement whereby Mr. Knetchel is engaged in the dual capacity of missionary and teacher appears to be giving satisfaction to all concerned, the Department is quite willing at the present time to agree to no change for another year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAast. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. C. E. Manning, B.A., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary of Home Missions,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nWesley Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease send me by return one dozen blank \"Quarterly School Return\" forms I ordered them before but you sent blank requisition forms instead.\n\nThe Chief and Council of the Reserve have desired me to remain another year. I like the work, am getting along well with the pupils and parents, and hope to be able to stay if I can make satisfactory arrangements. I should like to ask the Dept. to grant me an extra bonus of $150. to bring my salary up to $1,000, which I feel in all justness it ought to be.\n\nI have all the required teacher qualifications and am a College Graduate (B.A.). I hope that I may\nnever work for money, but I like to feel that I may look forward to a just monetary reward for my labours.\n\nI trust that the Dept. may consider this matter, and that, in fairness to the Indians here (and I earnestly believe that they deserve to be treated well and merit much more than we have given them in the past) and in fairness to the teacher, I may be granted the above extra bonus.\n\nWill you kindly have the Dept. advise me at its earliest possible convenience as to its decision in this matter, and oblige.\n\nYour humble servant,\nEarl Knechtel.\nOttawa, March 27, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, requesting certain forms and asking favourable consideration for an increase in salary. The Department has already received an intimation that the Indian Band would like you to remain for a further term at the Moravian Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that a dozen \"Quarterly School Return\" forms have been directed to you under separate cover.\n\nWith reference to your request for an increase in salary, I should be pleased if you would make your application to Dr. Manning, of the Methodist Missionary Society. As you are aware, your school is conducted under the joint auspices of that Society and this Department, and we look to Dr. Manning to make the recommendations concerning teaching services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dept., and the Methodist Missionary Board were agreeable, His reply was that he had been asked by the Moravian Council and a great many Members of Reserve to remain another year, and after considering the matter, had decided, although the work was somewhat heavy, to stay if The Ind. Dept., & Missionary Board approved of the same.\n\nWhile his work in the School has been extremely successful I can candidly say, that the progress made in the Church since he came, is even more apparent.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone, Agent for Moravians.\n\nSEC.

I think that, when the Rev. Mr. Nethercott is available for such services as only an ordained man can perform, and Mr. Knechtel is rendering such satisfaction as he is doing, it would be a mistake to make any change for the coming year.\n\nI am notifying Mr. Knechtel that you have agreed to his remaining in his present capacity for the year 1925-26.\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC.E.

(RG 10, Volume 6146, File 413-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nAn unfortunate situation has arisen at Moravian-town. Mr. Mathers, who is the Missionary Teacher there, has accepted an invitation to Lion United Church, Brantford, and wants to be released from his duties at Moraviantown on the 1st of March.\n\nHe proposes that his wife - who is a graduate of Victoria College and holds a permanent Specialist's Certificate in Household Science and High School Assistant's Certificate (also permanent) - take charge of the school until a successor can be secured.\n\nMr. Knechtel, who rendered such fine service at Moraviantown for two years, could take charge on the 11th of April. He is now in attendance at College in Kingston and will be through his examinations by the date named. I understand that the Indians would be delighted to have Mr. Knechtel succeed Mr. Mathers, but he cannot do so until April 11th.\n\nI have urged the Brantford people to wait until then for Mr. Mathers, but they seem reluctant to do so. We have had extensive correspondence about the matter - also personal interviews - and up to the present I have been unyielding in the matter of Mr. Mathers leaving Moraviantown before Mr. Knechtel is ready to succeed him. I am taking it for granted that it would be satisfactory to the Department to have Mr. Knechtel take charge of the school at Moraviantown in April and continue until summer holidays. Am I correct in this?\n\nNow, what I write about today is this. Would the Department consent to having Mrs. Mathers act as School Teacher on the Moraviantown Reserve from the 1st of March until the 11th of April? I do not press the matter, but simply state the case and will leave it with you to consent, or otherwise, as you may be disposed to do. If you do not consent, I will use my utmost endeavor to have Mr. Mathers remain until Mr. Knechtel is free.\n\nAwaiting your reply, which I hope will be by return mail, I am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC.E.

It will be necessary to obtain the services of a teacher for this school to begin duties when it reopens after the present summer holidays, on or about September 1st, next.

C. E. Manning, D.D., who is out of the country at present, - would say that acting on behalf of the Home Mission Board I have secured Mr. John Donald Scott to take charge of the Indian School at Moraviantown. He is already there carrying on mission work, including the Sunday services.\n\nSince I arranged with him to go, he has passed his Normal School examinations, which entitle him to a First Class Teacher's Certificate. I am asking him to let me have the certificate as soon as possible.\n\nMr. Scott has been highly recommended by the former Methodist and Presbyterian minister's at Streetsville, where he has been connected very actively with church work. He seems to be a good singer and able to lead singing, has taught in the Sunday School and has a certificate as Teacher of athletics.\n\nI suppose that officially only Dr. Manning can make the recommendation to the Department, but in his absence, and knowing the importance of filling the vacancy at Moraviantown, I thought it as well to secure, in the meantime, what I think is a man well fitted for the position of teacher as well as missionary. I hope that this action of mine will meet with the approval of the Department, awaiting, of course, the official recommendation of Dr. Manning as soon as he returns.\n\nDo you need to see Mr. Scott's certificate, or other testimonials?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Scott, the individual performing the dual duties of Teacher & Missionary was paid by the United Church Mission Board?\n\nI find on making inquiry, that the Indian Dept., pay $850.00 for the ten teaching months of year, and the Mission Board pay only $350.00 for the twelve months of service as Missionary;\n\nI had understood prior to making inquiry, that Dept., & Mission Board went Fifty - Fifty on salary.\n\nTo my mind the present arrangement is very one-sided; The Mission Board are not at present paying the Rent they collect from Mission Farm;\n\nThe Farm is rented for either $500.00 or $550.00 per year.\n\nThe residence occupied by Missionary is supplied by Reserve, fuel & repairs from Band Funds.\n\nThe Mission Farm was originally granted on the understanding that all revenue from same was to support the Missionary of the Reserve.\n\nDept., may say this matter is no concern of mine, but I view the matter differently; While I am agent or superintendent for this Reserve my chief duty should be to guard & protect the Rights of the members.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone, Agent for Moravians.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has been pointed out that the rental is at least $500 per year and that the United Church Mission Board pay the missionary but $350. The funds of the Indian Band are responsible for $850 towards the salary of Mr. Scott and, in addition, the residence with fuel and repairs is provided by the Band.\n\nI should be grateful if you would let me have a letter in this connection, so that the Department will be in a position to reply to a protest that has been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We are asked to contribute something toward drainage, and we expect to expend considerable in fixing up the old Moraviantown Church, so that for the next year or two we will have spent on salary and on these improvements quite as much, if not more than the rent amounts to. We will keep faith with the Indians and if at any time the yearly expenditure on the part of the Board of Home Missions on account of the Moraviantown mission does not amount to $500.00, we will carry any balance to reserve fund to be used for the benefit of the Moraviantown Indians.\n\nTrusting this explanation will be satisfactory to all concerned,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nNelson Stone, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nReports of misconduct on the part of the Missionary Teacher of this Reserve, \"Mr. J. D. Scott\" have been quite in evidence of recent weeks; I refused to listen or believe until on the 30th ultimo \"Mr. E. K. Snake\" the leading official of Reserve and local Church Board visited my office and stated that Mr. Scott had confessed his guilt when pressed by Snake for a true statement;\n\nSnake agreed with me at once, when I expressed the opinion, that it would not be in the best interest of Reserve or Mission Board to allow Mr. Scott to continue longer than was necessary to get a Substitute.\n\nI may say, that prior to this, several of the Parents of my agency, had registered a complaint to this office, and stated they would not attend church or allow children to attend school while he was in charge;\n\nThe misconduct consisted of the fact that for weeks Mr. Scott had been too intimate with a young married Indian woman with a husband and three small children, her stealing out nights and meeting him with his car and remaining out four and five hours from home;\n\nYou can readily conceive the effect of this would have when he was acting in the capacity of Missionary Teacher.\n\nI wrote \"Rev. C. E. Manning, D.D., Toronto, Ont., Sec., Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada\" and today have his reply to the effect, that he appreciated very much my courtesy in writing him as I did, and to say that he was having his local Superintendent at Thamesville, investigate and report to him; and it would seem that it would be imperative to remove Mr. Scott, but they had an ordained minister and qualified school teacher that was immediately available.\n\nDo not consider it necessary for Dept. to take any action or interview the Mission Board, but I wished to acquaint the Dept. with the circumstances.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone, Ind.

This Department would have taken any action considered advisable with the Church authorities.\n\nWe are now requesting the authorities of the United Church to inform the Department of the action it is proposed to take in obtaining the services of another teacher to succeed Mr. Scott.

I have replied to him that the usual practice has been departed from in this connection, and that he should have reported to the Department, who would take it up with the Church authorities if necessary.\n\nPerhaps you have had an opportunity of looking into the questions raised by Mr. Stone's communication to you. If so, I should be glad to learn what action, if any, you propose to take.

D. Scott, teacher of the Moraviantown Indian Day School, I have to inform you the Department has had a report that his conduct was more indiscreet than serious. However, it will be necessary to have a definite recommendation from you as to the retention of his services. Do you believe his conduct has militated seriously against his usefulness on the reserve?

Leonard Bartlett of Thamesville, who is Superintendent of the Moraviantown Indian Mission under the United Church of Canada, asking him to visit the Reserve, ascertain the facts and report to me. On January 6th he wrote me a letter in which he assures me that the most that can be said against Brother Scott is that he has been indiscreet. He states that only upon two occasions in one week did he give the young woman referred to a ride in his car and that he had no wrong intention in the matter.\n\nHe says he discussed the whole matter with Mr. Emerson Snake, the Indian who made the report to Mr. Stone and says that Mr. Snake without full consideration advised Mr. Stone to write to me. When Mr. Snake returned home that day and after more careful consideration he wrote Mr. Stone to defer writing to me for the present, but Mr. Stone's letter was already on its way. When Mr. Stone intimated in his letter to me that he had not advised the Department of Indian Affairs in the matter, I wrote him stating that I appreciated his courtesy in writing me as he had done, but was not sure but that he ought to report the facts as he understood them to the Department at Ottawa. I appreciate the fact that Mr. Stone should have communicated with you before writing to me, but I presume that he did not think the matter as serious as the Indians made it out to be and thought it would be better not to give any publicity to it.\n\nMy personal judgment is that the Indians have been unduly suspicious and Mr. Stone has been guilty of nothing more than indiscretion, - if even that could be said about him, - and I think it would be well for the Department to allow him to remain at Moraviantown as I am quite sure he will be very careful in the future. Any report I have of him is to the effect that he is a very fine young man and I would be sorry to see any reflection cast upon his character. If I had any suspicion that he had been guilty of wrong doing I would ask for his resignation and nominate another man for the position which he holds, but under the circumstances I think it is just as well to let the matter drop.\nA. P. MacKenzie, Esq.\n\nIf you concur in this judgment, I would be glad to have word from you to that effect.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCER: AMA\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to Dept., Letter No.15-1-I.of the 10th inst., concerning Mr. J.D. Scott, the Missionary Teacher of Moravian Reserve;\n\nI would say that immediately on receiving above letter, I made a thorough investigation, and today am informed through Missionary Board of United Church of Canada, that Mr. Scott has resigned and another is being installed;\n\nNo doubt the Dept. will be advised through the same source.\n\nNo information came to me as to date of transfer, but simply that Mr. Scott took this action considering first of all the interest of the work on the Reserve.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\n\nSEC.

Mr. Bartlett, who is Superintendent of that Mission.\n\nHe has been in further conference with Mr. Scott, the Missionary Teacher there, who had sent to me his resignation. He now advises that we accept that resignation, - not because he believes that Mr. Scott has been intentionally guilty of any wrong doing, but he thinks it would be better, in the interests of all concerned, if someone were to take Mr. Scott's place.\n\nWill the Department consent to the Rev. C. W. MacKenzie, who is now Assistant Principal of Muncey Indian Residential School, taking charge at Moraviantown without delay? He is a graduate in Arts, taught school for three and one-half years in Ontario, and for one and one-half years in Alberta. He attended Normal School in the spring of 1915, but his health gave way just before examination time and he, consequently, did not write on the final examinations. He is, doubtless, pretty well known to your Department, and I have reason to believe that, if you would favor his appointment to Moraviantown, I could arrange with him to go there without delay.\n\nAwaiting your reply, I am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC.

Mr. Wilding or another well qualified worker is appointed to this school, it may be necessary - depending on the number in the teacher's family - to enlarge the residence. I promised favourable consideration, in view of the fact that the Missionary Society is proposing to use during the next three or four years the rentals on the farm there for improvements to the buildings.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

The Department has been paying Mr. Wilding $95.00 per teaching month and we shall be glad if the same salary can be continued when he is appointed to Moraviantown. I quite expect Mr. Wilding will be able to continue the work there, if appointed, for some years and thus get the work into a more permanent basis. It is quite understood that Mr. Wilding will have charge of the mission work at Moraviantown.\n\nIndian Agent Stone will report in regard to the enlargement of the teacherage in due course. The way is opening for the making of improvements on the farm which we discussed and I shall be much obliged if the Department will authorize Mr. Stone to take oversight of these matters so that Mr. Leverton may have someone with whom to consult.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Barner.\nOttawa, June 13th, 1929.\n\nRev.

The Department will approve of the appointment of Rev. Mr. Wilding as teacher of the Moraviantown Indian Day School and also to perform the duties of missionary on the Reserve. He should take up the duties of teacher when the school reopens after the present summer holidays. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $5 per teaching month.

July 26, 1899\n\nThe Honorable\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa,\n\nSir: May I trouble you to consider the case of an Indian girl for whom something must be done. Sarah Jackson, an orphan, is the daughter of Charles Jackson, a Delaware from the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nShe was born in March 1875, and entered the Orphanage at Moraviantown in Dec., 1893. While here she seemed to do quite well both in her studies and in learning to work. A lady living near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. being interested...\nin our work, kindly offered to take her into her family, train her for usefulness, pay her wages and surround her with all the influences of a Christian home. She said: \"I assure you I feel the responsibility fully. As far as I am given light, I will guard her and guide her. For love of the Master I will do all I can to keep her close to Him.\" To us it seemed an open door through which the girl might enter into a better life than exists on the Reserves, and she was sent to her new home in December, 1895.\n\nAfter seven months of trial in two situations, she was sent back to this\nReserve... I enclosed please find a copy of the lady's letter stating why she could not keep the girl.\n\nShe at first refused to return to the orphanage, and wandered around from house to house, remaining out very late at night. Her uncle, with whom she had chosen to make her home, found it impossible to restrain her, and prevailed upon us to give her a shelter until something could be done with her. Her grandfather, John Peters, pleaded most earnestly with us not to return her to the Six Nations Reserve as those, in whose company she would fall, are not...\naccording to all reports, leading the right kind of lives. She would like, if possible, that she should be sent to some reformatory. On account of her conduct, the Superintendent of Mt Elgin Institution refuses to receive her. We can not keep her here. The only thing possible to prevent her from leading a dissolute life seems to be that she should be sent to some place like the Andrew Mercer School.\n\nWould the Department of Indian Affairs assume the expense, and, if so, will you kindly authorize Mr. A. R. McDonald, agent for this Reserve, to take the necessary\nsteps for her commitment to that Institution.\n\nIf this can not be done, what shall we do with her? If she is not restrained there seems to be every probability of her growing worse and eventually through an evil life, becoming a burden to the community.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nT.M. Rights\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter seven months of trial with Sarah Jackson, I return her. She leaves here tomorrow morning. You will see by the enclosed letter, that Mrs. Renshaw also made an effort but she gave her up with only a few days trial, and tried to get in some house and was unable to do so.\n\nI am very much surprised you sent her home after I wrote you should not take her unless she was honest truthful & obedient.\n\nShe could not develop the character that she is, suddenly, nor could she live five years in a place without being taken.\n\nMy only regret is I did not return her the first month she was here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMrs. W. C. Wilson\nIndian Affairs Office\n\nAugust 26th July 1879\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose you a letter handed me by Rev. T. M. Riggs missionary on this occasion and I shall endeavor all he can in regard to this girl and I hope you can see your way clear to send her to some Industrial school where she will be under restraint for a few years until she is older and wiser, she certainly must be taken from this present, and I understand her connection at Grand River will not help her morally or otherwise please write me what to do with her as something must be done at once.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6146, File 413-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOTTAWA, 1st August, 1899\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ulto., enclosing a communication from the Rev.

The location of the plot will be left to the discretion of yourself and Mr. Snider.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of February 10th, last, in which you were asked for particulars in regard to the kind of fence it is proposed to erect, the cost of levelling the grounds and putting in cement walks. This fence will have to be erected at once, and the information called for in the letter above referred to ought to have been in the hands of the Department before this. In order that no delay may be caused in the commencement of the gardening operations you will be good enough to let the Department have this information immediately, so that authority may be given to go ahead with the work, or it will be necessary to attend to at least the levelling of the ground and the erection of the fence.

Considering the rough cold weather the attendance for the past two months has been very fair and both parents and children show far more interest in the work. With moderated temperature the attendance became much better towards the end of February and is holding up well. I have had them out two Saturdays lately and they attended very well. Another Saturday will make up for the three days extra they had at Christmas and then they will have their full week at Easter. Those who attend regularly are doing well I am pleased to say.\n\nRegarding the furnace I must say it is\npoor affair in very weather. As it is only surrounded by a thin galvanized hot air pocket a large proportion of the heat is wasted in the basement. Were it bricked in I feel sure the school would be more easily heated and that there would be a great saving of fuel. I have had considerable experience with furnaces and have attended to it myself during the school hours. The janitor puts the fires on and the teacher does the work. Some days it was almost impossible to get the place warm before eleven and the children had to wear their overcoats. Such should not be the case. But the worst I trust is over for this winter.\n\nThough the Department did not grant me a raise at Christmas I hope it may see fit to do so before Easter. I would not ask for it if I did not feel justified in so doing.\n\nI remain respectfully yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

From the teacher's letter I should surmise that the fault is probably lack of proper attention, as he states in extreme that it is eleven o'clock before they can get the building warm. This would indicate that the fires are not maintained constantly, but allowed to go out at night and started in the morning and probably not much before school hour. It is hardly the fault of the furnace if the building can be heated by eleven o'clock, as it can be kept in the same condition at all times if proper attention is given; the fire being banked at night and replenished at an early hour in the morning, the outside cold air being shut off and the air in building only circulated while the school is unoccupied.\n\nThe furnace and pipes may also require cleaning as these have been in use for two seasons.\n\nWith respect to the casing of furnace, the galvanized iron cover is all that is considered necessary by manufacturers and round furnaces are seldom, if ever, bricked in.\n\nArchitect.\nTo James Nash, Dr\nDEALER IN\nGROCERIES, FLOUR and MEATS.\n\n6 per cent. charged after accounts are rendered.\n\nI HEREBY certify that the services rendered by me have been performed\nand the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item\nof the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent:\n\nIndian Affairs.

In order that you may fully understand the matter, I have to inform you as follows., cheque No. 5435 for $1.05 was issued in payment of one broom, ammonia, soap and towelling, while cheque No. 3319 also for $1.05 was issued through inadvertence in payment of the same articles.

If these windows have no doors or glass in them for the winter, the cold air is seeping into the attic all the time, and it is most impossible to heat the building or keep it heated. Also, see how conditions are around the cornice in attic.\n\nIf all the above conditions are in good order so as to make the ceiling and attic wind-proof, a smaller sized furnace could be used, which would cost - Twenty dollars less.\n\nTHE McClARY MANUFACTURING COMPANY.\n\nPer A.

The first mentioned contains charges relative to repairs to the school house and also in connection with the erection of a flag pole, and the last mentioned voucher is for gravel supplied for the school yard. Before considering the question of the payment of these vouchers, explanations are required from you.\n\nI beg to point out that in the account of $14.00 in Noah's favor there is a charge of $6.00 for pulley and bolts, and $8.00 has also been charged for a pulley and bolts. Mr. Russell's account above mentioned of $3.00 is for bolts supplied for the flag pole. The Department wishes to know whether it is possible that E.S.Russell was paid by Noah for the bolts used.\n\nIn Wm.F. Noah's account of $14.00 there is a charge of $3.00 for gravel and yet Noah has submitted a separate account of $3.00 for two loads of gravel. The Department wishes to guard against making duplicate payments; and therefore desires a full explanation from you in this matter.

He also states that the school room and furniture need a good washing.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will make the necessary arrangements to have the stair railing repaired, repairs made to the boy's closet and fence, and the school room and furniture thoroughly scrubbed and washed. All of the above work should be done at the lowest possible expenditure, and you should furnish properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRegarding the school garden; the Department desires that it be continued this season. The Inspector states that the Council instructed the teacher not to carry on this work this Spring. The Council have no authority in this matter, and I have to request that you will be good enough to consult the teacher as to the seed required for the purpose of planting the garden, and arrange for the purchase and delivery of same, as soon as possible, in order that the work can be completed before the season is too far advanced. It is considered that gardening is an important factor in the education of Indian children, and it is hoped that it is not too late to have the work performed and the garden planted.\n\nThe Inspector also states that a new truant office is being appointed, and it is hoped that he will carry out his duties more proficiently than his predecessor, and that he will see that all the children of school age, and who are in good health, will attend regularly.\n\nThe Inspector also states that there is a quantity of school supplies required, as well as a few other articles, and the teacher should prepare a requisition and forward it to your office for the supplies required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Scott for fence supplies for Moravian School residential lot.\n\nI was given an estimate that this would cost \u00a310.00, but that was just for the first and east side of the lot, and common ordinary posts. I thought we could make the old wires on the back end do, but on being ready to put up the fence they were not available. They were pretty well worn and some one had taken them. So I had to get for three sides instead of two.\n\nThere was also the brace wire and braces and a large gate. All of the above accounts for the exceeding of the estimate. Complete accounts are enclosed.\n\nSincerely send Mr. Scott settlement for the same. The fence looks lovely strong and very nice.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

R.R. 3\n\nMay 17th/22.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to write you in reference to a recent visit made to our school (Moraviantown) by the inspector, Mr. Colles of Chatham. He was considerably incensed over a change that had been made in the position of the closets, and insisted that they would have to be moved back again to where they were before.\n\nThe arrangements had been made for the change, by the Chief Council and Agent, about the time I came here last fall, and they tell me that the reason for making the change was that the closets were so close together that communications were too easily passed from the one to the other, and that children in the one were frequently annoyed by those of the other sex.\n\nI am told by those who have lived here ever since the school was built, that the closets were originally much farther apart, and admitted of no possible intercourse from the one to the other; and that it was the inspector's suggestion that they be placed near together in the rear of the school building. If this is the case it helps to explain why he is so annoyed at the position being altered.\n\nIf your Dept. is asked to have the closets put back where they were, will you please consider the reasons given above for their removal before authorizing any further change.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFrank J. Joblin.\nOttawa, May 22, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have yours of the 17th instant, informing the Department of the visit of the public school inspector, and explaining why certain outbuildings were moved from their original position.\n\nIn reply I wish to thank you for your explanation and to assure you that the Department will not authorize any further change without taking into consideration the facts explained in your communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nFrank J. Joblin, Esq.,\nR.

March 12th, 1923.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just had a note from Rev. Mr. Joblin, a teacher at the Moravian Indian school. You will remember at the teacher's residence, we put on an addition to the school under which a basement was constructed. The building of a cistern, water-pipes, sink, etc., was not part of the contract of the Reid Company of Bothwell who built the building. It was my intention to make application to the Department for permission to put this in together with a drain suitable for carrying the water away from the waste-pipe but I did not do this as I learned from Mr. Beatty that he had made application to the department for the cistern, sink, etc. Mr. Beatty called for tenders and awarded the contract to the Lambert Company of Highgate. The excavation for the cistern was made last and the cistern which is a very flimsy granite, iron affair, was brought out. Since that time nothing has been done.\n\nI believe the contract also included putting on eave troughs. Mr. Joblin states that the excavation of the cistern is now filled up with water and that his cellar is becoming flooded. As the case seemed urgent, I called up Mr. Lambert on the telephone and he stated that he would complete his contract as soon as possible. He stated that his contract did not include putting in a drain to drain the waste water from the sink away. I immediately got in touch with Mr. Beatty and instructed him to have a drain put in to carry the water away as if it was not done immediately the contents of Mr. Joblin's cellar would be ruined.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Raspberry bushes,\n- 100 Strawberry plants\n- 3 Grape Vines - Concord.\n- 2 Plum trees - 1 Lombardy, 1 Green Gage.\n- 6 Peach trees - 3 Early Crawford, 3 Late Crawford.\n\nThe cost of these would not be great and they would, with care develop into mature trees, &c., that would furnish an abundance of fruit and make the place attractive for a teacher. Mr. Abraham would procure these and see them properly planted.\n\nW.H.G. Colles,\nInsp.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Moraviantown Indian Day School, recommends that the teacher be supplied with fruit trees and small fruit bushes to plant out and make a permanent garden.\n\nI may say that we do not furnish supplies of this nature to Indian day schools, but there may be good reasons why the Inspector's recommendations should be carried out in the case of the Moraviantown school. I shall, therefore, be pleased to have your views as to whether you would recommend that a number of fruit trees and small fruit bushes be supplied. The list as recommended by the Inspector is as follows:\n\n- 2 Doz. black currant bushes (Boscoor Giant),\n- \u00bd \" apple trees - 2 Snow apple, 2 Harvent apple,\n- 2 Northern Spy,\n- 2 pear trees - Duchess, Oldenburg, 1 Kiefer,\n- \u00bd Doz. roots rhubarb,\n- 4 Doz. raspberry bushes,\n- 100 strawberry plants,\n- 3 grape vines - Concord,\n- 2 plum trees - 1 Lombardy, 1 Green Gage,\n- 6 peach trees - 3 Early Crawford, 3 Late Crawford.\n\nA question to be considered is, who would care for these trees especially during the summer holidays when the teacher is likely to be absent. The approximate cost should be stated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nNelson Stone, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing Dec. Qr. Report of Moravian Day School, Teacher, Earl A. Knechtel, B.A.\n\nI think Mr. Knechtel is doing splendid work, and is liked by both pupils and parents. I think the pupils are making good progress. I notice that the School premises and the pupils themselves appear to be kept in a clean and sanitary condition. I was out to School yesterday to the closing exercises. The teacher had arranged for a little program, a goodly number of parents were present and I can assure you that the manner in which each item or number of this program was rendered reflected credit on both teacher and pupils. I took a little treat out for everybody and it yielded to me a great deal of pleasure to see the way it was appreciated by all present. I wish to inform the Dept. that I have not yet installed the Wash-stands, basins, soap, towels &c. in the School. I took the matter up with the teacher and we cannot devise at present any place for them, the entry or cloak room on each side as very small not proper room for coats, hats and dinner pails, and if they were installed in this entry, the water would freeze in winter very quickly. There is a small room at the back of school room, unused, that with a little expense could be made...\nuseful for the above purpose, but any of these entry rooms are not provided with any heat from the present system of heating. In the summertime I think the proper place for the wash-basins is outside and the towels should be just inside the entry. I have had the 6 window shades installed but not the clock. The teacher requested me to wait a little before getting it, as he is not real sure at present as to it being a benefit in the School.\n\nNext Spring I will see if it is not possible to make some adjustments or alterations in rear of this building, so that this unused portion may be utilized. If I conclude it can be done, I will get an estimate on the cost, take the matter up with Chief and Council and if they are agreeable, I will then submit it to The Department for their consideration.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone,\nSEC.DEPT.OF IND.

We note that Mr. Knechtel, the teacher, is doing good work and is liked by both pupils and parents. Also, that the Christmas Tree provided by the teacher and yourself was greatly enjoyed by the pupils and their parents.\n\nRegarding the providing of wash room facilities, I shall be pleased if you will furnish a further report when considered timely. You should state the cost of any alterations required in fitting up or enlarging the small room at the back of the school, and also ascertain from the Band if they would provide the cost from their funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Ass't Deputy & Secretary.\n\nNelson Stone, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nMoved, voted and carried that Agent ask Dept. to approve of installing a large heating box stove in school house before close of winter to see if the stove burning wood, would not be more economical and satisfactory than coal in the furnace in the basement.\n\nI think we can get a second-hand stove on approval but we would have to get about $15.00 worth of stove pipe to install this plan for experiment, of course if the scheme proved O.K. the pipe would be utilized permanently and I think we could purchase the stove for about $25.00 or less. Last year we paid for coal alone $216.41 and around $50.00 for wood for school house. Now if this new plan can be operated successfully, I think this building could be well heated for a lot less money, and the fuel all purchased from the Indians and the permits for sale that we are at present issuing could be absorbed on the reserve and in this way serve a double purpose, as the reserve would be receiving all the benefit from its products. You can understand that a coal fire must be a perpetual thing during night and day of each school week during cold weather, whereas a wood fire in school house could be started at 7.30 O'clock A.M. and be discontinued at 3.30 P.M. and if properly looked after during that period, the building should be well heated during school hours and in this way considerable fuel conserved. I honestly think the plan, viewed from different angles is worth trying out.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(Sgd.) Nelson Stone.\nOttawa, February 7, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the minutes of the meeting of the Moravian Council relative to the installing of a large box stove in the school building to be used for heating purposes in place of the present furnace, I beg to say that the Department will, in view of the request of the Band and your recommendation regarding same, approve of a wood burning stove of the size and type considered suitable being purchased and installed. You may also purchase the supply of stove pipe required. We note it is considered that if this change in heating the building can be successfully operated that a considerable sum will be saved in the purchase of fuel. You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase and installation of the stove as soon as possible, and give it a trial as to whether it will be suitable for heating the building or not.\n\nNo unnecessary expense should be incurred in the purchase of the stove and stove pipe, and you should forward properly certified vouchers covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I also took the Council over to school and we find after consulting with teacher, that it would not be wise to install a stove in school room, as at present the school attendance is increasing and all the space is required for seating capacity, but the furnace is badly in need of immediate repairs and I am arranging to have this done on Saturday and I think it would be wise to try wood in this furnace and if it is successful, which I believe it will be, then we would not need to purchase any more coal, but burn all wood in these public buildings, and the outlay for fuel would be all expended on the reserve. If the wood is not a success in this furnace, then I would suggest installing a pipeless furnace in basement.\n\nNelson Stone.\nAgent.\nOttawa, March 6th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the resolution of the Moravian Council regarding the fuel required for the use of the Moraviantown Indian Day School and teacher's residence, as well as for the council hall, I beg to say that the Department will approve of the quantity required for next winter's use being obtained. You will be good enough to see that the full quantity of wood as mentioned in the resolution is delivered in each case. You should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred for each service separately.\n\nWe note that you do not consider it would be advantageous to install a stove in the schoolroom, as, owing to the increased attendance, all space is required for seating purposes. You should have the furnace repaired and placed in a satisfactory condition. We note you consider that wood could be satisfactorily used in all the public buildings on the reserve, and that it would not be necessary to obtain coal. After a trial of wood in the furnace at the school, you should report as to whether it has been found satisfactory or whether it will be necessary to obtain coal for next winter's use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You may arrange to have suitable stands erected at the lowest possible cost.\n\nThe Inspector also states that 6 granite ware drinking cups and a pail for wash water be supplied. You may purchase this equipment.\n\nIt is also recommended that the school building be painted, especially the classroom and the outside woodwork. Please furnish a report regarding any painting which you would recommend be carried out and state the approximate cost.

The closets that the Inspector reported to require attention and cleaning were inspected by Agent and Chief and found perfectly clean & sanitary and have been attended to regularly by the Janitor.

All outside woodwork should be given two coats of paint. It is noted that you estimate the cost of having all inside work required, including plastering and two coats of paint, to be $90 and that the outside painting and carpenter work would cost approximately $85, these amounts to include labour and material.

Letter No. I5-I-5 of the 10th inst., in reference to a report made by the Public School Inspector and his recommendation for purchase of various equipment, repairs etc., to school house and outbuildings; I would say that his recommendation is to a great degree impractical.\n\nHe has time and time again suggested installing wash basins, soap towels etc., and I defy him to show me any place or spare room to place them.\n\nHe recommended some few years before my time as agent, a table the same as in this report to be purchased; it was purchased and never used by any teacher, discarded and no teacher in my time ever wished to have one, but now the present teacher asks for it and the Inspector recommends it.\n\nHe recommends a deflector 8\" wide for the bottom of each window, this glass would have to be attached to both sides of frame, would be unprotected and I venture to say broken frequently, would cost at least $30.00 to install and have never yet noticed a similar device in any school of County.\n\nThe Inspector recommended in a recent report to have Closets repaired, I arranged to have them repaired as instructed to by Dept. Now he states they should not have been removed out into playgrounds; They were erected where they are at present, and no better place could be chosen for them, at the back of grounds right against the fence out of the road of playgrounds; The Well is at the front and surely he does not wish closets placed adjacent to well.\n\nThe Dept. can judge for themselves, but I do know that No School Board of the County of Kent takes any report of Mr. Colles seriously.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nNelson Stone,\nAgent for Moravians.\n\nSEC.
