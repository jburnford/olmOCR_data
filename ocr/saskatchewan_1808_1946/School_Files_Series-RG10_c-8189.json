Before writing further to her, I wish to know if you have heard whether the Sisters of St. Ann can give favourable consideration to my letter of June 24.

At the present time, the local Sisters are away and will not return, I understand, until around the 12th.\n\nRegarding the above, if the Sisters accept this school, I would not consider it advisable to have Miss Comeau take over the Cornwall Island East School as Miss Helen Francis should receive priority.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nCharge: Indian Affairs\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 25th instant, your file 338-1 (E), concerning the Cornwall Island East School. I do not know of any teacher at the present time who is willing to take over that school although I have interviewed several. Teachers in Cornwall schools, like many other large centers, can get away with teaching only one grade or perhaps two at the most and, consequently, frown on any school where they have eight grades to teach. I don't think it is the location of the school so much as the number of grades. I have no doubt but that, had we a set-up on Cornwall Island similar to the one in the Chenaile, we would have no difficulty in getting teachers.\n\nInsofar as advertising for teachers is concerned, it would seem advisable to advertise in papers that are more apt to reach teachers leaning towards rural schools. While we could try the Cornwall Standard-Preacher, it might also be advisable to advertise in Kingston, Pembroke and Smith Falls. It is just possible we would have some response from teachers desiring a change at Christmas. I might mention also that the Ottawa Citizen and Journal has a large coverage not only in the Ottawa Valley but also throughout Stormont and Glengarry. The Montreal Star has an exceptionally large coverage in Stormont County.\n\nT. L.

Classes start in April, so I must leave Canada at the beginning of April.\n\nI hope this news will not inconvenience you too much, for you and everyone else on the reservation, have been most kind and obliging during my stay.\n\nI did intend to complete the term when I started for I did not know this university had a spring class.\n\nSorry for the inconvenience this action will likely cause you.\n\nSincerely,\nSarah Jane Clark.\nRETIREMENT FUND APPLICATION FORM\n\nDepartment: Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch\n\nThe Superannuation Division,\nDepartment of Finance,\nNew Post Office Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDate: March 31, 1949\n\nRETURN OF THE AMOUNT AT CREDIT OF THE UNDERMENTIONED EMPLOYEE IN THE RETIREMENT FUND IS REQUESTED.\n\nName: Clerk (Surname) S.J.

P. McNaughton\nIndian Agent (D. P. McNaughton)\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nSt. Regis, Quebec,\nMarch 21st, 1936.\n\nEnclosed please find voucher in favour of Atchison & Co., Cornwall Ontario, reconstructing and delivering book cupboard for the Cornwall Island east day school.\n\nMr. Chisholm constructed a wash bench from material left at the school at finish of construction, and set it up in the basement, where it is serving its purpose very well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,-\n\nI have before me a letter received from Mr. Gregor Lesly, of St. Agnes de Dundee, in which he informs me that he has not received his December mileage cheque.\n\nThis account was sent in on January 18th, voucher No. 657, for $40.88 in favour of Gregor Lesly, present address St. Agnes de Dundee P.Q.\n\nPlease advise regarding the above and oblige,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe teacher says that the playground is too small. And I am willing to give as much land as is necessary free, if I in return will be given work whenever necessary, such as building a fence, levelling the playground, painting the building (as helper) and such other work as may be necessary. I have already bought the posts that Mr. McNaughton told me about, when the school was being built. I was given very little work.\n\nThe school I am referring to is Cornwall Island East Indian Day School.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJake Francis\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter regarding the offer by Jake Francis of more land to enlarge the grounds of the Cornwall Island east day school.\n\nWhen I visited the school on the 19th inst., Mr. Chisholm informed me of Mr. Francis' offer, without mention of provisory conditions. We talked the matter over, and while the grounds are at present large enough for the playing about of school children, additional land would give more space which would be available for providing a field large enough to be used for the playing of baseball or lacrosse, which is game mostly played in the district, and I am sure the youth of the Island would appreciate suitable grounds.\n\nIf the Department decided to accept Mr. Francis' offer, it would be as well if he was allowed to cultivate and graze his cattle on the land until it obtained a good level state, which could be done more expeditiously without a surrounding fence.\n\nMr. Francis has spoken to me about securing work in connection with the school, and I informed him the Department would be advised his services were available, where such were needed.\n\nAny additional land acquired would necessarily be on the west side as the well is on the east side, with Mr. Francis' land just beyond.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the offer of Jake Francis to give additional land at the Cornwall Island East Indian Day School.\n\nPlease inform Jake Francis that the Department appreciates his offer but it is considered that the grounds at this school are sufficiently large and, therefore, we are not prepared to accept his offer at the present time.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA.

The school and out buildings has received a coat of white paint, over the priming coat which was pretty well absorbed into the wood. The painting was held over pending the recovery of Jake Francis (who had been ill) as it was understood he was to be given an opportunity to do this work. As the Doctor advised Francis should not undertake this labour, the work was done, on his behalf, by his father and brother, who have done a fair job, but I have to advise that another coat will be required to give a good finished appearance, as the wood was too dry to apply enough paint at one coating.\n\nIf I have your permission I can get ahead with this work especially as Francis has the necessary (borrowed) scaffolding on the spot.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n| Name          | Price/Day | Amount of Wages | Received Payment |\n|---------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Jake Shaver   | $15.00    | $15.00          |                  |\n\nI hereby certify that the services have been performed and prices are fair and just.\n\nN.

One can be purchased with 1 year guarantee for a price of $15.95. The teacher also advises that a coal and wood stove will be required (not a gasoline stove) and this can be purchased for a price of $69.00 with reservoir or at a price of $79.00 with reservoir and heating oven.\n\nWith regards to estimates for repairs to the residence I would like to point out that it would be of great benefit to have this work done. The room in question was never completed and regardless of what teacher might be at this school the finishing of this room for a kitchen would be very practical.\n\nThe present mattress at the residence is in bad condition with the springs showing through in several places and it would be advisable to have a new one.\n\nI would recommend the above for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Can.\n\nIndian Affairs.

They advised however that the price now would not be much of an increase over the price we paid when a similar stove was purchased for the Chstlain School teacher.\n\nThe stove in question and which I believe would suit Mr. Chisholm's needs is a McClary Cook stove No. 8-914 with high shelf, coal and wood burning, with reservoir. Any coal and wood stove equipped with oven and reservoir should suffice. A four lid stove should be ample large enough as the residence, with the exception of the kitchen is heated by the school furnace.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.A.Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Can.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The arrangement has proven very satisfactory.\n\nTransportation since that time has been provided by Paul Caldwell, Indian of Cornwall Island West at a cost of .75\u00a2 per trip. This man is very reliable but for some time he has complained about the small scale of wages for this service. You realize that this ties a man and team up from 1.00 PM until approximately 4.30 PM. To get another Indian to do this for .75\u00a2 is out of the question and even at twice that rate it would not be possible to get someone as reliable. Mr. Caldwell has advised us this date that unless we would be in a position to set a rate of $1.50 per trip he would have to discontinue this service as apart from his everyday farm work he is getting many extra calls for his team.\n\nAs the west-end school is crowded to capacity it is not possible to hold these classes there and at any rate it would be too bad to make any change in the present policy just now as everything is working out so smoothly for children and pupils.\n\nI would recommend authorization be granted to increase the rate to $1.50 per trip.

He is a good painter but liquor and paint don't mix so well. I have, however, got another Indian that can do this work but we will have to get started right away as I can't expect him to wait around two or three weeks to get started. If it is permissible to purchase this paint locally I would appreciate your advice by wire and I could get things under way as soon as possible.\n\nI would like to have permission, if I find it necessary, to close the Cornwall Ild.E.School on the 23rd., as this job will have to be done in conjunction with the paint job at the Village teachers' residence. In the latter place considerable work has to be done before the painting can be completed but between the two jobs I would be in a position to keep my painters busy and without any lay-off. What I hope to do is go ahead with the teachers residence in the village as far as I can and then start and complete Cornwall Ild.E.School and return and finish the residence in the village after the carpenter work is over.\n\nAn advance of $100.00 is necessary for labour at the Cornwall Ild.

HOEY\n\nRe visit to the St. Regis Schools for the purpose of studying the crowded situation in the Cornwall Island Day School and the water and heating situation at the teacher's residence in the village of St. Regis.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nCORNWALL ISLAND EAST DAY SCHOOL\n\nI visited for a few hours at this school and had children pass the Standard Achievement Test in Reading. The object was to demonstrate to the teacher the method of administering diagnostic tests so as to deal with the difficulties of the pupils in a more systematic manner.\n\nThe interior of this school should be redecorated as soon as conditions permit. There is some difficulty in the drainage of the basement where Manual Training is taught to the boys. There must have been a few inches of water in the centre the day I was there. It appears to be due to an obstruction in the drainage system. This situation could be easily remedied, I believe, by the use of sewer rod either from the interior or from an excavation from the exterior. This would entail only labour; however, this is rather difficult to obtain on the Island today.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nRe visit to the St. Regis Schools for the purpose of studying the crowded situation in the Cornwall Island Day School and the water and heating situation at the teacher's residence in the village of St. Regis.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nTEACHER'S RESIDENCE\n\nI visited the teacher's residence three or four times to study the conditions from various angles. Mr. Buck, from the Engineering Branch, was at the Agency Wednesday afternoon May 17. I took the liberty to ask him to look at the building, the water situation and the heating plant. His time was very limited as he had to make a complete study of the Agent's Residence and he could not devote the time necessary to recommend any solution to the above mentioned problems. I thought, however, that even a casual glance might be helpful to him, if it were necessary to revisit the Agency at some future date.\n\nThe Indian Agent had quite a difficult task endeavouring to accommodate Mr. Buck, the Doctor, Inspector Wescott, and myself. I wish to express my appreciation for the cordial way in which he accomplished his duty.\n\nThe exterior of the teacher's residence is in need of paint. The windows and doors need adjustment. The walls, except those below the windows that are protected by the verandah, are streaked with water. This apparently occurs after every rain. I would suggest that the window casing be removed to determine the cause of this trouble. The spaces should be packed with oakum and caulked before putting on the casing and caulked again after the casing has been put in place. Grey caulking should be used as this kind may be painted. An Indian, a painter by trade, is available, provided he is hired in time. He expects 50\u00a2 per hour for his services.\n\n(over)\nThis work is mostly a question of labour which I am left to understand is rather difficult to obtain mostly due to the isolation of this reserve.\n\nThe furnace is of sufficient capacity to take care of the heating requirements of this building. It is a H\u00f6gla, No. 122, 23\u00bd inch fire pot and has a capacity from 12,000 to 16,000 cubic feet. This furnace was installed in 1927 when the building was erected and according to the file has not been touched since its installation. A complaint made after the first winter stated that the furnace did not give sufficient heat but apparently nothing was done as no reply appears on our files. The hood of the furnace is of a horizontal type; hence the pipes rise immediately above the furnace and run practically parallel to the ceiling of the cellar. Moreover, three of the hot air pipes are only 7 inches in diameter. One of these 7 inch pipes heats two rooms on the second floor which have a capacity of approximately 1000 cubic feet each. This would be more easily remedied if it were not for the ducts encased in the wall, which I presume would have the same area as the pipes leading to them. While I was in Cornwall I interviewed Mr. Edward Parker, plumber, who is willing to check up this furnace, install a new one (the radiator may be burnt which seems to be the chief defect of this type of furnace) for the approximate cost of $300. I believe, this could be done more cheaply, as he has given, in all probability, the highest that it might cost. I told him that we would inform him through the Indian Agent when to proceed with this work.\n\nThe water situation may be solved by several solutions. The most practical, I believe and the one I would attempt in my own home under similar conditions, would be to tap the casing of the present well approximately twenty feet below the surface which would be ten feet below the water level and run a 1\u00bd in. pipe below the frost to the teacher's residence to be connected with the present pumping unit. I believe, that at this time it is practically impossible to obtain a gasoline engine to drive the pump. The present pump in the teacher's residence could be used until a motor driven pump can be obtained.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\nCORNWALL, ONT., June 22nd 1944\n\nM.

If so, you will notice that the sleeping quarters comprise one rather small room upstairs with a low ceiling which forms the peak of the school. In other words, this one-room sleeping quarters is what we might consider as being the attic of the school with the exception that it is the extension of the school which comprises the living quarters.\n\nSuch a condition as outlined above does not altogether present a very healthy atmosphere and, while it might be tolerated if it could be possible to always find an unmarried teacher, it certainly could hardly be considered as providing proper sleeping accommodations for a family no matter how small.\n\nThis situation might be remedied for the benefit of not only the present but future incumbents of this school with an expenditure of less than $300.00. It is proposed, with your permission, to raise the roof on one side and thus provide suitable sleeping accommodation. The figure mentioned above will, I believe, cover all materials and labour required. Insofar as most of the interior work, the present teacher, Mr. Chisholm, would be very glad to do this himself. I am attaching a sketch giving a rough idea of what is proposed. It would be appreciated if authorization could be granted to proceed with this necessary change without delay as at the present time, it is possible to locate a carpenter who can do this work.\n\nJUL 9 1947\n\nF.

I understand from the present teacher, Mr. Ryan, that the residence is satisfactory as is without further alteration.\n\nIn view of the above, I will not proceed, at this time, with any alteration to the building but I would like authority to construct new steps to the class room from the outside just as soon as I can obtain sufficient materials. The entrance to the class room from the outside is very poor and much of the lumber has rotted. I would also like authority to expend around $30.00 for paint to decorate the interior of the residence part of the building. This has not been done for quite some time, apparently, and needs redecorating.\n\nI have a small amount of money on hand from the accountable advance forwarded for the construction of the chimney at the Cornwall Island West School and if you will forward me an additional accountable advance in the amount of $75.00, I think I can have both jobs above described carried out. I can not, at this writing, give you an estimate on the materials required for the repair or renewal of the entrance steps but it is not expected the cost of materials for this particular item will run in excess of $75.00.\n\nYour early reply is awaited.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6111, file 338-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing herewith three tenders received for wiring the Cornwall Island East School and Residence and supplying fixtures from the following Cornwall firms:\n\n1. \"Elco\" Electric - total price $290.00 plus $30.00 additional for 60 amp. wire service for electric range in Residence.\n\n2. Cornwall Electrical Sales - total $302.80 with additional amount of $40.00 for heavy duty range service.\n\n3. Campbell's Electric - total $308.95. No additional amount quoted for 60 amp. service but would suggest an amount of approximately $35.00 be added.\n\nIt would appear from the above that the quotation submitted by the \"Elco\" Electric, which includes all inspection fees, is the better price submitted. It is not known whether you would like to have a 60 amp. service installed in the event you would want facilities for an electric range at a later date. If so, it would appear that it would be well to have this done at the same time. You will note the price of this firm is very reasonable quoting the total of $320.00 for the complete installation of fixtures with heavy duty service.\nI might add that \"Elco\" Electric did the job for us at the west end school on Cornwall Island in a very satisfactory manner.\n\nAlready the power company have the poles installed as far as the east end school and will be putting up the wires shortly. There is no doubt that if we could have this work done now it would be an added inducement to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for this school. Your reply is awaited.\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

The present playground is less than \u00bc acre in size and not sufficient for the large enrolment in this school. Adjoining land is being used by the pupils at the present time, and this is likely to be the cause of dissension.

The Department would appreciate if you would follow the Inspector's suggestion. Last year several summer courses were conducted in Ottawa. It might be well for you to communicate with the Department of Education and ascertain where they intend to conduct summer courses during the summer of 1938. Such courses, of course, are taken at the teacher's expense but the expenditure is not usually heavy as I understand the Department of Education does not make any charge for the instruction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nC.

It is equally as important that the 12 girls in Grades V to VIII, inclusive, are in need of instruction in Home Economics. This could be provided to the satisfaction of the teachers and to the advantage of the pupils in the 2 Cornwall Island Indian Schools by transporting Miss Peters and the 8 pupils (all above Grade 3) from the West End School, for a period of one-half day per week, to the East End School, where Mr. Chisholm could instruct the boys of both schools in Manual Training in the basement room, while Miss Peters would teach Home Economics to the girls in the regular classroom. Since there is an organ in this school, provision could be made for having music taught, as well as having a joint weekly, literary meeting of both schools.\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is suggested that the series of arithmetics in use in Grades III to VIII of the Elementary Schools of Ontario should be used in this school. Other text books used in Ontario in Reading, Social Studies and language work are also recommended.\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nCornwall Island East End Indian School Date of visit June 6th 1940\n\nPost Office address of school Cornwall, Box 1163.\n\nGrades I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX\nEnrolled 14 8 6 4 3 2 3 1\nPresent 13 8 3 4 3 2 3\n\nTeacher Colin J.

I understand that the school nurse, Miss B. Patterson, St. Regis, had called on the homes.\n\nWhile particular emphasis was placed by the teacher upon the essentials of Arithmetic and Reading, the Programme of Studies being followed by the teacher in Social Studies and Natural Science was limited. This may have been partly due to the shortening of the School Year from 10 months to nine months.\n\nWhile this school was opened in March 1936, 4 of the pupils who attended school for the first time with the opening of the new school have proceeded through the grades and qualify as High School Entrance Candidates this year. This is a commendable achievement in the furtherance of the education of the Indian children in the easterly area of Cornwall Island, when it is considered that no educational opportunities were available to this area, previous to March 1936.\n\nRecommendations for teaching aids as enumerated in the report for the West End school apply in a similar manner to this school.\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nIndian Affairs.

With the increased enrolment in this school, and indications of increase in the number of pre-school children, the recommendation is repeated that a Central School, located midway between the two existing schools be erected to accommodate the Senior pupils of both schools and that provision be made to teach Grades IX and X at this school.

The results were discussed with Miss Chisholm, who is anxious to become acquainted with the Programme of Studies for Ontario.\n\nThe installation of electric lights in this school has been a welcome improvement.\n\nWith four teachers in this school during the last three years, it is hoped that the services of Miss Chisholm can be retained.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n(Use reverse if necessary\u2014This end to be the top)\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nCornwall Island East Indian School Date of visit May 3rd 1950\n\nPost Office address of school P.O.

Youngsters bring their own cups. Good radio and gramophone in school and programs of Ontario Department are brought in and used. Toilets clean - one full of ice with which Mr. Superintendent Bonnah will deal. Supplies well supervised and adequate. Condition of room fair.\n\nI took Grade 1 for reading and had them at the board for word recognition and number work. They did very well. Most of them could write their own name and address.\n\nGrade 8 were at the blackboard for a while and were tested in grammar, arithmetic and social studies. They were not as advanced as they should be at this time of the year.\n\nMrs. Gant is putting most of her time on the junior classes. This is as it should be. She is not an outstanding teacher, but this is a very heavy school. There are too many classes and too many pupils for one teacher. If we get some new schools on the Island there must be a new allocation of pupils. I felt that the teacher was doing as good a piece of work as could be expected under the existing conditions.\n\nThe five pupils in grade 8 all expressed the desire to go on to grade 9. I told Mrs. Gant that they were retarded and would have to do a lot of work before the end of the year if they were to go to high school.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.-ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n\nI.A. 401\n\nIndian Affairs.

I could take exception to Mrs. Gant's work in some things but she is doing her best and making a fine effort under difficult circumstances. She took grades three, four and five in reading and they were good average lessons. There was a good word study period. I had grades six and eight at the board and they were fair.

Mrs. Gant, with the willing co-operation of the pupils, had improved the attractiveness of the classroom with worthwhile pupil projects, orderliness of teaching aids and general cleanliness.\n\nOn a Composite Written Test, two of the Grade 8 pupils have reached a satisfactory proficiency for promotion to Grade 9, and encouragement should be given to the further education of these pupils.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\nI.A. 401\n(Use reverse if necessary\u2014This end to be the top)\n\nIndian Affairs.

A. Hosy, Supt. Welfare & Training\n\nFor the past number of years it has been customary for the children of the Cornwall Ild. W. school to go down to the Cornwall Ild. East school for homemaking and manual training classes. Mr. Chisholm took the boys for manual training, and Mrs. White took the girls for domestic science. In view of the fact that Mrs. White has a considerable number of girls this year in her class, and Mr. Chisholm has only a few, it would seem advisable for Mrs. White to conduct the girls' class in her own school and send only the boys down to the East school for manual training.\n\nThe only problem this would raise is the matter of the few girls in Mr. Chisholm's school who would not be able to get up to the West school for domestic science. At present we would be unable to arrange for transportation for these few girls up to Mrs. White's class. Nevertheless it is believed that the benefits offered by this change in arrangement are great enough to warrant adopting it.\n\nPlease let us have your views in this matter.\n\nT. L.

A. Hoey, Esq., Supt. Welfare & Training\n\nWith further reference to our letter of October 26, regarding arrangements to be made for manual training and home making for the boys and girls of the Cornwall Island schools, the following arrangement is being tried.\n\nThe girls of the Cornwall Island West School will take domestic science with Mrs. White in her own teacher's residence, as soon as this is completed, and equipped. The boys will go down to the East end school where they will have manual training with Mr. Chisholm's class of boys. The girls from the East School will go up to Mrs. Deer's Homemakers' Club on Wednesday afternoon when the boys are having manual training, and there they will be taught sewing.\n\nThis arrangement will go into effect next week, so there can be no report as to its success as yet, but it is felt that this should solve our problem for these two schools.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6112, file 338-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief, Training Division\n\nWith further reference to our letter of November 9, regarding plan for manual training and home economics training at the Cornwall Island Schools, this plan has been in operation for part of this month. Contrary to expectations, it has not worked out to the benefit of the pupils, as far as taking the girls of the East school to Mrs. Deer's Homemakers' Club on Cornwall Island is concerned. This club already has an enrollment of some fifteen women who come each week, and in a small home like Mrs. Deer's it has proved to be an imposition to expect her to take on nearly a dozen pupils from the school in addition.\n\nConsequently, this plan has been discarded for the East school, and Mrs. Chisholm has kindly consented to give these girls instruction in home economics in her own residence while Mr. Chisholm takes the boys downstairs for manual training, one afternoon a week.\n\nIf this step is approved by your office, it will be necessary to have authority to expend a sum of about $20 for Mrs. Chisholm to buy the needed materials for these classes for the balance of the year.\n\nT.

Benedict. For the month of September, Mr. Chisholm will be able to take over this work on a three-day per week basis. After that month it is expected he will be able to continue on a 4-day per week basis at least. However, I will advise you on this point later on.\n\nT. L. Donnach,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nFurther to Agency correspondence covering your File 33-6-11 W.T.I., May 16th, please be advised as follows. Only one application was received for the vacancy at the Cornwall Island East School and for obvious reasons, you will note, is not acceptable at this school. Further, Mr. Gordon states he would give no guarantee of completing the year as he \"just wanted to try it\". His application is enclosed in case that you would like to contact him with a view to placing him on some other Reserve. There is no guarantee, however, that he will go.\n\nRegarding the Manual Training Instructor's position, it is proposed to leave this vacant for the time being and Mr. Chisholm will continue to teach for the next academic year at least at the Cornwall Island East School. It is thought that even though Mr. Chisholm may not be able to teach the full month during September it is better for the time being that we can be sure of a teacher for that school for the year. Perhaps at some later date a suitable applicant might come along to fill the position of Manual Training Instructor.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nT. L.

December 18th.\n\n1931.\n\nMr D.C. Scott, C.B.\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nPursuant to our conversation of the 16th inst., I submit the following for your further consideration:\n\nThe Anglican Missions on the East shore of James' Bay and northward to the Eskimo Mission at Whale River were founded by the late Bishop Horden, who, as a missionary arrived at Moose Factory in the year 1851. The Anglican Church has been in occupation and until a few years ago in sole missionary occupation of that whole area; the result being that the entire Christian native population dwelling at, or dependent upon, such posts as Rupert House, Fort George and Whale River became members or adherents of the Anglican Church.\n\nThis state of affairs continued until a few years ago - I think about seven - when Roman Catholic agents took up their residence at Fort George and proceeded to erect a church with a large building suitable for Indian residential school purposes. These, and similar activities at Akulavik, N.W.T., were brought before, to the notice of the officials of the Department. (see, for example, my letter to you dated Oct. 12th. 1926.)\n\nAmong the results of these representations was the ruling set out in your letter, dated Dec. 28th. 1927, and addressed to the Rev. Dr. Westgate - reading as follows:\n\n\"It is thought that the denominations should respect the zones of interest which have been established and not encroach upon them by the extension of missionary effort upon which a demand for separate educational institutions might be afterwards based. This view seems entirely reasonable, and in future the Department will not recognize requests for aid to educational...\"\ninstitutions unless by pre-arrangement, and assistance must not be expected for institutions which encroach by the extension of missionary effort upon territory already provided for.\"\n\nAnother result of the consultations held in the years following the close of the war, was set out in the following letters:-\n\n\"The Hon'ble Charles Stewart,\nSupt. General of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\n\nApril 17th. 1922.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nPlease accept this expression of my appreciation of the sympathy and kindly courtesy with which you received the recent Deputation in connection with the Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThe decisions then agreed upon are, from the standpoint of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, most urgent. I, therefore, respectfully submit my understanding of them in writing, as follows:-\n\n1. It is agreed that the provision of buildings for Indian Education, in the form of Residential Schools, is a direct and sole responsibility of the Dominion Government.\n\n2. It is agreed that it is the purpose of the Dominion Government to provide, as soon as may be possible, the buildings required.\n\n3. It is agreed that, pending provision of the said buildings, the Dominion Government will provide the money necessary to enable the Church Authorities concerned to carry out urgent repairs on the buildings owned by them and used for the purposes of Indian Residential Schools.\n\nAn acknowledgment and confirmation of this letter will deeply oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) S. Gould,\nGeneral Secretary M.S.C.C.\"\nOttawa, April 21st. 1922.\n\n\"Dear Canon Gould:-\n\nI wish to acknowledge your favour of the 17th instant, setting forth your understanding of the principles discussed at the meeting last week, when I had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with the representatives of the Church Missionary Societies that are doing educational work among our Indian wards.\n\nYou may rest assured that it is my purpose to urge upon the Government the desirability of providing, as soon as possible, the residential school buildings that are needed to successfully carry out the work. As an interim arrangement, the Department of Indian Affairs will endeavour to have voted the funds necessary to enable the Church authorities concerned to carry out the urgent repairs on the residential school buildings owned by them.\n\nI have to thank you for your expression of appreciation, and I wish to assure the Church representatives of my continued interest in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D. (sgd) Chas. Stewart,\nGeneral Secretary Superintendent General\nMissionary Society,\nChurch of England in Canada,\n131 Confederation Life Bldg.\nToronto, Ont.\"\n\nI quote also from your letter to me dated May 26th. 1925:-\n\n\"I have your letter of the 2nd. instant, relative to repairs to church owned Indian residential schools. At an interview with church representatives, in April, 1922, the Honourable the Superintendent General stated that the Department would endeavour to keep the church owned buildings in a state of good repair, until such time as new buildings could be provided. Mr Stewart's letter to you of the 21st. of the same month reads in part as follows: \"As an interim arrangement, the Department of Indian Affairs will endeavour to have voted the funds necessary to enable the church authorities concerned to carry out the urgent repairs on the residential school buildings owned by them.\"\n\nThe intention behind the words quoted seems to me to be perfectly clear, and I am pleased to carry it out.\"\n\nTo revert to Fort George I find that our need of an Indian Residential School at that point was included in the list contained in my letter to you dated Oct.18th. 1924. A definite\nApplication for such a school was made at an earlier date, I believe, by the Bishop of Moosonee.\n\nThe urgency which this need has now assumed is shown by the following extract from a letter, dated Oct. 26th, 1931, from the Principal of our Indian Residential School at Moose Factory:\n\n\"I have had to refuse about 30 children admission into this school this summer. Our quota with Government grant is for 30 pupils as you know, but owing to deaths amongst our people including the Wynne family of Albany, I felt constrained to take extra children into the school so that last June I had 35 children in residence. Since the school opened after the summer holidays I have had 34 children in residence all the time and have again had to refuse others admittance. It is heartbreaking to have to do this, especially when the R.C.'s are begging and worrying our people to let our Protestant children go to their Roman Schools. Rev. Morrow, of Rupert's House, reports that six of his children have now been taken away by the R.C. Priest to the Fort George School and he further reports that some of the Indians at Rupert's House have stated to him that if they cannot get their children in our school at Moose Factory, they will have to let more of their children go to the R.C. School at Fort George.\"\n\nThis action of \"the R.C. priest\" appears to be in direct contravention of the ruling set out in your letter to me dated December 30th, 1921, from which I select this quotation:\n\n\"It has been decided to adhere more strictly to the intention of the Act as set forth in section 10[1] as follows:\u2014 \"No Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\" In the future, children from Protestant and Roman Catholic homes will be considered eligible for admission respectively, to Protestant and Roman Catholic schools only. We rule that wards of the Department of Indian Affairs should be admitted only to institutions conducted under the auspices of the church to which the parents themselves belong.\"\n\nUnder the circumstances just outlined, coupled with the inability of the Department to proceed, for the time being, with the provision of \"the residential school buildings that are needed to successfully carry out the work,\" (Vide Mr Stewart's letter quoted in full above), the Executive Committee of this Society decided, at its recent meeting, that our long-established interests in the region on the eastern side of James' Bay must be protected, and the demands of our people there for residential school education be met by the erection, this coming summer, at Fort George of an Anglican Indian Residential School. The Executive Committee further appropriated for this purpose - from one of the invested funds of the Society - the sum of $20,000.00. (twenty thousand dollars.)\nIn connection with this decision and appropriation, I now beg submit this written application:\n\n1. That provision be made in the estimates of the Department of Indian Affairs, for the forthcoming parliamentary year, for the payment of per capita grants for the pupils of an Anglican Indian Residential School at Fort George. The number of pupils to be thirty, at a per capita rate of $250.00 (two hundred and fifty) per annum.\n\n2. That pursuant to the principle expressed in the letter of the Hon'ble, the Superintendent General, quoted in full above, and in accordance with the precedent of certain refunds made to another church, the Department agree, at the earliest convenient date, to refund (without interest) to the General Treasurer M.S.C.C., the sum for capital expenditure (Viz; $20,000.00) mentioned in the next preceding paragraph.(i.e. at the foot of preceding page.)\n\nI respectfully urge both these requests upon your kind and sympathetic attention. I desire to emphasise, nevertheless, early favourable decision upon the first (the per capita grant) in order that we may proceed with our plans to send in the large amount of material required for the erection, next summer, of an Anglican Indian Residential School at Fort George.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nSG-G\n\nGeneral Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nP.S. I quote as follows, from a letter, dated July 31st. 1931, from Canon Griffin, our experienced missionary at Fort George:-\n\n\"I am sending a Census taken by myself to Bishop Anderson and I herewith attach a Summary of same -\n\nThere are 38 Widows\n\" \" 11 Widowers\n\" \" 116 Married Men\n\" \" 116 \" Women\n\" \" 40 Unmarried people over 21 years of age.\n\" \" 74 Young People unmarried from 16 to 21.\n\" \" 159 Children from 7 to 15 years of age.\n\" \" 141 \" 6 years and under.\n\n695 - All fully attached members of the Church of England in Canada -\n1 - Attached to Roman C.

As all grants of this nature must be preceded by Parliamentary sanction it would seem impossible for the Department to pledge itself to refund of expenditure undertaken by the Church and it is thought well to endeavour to obtain a grant for a building in the usual way.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

If there are not sufficient of these to fill the schools, you might communicate further with us in connection with the half-breeds, giving full particulars regarding those you consider might be admitted.

As he will not return for some weeks I am venturing to write to you direct regarding the question of per capita grants for the new School at Fort George, James Bay. I understood before I left for the North that you were good enough to give favourable consideration to this matter, and that it was to be included in the Supplementary Estimates submitted by you to Parliament. I have no information as to what was finally decided by the Government in this connection, and would be very grateful to you if you could see your way to let me know at an early date, in order that I may be guided in connection with this matter.\n\nPerhaps I should explain that this Indian Residential School will come under the Arctic Mission, of which I have special general charge, and therefore the matter presses upon me at the moment more than upon any other officer of our Church.\n\nI regret that owing to pressure of business during the closing session of Parliament it was not possible for me to secure an interview with you, but I hope that at some future time I may have that honour.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

He stated that the Church had erected a school and were not at that time asking the Department to contribute towards the cost of the building but wished only to receive a per capita grant for the Indian children in attendance.\n\nIf provision is made, it will be necessary that the Appropriation for Indian Education be increased next year by the amount of the grant allowed.\n\nFor a number of years, the Department has provided a grant towards teacher's salary in conducting a day school at this point and also has paid accounts for fuel and janitor service and rent of building for school purposes.\n\nIndian Affairs.

These were not shipped until Saturday, July 7th which was the day that the Nascopie sailed.\n\nWe will be pleased, therefore, if you would kindly get in touch with this firm and instruct them to arrange for the shipment to be re-forwarded to Moosonee, Ontario for forwarding to Charlton by Hudson's Bay Company vessel at that point.\n\nWe are enclosing copy of the Bill-of-Lading received from them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFor HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY:\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor District Manager.\n\nEnclos.\nFort George Aug. 23rd 1935\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs the School at Fort George does not start until Sept. 1st I will be unable to examine any of the children being admitted to the school. I have asked Mr. Jones to send their application forms in by the first mail and I will examine the children next year.\n\nIn talking over the school terms with Mr. Jones we decided that it would be much better to close the school each year on June 15th and reopen on Aug. 15th. In this way I will be able to see the pupils and the school in operation and it will also be better for the Indians as they can get away then for the winter hunt instead of having to bring their children back to the Post in the fall.\n\nUnless I hear from you to the contrary the Fort George Ang. Res. School will close and open on the above dates.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.L. Tyrer\nAgent.\nOttawa, September 5th, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the Fort George Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department has no objection to the holidays being taken from June 15th to August 15th. I would point out, however, that grant is only allowed for forty-three (43) days' holidays each year; consequently, if the school begins holidays on June 15th, the Principal, in preparing the June quarter return, may ask grant for the full quarter for each pupil who has been in residence. This will mean that fifteen (15) days of the holiday period have been allowed on the June quarter grant.\n\nWhen preparing the return for the September quarter, grant should be requested for each pupil who has been allowed home on holidays and who returned to the school on August 15th for 74 days (balance of holidays - 28 days; August 16 days; and September 30 days). In other words, in preparing the September return, grant should be requested for the actual number of days each pupil is in residence during the quarter plus 28 days, the balance of the holiday leave.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Tyref,\nIndian Agent,\nMoose Factory,\nvia Moosonee, Ont.\n\nPP/O'M.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI desire to inform you that, from January 1st, of next year, arrangements have been made for our Society to assume responsibility for the administration of the Indian Residential School at Fort George on the eastern shore of James Bay. When I visited this school last July, I learned that it had a capacity of 80 pupils, but only approximately half that number were in residence at that time, owing to a shortage of beds and mattresses. Immediately after my return to Winnipeg, ten extra beds and mattresses were sent forward, and as our Commission have prepared their estimates for the year 1936 on an average attendance of 50 pupils, at the per capita rate of $200.00 per year, I sincerely trust that a sufficient sum to cover this amount may be included in your appropriation for that period.\n\nAs further communication with this remote school will be practically impossible until navigation opens again in June or July of next year, the usual report of attendance will not reach you before that time. Payments to cover the grants for attendance should be made to our General Treasurer, at Church House, 604 Jarvis St., Toronto 5, Ontario.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, November 19, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, requesting a grant for an increased pupilage at the Fort George Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as the Department has received very definite instructions from the Minister of Finance to make no increases in our Appropriation, I regret that it will not be possible to provide for an increased pupilage at this school during the coming fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Indian Residential School.\n\nPer capita allowance for this school has been paid since February 1st, 1933. Since that time, provision has been made in our appropriation for a pupilage of thirty-five (35) only. Owing to definite instructions that have been received, we are not permitted to increase the pupilage at any Indian residential school at the present time. Under these circumstances, it will not be possible to allow grant for more than thirty-five (35) during the balance of this fiscal year nor during the fiscal year 1937-38.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

Jones, B.A., who has filled the Principalship of our Society's School at Fort George for five years, will retire from that position next July, and our Society will appoint, subject to the approval of your Department, the Rev. Bertram Samuel Greene, to take his place.\n\nMr. Greene, who is 30 years of age, is a graduate in Theology of Wycliffe College, Toronto, and in addition to the training he received there, he has had very considerable experience in institutional work. The following quotation from a testimonial furnished by the authorities of one of the institutions where he worked, will speak for itself:\n\n\"On an average we have one-hundred and forty girls and boys, a great variety of dispositions to deal with. Mr. Greene through the grace of God gave each one love; he taught them to sincerely read their Bibles; to love all that is noble and good and to pray with reverence. By example he has taught them that the better things in life bring real happiness and joy and he has been unsparing in his efforts to teach them clean healthy sports. In fact since he has come to the Home, it has been a different place. . . . . . . . .\n\nI have been in charge of this Home for nearly twenty years, and never had children looked to God with such confidence as the children are doing today. God has given us such splendid Clerical Friends in the past, who have helped such a lot, but never with such results as Mr. Greene has had. The children love him so dearly it will be a terrible parting.\"\nAs Mr. Greene has had a business training we consider ourselves fortunate in being able to secure his services for the important position in question, and I sincerely trust that his appointment may meet with the approval of your Department.\n\nHe is engaged to be married to an Honor Graduate in Sociology of Toronto University; and it is my understanding that he will be married in the very near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/KH\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 6th, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, the Department approves the appointment of Rev.

It was therefore decided to allow the salary of a teacher until June 30, 1938, at which time this payment would be discontinued.\n\nWe were informed that Miss Vera Calvert Rutherford would be the teacher in charge of the classroom.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L.

Westgate, Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada wrote to the Department under date of the 23rd October, 1942, from Winnipeg, as follows:\n\n\"The Principal of our Fort George School, P.Q., has informed our Commission of some Eskimo families living along the eastern shore of the Hudson and James Bays, and he desires to know if the children of school age in these families may be admitted to his school on a per capita grant earning basis.\n\n\"While it is my understanding the Dominion Government has ruled that the status of the Eskimo and Indians are identical, I will be obliged if you will let me know if the Eskimo children mentioned, up to 10 in number, may be received as per capita grant earning pupils into our Fort George School.\"\n\nDr. McGill pointed out that 50 pupils is the quota for the residential school at Fort George and the last report received showed an attendance of 40 pupils. He remarked that the admission of 10 Eskimo children would bring the quota up to the number agreed upon. The Chairman thought Dr. Westgate was justified in asking for the admission of Eskimo children so long as the quota of 50 pupils was not exceeded. The Chairman agreed with Dr. McGill that the same procedure would be followed in Quebec as in the Northwest Territories with respect to the payment for the education of Indian and Eskimo children. Mr. Cumming pointed out that no provision had been made in the estimates for the education of Eskimo children at Fort George. He referred also to a remark made by Reverend Father Plourde during one of his visits to Ottawa that 15 Eskimo children were ready for admission to schools at Fort George. Father Plourde had been asked to submit full particulars but no further information or correspondence has been received to date.\n\nCharles Camsell,\nCommissioner.\nMinutes of the One Hundred and Forty-ninth Session of the Northwest Territories Council held in the office of the Deputy Commissioner on Wednesday the 3rd March, 1943, at 11:30 a.m.\n\nThe Chairman remarked that Dr. Jenness might be consulted and if the National Museum was interested the material could be brought to Ottawa. Agreed.\n\n7. Education -\n\n(i) Scholarships\n\n(ii) Day Schools -\n(a) Fort Simpson, N.W.T.\n\nThe Secretary reported that in a letter dated 5th September, 1942, His Lordship Bishop Sovereign requested financial support for St. David's School at Fort Simpson, N.W.T., despite the fact that the attendance for the quarter ended 31st December, 1942, was less than the average required in order to earn the grant.\n\nSt. David's Mission School was opened in 1901 and has been in operation almost continuously since that time. The Northwest Territories School Ordinance provides for the payment of special grants to any school whether organized according to law or not. The established policy has been to support day schools in southerly or Indian Territory to the extent of $200.00 per annum - $50.00 per quarter. The only departure has been the cases of schools at Fort Smith and Yellowknife where qualified teachers are employed, the Alberta curriculum taught and exceptional circumstances prevail. Payment of the grant is based on submission of quarterly returns and provided the average daily attendance is five or more.\n\nAlthough it is the custom to require an average daily attendance of five or more in order to earn the grant, nevertheless in view of special conditions and circumstances which exist at times, and realizing the need for maintaining educational facilities at all strategic points, the Department has on occasion allowed a portion of the grant when the average attendance was less than five.\n\nIn 1933-34 the average attendance at St. David's school was below the required figure but the Minister of the day approved of one-half the regular grant being paid, that is $25.00\nper quarter or $100.00 per annum. Apparently the same situation is again developing at Fort Simpson as it is noted from the last return that the total attendance is only five made up of three white and two half-breed children.\n\nIt was moved by Mr. Cumming, seconded by Mr. Daly, that in view of the fact that St. David's is one of the oldest schools in the Mackenzie District and the desirability of maintaining two mission schools in settlements where there are children of both denominations and the distinct possibility that the settlement of Fort Simpson will expand rapidly when the road and other transportation facilities now under construction are completed and the need for schools will be even much greater than at present, that if St. David's Mission School is kept open for the benefit of whatever pupils attend, one-half the regular grant be paid, that is $25.00 per quarter or $100.00 per annum. This action will not create a precedent. Carried.\n\n(ii) (b) Fort Chimo, Que.\n\nStand.\n\n(iii) Residential Schools, Fort George, Que.\n\n(a) Anglican\n\nDr. McGill reported that the Anglican residential school at Fort George had burned down, Stand for further information.\n\n(b) Roman Catholic\n\nStand.\n\nCharles Camsell,\nCommissioner.\nOttawa, April 16, 1943.\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nIt is my understanding that you will discuss this afternoon with certain officials of the Department of Munitions and Supply the desirability of taking steps, in the immediate future, to rebuild the Fort George Indian Residential School.\n\nThe records of this Branch indicate that this building was destroyed by fire on January 26, 1943. It had at that date an enrolment of 50 pupils, for which we allowed grants at the rate of $200.00 per pupil per annum. It is unnecessary to state that these grants will again be paid just as soon as the new building is in operation. Provision has been made in the 1943-44 estimates for such payments.\n\nIn view of the large number of Indian day and residential schools destroyed by fire in recent years, only one or two of which have been rebuilt, accommodation at Fort George is very much needed, particularly in view of the fact that this is the only institution designed to meet the needs of the Indians who are members of the Anglican Church in that area.\n\nShould the officials of the Munitions and Supply Department require additional information, I want them to feel free to communicate with me by phone.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector.\n\nReverend Canon L. A. Dixon, M.A., C.B.E.,\nActing Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Since that time the yearly cost of maintenance has averaged about $21,000. The following are the official figures for the past four years:\n\nFiscal Year 1940-41 - $16,387.25\n\" 1941-42 - 20,075.22\n\" 1942-43 - 26,209.98\n\" 1943-44 - 23,656.17 - (This item is subject to adjustment when final figures available)\n\nRevenue - Departmental receipts in respect of the reindeer industry consist of the proceeds of meat and hides sold from the main herd. These are surplus products after providing for direct relief, donations to missions and meat for the local medical officer and camp purposes. The sales are made to residents of the district, native and white, who are in a position to pay for these products. The proceeds of meat disposed of in lieu of wages are included in the sales. The following are the revenue returns for the past four years:\n\nFiscal Year 1940-41 - $574.15\n\" 1941-42 - 1,924.90\n\" 1942-43 - 3,469.70\n\" 1943-44 - 6,707.60 - (This item is subject to adjustment when final figures available)\n\nUtilization of Reindeer Products - The original stock of 2,370 reindeer from Alaska delivered to the Canadian range east of the Mackenzie delta in March, 1935, had increased by the summer of 1943 to more than 9,000 heads, in three herds - 6,157 deer in the main herd on the reserve and 3,173 animals in two herds under native management near the Anderson and Horton Rivers. During the development of the reindeer herds, meat and hides are provided for the use of those directly engaged or connected with the herding work. In addition meat is available for direct relief and large quantities are supplied each year to the mission hospitals and residential schools in the Akivik area as a contribution toward the maintenance of these institutions for the benefit of the natives. More than 1,000 carcasses from the main herd have been supplied free to the missions. These represent a value at local prices of about $23,000. The hides are used for local purposes with a number of surplus hides being made available for shipment to needy Eskimos in the Eastern Arctic.\n\nIn the case of native herds the natives in charge are allowed to take meat, hides, sinews, etc., from surplus stock for their own use or to sell or exchange for necessary cash, furs, supplies or services. Any cases of destitution in the vicinity of the herds are to be supplied with reindeer products on a basis of replacement from the main herd.\nGrants - aid -\n\nThe N.W.T. Administration pays the following annual grants in support of the various schools:\n\n- Residential schools - $400 per annum.\n- Some day schools in Mackenzie District - $200\n- Day schools in Eskimo territory - $250\n- Fort Smith Day School - $500\n- \"Public\" - $700\n- Yellowknife - $1,500\n\nIn addition to the regular grants the N.W.T. Administration also furnishes school supplies.\n\nThe Northwest Territories Council has approved payment from the Territorial Liquor Fund of the cost of correcting examination papers of the Fort Smith and Yellowknife Public Schools.\n\nCurriculum taught -\n\nThe Alberta Curriculum is taught in most of the schools of the Mackenzie Districts. In the Eastern Arctic where the population is almost exclusively Eskimo the Missionaries teach a few elementary subjects including reading, writing, drawing, etc.\n\nMaintenance of children in residential schools -\n\nThe Northwest Territories Administration pays $200 per annum for each of the destitute or orphan children maintained in the residential schools. These children are admitted under special application form certified by the parent or guardian, the local representative of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the District Agent. A certificate of health is given by the resident Medical Officer.\n\nSchools in Eskimo Territory of Quebec -\n\nAs the Administration of Eskimo Affairs has been vested in the Northwest Territories Administration provision has been made for the payment of grants (on the same basis as those of the N.W.T.) toward the maintenance of residential and day schools operated within Eskimo Territory of the Province of Quebec.\n\nAt the present time there are two residential schools at Fort George, P.Q., one operated by the Anglican and the other by the R.C. Mission. Provision has been made for the maintenance of 10 pupils in each school @ $200 per annum, each, and in addition the schools will receive the regular grant for residential schools of $400 per annum.\n\nAnglican residential school at Fort George, P.Q., destroyed by fire. Until now school constructed pupils are maintained in the residential school at Moose Factory.\n\nBiscuits for Eskimo children attending day schools in Eastern Arctic -\n\nWith the approval of Dr. L. B. Potts, Director, Nutritional Services, Department of Pensions and National Health, arrangements have been made to supply the Mission schools of the Eastern Arctic with a special brand of biscuits for distribution as circumstances permit, to the pupils enrolled.\nApril 24, 1946\n\nThe Northwest Territories Council\n\nSchools in the N.W.T.\n\nAuthority - The schools of the Northwest Territories are operated and assistance given under authority of:\n\n(a) Northwest Territories Act.\n(b) The School Ordinance.\n(c) The School Assessment Ordinance.\n(d) The School Grants Ordinance.\n(e) Local Administrative District Ordinance.\n\nSection 6 of the School Grants Ordinance authorizes the payment of special grants to any school whether organized according to law or not.\n\nSection 74 (sub-section 17) of the Local Administrative District Ordinance authorizes the Local Trustee Board to pass by-laws granting sums of money from time to time in aid of schools within the district. As the School Ordinances were passed prior to 1905 and designed to meet conditions within the province it has been suggested that these be consolidated and amended in order to meet present day conditions within the Territories. This work is receiving attention.\n\nIt has been suggested that a qualified school inspector inspect the schools of the Mackenzie District and afterward assist in the consolidation and amendment of the Ordinances as he would have first-hand knowledge of conditions and requirements.\n\nTypes of schools -\n\nThere are three classes of schools in operation within the N.W.T.\n\n(1) Residential schools - operated by the Missions.\n(2) Day schools -\n(3) Public day schools - \" School Boards.\n\nSchools in operation during 1943-44 -\n\n(a) Residential schools -\n\n(1) Resolution - operated by R.C.

It is possible that you might consider an observation ward at each one of the three points suggested above for troublesome or border-line cases, and if observation substantiates the insanity the patient would then be transferred south.\n\n(sgd.)

Indian Residential School for the quarter ended December 31, 1944.\n\nWhile I recall that you mentioned on one of your visits that you were rebuilding this school, we do not appear to have any written information to that effect. I would appreciate a letter from you outlining what accommodation you have provided. If possible, you should give the dimensions of the dormitories and a brief list of the other rooms in the building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. H. A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Avenue East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDESTROYED by fire in February 1943, this school has been rebuilt by the M.S.C.C. and was formally opened and dedicated, Sunday, July 9th, 1944, in the presence of Bishop and Mrs. Fleming, Canon Dixon, the school staff and over six hundred Indians. The Bishop of the Arctic, in whose Diocese it is, and who arranged for its rebuilding, presented Canon Dixon with a golden key in token of the handing over of the school to the administration of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission on behalf of the M.S.C.C. The new school has a capacity of fifty pupils with a staff of six or seven. The Rev. Howard B. Hamilton is the principal. Native crafts such as the making of canoes, snow-shoes, fish nets, and silk work, are being included in the curriculum.\nMarch 22, 1945.\n\nAttention Mr. Philip Phelan\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nAcknowledging your letter of February 27th #72-0-1, I regret that no express information appears to have been given to the Department in regard to the above school. I find incidental references in the correspondence, but now beg to give you the desired information. A picture of the school is attached and I may say that the building is 101'6\" x 65'.\n\nThere is a part basement in which the heating plant is located, a main floor with 10' ceiling and second floor with 8' ceiling.

Bishop Fleming personally planned and supervised the work and was given every assistance by the Government in the matter of priorities. Some work went on in spite of the winter on the inside of the building and it was finally completed in 1944.\nOur information is that the present enrolment is a little over 20 and that other pupils are expected. Unfortunately the Hudson's Bay Company's boats were delayed last summer and supplies of food and other items were not received until very late. The Principal was, therefore, unable to receive the children of Inlander natives and they were accordingly taken away with their parents. It is confidently expected that a full enrolment will be secured this summer, in readiness for opening at the latter part of August.\n\nTrusting this information will meet your requirements,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nHAA:WS\nEncls.\n1.

It was partly due to insufficient supplies and lack of some essentials. During the winter country game was very scarce. A severe epidemic resembling 'flu developed in the area during February, March and April. This strain of illness plus lack of fresh food and nothing such as milk, canned tomatoes or other canned fruit and vegetables was enough to bring many of the pupils below their threshold of sufficient nutrition. As a result when I examined them this summer, twenty-five out of the fifty, showed very evident indications of Scurvy. Sufficient concentrated vitamins were sent from my office to the school to treat these children and the principal was strongly urged to increase his stock of food supplies and to include such items as milk and canned tomatoes. These children do not receive milk as a routine. They never see fresh fruit and vegetables. Everything they eat is canned or is made up of staples such as flour and other cereals plus seasonal fresh country food which is not always sufficient even for the time it is available.\n\nThos. J.

Glen,\nMinister,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHonourable and dear Sir:\n\nRe: St. Philip's Indian Residential School,\nFort George, Que.\n\nI beg to make application on behalf of our Administration for an increase in the authorized pupilage at the above school. I may say that Anglican missionary work in this area was commenced in 1852 and educational work was carried on in a simple manner for a considerable period. In 1932 a residential school was built by the Church and thirty-five pupils were authorized, this number being increased to fifty in 1938. In 1943 this school was destroyed by fire and in view of the great need for such an institution our Missionary Society expended a considerable sum in constructing the present building in 1944. The Bishop of the Arctic (Rev. A.L. Flemming) was asked to plan the building and supervised its erection. He was under the impression that the Department had authorized an increase of pupilage to eighty but when the school was opened the number was restricted to fifty.\n\nThe basis of our request lies in information recently received from the principal of our school to the effect that he has the names of one hundred and eighty-six baptized Anglican children of school age in the area. By reason of the fact that we have been unable to admit more than thirty pupils, a number of Anglican children have been admitted to the school established by the Roman Catholic Church contrary to Clause 10, Section 2 of the Indian Act. Our principal claims that material is being assembled for the enlargement of the other school and this can be for no other purpose than admission of a larger number of Anglican pupils. In these circumstances we feel justified in asking that the authorized number of pupils be increased to seventy-five and I trust that this will meet with your approval.\n\nCommending this matter to your kind consideration,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) H.A.

Canon H. S. Shepherd, B.A.,\nas Principal of St. Phillip's School,\nFort George, Quebec.\n\nThe Rev. G. W. Fisher, L.Th.,\nas Principal of St. Alban's School,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nThe Rev. D. C. Wickenden, B.A.,\nas Principal of the Indian Residential School, Sioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nCanon Shepherd was formerly in charge of our school at Shingle Point in the western Arctic and took charge of All Saints', Aklavik, after its construction. He came out on furlough after a long term of service and has latterly been acting as Eskimo Missionary at Port Harrison, Quebec. As we expect a few Eskimo pupils at Fort George, his knowledge of the language will be invaluable.\n\nMr. Fisher had a long and successful term at Lac la Ronge and was transferred to Sioux Lookout only a year ago. We regret that the state of health of Mrs. Fisher has made it necessary for him to be placed within easy reach of medical care, and at his request we have favorably considered the change suggested. Mr. Fisher has a good knowledge of the Cree language and will have many points of contact with the pupils attending Prince Albert.\nMr. Wickenden has been acting Principal at the Gordon's School since the destruction of Lac la Ronge. He is a fully qualified teacher and prefers this appointment to that at Gordon's in view of the fact that he is more interested in the academic side of the work than the practical, and it would appear likely that for some time to come there will be the necessity of structural changes at Gordon's.\n\nWe can confidently commend these three men for the positions indicated and trust that their appointment may be definitely confirmed.

It was not possible to provide this amount in our current year's appropriation.\n\nPlease let me know if the requirements listed are intended for repairs to the present building or for the erection of an additional building. As a matter of fact, it was found possible to provide only $150.00 for repairs and improvements at the Fort George C. E. Residential School and you might specify what items are most necessary.

No. 72-0-5, I beg to state that the requirements listed for our Fort George School in my letter of May 4th are entirely for the purpose of providing a residence for the Principal at this institution. This additional accommodation was considered so urgently necessary, that our Society purchased all the buildings at Fort George which were owned and occupied by the Revillon Fr\u00e8res. The buildings were dismantled and the material moved to our School's location. From this material which cost our Society somewhere about $4,000.00, a residence for the Principal is being erected this summer, and the items given in the list embodied in my letter of May 4th were for the specific purpose of completing that residence.\n\nIn the light of this information I trust that your Department may find it possible to grant the sum of $551.00, and if this is done our Commission will meet the carrying charges.\n\nAs the first boat for Fort George is due to leave Moosonee on July 18th, a prompt reply will oblige.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW:BGS\nOttawa, July 5, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to your letter of May 4th, in connection with the erection of a residence for the Principal of the Fort George Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of May 14th, it is only found possible to provide $150 in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Fort George C. E. School. However, in view of your recent letter, it has been decided to allow the amount of $250.00. This will be the total amount that the Department can provide this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

F. McKenzie, Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, the Commission do not appear to have received the Night Watchman's salary for the Fort George Indian Residential School as set forth in the above letter.\n\nIt is possible that owing to the Fort George School having previously been under the administration of the Diocese of the Arctic, the salary cheques have been mailed direct to the General Treasurer, M.S.C.C., 604 Jarvis Street, Toronto.\n\nWill you be good enough to have this point looked up, as the Commission's records show no payment for either $26.17 or $37.38, whilst they should have received the sum of $280.00 per annum, being $40.00 per month from the 1st October to the 30th April in each year.\n\nShould these amounts not have been paid, may I request that a cheque issue in favour of the Commission in due course?\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM.S.C.C.\nMay 26, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to payment for the night watchman's services at the Fort George Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, payments for such services are made on receipt, from either yourself or the school principal, of a voucher for the services of the night watchman. As we have no record of having received any vouchers for this service for the year 1936-37, it was presumed that no watchman was employed. As our books for the fiscal year 1936-37 are now closed, I regret that it will not be possible to make any payments for that year.\n\nIf, however, you forward a voucher for the night watchman's services at the Fort George C. of E. School for the period October 1, 1937, to April 30, 1938 - viz.: a period of 7 months at $40.00 a month - a cheque will be issued.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

However, I thought you would be interested in knowing that the money is available if something is needed. In that event I should appreciate having full information regarding the materials required in order that purchase may be made by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Residential School.\n\nDr. Westgate is presently absent from the City but your letter will be brought to his attention immediately on his return in about a week's time.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.\n\nEWM/KH\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the last inst., No. 72-05, re a grant of $400.00 for any repairs that might be required at our Fort George School, I beg to state that the most urgent need at this School is the enlarging of the main school building, and I would strongly recommend that this grant be used in purchasing some of the material required for that purpose.\n\nYou may recall that this building was provided out of Church funds, and it was the understanding of our Bishop (Bishop Fleming, of the Diocese of the Arctic) that it had a capacity of 80 pupils. His understanding in the matter was subsequently found not to be shared by officials of the Department, who considered the air space provided insufficient for so large a pupilage. The only way to meet the wishes of the Department in this respect is to enlarge the School, and in view of the heavy expenditure which our Church has already made on this and the other buildings at this centre (including a church, a residence for the principal, a mission house, storeroom, etc.) it seems to me but reasonable to ask that some assistance be given us in the enlargement of the main school building.\n\nI have before me a fairly comprehensive list of the materials required for this project, and I have received one estimate on the cost of the same, delivered at Moosonee. The total cost up to that point is approximately...\n$2500.00, and to this would have to be added the freight for the rest of the way, and the cost of building. It is probable that the total cost will amount to about $3,500.00.\n\nWhile I think it likely that our Society would be willing to provide part of this amount if an assurance were given that an increase in the pupilage would be allowed, I still feel that there is a just claim on the Indian Affairs Branch to give us some help in providing additional accommodation for the children of their Indian wards at this remote centre.\n\nIt is now nearly ninety years since our Church began work at Fort George, and it is my understanding that practically all of the Indians in that and the surrounding settlements are members of our Church. We have done our utmost to help them and the Government in providing for their physical, mental and spiritual welfare, but our resources are limited, and especially under prevailing world conditions.\n\nIf the Department will agree to allow the $400.00 mentioned in your letter to be applied in the way suggested, and can make a further grant of at least $2,000.00 next year for the same purpose, in addition to granting an increase of ten in the pupilage, I will endeavour to persuade our Society to find the balance.\n\nAs the cuts in the grants which we consider were arbitrarily imposed during the years 1932-38 inclusive, meant a loss in revenue to our Society of approximately $142,000.00, and as we will suffer a further loss in revenue of at least $15,000.00 a year so long as the ruling remains in force that the pupilage is to be reduced to 92.24% of the number originally agreed upon, I think you will see that we cannot reasonably be expected to provide the full amount required for the desired enlargement of the main school building.\n\nAs the last boat proceeding to Fort George this year is scheduled to leave Moosonee Sept. 5th, it is now too late to forward any of the building material at that time. I trust, however, that the arrangement I have suggested above may be adopted, and steps taken to have all the required material go forward by the first boat from Moosonee next year.\n\nI will ask the Principal of our School at Fort George to furnish me with a revised detailed list of the minimum quantity of all materials required, and could let you have this shortly after it reaches me by the mid-winter mail, possibly towards the end of February or the beginning of March.\nThanking you in advance for any help you and your Department of Government may be able to give in this urgent and important matter,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW/KH\nOttawa, August 28, 1940.\n\nRe: Repairs, Fort George C. E.\nIndian Residential School.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 23rd instant, addressed to Mr. Phelan, of this Branch.\n\nIt was my hope that I might have an opportunity of having a personal discussion with you or someone representing your Commission, with respect to the operation of a number of Church of England residential schools.\n\nWhen I visited Chapleau a few weeks ago, I learned that the water supply there was scarcely adequate to meet the normal domestic needs of the institution and that it would be wholly inadequate in the case of fire. The estimated cost of installing an adequate water system at the Chapleau school is $3,000. No provision has been made in the estimates of this year, however, for this work. It was also impossible to include in this year's estimates the sum necessary to proceed with the rebuilding of the Carcross Residential School, and the water supply and sewage systems at the Lac La Ronge School are matters that have also been left in abeyance, owing to lack of funds.\n\nDo you consider it really wise that an attempt should be made by your Commission to extend\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Res. School Comm., M.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House, Alexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\neducational facilities at Fort George while the funds at our disposal are insufficient to keep in a proper state of repair the residential schools already established throughout the Dominion? My own opinion is that we should do all we possibly can, with the funds at our disposal, to keep the buildings already in operation in a high state of efficiency until, in the course of time, we emerge from this critical period resulting from the war. In any event, the matter would have to be discussed by you with the Minister before we could promise either additional funds for repairs at Fort George or an increase in the pupilage. I am personally of the opinion that it would be exceedingly difficult to secure from the Government such a promise. A few days ago I had a letter from the Indian Agent of the James Bay agency, in which the Agent criticized the operation of the residential schools in his district very bitterly. It is his opinion that the residential schools are a hindrance rather than a help to the Indians of the James Bay district. While I do not subscribe in any way to the views expressed by the Indian Agent, nevertheless these expressions received from our agents influence to some extent the policy of the Government.\n\nIs it your intention to visit Ottawa at any time in the immediate future? If not, you might make arrangements to interview the Minister during one of his periodical visits to the city of Winnipeg.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

BAILEY\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41 an amount of $400.00 was provided for repairs and improvements at the Fort George C.E. Residential School which is owned by the Church of England.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, Secretary of the M.S.C.C., was advised of the appropriation in a letter dated August 1 and requested to submit full information regarding the material required in order that it could be purchased through your Branch. I am today in receipt of a letter from him which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"On August 7th I wrote to the Rev. Principal Greame, requesting him to furnish me with a list of essential repairs, but owing to the lack of mail facilities from Fort George, I did not receive any reply to my letter until the 11th inst., when the following list and information reached me:\n\n\"School leaking badly. Need galvanized roofing to cover forty-five hundred square foot roof. One hundred and fifty feet ridge roll. One hundred and thirty feet end flashing. One hundred and fifty joists two inches by four inches by twelve feet.\"\n\n\"As this information was so late in coming to hand, and the end of the fiscal year being so near, I greatly regret that I quite overlooked your request that a list of the materials be sent to you to be\npurchased by your Purchasing Branch. The oversight was entirely due to the very brief space of time I felt was left to have the bills in your hands before the fiscal year ended.\n\n\"An order was at once placed with the Halliday Co., Ltd., Hamilton, Ont., and I am enclosing herewith their bill in triplicate for $509.61, and trust that under the circumstances I have mentioned, and the explanation I have given, we may have your Departmental cheque for the $400.00 promised.\"\n\nI attach the account to which Rev. Dr. Westgate refers and it would be appreciated if you would issue a purchase order for the amount of $400.00.\n\nR.A.

The Order Number on the slip accompanying the cheque was 6422 and the only explanation of the amount was that it was for \"supplies for Indian Affairs\", and March 31 was given as the date of invoice. As the amount does not correspond with any bill we have submitted, I will be greatly obliged if you will let me know for what bill it is the payment.\n\nIn Departmental letter dated August 1, 1940, No. 72-0-5, we were informed that the sum of $400 would be provided by the Department for any repairs that might be required at our Fort George School. I wrote about this on the 25th ult., addressing my letter to Mr. Phelan (as notice of the grant had come from him) and enclosed bills from the Halliday Co. Ltd., of Hamilton, Ont. for $509.61, requesting that a cheque be issued for the $400 to help to meet the same. Should the cheque in question have been issued in payment of the $400 grant promised, I would be interested to know why the amount has been reduced.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW/kh\nR.A.

The promise was embodied in a letter from Mr. Phelan to me on August 1st, 1940, the number of his letter being 72-0-5. I wrote to Mr. Phelan in this matter on March 5th last, and enclosed bills from the Halliday Company Ltd., Hamilton, Ont. for $509.61 and explained the circumstances under which the order for material for repairs was placed.\n\nThanking you in advance for any help you may be able to give in having the grant paid promptly,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW*WS\nSecretary of the Commission.\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant and I regret that your letter of April 26 was inadvertently overlooked.\n\nAs you were informed by Mr. Phelan $400.00 was provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41 for repairs, improvements and new equipment at the Fort George C.E. Residential School. In the case of Church-owned schools we can only expend the amount actually appropriated for them. In the case of Fort George an amount of $9.90 was expended in supplying the school with footballs that the Principal requested. As a result when the account for repairs was submitted there was only a balance of $390.10 available, which amount was sent to you on April 17 and, as you mention in your letter of April 26, has been received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have just received your letter of the 17th inst. #72-0-3, and note that although the December Quarter return for our Fort George School has reached you, the return for the preceding September Quarter has not yet arrived. As we are in precisely the same position, having received a copy of the December return, but no copy of the one for September, I am telegraphing to Mr. Principal Greene today asking when the September return was posted and the method of transportation.\n\nI am aware that a passing plane brought some mail out from Great Whale River, and although I have no definite information on the point, I think it likely that the same plane brought out the December return from Fort George.\n\nIn due course I will advise you of any information I may receive through my telegram regarding the September return.\n\nWhile writing with regard to matters pertaining to this school, I wish to refer to the question of the salary of the Night Watchman.\n\nWhen I wrote to you on August 8th of last year, I mentioned that I was informing the Principal that salary for the Night Watchman would be provided for seven months at the rate of $40.00 per month. In my letter to him on the same date I said \"Please do not fail to make out the necessary monthly vouchers for the salary of the Night Watchman and state on the same 'Payment to be made direct to the Indian and Eskimo Residential...\"\nSchool Commission, M.S.C.C., 36-43 The Bible House, 184 Alexander Avenue East, Winnipeg, Man.*\n\nAs neither vouchers nor cheques have been received by our Commission for any month during the year 1941, I can only assume that they have either not been sent, or have been lost on the way. I am submitting herewith requisitions for the months for which the salaries were earned. I quite realize that your fiscal year 1940-41 ended on the 31st of March, 1941, and if there are insuperable difficulties in paying the grant for the January-March Quarter of 1941, we will be obliged to accept the inevitable. I cannot, however, see any reason why payment should not be made for the other months in 1941, namely, April, October, November, and December, and trust that we may be favoured with cheques for the amount due.\n\nYou will know from my letter to you on March 15, 1940, that the Night Watchman at this school is paid from the Commission's funds, and it will be a very real help to us if we can be reimbursed by you in the near future.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW*WS\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEncs.\nThe I. & E.

No. 44-6-5. There appears to be some confusion between appropriations for repairs for the Moose Fort and Fort George Schools for the year 1941.\n\nYour letter No. 160-2 of the 30th June, 1941, enclosed statement showing amounts provided for repairs and improvements. This statement sets out that for Moose Fort, Ontario, under General repairs and painting, the sum of $300.00 was provided, and under Fort George, Quebec, a similar sum was provided.\n\nThe Commission's letter of December 22nd, 1941, enclosed receipted accounts in triplicate, covering purchases for Moose Fort in the amount of $459.51. On January 16th, 1942, Departmental cheque No. 11901 for $284.30 was received in settlement of this claim.\n\nThe Commission's letter of February 10th, 1942, enclosed receipted accounts in triplicate, covering purchases for Fort George in the amount of $398.23. On March 6th Departmental cheque No. 62659 was received, stating that it covered purchases for the Moose Fort Indian Residential School.\n\nThus we have received two sums for Moose Fort, and none for Fort George. The mistake you appear to have made was in designating cheque No. 62659 for Moose Fort, instead of for Fort George. If this explanation clears up the matter to your satisfaction, I\nwill be glad to have a line from you to that effect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTERW:BGS\nOttawa,\nJuly 18, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 15, cheque 11901 for $364.30 was payment on your account of $459.51. The reason for the amount paid to you being less than $300.00, which was the amount provided in the estimates, was due to the fact that a previous payment of $15.70 had been made.\n\nCheque 68659 for $300.00 covered the payments to Fort George. It is evident from your letter that a mistake was made on the slip which accompanied the latter cheque, as it should have read Fort George not Moose Fort.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

July 23, 1942.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn your letter of the 30th ultimo number 160-2, you stated that the sum of $550.00 would be available for repairs, improvements, and the purchase of new equipment at Fort George School this year.\n\nIn a letter dated July 11th, and just received from the Rev. H. E. Hamilton, the new Principal at this school, he states that he and the Rev. B. S. Greene who has just retired from the Principalship of that school, had agreed that the school's most urgent need was a boat possibly about 30 feet long, and fitted with a marine engine for transporting children to and from their homes to the school, and in bringing in sick Indians for treatment in the hospital, etc.\n\nMr. Hamilton states that he knows a native who is an excellent boat builder, and that he could build the boat during the coming winter if our Commission guaranteed the provision of an engine.\n\nI have not yet had time to ascertain the cost of a suitable engine, but I am writing for the specific purpose of learning if you will agree to allow the $550.00 appropriation to be applied towards the cost of purchasing and shipping the same.\nMr. R.A. Hoey - 2 July 23.\n\nWhile it does not seem likely that the engine could be purchased in time to be shipped before navigation of James Bay closes this summer, it could be purchased and paid for before the end of March next, and sent forward as soon as navigation opens.\n\nTrusting your Department may authorize the expenditure of the $550.00 in the way suggested, believe me,\n\nfaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nBRW/GM\nHM WINNIPEG MAN JULY 30 1107AM 1942\n\nR A HOEY 297.\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BR DEPT MINES AND RESOURCES OTTAWA ONT\n\nJUST RECEIVED COPY LIST REQUIREMENTS OUR FORTGEORGE SCHOOL FORWARDED YOU BY PRINCIPAL HAMILTON THROUGH INDIAN AGENT ORFORD STOP AS COST ITEMS LISTED WITH FREIGHT WILL CONSUME GRANT AVAILABLE HAVE DECIDED CANCEL REQUEST MY LETTER JULY TWENTY THIRD RE ENGINE FOR BOAT STOP LAST BOAT LEAVES MOOSONEE AUGUST TWENTY EIGHT\n\nT B R WESTGATE\n\n1214PM\n\"B.F.\" SLIP\n\n\"B.F.\"\n\nFOR\n\nDate\n\nInitials\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6112, file 350-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor?\n\nCOPY\nOttawa,\nAugust 6, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a telegram dated the 30th ultimo Rev.

Orford,\nIndian Agent,\nMoose Factory, Ont.\n\nDear sir:\n\nEnclosed please find a Supplementary Requisition for the year ending June 30, 1943, made out for the Anglican School at Fort George.\n\nThe government grant of $550.00 is to cover this requisition and also any tax that may be on taxable goods on order. From the remainder of the grant, any freighting charges that may be incurred in shipping from Moosonee to Fort George may be deducted.\n\nAs this material is urgently needed, I would appreciate your closest co-operation in forwarding this requisition at your earliest convenience, that it may be filled and shipped in time to get the boat the later part of August, or the first part of September, as the case may be.\n\nHaving seen the condition of the staff residence, you will appreciate the urgency of this requisition. Anything you might be able to do by way of writing an accompanying letter when the requisition is sent in to the Purchasing Branch, if that isn't inconveniencing you too much, would earn the grateful thanks of the staff and myself.\n\nThanking you for the interest shown, I remain\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Fort George C.E. Residential School dated July 22, enclosing requisition for supplies for the school.\n\nMany of the items mentioned on the Principal's list are not usually supplied by this Branch as they are considered replacements. I refer in this regard to a request for can openers, frying pans and dishes.\n\nWe have supplied at other schools a reasonable amount of furniture when funds were available and you may, therefore, advise the Principal of the Fort George School that we will allow him an amount of $300.00 toward the purchase of furniture for the Principal's residence and the staff rooms. I believe he should arrange for the purchase of furniture to the above amount and he will be able to have the furniture reach Moosonee in time to be taken to the school before winter starts. When he has made the purchase you should certify the account and forward it to this office, when payment of the amount of $300.00 will be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. T.J. Orford,\nIndian Agent,\nMoose Factory, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOn July 23rd last I wrote to you to ascertain if the grant of $550.00 available for repairs, improvements, etc., at our Fort George School this year, could be applied towards the purchase of an engine for a boat which we hoped to build for that school this winter.\n\nShortly after despatching my letter I received from the Rev. Principal Hamilton a copy of the list of requirements for his school which he had forwarded through Dr. Orford, the Indian Agent. I immediately despatched to you a telegram dated July 30 cancelling my request that the grant be made available for the purchase of an engine, as I felt that the items on Mr. Hamilton's list were of greater urgency, and that precedence of claim on the grant should be given to those items instead of to the engine formerly requested.\n\nI have just now received from Dr. Orford, a letter dated August 23rd, and with it a copy of the list of requirements he had received from Principal Hamilton and which he had forwarded to you. He states that your Department will allow the sum of $300.00 toward the purchase of furniture for the Principal's Residence and the Staff rooms, and he asks me to \"arrange for the purchase and shipment to Moosonee as soon as possible\".\n\nBy the same mail I received your letter of the 24th inst. #44-6-5 in which you stress the importance of having supplies purchased through your Purchasing Branch, and it is for this reason that I do not feel justified in placing any order for the items required at Fort George without a specific authorization from you.\nAs the last boat of the season will leave Moosonee on September 21st, it is important that an order be placed at once by your Department for all the items given on the enclosed list, on the understanding that our Commission will meet any cost over and above the $300.00 which you are allowing. If we wait to ascertain the items your rules would permit you to buy, the last boat of the season may have gone before we could secure the others.\n\nAs Dr. Orford appears to understand that he had authority to ask our Commission to make the purchases it will be appreciated if you will let me know by air mail or wire if his understanding is correct. If I do not hear from you by the end of this week I will conclude that you are acceding to my request to purchase all the items on the list, and that you will advise me of the cost over and above the $300.00 which you are providing.\n\nIf the purchase is to be made through your Purchasing Branch the goods should be consigned as follows:\n\nRev. H.B. Hamilton,\nPrincipal, Anglican Indian School,\nFort George, Que.\nc/o Hudson's Bay Company,\nMOOSONEE, Ont.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW*WS\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEnc.\n## Fort George School\n\n### Supplementary Requisition for Year ending June 30, 1948\n\n| School | No. | Quantity | Description | Colour | Size | Price |\n|--------|-----|----------|-------------|--------|------|-------|\n| 12-545 | 1   | only     | Can opener  | large  | $2.75|\n| 11-554 | 1   | dos.     | Dinner plates (Green Line) | | $3.90|\n| 11-534 | 1   | dos.     | Oatmeal Bowls (Green Line) | | $1.15|\n| 11-534 | 2   | only     | Covered Veg.

Residential School. Local purchase was authorized, due to the fact that the supplies had to be secured in time to reach Moosonee before September 31, in order that they might be placed on the boat leaving that point for the Fort George C.E. School. The total amount of the expenditure made for this purpose was $445.10 but, as several of the articles on the account are not supplied by the Department, we told the Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C. that we would only allow $300.00 toward the cost. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would issue a purchase order for $300.00. This should be issued in favour of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada. The coding is as follows: 350-77-12-415.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nOctober 15, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing accounts covering the cost of articles purchased for the Fort George C.E. School. As you were informed in official letter of August 14, many of the items mentioned on the account are not usually supplied by this Branch, as they are considered replacements. However, as promised in that letter, I am requesting the Purchasing Branch to approve an expenditure of $300.00 toward the cost of the articles.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Residential School. Local purchase was authorized, due to the fact that the supplies had to be secured in time to reach Moosonee before September 21, in order that they might be placed on the boat leaving that point for the Fort George C.E. School. The total amount of the expenditure made for this purpose was $445.10 but, as several of the articles on the account are not supplied by the Department, we told the Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C. that we would only allow $300.00 toward the cost. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would issue a purchase order for $300.00. This should be issued in favour of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.

In this connection I beg to state that I have just received a letter from the Rev. Canon H.S. Shepherd, Principal of our Aklavik School, in which he points out that it is impossible for him to forward such requisitions at the end of each month because of infrequency of the mails. He also points out that by sending the requisition through the Indian Agent at Fort Norman long delays are inevitable, and reminds me that one of the requisitions he sent through the Indian Agent at Norman did not reach Ottawa until six months after it had been despatched.\n\nOwing to the distant location of our Aklavik and Fort George Schools, and the absence of frequent mails, it has seemed to me that the most satisfactory way of dealing with the question of payment of the Night Watchmen's salaries at these Schools, will be for our Commission to submit quarterly requisitions, and in the hope and expectation that you will agree with this opinion, I am enclosing herewith requisitions in triplicate for the salary of this agent at each of the two schools mentioned, for the quarter ending December 31st last, and will send similar requisitions at the end of March next for the March quarter and the month of April.\n\nShould there be any further specific information which you may require in connection with these requisitions, I will gladly endeavour to supply it during my visit to Ottawa the beginning of next week.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nREGRET INFORM YOU OUR SOCIETY'S SCHOOL BUILDING FORT GEORGE COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY FIRE YESTERDAY MORNING STOP STAFF AND PUPILS AND ALL OTHER BUILDINGS AND CONTENTS SAFE STOP CHILDREN SENT TO HOMES AT POST UNTIL PARENTS CAN COME FOR THEM STOP OUR COMMISSION MEETS THIS AFTERNOON CONSIDER\n\nSITUATION=\n\nWESTGATE.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I deeply regret that there has been a serious oversight in our office which accounts for our belated request. In assuming my new duties I was advised that matters relating to property and equipment were the concern of the Assistant Secretary and Treasurer, and I have normally worked on this basis, although we naturally confer where matters have to be decided upon. I now find that in the past my predecessor attended personally to the list of requirements forwarded to your Department by the Principals. In the present instance, Mr. Hamilton has written on several occasions but the matter has not been attended to owing to the misunderstanding as to responsibility.\n\nOur Principal tells us that Dr. Orford has been keenly interested in the matter of a water system, and that he discussed it with you in Ottawa and found your mind fully in accord. As a matter of fact, we in this office know very little about the construction of the new school as it was placed by our Missionary Society Executive in the capable hands of Bishop Fleming. Certainly we are warmly in favor of the suggestion that a water system should be installed at the time the school is being built. On grounds of health, protection against fire, and the convenience of those who work in the school we are entirely in agreement that such a system should be installed. In spite, therefore, of the fact that we have not been able to submit definite specifications I trust that it may still be possible to apply this $300.00 appropriation towards the cost of the necessary supplies. I take it the cost will be considerable but am confident it can readily be justified.\n\nWe wired to your Agent at Moose Factory this morning and he may be communicating with you shortly.\n\nAwaiting with interest your word, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.

Recently he advised me that the School at Fort George was in need of a Duplicator and that he knew where one could be obtained. He wished to have the machine to take with him to Fort George by plane and in view of the limited time I gave him authority to order it and have the account presented to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nI trust this meets with your approval.\n\n(Rev.

I am in receipt of a letter from the company today, stating they have not yet been paid. I would appreciate it if you could arrange to have cheque forwarded to them immediately.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, March 15, 1946.\n\nDr. T. J. Orford, Indian Agent,\nMoose Factory, via Moosonee, Ont.\n\nWith reference to issuing vouchers for the amount allowed the night watchmen at Indian residential schools in your agency, I would appreciate it if you would have these vouchers read as follows:\n\n\"To Allowance towards salary of night watchman\nat ......................... Residential School\nfor the month of ......................... $.......\"\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources,  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nIn further reference to your letter 160-2 dated August 30th, 1945, and in confirmation of my telegram sent this morning, I now beg to enclose receipted invoices in quadruplicate from the Winnipeg Paint and Glass Co. Ltd., totalling $300. This covers material which has been purchased to construct six storm porches at the above school. The new building was erected without any such protection and during the winter the need was found to be very great. There are four entrances on the ground floor and in time of blizzard the snow banked up heavily against them. Furthermore, the school was not provided with eaves-troughing and when the snow melted considerable ice formed in front of the doors and in some cases prevented them from opening. The trouble was specially bad in connection with the two fire escape doors in the upper storey. For lack of protection these also tended to become banked up with snow and seal. Our Principal, therefore, urged that porches should be constructed in all cases and we trust the trouble will now be remedied.\n\nI regret the exceeding lateness of this request, but may say that our Principal has been asking for so many things that it was difficult to know what was most urgent. There was a long delay in the early part of the year during which no mail was received from Fort George and our Principal left the school by plane in great haste a few weeks ago owing to the tragic death of his wife. We have had difficulty in communicating with him and I trust that it will be possible to apply the amount of $300 to cover this necessary material.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, March 29, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT,\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $300.00 was provided for repairs and improvements at the Fort George C. of E.

E. School during the fiscal year just closed. This is due to the fact that a payment of $217.82 was made to you in May, 1945. The account was forwarded to us under cover of your letter of May 16. The books for the preceding year had then been closed and it was necessary to charge that account to the appropriation for 1945-46.\n\nIt is our intention to pay the account you recently submitted, by using the balance remaining in the 1945-46 appropriation and charging the balance to our 1946-47 appropriation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend H.A.

Sir:\n\nWith reference to your requisition dated March 3rd for school supplies for the academic year 1947-48, I wish to advise you that we have requested our Purchasing Agent to arrange for the purchase of 5 rear seats, medium size; 1 - 4 Drawer steel filing cabinet and one small phonograph.\n\nIt is not the usual practice of the Department to supply phonographs to Indian residential or day schools, but in view of the remote situation of the Fort George C. E. School, we are making an exception. We feel, however, that the Victor records requested by you should be purchased from school funds.\n\nWith reference to your request for a wall case for storing books and classroom equipment, would it not be possible to have a suitable, inexpensive cupboard made at the school? You might let us have your views on this suggestion.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nRev. H. S. Shepherd,\nPrincipal,\nFort George C. E.

There has been no return mail from Fort George since Feb 27th.\n\nNora Tamook NO-017 I believe is still in the school but as I had notified Mr. Jones that I thought she was an Eskimo he seems to have concluded the same so left her name off the authorized list.\n\nAs I informed Mr. Jones that I would inspect all the pupils in August and September he is perhaps holding the form for that reason. (Philip Cox, no-33)\n\nI received another freight shipment for Leslie Garrett at Trout Lake which I will forward.

I would point out, however, that grant is only allowed for forty-three (43) days' holidays each year; consequently, if the school begins holidays on June 15th, the Principal, in preparing the June quarter return, may ask grant for the full quarter for each pupil who has been in residence. This will mean that fifteen (15) days of the holiday period have been allowed on the June quarter grant.\n\nWhen preparing the return for the September quarter, grant should be requested for each pupil who has been allowed home on holidays and who returned to the school on August 15th for 74 days (balance of holidays - 28 days; August 16 days; and September 30 days). In other words, in preparing the September return, grant should be requested for the actual number of days each pupil is in residence during the quarter plus 28 days, the balance of the holiday leave.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Residential School.\n\nWith regard to the boys you will note that the names have not been entered on the return consecutively according to number. This should always be done.\n\nWhen a pupil is discharged his number should be dropped and should not again appear on the return. A new number should be given to each new pupil upon entrance.\n\nAs the Department allows grant for 92 days holidays the Principal should, in preparing the September return, request grant as follows:\n\n1. For those pupils who were in the school at the time the holidays began and who returned promptly within two months of that date grant should be requested for 92 days.\n\n2. In the case of pupils entering the school for the first time during the September quarter grant should only be requested from the date of admission to the end of September.\n\n3. For a pupil who was allowed on holidays at the beginning of the holiday period and did not return within two months of that date grant should only be requested for the number of days actually resident in the quarter plus the number of holidays to which the pupil was entitled.\n\nW. L. Tyref, Esq., M. D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMoose Factory,\nVia Moosonee, Ont.\nIn the case of the Fort George School I note that the holidays began on June 15. Consequently, 15 days of the holiday leave was allowed the school in paying the June quarter per capita allowance. This left a balance of 47 days for the September quarter. Therefore, if a pupil allowed out on holidays on June 15 did not return to the school until August 20 the Principal should, in preparing the September quarter return, request grant for such pupil for the period August 20 to September 30 plus 47 days holiday leave.\n\nPart payment of the per capita earnings for the quarter ended September 30 is being forwarded to the Treasurer of the M.S.C.C. and the balance will be paid when a properly completed return is received by the Department.\n\nFor your convenience I enclose extra copy of this letter which you can forward to the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nAugust 18th, 1939\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Fort George Anglican Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: Allen Louise Pachahanoos\nAge: ten (29/7/29)\nName of Band: Fort George\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 144\nFather's full name and No.: David Pachahanoos #144\nMother's full name and No.: Betty Pisiniqian\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health:\nReligion: Anglican\nDoes applicant speak English?: No\n\nPreviously attended school for years:\nDavid Pachahanoos (Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNOTE\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

This would make the per capita grant for the June quarter $3091.51 instead of $2790.23 as was shown on the return.\n\nWould you please let me know the amount of the grant allowed for June and how the figure was arrived at so as to avoid possible mistakes in the future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 22, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nYour letter of October 9, 1939, reached the Department on the 19th instant with reference to the per capita allowance at the Fort George C.E. Residential School.\n\nIn this regard I may say that per capita allowance is provided for 50 pupils at a per capita rate of $200.00. If the average attendance in the quarter is 50 an amount of $2500.00 is paid, but if the average attendance is greater than 50 no additional amount is paid as funds are only provided for a pupilage of 50.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

These forms will be sent direct to you until we are notified of the appointment of a new Indian Agent.\n\nI wish to draw your attention to pupil no. 100, John Kitty, admitted to hospital on Nov. 21, with acute T.B., A hospital grant has been applied for in this case, but if the Department decides not to pay the same we shall ask for a school grant to be paid for the period during which this pupil is in hospital.\n\nRe pupil no. 0120, Lucy George, also in hospital with acute T.B., during the December quarter. This child is well enough to return to classes, but will continue to sleep and board at the hospital. A hospital account will be rendered for the December quarter and up to January 6, but after this date she will be placed on the school return as a grant earning pupil. Should the Department decide not to pay hospital account for this child we shall apply for a school grant for the period during which she was in hospital, as in the case of pupil no. 100, John Kitty.\n\nTrusting that this is the correct procedure and thanking you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSept 6th - Discharges turned out for approval.\nApplications for new pupils not forwarded.\n\n129 - Henry N.

George\n\nIn a recent letter from our Principal the following paragraph occurs and I feel that it should be passed on to you:\n\n\"One of our pupils died from the meningitis yesterday morning. Miss Scott had sent a wire about this boy to Dr. Orford some time ago, and the reply was that he had been active there four years ago when examined. However, in spite of that fact, Dr. Orford allowed him to be admitted to the school this year again. He had formerly been in school before the fire. Is there any way in which pressure could be brought to bear upon the authorities to have the Indian Agent examine the school children on his visit to the Post? Since I have taken over the School this has never been done. Now that the pupilage will be more or less the same for a few years, an examination at any time would be a big help to us. This death was an unfortunate occurrence, as the boy was of the Inlanders, and they have just started to put children in to the school again. I sincerely hope this incident will not have any serious effect upon the people.\"\n\nI trust that we may look forward to the time when pupils entering the schools on James Bay are examined as carefully as appears to be the case now at Aklavik. I feel confident that this is your desire and doubtless when the new institution is established at Moose Factory many improvements in the health situation may be expected.\n\nI am looking forward to another visit to Ottawa during the latter part of February and hope to have the pleasure of seeing you then.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFeb. 16, 1946.\n\nTo: Dr. P.E. Moore\n\nRe: St. Philip's School, Ft. George\n\nRev. H.A. Alderwood's letter bears out my point made on more than one occasion that residential schools in isolated areas constitute a health hazard until we can gather sufficient personnel to carry out immunization and X-ray survey. No reliable physical examination will discover tuberculosis in a child unless it is a gross lesion. The development of tuberculous meningitis can be, and frequently is, rapid in an apparently healthy child where X-ray has not been available to demonstrate an actual or potential chest lesion.\n\nThe particular case mentioned by Rev. Alderwood was referred to me by radiogram last fall by the nurse in charge at the C.of.E. Ft. George hospital, and from symptoms described it appeared to be a meningitis. This diagnosis - made by radio - was purely tentative and considered probably as tuberculous in origin due to the course of the disease which proceeded to death in January. Referring to my file on the boy, I had examined him on one or two occasions during previous summer visits and not on any occasion considered him a definite case of primary tuberculosis though I did list him as a suspect and for further examination. Under present conditions such an examination reveals only gross lesions.\n\nCertainly at time of entrance to school the case did not show symptoms referable to a developing meningitis. If he had, he would have been placed in hospital.\n\nRev.

Hoey,\nDirector of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nReverend Father Belleau, in charge of both the Fort George and Albany Residential schools, has asked for the following improvements for these two schools:\n\nI.--Fort George:\n\n(1) A small outer building for implements and farm machinery 25' X 35'.\n\n(2) Outside bake-shop 25' X 18', the oven will be constructed of second-hand bricks by one of the Brothers attached to the school.\n\n(3) About thirty-five gallons of paint would suffice to paint the exterior of the school. The labor for painting as well as for the construction of the two buildings mentioned above would be supplied free of charge by the principal.\n\nII.--Albany:\n\nAccommodation for sick pupils at the Albany school is very primitive and Father Belleau suggests that Porch-Solarium, 10 feet long by 8 feet wide might be a good solution for this problem. He estimates that the cost of this structure would be between four and five hundred dollars. As in the case of the Fort George School, the principal would supply all labor free of charge.\n\nI hope that you will be able to provide for the above improvements in the coming estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Flourde, O. M. I.\nNovember 2, 1938.\n\nFather Belleau informs me that he received news by wireless that the laundry building of Fort George school was destroyed by fire about the 28th of September. The building is a total loss also the equipment. This equipment consisted of a gasoline engine, a washing machine, a stove, water heater and a drying rack. Although Fort George is not a government owned school, it is to be hoped that funds will be made available to enable the principal to rebuild and equip a new laundry.\n\n(Sgd.) J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nNovember 17, 1938.\n\nEXD.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in which you refer to the destruction by fire of the laundry building of the Fort George R.C. Residential School.\n\nIt is hoped to have a small amount available in the appropriation for the fiscal year, 1939-40, for the purchase of equipment at this school. However, the funds, if provided, will not be available until after April 1st next. In the meantime, Father Bellean should write this Branch giving full information regarding the equipment he requires and when this letter comes to hand, his request will receive every possible consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.F.

Mr. LeCourte, the Beaver Laundry Machinery Co's representative at Ottawa, told me that the above price was F.O.B. Montreal. If the Department saw fit to purchase this washer, we would appreciate it very much. We could have it loaded in Montreal with the other supplies for our Missions.\n\nWould the Department's Buyer get in touch with The Beaver Laundry's Agent, or will you please advise with further particulars on the subject?\n\nThank you sincerely for your kind cooperation in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenri Belleau O.M.I.  \nVicar-Provincial\nOttawa,\nMay 11, 1939.\n\nEX'D\n\nDear Father Belleau:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant regarding the washer for the Fort George school I note that you state that it should be shipped to Montreal.\n\nOur Purchasing Branch is always anxious to obtain definite information regarding the point to which any purchase should be shipped.\n\nI would, therefore, request you to let me have, as soon as possible, the name or number of the wharf in Montreal to which the washer should be delivered and the approximate date on which it should reach that point.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief Training Division.\n\nRev.

If the Department cannot let us have these goods delivered at Moosonee, we would prefer having them shipped with our other supplies, from Montreal, as we have been granted a rate of favor on freight for our Missions, when shipped by carload lots. It would be advantageous therefore, to have this shipment go with other Mission goods, to save on freight rates.\n\nYour kind co-operation in procuring this material is very much appreciated, and we thank you sincerely.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n+ Henri Belleau O.M.I.\nMgr Henri Belleau O.M.I.\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nVOTE........................................

School.\n\nIt will be preferable to have materials sent direct to Moosonee, Ont., as our supplies have all been shipped from Montreal.\n\nAddress: R.C. Residential School  \nFort George, Via Moosonee  \n(Catholic Mission)  \nOnt.\nWe shall handle transport of these supplies from the end of the rail road to Fort George. If everything arrives in the first week of August, it will be in time for the schooner.\n\nWe appreciate very much what you are doing for our missionary schools. It helps considerably, especially at Fort George where pupilage is less than 50% of the real number of children.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n+ Henri Belleau\nVic. Apost. of James Bay.\nOttawa, August 1, 1941.\n\nDear Bishop Belleau:\n\nI desire to refer to Your Lordship's letter of May 25, enclosing requisition for building material for the Fort George R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you were previously informed, there was an amount of $800 only, provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and the purchase of new equipment at the Fort George R. C. School. When prices were obtained on the articles requested on your requisition, it was found that the total cost exceeded $800. As a result it was found necessary to delete the last six items on your requisition.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. H.

September 15th, 1941\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have received your letter no. 72-4-4, dated 3rd instant, regarding school material requisition for the Fort George Residential School, and I wish to thank you for it. You mention that the requisition of May 29 has gone forward to the Government Stationery Office. This is quite satisfactory.\n\nWhen visiting the Fort George School lately, I was told that two requisitions had been sent, the latter to complete the first one. I am sending you the first requisition which is of course the most important, and would be much obliged if you checked up on it to see whether this or the latter requisition is the one which was sent to the Stationery Office.\n\nI regret imposing this trouble upon you who are busy enough without having to review such things as have once passed through your hands. I trust it will not cause you too much trouble; the last shipments are about to be made from here to Fort George, and it would be too bad if by mistake they ran out of school material. Winter transport of such articles is difficult by dog-team.\n\nThe laundry machinery ordered by the Department for the Albany Residential School has not yet arrived. One of the three pieces was not available, I believe, because it was still in use and could not be delivered. But the washer and the extractor were supposed to be on hand. In two weeks, transport by navigation will be at an end here. The purchase order dated July 11, is stamped with the name of H.J. Davidson. The Agent of the Beaver Laundry, J.L.C. Lecours had quoted prices on July 7. The order is numbered 8196, File no. 39,510-15-20-1.\n\nThank you for your kind cooperation in this matter and many others.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n+ Henri Belleau O.M.I.\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\nOttawa,\nOctober 6, 1941.\n\nDear Bishop Belleau:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th ultimo a requisition was forwarded to the Government Stationery Office for the supplies usually supplied to Indian residential schools and they were requested to rush delivery of these supplies to Moosonee.\n\nI have already written to you regarding the laundry machinery for the Albany School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt.

Residential School, which is a Church-owned institution.\n\nRt. Rev. Henri Belleau, O.M.I., Bishop of Moosonee, has submitted, for our consideration, the attached quotation which he has received covering the cost of articles which are needed for repairs and improvements at this school. You will note that the total amount of the quotation is in the vicinity of $650.00. I should appreciate having your approval to allowing an amount equal to that which we have in the appropriation; namely, $550.00.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\n| Quantity | Description

Hoey\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThank you sincerely for the telegram dated 11th instant re-requisition for the Fort George School. As you instructed, the order was immediately placed with the firm that had made the tender, in order that no delay would follow. They have been instructed to ship all material and date the accounts before March 31st.\n\nThe list of building material and equipment amounted to about $640.00, according to prices quoted by Omer DeSerres Limit\u00e9e, of Montreal. I submitted this to the Department because I had understood that an appropriation of $800.00 had been made for this requisition and that this same amount would be available. The order placed with the Omer DeSerres firm amounts to $550.00, as you instructed. Must we understand that their will be a balance of $250.00 to complete the expenditure of the promised appropriation? If such were the case, we would appreciate it very much if this encumbrance or balance were spent on hard brick for chimney building at the Fort George school.\n\nWithout further writing on our part, on this subject, because of the proximity of the end of the fiscal year, if there remains the amount of $250.00, we would appreciate that the Department's Purchaser place the order for Hard Brick (not pressed), to be delivered at Moosonee, Ont.\n\nI would be much obliged to you if you could let me know what are the last decisions and possibilities concerning this requisition for the Fort George school. Thank you for your very kind cooperation.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n+ Henri Belleau O.M.I.\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay.\nOttawa,\nMarch 23, 1943.\n\nDear Bishop Belleau:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, in which you state that you have placed the order with Omer DeSerres, Montreal, for material required for the Fort George R.C. School. I note that you are under the impression that an amount of $800.00 has been provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school. I regret that you were apparently misinformed regarding the amount, because the sum of $550.00 was the total provided.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. H. Belleau, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay,\nMoosonee, Ont.\nMr R.A.Hoey  \nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nThank you for your letter of the 23rd ultimo re-requisition for the Fort George school. Order given to Omer DeSerres L\u00e9t\u00e9 does not exceed $550. If by mistake, this firm sends all material mentioned in their tender or quotation, balance of account will be paid by us, provided the Department pays $550.\n\nI had asked prices on material and not knowing at the time the exact amount, I had submitted list of material which amounted to about $640. Afterwards, on reception of your telegram, I got in touch with DeSerres and corrected my error concerning amount appropriated by Department.\n\nThank you for notifying me.\n\nYours truly,\n\n+ Henri Belleau  \nVicar Apostolic of James Bay.\n\nP.S.

Residential School.\n\nIn memorandum dated March 8, 1943, to the Deputy Minister approval was requested for Bishop Belleau purchasing materials to an amount not exceeding $550.00. The Deputy Minister approved this action and it would, therefore, be appreciated if you would issue purchase order covering the attached voucher. The coding is as follows: 351-77-10-691.\n\nR.A.

J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity,\nOttawa.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWe have gone over your plans which were enclosed with your letter of March 1st, and we are unable to give you a very definite estimate on the wiring supplies because we do not know what type of building is to be wired.\n\nIf this is a new building there would no doubt be some changes, and if it is a building which was constructed some time ago, you might possibly want part of it in concealed wiring and some of it in open wiring. This has not been stated in your plan, and there is no mention made of floor plugs or the type of drop lights, or whether you want wall switches or pull-chain receptacles.\n\nTherefore we have quoted porcelain pull-chain sockets and also added about 25 toggle switches in case you want to turn on lights by means of wall switches in some of the rooms. Although there may be some left over, they would be useful in some of the other buildings that you mention that might be added to this later on.\n\nWe cannot make delivery this month, but we can quote you on the material and if you want to place your order with us, or for that matter, make payment if necessary to get in before the end of your fiscal year, we could make delivery in the following month, when our next shipment of Winchargers should arrive.\n\nTherefore, the following equipment will be necessary: Price, net f.o.b. Winnipeg\n\nOne rebuilt Delco Light Plant, Model 850 $156.00\nOne Model 150 Wincharger 231.20\n16 Cells, 17-plate, 360 ampere-hour batteries 220.00\n40-foot galvanized guy-wire tower 44.10\nWiring Supplies as per attached list, approx. 144.50\nWe are enclosing an illustration of the unit, also a pamphlet showing the battery. The tower will place the unit 45 feet above the ground.\n\nYou do not state whether or not you want fixtures in any of the rooms. For example, the kitchen has two lights. Would you want the regular kitchen units? These would cost about $2.00 each, net, but you would not require the porcelain pull-chain socket and the drop cord, which are already quoted. Other rooms might require some type of ceiling fixture, possibly a single or double fixture with a switch on the wall.\n\nThese are points which are not covered, also the matter of floor plugs in some of the rooms. For that reason the wiring price is only an approximate figure to which you would have to add something for the difference between the present drop cord and socket arrangement, and the fixture, which might be preferred.\n\nYou will note that we have quoted with this installation a lighting plant as an auxiliary, and therefore have quoted a 17-plate battery instead of 21-plate. Where you have an auxiliary plant it is not necessary to have the largest type of battery, because if you have failure of sufficient wind for several days, the auxiliary plant can be put into operation and the batteries fully charged. The same applies if a drain of higher than 10 amps. is required, when there is no wind and the batteries are in a semi-discharged condition. It is advisable that the batteries should have some support in such a case, and for that reason an auxiliary plant is almost necessary in an installation of this size.\n\nWe have a plant on hand at the present time, completely rebuilt and guaranteed. This plant burns kerosene or gasoline or distillate, but it is started with gasoline, preferably the cheaper grade.\n\nWe have a great many orders on hand for Winchargers, batteries, and plants. Therefore we would suggest that you place your order as soon as possible, and give us an option of delivery in April.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDICKSON ELECTRIC COMPANY, LTD.\n\n(Sgd.) W.P.

Hart Lighting Plant Batteries are the product of one of the oldest battery manufacturers in the world.\n\n2. The Hart Battery Company is the oldest manufacturer of Storage Batteries in Canada.\n\n3. Hart Batteries are especially designed for use with Lighting Plants where minimum of attention is required.\n\n4. All plate elements in Hart Batteries are suspended from the top, leaving a larger sediment space in the jars.\n\n5. To insure uniformity in Hart Batteries, there are 72 distinct operations and 25 inspections in the course of manufacture.\n\n6. Capacity tests are made on every production run of plates to insure the user that the highest quality is maintained.\n\n7. Hart Batteries carry the finest guarantees offered anywhere in the world.\n\n8. Hart uses lead grids especially designed to prevent plates from buckling.\n\n9. Fifty years engineering and research has enabled Hart experts to select active materials that produce longer battery life.\n\n10. Hart Battery Company maintains branches across Canada.\n\n11. Due to the popularity of Hart Lighting Plant Batteries, fresh stocks arrive almost weekly.\n\n12. Hart Battery Construction incorporates the use of Fibre Glass mats and spun glass separators.\n\n13. Hart Lighting Plant Batteries use low gravity Electrolyte (1.165\u20141.220).\n\n14. Hart Batteries are designed so that they will not overheat under normal conditions.\n\n15. Only pure acid is used in Hart Battery Electrolyte.\n\n16. Hart Positive and Negative Plates are extra heavy to insure longer service to the user.\n\n17. In addition to spun glass, the Hart Battery has heavy duty deep grooved wood separators for better operation.\n\n18. All Hart Batteries receive a special conditioning charge before shipping.\n\n19. Hart Batteries have extra heavy Terminal Posts.\n\n20. A special Pilot cell with floating discs indicates the charged condition of the set.\n\n21. Hart Batteries are distributed by specialists in the farm lighting field, in co-operation with Hart branch offices thereby assuring better service.\n\n22. The Glass Jars are extra large\u2014contain more electrolyte and are cooler in operation.\n\n23. Hart has a wider selection to choose from, assuring better satisfaction for the user.\n\n24. Hart Batteries are used in Submarines, on trains, in airplanes, for power, lighting, and signalling equipment; their quality is recognized.\n\n25. Hart Batteries are designed to reduce flaking and waste of active material.\n\n26. Only the highest quality material goes into Hart Batteries.\n\n27. Wooden separators extend well beyond the plates to prevent short circuiting.\n\n28. Even glass jars are specially selected of clear glass to provide easier check on water level and working condition of battery.\n\n29. The Hart guarantee is simply worded, easily understood and is backed by a large company with a splendid reputation, for liberal and fair treatment.\n\n30. Hart Lighting Battery prices are the lowest in Western Canada.\nENGINEERED TO ELECTRIFY THE AVERAGE SIZE FARM\n\nThis powerful and highly efficient unit is particularly designed for farmers and ranchers who wish to operate the ordinary number of lights and appliances. Extra heavy construction throughout. Equipped with the famous Albers Celoron Gear. Starts charging in a 7\u00bd mile wind. Highly efficient in low and average wind velocities. Will generate enough current to light the house, garage and other outbuildings, run the radio, vacuum cleaner, fans, do the washing and ironing. In good wind areas, when equipped with proper size batteries, will operate a water system and a small refrigerator.\n\nDELUXE INSTRUMENT PANEL\n\nOven-baked black enamel, insulated Instrument Panel. All connections plainly marked. No frayed battery wires. Automatic relay prevents overcharging when propeller speed is too high or batteries full. Indicator shows whether battery is charging or discharging. Is equipped with safety fuse.\n\nWINCHARGER CORPORATION\n\nWORLD'S LARGEST MANUFACTURERS OF WIND-ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\n\nSioux City, Iowa, U.S.A.\n\nCABLE ADDRESS\u2014WINCHARGER\n\nLicensed Under U.S. Letters Patent No. 1,892,694\u2014Stuart\n\nIndian Affairs.

Le recrutement de notre \u00e9cole fut bon, de sorte que abritons encore cette ann\u00e9e une bonne trentaine d'enfants. Nous avons plusieurs malades \u00e0 notre h\u00f4pital. Je me suis bien amus\u00e9 avec le P\u00e8re Ethier durant les vacances jusqu'\u00e0 l'an, nous avons fond\u00e9 le Studio L.A.R.O.M.I nous avons travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 colorer quelques photos, \u00e7a semble assez facile.\n\nJ'esp\u00e8re que vous viendrez nous voir avant longtemps, c'est facile maintenant que la guerre est termin\u00e9e. Nous avons chang\u00e9 de Sup\u00e9rieure l'\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier, Soeur Th\u00e9r\u00e8se D'Avila est avec nous au moins pour six ans. Elle a beaucoup d'exp\u00e9rience avec les enfants indiens.\n\nLa petite Laveuse Beatty que le D\u00e9partement des Indiens nous avait envoy\u00e9 est bris\u00e9e, seulement apr\u00e8s 20 heures de travail. Je pense bien que c'\u00e9tait un manque dans la machine. Impossible de r\u00e9parer ici. Cette machine est garantie pour un an. Je vous demande comment proc\u00e9der pour l'envoyer, dois-je l'adresser directement au D\u00e9partement ou l'envoyer \u00e0 la manufacture. Laissez moi cela \u00e0 savoir.\n\nNous voudrions bien avoir un dactylographe commercial pour nos rapports d'\u00e9cole et d'h\u00f4pital. Nous le commanderons sur la commande de livre d'\u00e9cole.\n\nCher Mr Doucet, un gros merci pour tout ce que vous avez fait pour nous. Au sujet de l'\u00e9cole de jour de Fort George, a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 quelque chose ?\n\nAu revoir, union de pri\u00e8res et sacrifices\nP\u00e8re Lionel Labr\u00e8che O.M.I.\nFort George, Baie James, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was away on a tour through Southwestern Ontario for the greater part of the month of January. This is the explanation for the delay in answering your letter.\n\nI carefully noted your two little snapshots and I guess your laboratories certainly do embellish the North to some extent.\n\nI was very sorry to hear that your washing machine has been causing you trouble. I think the simple way of doing it would be to send this machine to the following address: Hughes Appliances Limited, Agents for Beatty Washers, 74 Rideau Street, Ottawa, Ontario. If you would be kind enough to notify me when you are sending this machine I will make it a point to examine it when it arrives and before it goes out to make sure that everything is okay.\n\nAs regards the typewriter, I think we will have to wait some time yet as these machines seem to be rather difficult to obtain at the present time.\n\nI presume that you have received the various games that were sent some time last November.\n\nThe subject of the Seasonal School at Fort George will come up for discussion in the near future. I will then notify you of the outcome.\nPlease offer my best regards to Father Ethier and to the other members of your personnel. I wish you the greatest success possible in Indian education.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\n\nRev. L. Labreche, O.M.I.\nPrincipal,\nFort George R.C. Indian Res.

Arneil, Esq.,\nInspector, Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil:\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of an Invoice from Charles Ogilvy, Ltd., Ottawa, which I received last summer.\n\nDuring Mr. Doucet's visit last winter to Fort George, the subject of such a machine as is listed in the Invoice came up. He seemed to appreciate our position, and seemed agreeable that we should begin to build up a small \"workshop of power tools\" to handle repair work, etc., such as might be necessary around the premises.\n\nI believe, during your visit, this subject was also referred to.\n\nHaving received two copies of this invoice, I felt reasonably sure that our request had met with approval, and that this machine was shipped for our use. However, when the shipping season was over, the machine had not arrived - or so I thought. Feeling that it had missed shipment at Moosonee, I have not sent notification about it before this.\n\nThe other day the R.C. brother was up to look at our Delco, and we began discussing equipment, etc. I happened to mention receiving the Invoice for the jointer, only to find that it had gone down to the R.C. Mission on its arrival at Fort George. This was, indeed, news to me. Remembering your kind offer to be of any assistance possible, I am now writing to you to check up for me on this matter. Was this machine ordered for us, or for the R.C.? If it was ordered for us, what can be done about it at this date? I understand that they have not got the machine set up yet, but I hesitated to say anything more without first writing to enquire for definite information.\n\nThanking you for co-operating in this matter in the midst of your busy life, I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Residential School,\nFort George, Que., via Moosonee, Ont.\nOttawa, April 12, 1946.\n\nDear Bishop Belleau:\n\nWhen you were at the Department recently, I suggested that you purchase certain articles that you required and that you forward the accounts to me. Provided the accounts are dated previous to March 31, we would be able to pay them from last year's appropriation. However, we will have to receive these accounts within a very short time, as this is the last month in which we are allowed to pay from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1945-46. Consequently, if you have purchased any of the items, please let me have the account at the earliest possible date and, as noted above, it should be dated previous to March 31.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Reverend H. Belleau, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay,\nMoosonee, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have wired Rev. Fr. Fay at Moose Cree, asking him to send immediately certified accounts of hardware bought from Gray-Harvey on two occasions before March 31st.\n\nI have received the invoices and would like you to pay up to $104.00 in 2 payments, if possible. The merchandise had not been checked, so I left the invoices with Fr. Fay when I had to leave on April 5th. I hope he sends them soon. The Gray Harvey Co made a mistake and put on one invoice an amount totalling...\nup to about $155.00 or so.\n\nWe shall pay the balance if it cannot be paid by the Dept. on the present fiscal year appropriations.\n\nSorry this delay has happened.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n+ Henri Belleau D.M.D.\nDear Mr. Thelan:\n\nEnclosed please find invoice in triplicate for one hundred dollars worth of paint bought for Fort George R.C.

H.Belleau at Moosonee, Ont., we regret to have to inform you that the Rt. gentleman is not correct in regards the invoice he holds.\n\nOn looking into this matter we find that the invoice shows freight allowed and in the circumstances the consignee is responsible for payment of carrier's charges.\n\nWe trust that you will have no further trouble in collecting your outstanding account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCANADA CEMENT COMPANY LIMITED\n\nA.S.Buckle,\nAsst. Manager, Traffic Department.\nOttawa, 6 December 1946.\n\nRt. Rev. H. Belleau, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay,\nMOOSONEE, Ontario.\n\nDear Bishop Belleau:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant, I think the freight account to which you refer covered the shipment of a carload of cement for the Fort George Residential School.\n\nOn reviewing our file, I find that we paid $258.00 for the carload which it was understood contained 150 barrels or 600 bags.\n\nWe did not pay the freight of $199.50. The amount specifically allotted for the Fort George R.C. School has been expended but the amount provided for the Albany School has not all been spent. If you send me the receipted account from the Railroad Company, for the freight amounting to $199.50, I think we can arrange a refund to you before the end of January.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nChief, Training Division  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nDepartment of Mines & Resources,  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am enclosing copy of a letter received by the Railway Agent at Moosonee, insisting on having freight paid by us on the carload of cement quoted at .76 1/4 cents per sack.\n\nOn the insisting of the Canada Cement and the impossibility for the Agent to let us have the carload without payment, we paid the freight bill amounting to one hundred and ninety-nine dollars and fifty cents (199.50).\n\nThis carload of cement was sent by order of the Department to Fort Albany. I had asked for a quotation of prices direct from the Montreal Office of the Canada Cement and was told (by wire and also over the phone) that F.O.B. Moosonee, .76 1/4 cents per sack would be the price. In fact we bought cement for our own use at that price.\n\nAs delivery of the cement went to the F. Albany R.C. Residential School was made only in August, I received notice of this only when returning from the visit made to the different missions, and consequently have delayed taking the matter up with your office.\n\nDo you think anything could be done about this matter? I believe the freight should be refunded, because some mistake must have been made somewhere about the rate or cost fob Moosonee. You showed Rev. Fr. Plourde and myself the file of the Albany School, in which file you had the Canada Cement quotation at .76 1/4 cents. This was last Spring, towards the end of the fiscal year, if I am not mistaken.\n\nThank you for the attention you have given and will again give this matter, and for many other services rendered.\n\nSincerely yours in Christ,\n\n+ Henri Belleau O.M.I.\nBishop Henri Belleau O.M.I.\n\nP.S. Of course, if the Dept. paid less than .76 1/4 cts a sack, owing to our paying freight, that would be reasonable; we understand that fiscal year was over when this was discovered. I see that delivery was made in July, no Aug. If nothing can be done about it, it will be alright as far as we are concerned. We'll be looking ahead next time.\nOttawa, 6 December 1946.\n\nRt. Rev.

Orford\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Bishop Belleau:\n\nI have intended to write you for the past week or so and to state that we have not yet received the June quarter return of the Fort George R.C. School. We have received the enclosed return for September but we cannot pay September until the June quarter return is received. You will remember that in conversation with you recently I suggested that the names of all the Indian children in attendance at this school be included on these returns, although we only allow grant for slightly over 18. You will remember my reasons for suggesting this action.\n\nI trust that you will find it possible to have the return for the quarter ended June 30, 1942, and the revised return for the September quarter, 1942, forwarded at as early a date as possible.\n\nI believe it inadvisable to include the names of the Vestaltook children as they are Eskimos and, therefore, should not appear on the return of Indian children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt. Rev. H. Belleau,\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 15, 1943.\n\nDear Bishop Belleau:\n\nIn preparing the return of the Fort George Residential School, which was forwarded to the Department, covering the quarter ended September 30, 1942, grant was requested for the full quarter for each of the children whose name was shown on the return. However, under the heading \"Date of entrance to school\", an entry was made showing that each of the children had entered the school on August 1, 1942. If that information was correct, we should have allowed grant only from August 1 to September 30. However, we were under the impression that this entry was a mistake on the part of the person who prepared the return, as I felt, from conversations we have had, that all the children had been in the school for some considerable time.\n\nThe auditor has been recently rechecking our returns and he has discovered this discrepancy. I would therefore appreciate your advising me whether the pupils whose names were shown on the return for the quarter September 30, 1942, were actually in residence from July 1, 1942.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev. H. Belleau, O.M.I.,\nMoosonee, Ont.\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nChief, Training Division  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nHave received your letter re-return for Fort George Catholic School, September 1942 quarter.\n\nHave been absent visiting missions and could not answer sooner. Mistake has been made, mentioning August 1st as date of entrance into school. Leaving for Fort George on sooner tomorrow morning. I will look into the matter and have correct return sent as soon as possible.\n\nThank you for notifying us about this.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Residential School. The names of James Corston, Joseph Martinsau and Emily, Marianna and Kathleen Corston should not appear on future returns, as the Indian Agent, Dr. Orford, states that they are not Indians.\n\nThe names shown on the attached return which we are sending back should not be sent to the Indian Affairs Branch in future, as it is understood that these children are Eskimos. In this connection I would refer you to a letter written to Bishop Belleau on January 11, 1943, regarding this family.\n\nOn the June quarter return Sophie Josecomolom is shown as No. 045. This name does not appear on the September quarter return, but on the latter return Annie Kacobac is shown as No. 045. New pupils should be given new numbers and when a pupil is discharged the register number should be dropped from the return. It is very confusing to us to have the same number shown in regard to two different pupils. I trust that you will keep this suggestion in mind for the future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. D.

Residential School, has been sent, is an Indian.\nIt was intended that authority to receive her into the School be requested\nof the Department, for reasons of moral protection and advanced vocational\ntraining. Lucie has reached beyond school age (and she has already been a\npupil or at least has been a helper residing at the School). Of this,\nhowever I am not certain. I am inclined to believe that she must have been\nonly working for the School if her name does not appear in the past returns\nand if no application form has ever been filed in her name.\n\nThank you for approving of her admission for one year.\n\nThe children for whom attached forms had been signed by\nparents or guardians are all Indians. The forms were signed while the\nFather Principal of the Fort George School was on a trip to Richmond Gulf.\nIt appears that he either forgot the Indian Affairs application forms, or\nhappened to have run out of his supply, and he may have used these as a\nsubstitute.\n\nI regret having received your letter lately only, in Montreal.\nPlease address all correspondence to Moosonee, as usual.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nVicar Apostolic of James Bay.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bishop Belleau of Fort George District has communicated by phone with Rev. Father Ethier of this parish, informing that he had place for several pupils at the Fort George Residential School and arrangement has been made to send the pupils by plane. As Father Ethier has an opportunity to send the pupils by plane at a such date directly to Fort George, immediate steps have been taken by himself and the pupils were...\nleaving a short time after from St Felicien.\n\nEvery family has been consulted about the matter and they were glad to see their children placed in a school for the academic year.\n\nFew days after the departure of the pupils, Rev. Father Ethier informed me about the matter, and he told me that Bishop Belleau had arranged the case with the Department.\n\nI have met Mr Doucet lately at his last visit here, and apparently Bishop Belleau did not communicate with your Department regarding the matter.\n\nThe enclosed Admission Forms have been filled up at Fort George and it is why the father did not sign it. I notice also that the pupils did not pass their medical examination. Before returning the Admission forms to Fort George, re Physical Examination, I have thought wise to give you some informations regarding this special case, and forward in the meantime the forms to the Dept.\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Supt.\nPointe Bleue Agency.\nDecember 12th, 1949.\n\nMr. E.

Indian Agency,\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\n\nAttached I am returning the September Quarterly Return for the Fort George R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Principal has failed to separate the boys from the girls on his Return. This is usually done by indicating the register number for girls with a \"G\" preceding the number. Please bring this to Father Couture's attention for future returns.\n\nPupils 086-091 and 65-85 are entered on the Return for the first time. It is presumed that these are new admissions. However, this information should have been shown on Form I.A. 411 which is to accompany the Return itself. Furthermore, the Principal has claimed full grant of ninety-two days for each of these pupils while they entered the school during the months of August and September. It will be necessary for Father Couture to adjust either the figures or the dates of entrance to the school.\n\nFather Couture has also dropped from the September Return the names of a number of pupils who were shown as grant-earning pupils in June. In cases of this nature the school is entitled to sixty-two days grant for each pupil. It will be necessary for the Principal to insert the names of these children and claim this grant when re-submitting his September Return.\nIn order to avoid financial difficulties, we are forwarding the school a part payment of $2000, on the September grant.\n\nIt would be appreciated if this Return could be corrected and returned as soon as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMFT/HM\n\nEnclosure\nNovember 20, 1951.\n\nMr. J.S.

It deals with the deleting from our quarterly grant, for nine pupils of the Fort George R.C. Residential School, of the names of those pupils, on the grounds of a technical defect in the Application forms for admission. Those forms of Application for admission into the school, were written by the Principal, and signed by the Indian parents, who were supposed to be conversant with the Application which they signed. The religion of those nine pupils is put down under the name \"Christian\"; it has been done in this manner, with the use of that term, since 1938, for quite a few pupils. No objection was raised by any official of the Department, against the use of that term, \"Christian\", so far. No one ever argued that it was improper and that it rendered the child whose father signed the Application, ineligible for a grant to the school. Seven out of the nine children mentioned above, are Catholics.\n\nThe fact that Protestant parents have requested that their children be admitted, and that their direction has been given by writing, does not invalidate the right of the school to receive a per capita grant but rather agrees with Section 117 of the Indian Act, and also with another document which should not be ignored by the Canadian Federal Government, even if Indians are concerned.\n\nI beg to quote part of the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man, adhered to by Canada, and signed on the 10th of December 1948, by Canada's representative or delegate, at a meeting of the United Nations Organization. It stresses the elementary freedom claimed by the Indian who signs an Application for admission of his child into our Residential School, at Fort George. I wish you would, when opportunity offers itself, show this text to those who object, when an Indian parent directs that his child should go to such or such a school, and so directs in black and white. This is from Section (or Article) 26 of the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man: \"Parents have, through priority, the right to choose the kind of education to be given to their children.\" If they wish to have their children educated under the same religious auspices as they themselves have been educated, all is well in this respect, and the State should take this wish into account. But if, on the other hand...\nfor a sound reason, parents wish to have their children enter into a school of another Christian denomination, why should the State interfere and treat them as morons, unable to make a choice?\n\nYour having been notified by Mr. Phelan himself, that the grant was cancelled for the nine above-mentioned children, makes it necessary for me to write him about it. Thank you. With kind regards.\n\n(Signed) Henry Belleau, O.M.I.\nMay 9, 1952.\n\nMr. J.S. Allan,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 18th regarding deletions on the September, December and March Quarterly Returns for the Fort George R.C. Residential School, it has been decided that the Department will allow grant for these children for the period August 15th, the date they entered residence to August 31, 1952.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise the Principal to this effect instructing him to claim retroactive grant from August 15, 1951 to June 30, 1952 on the June Quarterly Return. You should instruct him also that these children should be returned to their parents at the end of the present academic year and should not be brought back to the school until a definite decision has been reached regarding their admission and you have been informed to that effect.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nAssistant Superintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nThe rulings handed down on disputed religious cases were to the effect that where a mother is Roman Catholic and the father is Protestant, the children should attend a Roman Catholic school. In cases where children were in a Protestant school and it was proven during the academic year that these children should not be in a Protestant school but should be placed in a Roman Catholic school, it was ruled in the case of the Yellowhorse children \"Old Sun's, Crowfoot schools\", that the children must remain in the school they are attending to the end of the academic year and then transfer effective September 1st the following academic year.\n\nIn view of the above ruling, it was decided to allow the Principal of the Fort George R.C. Residential School to claim grant for the nine children who were brought to the school on August 15, 1951 and for whom the applications for admission were disputed due to the fact that the religious denomination was shown as \"Christian\".\n\nIn a letter dated February 7th, file 350-10, Canon H.G. Cook indicated that he is not able to accept children whose admission is disputed to the Fort George C.B. Residential School as \"we could not take these children into our school before next summer. We are full to the roof now and never know when to expect children back from the Moose San. Several have come back to us already. We could take them in next summer but it would mean turning away some of the children at present in our school\".\nJuly 16, 1952.\n\nMr. J.S. Allan,\nSupt.

Much of the accommodation shown on the Teslin plans for teaching staff was also to be left out.\n\nOn receipt of the memorandum from Mr. MacInnes Mr. Noffke was instructed to defer further operations until an explanation to Indian Affairs could be obtained from Bishop Labrie and Father Plourde.\n\nOn the 9th instant Col. Neary phoned the writer advising that Father Plourde, who had been in Western Canada, had returned to Ottawa, and that a conference had been held, whereat it had been decided to proceed with the original arrangements.\n\nMr. Noffke has been advised verbally to resume work on that basis.\n\nCol. Neary advises that the building will be placed on another part of the property, which will require another survey, a request for which will be made in a memorandum to you from Major MacKay within the next few days.\n\nMajor MacKay\nConfirming telephone arrangements between our staffs.\n\nR.A.

This will, therefore, cancel our memorandum of July 25 and the Architect can now proceed with the completion of these drawings.\n\nThe new site of the school has also been settled and we have a telegram from Mr. Indian Superintendent Pauze at Seven Islands reading as follows:\n\n\"Hotel New Location of Seven Islands Residential School Proposed to be on South Part of Lot Number Eight Approx Twenty Six Hundred Feet On a Bearing of Two Hundred and Seventy Five Degrees True of Present Site of Class Room Block Stop In Other Words the South West Corner of New Class Room Block\"\n\nThis site has been accepted by the Reserves and Trusts Division and your Chief Architect has been advised by the Superintendent of Education how to contact the surveyor being employed by the Surveyor General to carry out the required survey of the village, agency and school properties.

Therefore, I have today asked the Director of this Branch to provide you with the necessary information concerning the progress being made in this regard. He has been sent a copy of Mr. Levy's memorandum of the 29th November.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 2 December, 1949.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR,\nLANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nPROPOSED SEVEN ISLANDS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory memorandum concerning the building of this residential school.\n\nAs this matter is now in your hands, it would be appreciated if you could submit to the Deputy Minister the information required by Mr. Levy.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\nJanuary 26, 1950.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO:\n\nMAJOR MacKAY,\n\nA week or so ago, Mr. Ross of the Engineering and Construction Services of the former Department of Mines and Resources called at this office and discussed, in the presence of Mr. Pauze, Indian Superintendent, who was in Ottawa at the time, the relative merits and costs of providing water to the new Seven Islands Indian Reserve and the Department's buildings thereon. Mr. Ross was of the opinion that it would be preferable to take water from a creek about 1/2 mile from the Reserve. He reported that the water in this creek had been analyzed and that it was excellent water. It had a clear colour, contained no sand or iron, was extremely soft, and had no harmful chemicals. Mr. Ross has the chemical analysis of the water, if it is required.\n\nFollowing is a rough estimate of the cost of providing water by drilling wells and taking water from a creek:\n\nWater from Wells:\n\n4 gravel wall wells estimated at 150 ft. in depth, including drilling and casing and gravel wall around water area $ 4,000\nMechanical pumps for each well, consisting of gas engine or electric motor (deep well turbine pump) 6,000\nPressure tanks, etc. - $3,000 each 12,000\n4 pump houses - $2,500 each 10,000\nContingencies 3,000\nPossible cost of distribution system to Administration buildings and school 5,000\nPossible freight charges 2,000\n\n$ 42,000\n\nCont'd.....\nWater from Creek:\n\nDam at intake and pumping station $2,000\n1000 ft. of 4\" main to reservoir 2,500\nReservoir and pump house 6,000\n4000 ft. of 6\" distribution main 12,000\n5 hydrants, valves, etc. 2,000\n3 pumps, pressure tank, etc. (1 pump at dam, 1 pump at reservoir, and 1 fire pump) 7,000\nFreight 1,000\nContingencies 3,500\nPossible cost of pipe line to school 10,000\nFreight on pipe, additional to above freight 2,000\n\n$48,000\n\nFrom the foregoing, it will be seen that by taking the water from the creek, we would have an assured supply and the cost would not be very much greater than would be involved by securing water from four wells. Mr. Ross stated that the water in the well at the airport contained too much iron, and the water was not very good. At the present time, while a 75 gallon per minute pump was installed, it was only operating 1/3 capacity, possibly due to sand clogging the screens. Mr. Ross feels that, if we install pumps in wells, we will encounter the same difficulty, and there will be constant expense by having to replace pumps.\n\nThe foregoing figures are very rough and we were uncertain just where the school was to be located. Mr. Ross was to attend a meeting in Mr. Buck's office the next day, as Mr. Buck and Col. Neary were to discuss further the location of the school. This Section has not yet been informed as to what decision was arrived at.\n\nDo you consider that it would be in order to ask Mr. Ross to furnish us with his report on this subject, as he has already investigated the matter on the ground. If we do not have this report, another engineer will have to visit Seven Islands to gather the information already in the possession of Mr. Ross. I have prepared the attached memorandum in case you wish to send it to the Director of Development Services, Resources and Development Department.\n\nW. J. F.

I am sure you will find it much more economical to install an oil unit for the purpose of heating this building.\n\nMy only purpose in writing this letter is to pass along this information to you, and if you decide to install an oil unit instead of a coal stoker we would appreciate being advised as soon as possible, as it may make some little difference in our tender price, as we are bidding this project.\n\nWith reference to changing the position of the building, I see no reason why this would be any more expensive than your present arrangement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(John D. Stirling)\nGeneral Manager\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nc/o Col. Bernard F.

Sterling of the North Shore Construction Company with whom I have discussed the following points:\n\nOn the blue print sheet No. 1, the architect has placed the school facing the Reservation, or facing East, but the Seven Islands & Moisie road is running north of the said lot reserved for the Residential School. Due to this last reason I think it would better from the road if we had the front part of the Residential School facing North, then from the center of the lot, or the main door we could build a road leading to the above public road.\n\nLooking over the plans and specifications of the Residential School it is mentioned that the said specifications call for a coal furnace with stoker. If you remember, when I was in Ottawa last January, it was definitely decided to give this school an oil heating system. I remember mentioning you that it would be a lot cheaper to burn oil instead of coal on account of high freight rate, etc..\n\nIf further explanations are needed, I am quite sure that Mr. Sterling the bearer of this letter will gladly comply and clarify the above subjects with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Total 1949-50 expenditures will not be more than $6,500.00.\n\nAlthough the Architect estimates the cost of the School at $325,000.00, the lowest responsible tender will probably be about $350,000.00 at least. Nineteen fifty-fifty one requirements will therefore be as follows:\n\nConstruction of School..........................$ 350,000.00\nContingencies for extra work\nand increased costs............................. 30,000.00\nArchitects Amyot and Noffke,\n2\u00bd% fee each on $380,000.00-$19,000.00\nless amount paid to date.... 6,093.75 12,906.25\nEngineering (Inspection) expenses........... 1,500.00\n\nTotal..................$ 394,406.25\n\nThe above maximum figures may have to be adjusted downward if a tender under $350,000.00 is received and accepted. The $394,406.25 figure is based on the assumption that the School will be finished by March 31, 1951.\nIndian Affairs\n\n20 April 1950\n\n516 50 51\n\n13-491 School #352\n\nConstruction of Seven Islands Indian Residential School........................$300.00\n\nNOTE: This amount is to be transferred to the Department of Resources and Development.\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa\nApril 15, 1950.\n\nMr. J.

Would you kindly have the necessary enquiries made as soon as possible, in order that a decision may be reached.\nshortly on the advisability of giving the contract to Mr. Tremblay.\n\nInformation has reached this office to the effect that La Compagnie de Construction, Seven Islands, Quebec, has also submitted a tender in connection with the construction of this building.

Neary,\nSept. of Indian Education.\nRe construction of Seven Islands Indian Residential School........$700.00\n\nTO PAY BALANCE OF WORK UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT.\n2 June, 1950.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nCONTRACT FOR INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nSEVEN ISLANDS, QUE.\n\nIn connection with the award of a Contract for the construction of the above building, an analysis of the tenders received was contained in a letter to the Director, Indian Affairs Branch dated the 28th of April, 1950, over the signature of R.A. Gibson, Director, Development Services Branch, Department of Resources and Development.\n\nThe letter, of which you have a copy, listed the names of tenderers and the amounts of their tender.\n\nSome doubt was expressed therein, regarding the ability of the lowest tenderer, Lucien Tremblay of Portneuf, Quebec, and further to comment supplied in Mr. Gibson's letter of the 28th of April, answers to a series of questions were requested in a letter to Tremblay over the signature of the Director of Indian Affairs, under date of the 19th of May.\n\nIn a telegram dated the 26th of May, 1950, Lucien Tremblay advised that he had been a general contractor for twelve years, that he owned a number of small units of construction equipment, as well as a three hundred ton freighting schooner. He indicated that his contracting experience had been mostly highway work and forestry or logging operations, but referred to a school smaller but similar in character to the proposed Seven Islands building, designed by Pierre Rinfret of Quebec, and which cost in the neighborhood of $152,000.00.\n\nTremblay stated he would have as his engineer in charge, Mr. Lionel Halle of Quebec City, and named Messrs Raoul Tremblay, of Portneuf and Georges Dechene of Quebec, as superintendents.\n\nFollowing receipt of Tremblay's telegram, a letter signed by Mr. Pratt under date of the 27th of May last, requested confirmation of the information supplied, in response to which comment is furnished as follows:\n\nAlthough Tremblay indicates a standing as a general contractor, his experience on buildings appears to be limited. The school at Portneuf Quebec built for their Board of Education was discussed with the designing architect who stated that the work was satisfactory. Mr. Rinfret does not know who was the Superintendent of the school, but says Tremblay's building operations are not extensive, there is little likelihood of having the same staff employed at Seven Islands. One building, however, is not sufficient reference on which to base a reputation, and Mr. Rinfret is reported from other sources, to have carried out very few inspections. Mr. Gaston Amyot, a practicing architect in Quebec,\n\nLaval Fortier, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nWoods Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6113, file 352-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nwho has been recommended as supervisor for the Department on the Seven Island school, was requested to investigate the qualifications of the staff. Mr. Tremblay suggested, and advised the writer that:\n\n(a) Mr. Lionel Halle is a pensioned ex-employee of the Federal Department of Public Works, who was in the past located at Quebec, but who now is not prepared to assume the duties of an Engineer-in-Charge of a large structural undertaking. He would be willing to establish the location and set levels for the school if requested, but this duty can be carried out by the Departmental Supervising Architect.\n\n(b) Mr. Raoul Tremblay of Portneuf Quebec, a relative of Lucien Tremblay, was described as a fair carpenter, but not possessing the qualifications of a superintendent.\n\n(c) Mr. Georges Dechene of Quebec, was described as a man who might be used as a labour foreman but not in the capacity of either superintendent or assistant superintendent.\n\nWithout a more intimate knowledge of Tremblay's organization, the writer is not prepared to recommend the award of a contract to Lucien Tremblay.\n\nWhen tenders were invited, the invitation, in the form of an advertisement, appeared in selected newspapers from the 30th day of March 1950, until the 4th of April, 1950. The set time for closing tenders in Ottawa, was noon on the 24th of April, allowing three full weeks for the preparation of tenders. Five bona-fide lump sum tenders reached Ottawa within the time limit, but on the morning of the 24th of April, a telegram was received by the Director, Development Services Branch, from M.L. Coiteux, President of Sept Iles Development and Construction Co. Ltd., stating that a tender on the project had been mailed from Quebec that morning for special delivery. Mr. Coiteux understood that if his tender was postmarked as of the 24th of April, 1950, it would receive consideration with any others.\n\nMr. Coiteux's understanding was in error, and consequently his tender cannot be considered. Under normal circumstances, all tenders deserving consideration must be opened at the same time.\n\nAs a matter of record, all tenders must be submitted in the addressed envelope supplied by the Department for the purpose, which upon arrival in Ottawa, are not identifiable, and for that reason, cannot be returned to the tenderers. All sealed tenders must nevertheless be opened, the security deposit removed, registered and placed in safekeeping. When opened, the tender from the Sept Iles Development and Construction Co. Ltd., was in the amount of $348,176.00, the second lowest. It must be stated however, that our report on this organization would not justify the undersigned in recommending the award of a contract to them, even had the tender been received within the time limit. The security deposit forwarded with the tender has been returned to this firm.\n\nThe second lowest bona-fide tender was submitted by the North Shore Construction Co. Ltd., with headquarters at Montreal. It was in the amount of $359,450.00, $47,500.00 higher than the lowest tenderer. This firm an affiliate of Clan Steamships Ltd., has carried out the construction of a number of housing developments, and other building work for pulp and paper companies, and have also\ncompleted a number of dock construction contracts, much of the latter for the Dominion Government. They have also erected an agent's residence, and an office building for this Department at the Seven Islands Indian Agency. The Department of Public Works consider their work satisfactory and while not of major proportions, the work performed for our Department is well executed.\n\nIt is felt that, the Department's interests would best be served by the award of a contract to the North Shore Construction Co. Ltd.\n\nIf concurrence is received, a submission to Council will be prepared immediately for our Minister's signature, seeking authority to initiate action with that firm.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nChas.

We understand from Mr. Walker that the levels as set by Tremblay's engineer did not take into account the fact that the finished grade at the building was produced by fill, and that he interpreted the elevation given to be natural grade.\n\nTremblay, we understand, is prepared to fill the incorrect excavation, at his own expense, and to excavate for the building in an area to be set by the Department.\n\nYou were advised orally, by the writer, that it had been decided to abandon any attempt to adapt the building design to the first excavation, and that the building was to be moved northerly to allow fifty feet (50'-0\") of undisturbed soil between the old and new excavations. It was anticipated here that it might also be necessary to move the building slightly to the west, in order to permit the sewage evaporation bed to lie on solid ground.\n\nA drawing was in course of preparation before we learned that no excavation had been carried out for the boiler house or sewage disposal works, and, consequently, only the northerly movement will be necessary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We acknowledge your letter of July 16th with copies or letters from the British American Oil Co., Ltd., and Imperial Oil Limited, establishing that the only fuel available at Seven Islands is standard domestic grade (No. 2), which both organizations state they can deliver by tank truck to the school subject, of course, to weather and resultant road conditions.\n\nIt is further confirmed that you were instructed to prepare an alternative specification covering the use of oil fired equipment restricted to operation with domestic type fuel. The Department does not feel justified in authorizing the installation of pre-heating equipment required for the most efficient use of bunker oil, when it is apparent that such fuel oil will not be available at Seven Islands for some years.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We note your opinion that, aside from installation costs, which may be slightly greater for oil burning equipment, there should not be much variation between stoker firing and oil firing equipment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nChief, Engineering and Construction Service.\nOTTAWA, le 1er ao\u00fbt 1950\n\nMonsieur Laval Fortier\nSous-ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9\net de l'Immigration\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nCher monsieur Fortier,\n\nMonsieur Lomer Brisson, d\u00e9put\u00e9 de Saguenay, m'a appel\u00e9 le 21 juillet de Sept-\u00celes, dans son comt\u00e9, me disant que les travaux \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole des Indiens avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendus depuis quinze jours et que, apparemment, il fallait attendre l'acceptation finale des plans \u00e0 la division des Affaires indiennes, minist\u00e8re de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l'Immigration.\n\nMonsieur Brisson m'a fait remarquer que cette suspension lui causait des ennuis tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux et que tout le monde semblait inquiet et se demandait si l'ouvrage reprendrait.
