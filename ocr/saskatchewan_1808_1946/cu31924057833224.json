Unfortunately, however, the classification and nomenclature of these corals have long been in a state of some confusion. With a view to remedying this, Mr. Lambe has, at Mr. Whiteaves's suggestion, undertaken a revision of the genera and species.\n\nThe present report on the Madreporaria Perforata and the Alcyonaria, with five plates, forms the first part of the fourth volume of \"Contributions to Canadian Palaeontology\". A second part, now in course of preparation and to be illustrated by thirteen plates, is intended to conclude the revision of this class so far as present material permits.\n\nGEORGE M.

LAMBE.\n\nThe following pages consist of a revision of the genera and species of Canadian Pal\u00e6ozoic corals, with as complete a description as possible of their structural characteristics. The classification of the corals in the first volume of Nicholson and Lydekker's Manual of Pal\u00e6ontology has been for the most part adhered to and, in most cases, original descriptions of the genera and species, as the writer understands them, have been prepared. As far as the material available will permit, the various genera of the Madreporaria Perforata are taken up in order and later those of the Alcyonaria. At a future time it is hoped to complete a revision of the Actinozoa by a similar treatment of the remaining sections of the Zoantharia. It is attempted to show that some forms hitherto considered of little value as regards the determination of the age of the deposits in which they occur, on account of their wide range in geological time, are capable of indicating definite horizons through the possession of distinctive structural peculiarities. The advances made in pal\u00e6ontology of recent years and the new light thrown on some doubtful points of structural detail, through the medium of additional and sometimes better preserved material, have either necessitated the removal of some species to different genera or have strengthened others in the positions already assigned to them.\n\nAll the fossils mentioned in the following pages with few exceptions are in the collection of the Geological Survey Department at Ottawa and are the result of many years collecting in all parts of the Dominion by officers of the Survey.\nThe writer takes this opportunity of expressing his thanks to Mr. Whiteaves for critical suggestions made during the progress of this report, and to Professor H. Alleyne Nicholson for the loan of a number of types of Canadian species of fossil corals described in the two \"Reports upon the Pal\u00e6ontology of Ontario\" and in his \"Pal\u00e6ozoic Tabulate Corals.\"\n\nACTINOZOA.\n\nZOANTHARIA.\n\n1.

The corallites are in close contact with each other, without a complete amalgamation of the walls, and are either polygonal, subpolygonal or circular; they emerge at right angles to the surface and in the ramos\u00e8 forms diverge outward from an imaginary central axis; they are either equal or subequal, or are distinctly of two sizes, in which latter case the larger ones are subangular or circular, and the smaller ones polygonal. Septa are represented by tubercles or spines, arranged in vertical rows or irregularly distributed, or by horizontal, tongue-shaped processes (squamulae) also occurring in rows. The mural pores are placed in the sides of the corallites, or close to or in the angles; in the former case they occur in one, two or three definite vertical rows or are disposed without order. Longitudinal striations sometimes occur on the inner surface of the walls, one to each space between the rows of pores. Although the walls of the corallites are typically thin, a decided thickening is at times observable. Opercula are present, in some species, closing\nthe calyces. The tabulae are frequently crenulated, or have more or less well defined depressions at the margin.\n\nAs has been already pointed out by Rominger,* all Cambro-Silurian or Silurian species of this genus have spiniform septa whilst those of the Devonian have squamulae.\n\n**Favosites Gothlandica**, Lamarck.\n\nPlate I., fig. 1.\n\n*Favosites Gothlandica*, Lamarck. 1816.

Corallites prismatic, generally rather equal in the same specimen, varying in different individuals from about 2 or even less to 5 mm. wide. Pores circular, surrounded by a slightly raised rim, in one, two or three rows in the sides of the corallites; averaging from about .25 to .33 mm. in diameter. Tabulae complete, flat, at times concave or convex, and varying considerably, even in the same specimen, in their distances apart from each other; they frequently exhibit concentric lines of growth. Marginal depressions or crenulations are often developed in the tabulae and in some specimens are very noticeable, extending for some distance toward the centre of the tabulae; in the same specimen these crenulations may be well marked in some of the tabulae and altogether wanting or but slightly formed in others. Short, close set, sharply pointed septal spines project inward, with frequently a slight upward inclination, from the walls of the corallites; sometimes they are arranged apparently without order, at other times in more or less definite longitudinal rows.\n\n*Geological Survey of Michigan, Fossil Corals, p. 19. 1876.*\nF. Gothlandica occurs at numerous localities in the Niagara, Guelph and Lower Helderberg formations, in divisions 2, 3 and 4 of the Anticosti group and in rocks of supposed Hudson River age at Stony Mountain, Manitoba. The specimens in the collection are from the following localities\u2014in the Niagara from Thorold, Ont., E. Billings; Rockwood, Ont., R. Bell, 1861; Owen Sound, Ont., J. Townsend, 1874; Grand Manitoulin and Cockburn Islands, Lake Huron, R. Bell, 1866; Drummond Island, Lake Huron; at the north end of Lake Temiscaming, Que., R. Bell, 1877 and A. E. Barlow, 1883, 1884: in the Guelph from Galt, Ont., R. Bell, 1861: in the Lower Helderberg from l'Anse au Gascon, Baie des Chaleurs, R. Bell, 1862; l'Anse \u00e0 la Vieille and l'Anse \u00e0 la Barbe, Baie des Chaleurs: in divisions 2, 3 and 4 of the Anticosti group from various localities, J. Richardson, 1856 and Professor John Macoun, 1883. The specimens from Stony Mountain were collected by T. C. Weston in 1884. Two small specimens were also collected on the east side of Mansfield Island, Hudson Bay by R. Bell in 1884 from rocks that have been doubtfully referred to the Niagara. A number of specimens were obtained by A. P. Low at Limestone Rapids on the Fawn branch of the Severn River in 1886 in rocks which are supposed to be \"not older than the Galena and may be as new as the Niagara.\"*\n\nIn 1894 specimens were obtained at Fort Churchill, Hudson Bay, by J. B. Tyrrell, in rocks that have been referred to as of Cambro-Silurian age.\n\nIn addition to the above localities F. Gothlandica was collected in rocks of Silurian age at Davis Point, Lake Manitoba, by J. B. Tyrrell, 1888, and at the west side of Cedar Lake, at Cross Lake Rapids and at Grand Rapids, Saskatchewan River near its mouth by J. B. Tyrrell, 1890; also at a slightly lower geological horizon, a few miles south of Long Point (station 1030), Lake Winnipeg by D. B.

Corallites prismatic, with an average width of nearly 2 mm., generally rather equal in the same specimen. Tabulae complete, horizontal, often concavely or convexly bent, rather close together, generally from .5 to 1 mm. apart but frequently more distant and showing a considerable variation even in the same specimen. Small marginal pits or depressions in the tabulae are sometimes developed in this species, but as a rule they are small and inconspicuous. Pores of moderate size, placed in or close to the angles of the corallites, in some specimens very numerous and about .75 mm. apart, sometimes encircled by a raised border. Occasionally pores are seen in the sides of the corallites, but this seems to be exceptional. Septal spines sharply pointed, as a rule short but capable, as is evinced by some specimens, of a much greater degree of development and becoming moderately long. In this species the septal spines are not so numerous as in the preceding and occur more generally in longitudinal rows.\n\nThe corallites of some specimens are very much below the average width of nearly 2 mm. being less than 1 mm., whilst in other specimens they are very unequal and vary in diameter from about .5 to 2 mm.\n\nThis species occurs in the Hudson River formation in Anticosti and at Stony Mountain, Manitoba, as well as at Stonewall, Manitoba, near the latter place; it is also found in the four divisions of the Anticosti group.\n\nSpecimens of a *Favosites* have also been collected at East Selkirk and Lower Fort Garry, Manitoba, that are doubtfully referred to this species; they do not show the pores although otherwise the structure is well preserved. The rocks at these localities have been assigned by Mr. Whiteaves to the Galena-Trenton so that if through the medium of other specimens from these places the pores are found to be situated at the angles of the corallites, the downward extension of the range of *Favosites aspera* will be considerable.\n\nThe largest specimen in the museum is from Stony Mountain and was collected by R. W. Ells in 1875; it is 10 inches broad, 2\u00bd inches in\nmaximum thickness or height and is a portion only of the entire corallum.\n\nSpecimens of *Favosites aspera* were collected in the Silurian (Niagara) near the mouth of the Saskatchewan River at Roche Rouge by J. B. Tyrrell in 1890, and a little lower down the river at Grand Rapids by D. B. Dowling in 1891; also in the Cambro-Silurian at a locality (station 1030) a few miles south of Long Point, Lake Winnipeg, by D. B. Dowling in 1891.\n\n**Favosites Hisingeri**, Milne-Edwards and Haime.\n\n*Favosites Hisingeri*, Milne-Edwards and Haime. 1851. Polyp. Foss. des Terr. Pal\u00e6oz., p. 240, pl.

Corallites prismatic, small, varying in diameter from .5 to 1.5 mm. across in the same specimen. Septal spines numerous, sharply pointed, long, reaching to or almost to the centre of the corallites, generally curved slightly upward and arranged in longitudinal rows. Pores of moderate size, occurring in one or two rows in the sides of the corallites. Tabulae flat, horizontal, about from two to four in a space of 1 mm.\n\nThis species differs from *F. Gothlandica* in the smallness of its corallites and the much greater length of the septal spines; from *F. aspera*, in which the septal spines are frequently of considerable length, it is easily recognized by the pores being placed in the sides instead of at or near the angles of the corallites and by the smaller size of the corallites in average specimens.\n\n*Favosites hispida*, Rominger,* is a form which differs from *F. Hisingeri*, as generally understood, only in a slight increase in the diameter of the\n\n---\n\nGeological Survey of Michigan, Fossil Corals, p. 22, pl. V., fig. 4. 1876.\ncorallites which, in the former species, are described as being a little over 1\u00b75 mm. wide. The difference in the size of the corallites in the two species is so slight that the writer is inclined to regard *F. hispida* as not specifically distinct from *F. Hisingeri*, but rather as a form of the latter in which the corallites are a trifle larger than the average.\n\nOccurs in the Niagara and Guelph formations in Ontario; on Cockburn and Drummond Islands, Lake Huron and at Thorold (Niagara); at Elora and near Durham, lot 16, concession 1, Bentinck township, county of Grey (Guelph).\n\n**Favosites Niagarensis**, Hall.\n\n(Non *F. Niagarensis*, Rominger.)\n\n*Favosites Niagarensis*, Hall. 1852. Pal\u00e6on., New York, vol. II., p. 125, pl. 34A bis, figs. 4a\u2014i.\n\nA number of specimens of a favosite coral, in the collection of this survey, from rocks of presumably Lower Helderberg age are here referred to this species; they have been collected, by officers of the survey at various dates since 1858, between Cap des Rosiers and Cape Gasp\u00e9, at Cap Bon Ami, Gasp\u00e9, on the Matapedia and Restigouche rivers, at one mile east of the Little Cascapedia River and at Cap Bon Ami, N.B., near Dalhousie. These specimens are either spherical or clavate, with gradations between these forms, and seem generally to have had a small basal attachment. The corallites are rather unequal in size and vary in diameter from 5 mm. to slightly over 2 mm. The tabulae are well preserved, regular and complete, from about five to ten occurring in a space of 5 mm. The sides of the corallites are beset with small spiniform septa and are pierced by one or two rows of pores. In one specimen from Cap Bon Ami, Gasp\u00e9, the coral, beginning with a basal diameter of 2 cent., increases in thickness slowly for some distance upward, then expanding more rapidly, reaches a diameter of nearly 6 cent. near the top and is rather regularly rounded above; the total height of the specimen is 22 cent.\n\nThe Canadian coral agrees with the one described by Hall, in having corallites that are smaller than those of *F. Gothlandica*, in the position of the pores in the sides of the corallites and in the small basal point of attachment of the corallum. Its general contour is often spherical but frequently becomes higher than broad and sometimes clavate. In the description of *F. Niagarensis* the corallum is stated to be spherical or irregular in form.\n\nIn describing *Favosites Helderbergiae*, Hall states that it \"differs from *Favosites Niagarensis*, which it resembles in the size of its cells, in\n\n---\n\n*Pal\u00e6on. New York, vol. VI., p. 8, 1887.*\nhaving more numerous diaphragms and in the mural pores being on the lateral faces instead of at the angles of the cells.\" This last distinction disappears when we consider that *F. Niagarensis* is described as having pores \"distinctly visible in the sides of the cells,\" and the figures of this species* would lead to the belief that the distances apart of the tabulae are very variable. The only difference then between *F. Helderbergia* and *F. Niagarensis* appears to be in the shape of the corallum which in the former species is \"large, lenticular, depressed convex or hemispherical,\" and in the latter spherical or clavate, a difference which though slight, may be considered sufficient, if it be constant, for the separation of the two species.\n\n**Favosites Gaspensis. (Sp. nov.)**\n\nCorallum subdendroid or irregularly lobate with polygonal calyces opening on the entire surface; branches or lobes compressed laterally and varying in their lesser diameter from over 20 to less than 8 mm. The corallites radiate from an imaginary central axis and emerge at right angles to the surface; they are thin walled, polygonal in section and rather unequal in size but average nearly 3 mm. in width with a few that are somewhat larger. Walls of the corallites pierced by one or two rows of circular pores and carrying on their inner surfaces numerous short septal spines. Tabulae complete, horizontal, about .5 mm. apart.\n\nThis species is of interest on account of the shape of the corallum and of the large size of the corallites; it bears some resemblance, particularly in the size of the corallites, to the branching coral *Favosites cervicornis\u2020* (Can. Jour., new series, vol. IV., p. 110, fig. 9) from the Corniferous of Ontario, but differs therefrom in several particulars especially, as all Silurian corals of this genus do from those of the Devonian system, in having septal spines instead of squamulae.\n\nOne specimen from l'Anse au Gascon, Baie des Chaleurs, Que.; collected by R.

Under surfaces and often the sides protected by a strong wrinkled epitheca; the wrinkles are generally rather irregularly disposed and overlap or run into each other, but in some specimens they are more nearly parallel and give to the epitheca a ribbed appearance. The basal portion of the corallum is frequently strongly plicated. The ends of the corallites, when directed upward or outward, except at the top of the corallum, are generally closed by opercula which show a certain amount of concentric structure. The corallites are generally prismatic and rather equal in size when the surface of the corallum is moderately flat but round and unequal in size in specimens or parts of specimens where the surface is rounded; varying in diameter in the same colony or in different individuals from 2 mm., or even less, to 4 or 5 mm. Tabulae horizontal, complete, sometimes apparently formed by the union of several squamulae which are present in large numbers. Pores piercing the sides of the corallites in from one to three longitudinal rows, in some specimens large and placed close together, in others smaller and farther apart, generally surrounded by a raised rim which is frequently not preserved on much weathered surfaces. Inner surface of the corallites marked, with varying distinctness, by longitudinal impressed lines, one to each space, between the rows of pores.\n\nThis coral is subject to much variation in outward form, in the size and number of the mural pores and in the size and shape of the corallites themselves, whilst its appearance is much affected by the state of preservation of the epitheca and of the tabulae and squamulae, especially the\nlast, which are frequently not preserved, leaving the walls of the corallites on the inside quite smooth.\n\nThe squamulae occur one above another in longitudinal rows corresponding in a general way with the rows of pores, those of one row frequently interlocking with those of another. When the mural pores are numerous the squamulae are generally placed one above each pore, but, when fewer in number and farther apart, two or three squamulae are found occupying the space between any two pores of a longitudinal row. From this it would appear that the squamulae may be equally numerous when the pores are distant from each other or when they are placed close together. Most frequently the squamulae have their bases only preserved but under favourable circumstances they are seen to reach the centre of the corallite in the form of thin tongue-shaped processes that are longer than broad and at times inclined slightly upward.\n\nIn different coralla the pores vary in diameter from about .33 to .50 mm., and in their distance from each other; in some specimens, especially in those in which the pores are large, they are about .50 mm. from each other, whilst in others they are as much as 2 mm, apart vertically. In most cases the absence of the raised border of the pores is probably due to weathering, as examples occur in which the rim is present in certain portions of the corallum and absent in more exposed parts; in the case of the latter the pores appear larger than they really are.\n\nAs in some other species of the genus, small marginal depressions in the tabulae are not unfrequently developed.\n\nBroadly expanded examples sometimes measure nearly 9 inches across with a height of 3 or 4 inches; clavate specimens occur that are 10 or more inches high and a few inches thick; some of the pyriform specimens are 6 or 7 inches high and 5 or 6 inches in breadth.\n\nThe large collection of specimens of this species in the museum of the Geological Survey has enabled the writer to study the many transitional stages between examples with large close set pores, which are undoubtedly the *F. tuberosa* of Rominger, and others that agree in every particular with *F. epidermata*, Rominger.\n\nAbundant in the Corniferous formation of Ontario.\nFavosites hemispherica, Milne-Edwards and Haime.

Corallites prismatic, rather unequal in size, varying from 1 to 2\u00b75 mm. in diameter in the same specimen. Pores with raised margins, in one, two or three rows in the sides of the walls of the corallites, placed close together; about 2 mm. in diameter and 50 mm. apart. Tabulae apparently absent. Squamulae very numerous, one above each pore, reaching to and often past the centre of the corallites, frequently insculpting, thin at the edge with strong bases, about 50 mm. apart vertically and often inclined slightly upward or downward; those of one row generally alternating and interlocking with those of another.\n\nComplete tabulae seem to be wanting, but as in Favosites basaltica the union of several squamulae, on about the same level, may result in the production of an undulating and rather imperfect partition across the corallite.\n\nThis species differs from F. basaltica, Goldfuss, in the apparent absence of true tabulae and in the somewhat more numerous squamulae, although if a comparison be made with some specimens of F. basaltica in which the pores and squamulae are abundant, the difference is seen to be so slight as to make it doubtful whether F. hemispherica is really distinct from F. basaltica; perhaps it would be better to regard it rather as a variety of basaltica than as a distinct species. In 1859, in the Canadian Journal, vol.

In the most typical specimens there is a differentiation of the corallites into comparatively large rounded or almost circular tubes, at an average distance of about 4 mm. apart, and smaller prismatic tubes in the intervals. In portions however of the same specimens the difference in the shape and size of the two forms of corallites may be less apparent or may disappear altogether, whilst in some individuals prismatic corallites, having an average diameter of about 1 mm., alone occur; the circular corallites are from 1 to nearly 2 mm. in diameter. Pores small, about \u00b717 mm. in diameter, close together, about \u00b733 mm. apart vertically, in one, two or three rows in the sides of the corallites. Tabul\u00e6 horizontal, entire.

A thin epitheca covers the lower part of the corallum and extends for some distance up the branches. Within, the corallites diverge obliquely outward and upward from an imaginary axial line and terminate at right angles or rather obliquely to the surface; they are moderately thin walled throughout their length and polygonal in section, but in some cases, the walls become quite stout. Calyces unequal in size, generally with smaller ones dispersed between the larger ones; varying in diameter in the same specimen from 2 mm., or even slightly more, to 1 mm. Pores not very numerous, of moderate size, in one or sometimes two rows in the sides of the corallites. Tabulae horizontal, complete. Inner surfaces of the walls bearing numerous, horizontal, lamellar squamulae that project only a short distance into the corallites. In the basal part of the corallum the outlines of the calyces are clearly defined in the epitheca which is also roughened by irregular, raised, horizontal ridges.\n\nTwo specimens from Ontario show the low bushy shape of the corallum well; one is slightly over 7 cent. high, nearly 13 cent. broad with nine main subdivisions which during life were apparently about to bifurcate; the other is nearly 11 cent. high, 16 cent. broad with about the same number of stems or main branches, each of which subdivides two or three times.\n\nFound in the Corniferous formation of Ontario, and of the Moose-River district. The specimens in the collection of the survey from Ontario are from the township of Walpole, Haldimand county and from the township of Wainfleet in the county of Welland.

Tubes unequal, the larger ones circular, measuring in different specimens from one-half to one and a half millimeter in diameter; the smaller tubes filling the interstices between the larger ones are subangular. Orifices at the ends of the branches all open; on the sides of the stems most of them are found closed by opercula. Opercula flat or convex, some of them decorated with twelve marginal carinae radiating toward the centre. Diaphragms partly simple and regular, but largely intermingled with irregular partial septa, formed\nby the development of lateral squamae analogous to the vertical rows of leaflets in other species of Favosites. Pores numerous.\"\n\nThis species differs from *F. nitella*, Winchell only in its mode of growth; in *F. clausa* the corallum is dendroid, in *F. nitella* it is generally discoidal, but sometimes digitato-ramose. In the original description* of the latter species it is said to occur in \"small masses varying from globoid to elongate or scarcely branching.\"\n\nWhether *F. clausa* is really distinct from *F. nitella* is a question which can only be solved by the study of a large series of specimens showing the variation in form of the corallum in both species; such a series is not at present available to the writer.\n\nThe specimens in the collection of the survey are from the Hamilton formation of Ontario, at Thedford and vicinity, in the township of Bosanquet, and from the Aux Sable River; and from the Corniferous at Cayuga, Ont.\n\n**Favosites radiciformis**, Rominger.\n\n*Favosites radiciformis*, Rominger. 1876.

Such specimens are very unlike, in external appearance, those with normally formed tube orifices.\"\n\nWith this species are identified a few fragmentary specimens from the Corniferous limestone near Woodstock, Ont., collected by Alexander Murray in 1860, and two fragments from rocks of the same age at Long Portage, Missinaibi River to Moose Factory, R. Bell, 1877. In one of the specimens from Woodstock the openings of the corallites are very\n\n---\n\n*Winchell. 1886. Rep.

II, p. 121.\n\nCorallum normally turbinate with the apex of the cone as the initial point, but varying very considerably in shape; up to about 15 cent. in diameter. The corallum is almost invariably strongly curved for a short distance from the pointed base and expands more or less rapidly, at times so rapidly as to make the breadth much greater than the height. Or, the growth of the corallum may continue in an upward direction, without much increase in breadth, producing a club-shaped form which may be straight, curved or abruptly bent or twisted. The corallites curve outward from an imaginary central axis and emerge at or nearly at right angles to the surface; they are distinctly prismatic, of rather uniform size, from about 1 to over 2 mm. in diameter and are faintly striated transversely on the outside. In some specimens scattered tubes of a size noticeably larger than the average sized ones may be observed. The outer ends of the corallites over the whole of the surface of the corallum, except at or near the top, are closed by concentrically striated opercula which frequently exhibit about twelve crenulations or depressions at the edge. The opercular coverings appear to thicken and amalgamate with age and to then have the appearance of a rather thin, smooth epitheca in which the prismatic ends of the corallites can still be traced. The pores are more frequently arranged in a single than a double row in the sides of the corallites but their size and distance apart seem\nto be subject to considerable variation. The tabulae are complete and are on an average, about 1\u00b75 mm. apart, and in some specimens \"squamulae\" are seen to be present though never apparently in large numbers.\n\nAbundant in the Corniferous and Hamilton formations of Ontario; found also in the Oriskany sandstone. The largest specimen in the museum is from the Corniferous; it was about 1 foot long when perfect and is over 5 inches in diameter at its broadest part. *Calamopora basaltica* of Goldfuss from the Eifel (pl. XXVI, figs. 4c, 4d, op. cit.) bears a strong resemblance in the size and curve of its corallites and the arrangement and size of the pores to *F. turbinata*, Billings. The specimen figured by Goldfuss is a fragment only, so that it is impossible to tell what the shape of the corallum was when entire, although the marked curve of the corallites might suggest a form similar to the typical one of *F. turbinata*.\n\nIn the enlarged drawing the pores are in a single row on two sides of the corallites and there is a partly double row on a third side, also in figure 4c the pores are shown in single and double rows. The tabulae are apparently complete.\n\nIf, at any future time, it is found that *F. turbinata* is the same specifically as the coral represented by Goldfuss in these two figures, the name *turbinata* would still remain in use as the other form of *Calamopora basaltica*, Goldfuss from Lake Erie (fig. 4a), which is in the writer's opinion conspecific with *F. epidermata*, Rominger and was evidently considered the type of the species by its author, as it is mentioned and figured first, should be known as *F. basaltica*, Goldfuss.\n\nIt is possible that the *Calamopora hemispherica* of Troost is conspecific with *F. turbinata* but the description is so indefinite as to render it a matter of conjecture whether the two belong to the same species or not. As the \"Fifth Geological Report to the Twenty-third General Assembly of Tennessee\" may be difficult of access to many it is thought advisable to give Troost's description in extenso; it is as follows:\u2014\"Calamopora hemispherica, nobis. The fossil to which I have applied the name of *hemispherica* occurs, so far as I have been able to observe, only in hemispherical masses. It is formed of tubes of such size that nine of them, placed the one next to the other, will occupy half an inch; they radiate from the centre towards the circumference. In the interior of the mass they are internally and externally prismatic, but the upper surface is so much incrusted, that their oral apertures have no regular shape. Some of these tubes (on water worn masses) project here and there, and are then internally as well as externally cylindrical, and not connected together; they may be mistaken for *Syringopora*. The transverse septa are flat, and the connecting pores placed in the middle of the sides.\"\nYandell and Shumard in the \"Contributions to the Geology of Kentucky\" refer to Troost's fossil in the following words:\u2014\"Favosites hemispherica.\u2014This fossil the most characteristic of the shell-beds, to which it is limited, is abundant on the Falls, and is found in masses of a hemispherical figure, which vary from one to ten inches in diameter. It is most commonly calcareous, though sometimes it is siliceous;\" no further information regarding the structure is given.\n\nRominger states in his \"Fossil Corals of Michigan\" that \"all the original specimens of Fav. hemisph. kept in Mr. Yandell's collections are identical with Favosites turbinatus of Billings.\" As to most palaeontologists, however, definite descriptions with figures are often the only means available for the study of already described species, and as Billings has evidently given the first description with figures that places beyond doubt the identity of the fossil referred to, it appears best, to the writer at least, in the interests of science, that the name turbinata should be retained for this particular species.\n\n**Favosites nitella**, Winchell.\n\n*Favosites nitella*, Winchell. 1866.

When discoid the coral expands laterally from a basal initial point of attachment, and rarely exceed 5 inches in diameter and between $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch and 2 inches in height; the edges are thin, the upper surface flat or undulating, at times nodose, the lower surface generally uneven, covered by a concentrically wrinkled and finely striated epitheca. In gaps in the epitheca of the under surface, at the edges and sometimes on portions of the upper surface the ends of the corallites are closed by opercula. In the digitate forms the corallites incline outward from an imaginary axis and have their outer ends closed by opercula except at the top, or if the coralla or portions of them were prostrate or inclined as they appear to have been at times, opercula are seen on the lower surfaces only.\n\nCorallites unequal in size, prismatic, with rather thick walls and rounded angles, varying in diameter from .50 to 1 mm. in the same coral-lum. In some specimens or at times in parts only, almost circular corallites about 1 mm. or slightly less in diameter are developed and are seen at varying intervals apart on the surface, the spaces between being\noccupied by corallites of smaller size but of the usual shape. Pores rather large, about 33 mm. in diameter, from 1 to 1.5 mm. apart vertically and in a single row in the sides of the corallites. Tabulae horizontal, complete; squamulae present in small numbers and of the usual shape.\n\nThis species approaches most nearly to *Favosites Canadensis*, Billings, of the Corniferous limestone, from which it may be easily recognised principally by the small size and characteristic shape of the corallum, by the smallness of the corallites and by its having rather large pores in single rows as well as by the comparative fewness of the squamulae.\n\nAbundant in the Hamilton formation of Ontario.\n\n**Favosites Alpenensis**, Winchell.\n\n*Favosites Algenensis*, Winchell. 1866.

Squamulae few in number, rather small, narrow and rather short, extending only a short distance into the corallites. Inner surface of corallites faintly striated longitudinally.\n\nThis species is distinguishable from other Devonian *Favosites* principally by the size of the corallites whose sides have most frequently only one row of pores and by the fewness and small size of the squamulae as well as the large number of well developed tabulae.\n\nFound in the \"Middle Devonian *\" of Lakes Winnipegosis and Manitoba.\n\nWestern shore of Dawson Bay, Lake Winnipegosis, J.

It was on the strength of these determinations that Mr. Whiteaves identified the Manitoba specimens of *F. Alpenensis* with *F. Gothlandica*.

The calyces are typically subtriangular and oblique to the surface, although in some species this obliquity is less apparent, as is also the compression of the corallites. The pores and tabulae, septal spines or squamulae are as a general rule not so numerous as in *Favosites* whilst the development of longitudinal ridges forms one of the features which distinguish this genus from *Favosites* and suggests its near relationship to *Cladopora*.\n\n**Alveolites Labechei**, Milne-Edwards and Haime.\n\n*Alveolites Labechei*, Milne-Edwards and Haime. 1851.

An *Alveolite* similar in structure to the Anticosti one is found at Fossil Hill, Manitoulin Island, Lake Huron and at Skunk Island off the south-western end of Manitoulin Island, also a little further west at Point Detour and at Owen Sound, Ont. A small specimen which probably also belongs to this species was found at l\u2019Anse au Gascon, Baie des Chaleurs, in rocks that have been assigned to the Lower Helderberg formation. The specimens from Skunk Island, Manitoulin Island, Point Detour and Owen Sound are from the Niagara formation, and those from Anticosti from the probable equivalent of that formation on the island.\n\nA specimen that is thought to belong to this species was collected on the north-east side of Lake Winnipegosis (Station 227, No. 198) by J. B. Tyrrell, in 1889 (Silurian).\n\nThe corallum of the Canadian representatives of this species takes the form of a low spreading mass, attached centrally at the base, with a somewhat convex upper surface, and a flat concentrically wrinkled lower surface with a thin epithecal covering; a specimen from South-west Point, Anticosti, has a breadth of about 8 inches with a thickness of nearly 2 inches at the centre. Other specimens, some of them from Manitoulin Island and vicinity, depart from this form of growth and have a less symmetrical shape; they are frequently much thicker without a cor-\nresponding increase in breadth. The corallites are compressed and diverge from one or more basal points outward with calyces oblique to the upper surface; they are thin walled throughout their length and vary in breadth from .5 to 1 mm., with a height of about .25 mm. Pores of moderate size placed at the angular edges of the corallites. Tabulae numerous, directly transverse, about .5 mm. apart. In some of the Lake Huron specimens a longitudinal ridge is present on the lower side of the calyces, and two or three rows of septal spines can be seen projecting from the inner surface of the upper wall of the corallites.\n\nOf this species Milne-Edwards and Haime remark that it very closely resembles *A. suborbicularis*, Lamarck, of the Devonian formation, a species that has not as yet been recognized in Canada.\n\n**Alveolites Niagarensis,** Rominger.\n\n*Alveolites Niagarensis*, Rominger. 1876.

The compressed tubes are always more convex on the upper sides, with a corresponding concavity of the lower sides, which rest on the convexities of the subjacent tubes. The compression is sometimes only moderate, and the outside of the oblique orifices is formed by a projecting arched lip; in other specimens the compression is stronger, the orifices become narrow, lanceolate, or fissure-like, with an appressed subplane lip on the outer side. The orifices of the majority of specimens are surrounded by a cycle of denticules, corresponding to longitudinal rows of spinules along the inner surface of the tube walls. The rows are rarely fully twelve in number, and some of them are always more strongly developed than others. In some specimens no denticulation of the orifices can be observed, and the tube channels are found to be almost smooth; this is not the case in all cases owing to the want of development of the crests or spinules; these seem often to have been obliterated by imperfect preservation in the process of petrification.\"\n\n*In 1889 Mr. S. A. Miller in his \"North American Geology and Palaeontology\" proposed the name *A. undosus* for this species. As Nicholson had already, in 1875, in the \"Palaeontology of Ontario\" described a dendroid coral from the Niagara limestone at Rockwood, Ont., under the name *Alveolites Niagarensis*, and as this coral is not an *Alveolites* but most probably a *Cladopora*, the specific name of Rominger's coral is here retained.*\n\"Diaphragms somewhat distant and oblique. Pores large, marginal, causing a pouch-like dilation of the tube wall at the spot where situated. Diameter of tubes in the wider transverse direction varies in different specimens, from a half to one millimeter, which difference in size greatly alters their aspect. The degree of compression of the tubes, their more erect or more prostrate position in various specimens also cause numerous variations in their appearance, but no tangible line between one and another of the forms exists.\" \"It occurs in great abundance in the Niagara group of Drummond Island, at Point Detour, and in other localities.\" (Rominger.)\n\nWith this species are identified specimens collected by R. Bell, at the north end of Lake Temiscaming, Que., in 1887, by J. B. Tyrrell, in 1890, at Grand Rapids, Roche Rouge, Cross Lake Rapids and Chemahawin, all on the Saskatchewan River, in the district of Saskatchewan, by D. B. Dowling, at Grand Rapids, in 1881, and by A. E. Barlow, on the Isle of Mann (Burnt Island) Lake Temiscaming, Que., in 1893. At these localities the rocks are of Niagara age. The large prominent pores mentioned by Rominger are well shown, especially in the specimens from Cross Lake Rapids, where the rock is a light yellow dolomitic limestone, and the coral is preserved so that the corallites are free of matrix and show the tabulae and septal spines; in the examples from Lake Temiscaming the structure is best seen in sections. Another specimen was collected at Limestone Rapids, on the Fawn branch of the Severn River, by A. P. Low, in 1886.*\n\nThe corallites in these particular specimens are irregularly polygonal, scarcely any compression is noticeable and they emerge rather at right angles than obliquely to the surface. A near approach to *Favosites* is thus seen to occur in a species which shows a considerable variation in structural details on which depend its generic affinities.\n\n**Alveolites Goldfussi**, Billings.\n\n*Alveolites Goldfussi*, Billings. 1860.

The corallites, as seen in vertical sections radiate upward and outward from the basal nucleus with a spiral twist and emerge obliquely to the surface; they are thin walled throughout their length, subpolygonal in transverse section, about 1.5 mm. wide and .9 mm. high, generally with a broadly arched convex upper wall, one or two somewhat concave lower walls and two short, straight, side walls, with modifications of these. The obliquity of the corallites to the surface and their compression are subject to much variation, those that are most oblique showing the greatest amount of compression. The corallites undergo no change at the surface, they end abruptly without expanding and without any thickening of their walls, the calyces being subpolygonal and of the same shape and size as the corallites in the interior of the corallum. Mural pores of moderate size, occurring in the sides of the walls of the corallites, not numerous. Tabulae complete, placed at irregular intervals. The inside surfaces of the walls of the corallites, as shown by natural exposure through weathering and by means of sections, are studded with numerous small squamulae arranged in longitudinal rows, those of one row alternating with those of the next, in the manner so usual in certain species of Devonian *Favosites*.

Corallites moderately thin walled throughout their length, flattened, wider than high, with a broadly arched upper wall and generally doubly concave on the lower side, reaching the surface at a somewhat oblique, but rather variable angle; average size \u00b775 mm. wide and \u00b75 mm. high. Pores of fair size, about \u00b72 mm. in diameter and \u00b75 mm. apart, occurring in single rows near the two angular sides of the corallites. Tabulae numerous, complete, from about eight to fourteen in a space of 5 mm. Numerous small spiniform septa project from the inner surfaces of the walls of the corallites; these are only seen in very well preserved specimens, either in polished sections or when the corallites are free from matrix. A strong longitudinal ridge is present on the lower surface of the calyces and extends apparently for a short distance only into the interior of the corallites. At times the corallites appear to radiate from a number of centres, with a consequent result that the corallites in these specimens are rather unequal in size, and their obliquity to the surface is variable.\n\nThis species was described by Meek from specimens collected by Robert Kennicott at the \"Ramparts\" on the Mackenzie River, forty miles above old Fort Good Hope. Through the kindness of the authorities of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, the writer has been\nenabled to examine Meek's type specimens and to compare them with specimens in the Survey collection, from the Hay, Mackenzie, Peace and Moose rivers, and Lake Winnipegosis, that had been referred by Mr. Whiteaves to Meek's species.\n\n*Alveolites vallorum* bears a striking resemblance to *A. suborbicularis*, Lamarck, as figured by Goldfuss in the *Petrefacta Germaniae*, pl. XXVIII., figs. 1a\u2014e. The resemblance in structural details between the two species is also seen in a description given by Nicholson of some specimens of *A. suborbicularis* collected by him in the Eifel; this authority is inclined to separate a form with numerous spiniform septa and a pedunculate base from one with an incrusting habit in which septa were not seen. From Goldfuss's figures it would appear that the corallum is very variable in shape and would include both forms. As regards the septa, they can be recognized only under favourable circumstances in well preserved specimens. The retention of Meek's species for the reception of the Canadian specimens is, however, thought advisable until it can be ascertained by direct comparison what the true relationship of *A. vallorum* to *A. suborbicularis* really is.\n\nThis species is represented in the collection by specimens from Devonian rocks at the following localities: junction of the Red and Peace rivers, A. R. C. Selwyn and J. Macoun, 1875; between the Long Portage of the Missinaibi branch of the Moose River and Moose Factory, R. Bell, 1877; Hay River, forty miles above its mouth, R. G. McConnell, 1887 and 1888; Mackenzie River at the \"Ramparts\" and at \"Rock by the river's side,\" R. G. McConnell, 1888; Peace River at Vermilion Falls, R. G. McConnell, 1889; Lake Winnipegosis, J.

Walls of the corallites thin, except at the surface, where they are greatly thickened, causing the calyces to have the form of narrow slits. Calyces more or less curved, sometimes straight, about 2 mm. long and .25 mm. wide with thick rounded margins and a broad not very distinct lip on the concave side of the opening; a depressed line surrounding the calyces defines the outer limits of the corallites. Tabulae complete, distant. Mural pores of medium size, placed about 1 mm. apart in the narrow edges, but also occurring irregularly in the broad sides of the corallites. The epitheca is finely striated in a direction at right angles to the length of the corallites. The calyces are sometimes quite straight, but it is usual to find them either evenly curved backward or else bending backward at either end; they are about 1 mm. in advance of each other and overlap laterally.\nC\u0153nites Selwynii bears a close resemblance to the Silurian C. linearis, Milne-Edwards and Haime*, but its calyces are about twice as broad and are more generally curved than straight.\n\nRare in the Corniferous limestone of Ontario; the specimen described by Nicholson, the only one that he had seen, was collected at Port Colborne; the single specimen representing the species in the collection of the Geological Survey was obtained by Mr. S.

The corallites are at first subpolygonal and sometimes slightly compressed, later becoming more nearly circular as the walls thicken; in the ramose or fan-shaped forms they diverge from an inner axial line or plane and end in circular, oval, reniform, sometimes almost lunate calyces more or less oblique to the surface. The longitudinal ridges apparently do not extend far into the corallites and end where the calycular expansion takes place.

The corallites are almost vertical, or only slightly inclined outward in the central part of the stems or branches, but near their distal ends they bend rather abruptly outward so that the calyces are almost at right angles to the surface. The walls of the corallites become stouter as they approach the surface, where the maximum thickness is attained. The calyces are rather irregularly disposed, not arranged in definite rows, somewhat angular, wider than high, their distance apart vertically being about equal to their width; from 3 to 5 mm. wide and about half as high. Tabulae and septa have not been recognized, but comparatively large mural pores are seen to be present.\n\nMilne-Edwards and Haime, in their British Fossil Corals, p. 263, make Cladopora multipora, Hall synonymous with their species Alveolites? seriatorporoides.

Calyces about 75 mm. in width and slightly less from back to front, and separated from each other by an average distance, due to the thickened walls at the surface, of 5 mm.

Corallites circular or rounded polygonal in section, gradually increasing in size until an average diameter of 1\u00b75 mm. is attained at the surface. Tabulae, as seen in longitudinal section, complete, about '5 mm. apart. Squamulae small, occurring on the sides of the walls of the corallites. Pores rather irregular in distribution, of moderate size.

That this species is at times reticulated, is borne out by a specimen presumably belonging to this species, in which frequent coalescence of the branches is observable. In some specimens many of the calyces are closed by opercula.\n\nIn only a few of the specimens are the longitudinal ridges apparent, the corallites being as a rule either filled with matrix or quite empty with smooth sides. The tabulae and squamulae are seen in longitudinal sections, whilst the pores are preserved in most of the specimens. The wearing or weathering of the surface, with the destruction of the lips of the calyces, brings to light the subcircular or polygonal outlines of the individual corallites, a feature not seen when the surface is entire.\n\nIn a specimen of *C. cryptodens*, in which the tooth-like ridges are preserved near the mouths of the corallites, striations are seen on the walls of the calyces, as in *Striatopora formosa*. These two species are strikingly similar in outward form and the discovery in the former of a character which was relied on for their specific as well as generic separation, can scarcely leave any doubt as to their being conspecific. The calicular striations are not seen except in weathered specimens and may represent septal ridges or grooves only partially developed, or possibly are the result of the unequal weathering of the wall substance of the corallites. The specimen of *C. cryptodens* referred to was obtained in the Corniferous limestone at Rama's Farm, Port Colborne, Ont., by E. Billings in 1857.\n\nThis species occurs in the Corniferous limestone of Ontario and in the Devonian formation on the Red Deer River, Lake Winnipegosis; it has also been collected from Devonian rocks at the Long Portage, Missinaibi River, and on the Albany River.\n\n**Cladopora labiosa**, Billings.

Corallites irregularly polygonal, having an average diameter of about '5 mm. but varying considerably in size, with moderately thin walls that exhibit a gradual thickening toward the calyces. The corallites bend outward and upward, as in other species of this genus having a palmate or flabellate corallum, from a central axial plane and issue obliquely to the surface on both sides of the expansion. Calyces, with an average breadth of about '75 mm., circular, transversely oval, semicircular or reniform, with the lower edge produced so as to form a sharp-edged lip;\ndistance apart variable, depending on the amount of thickening of the walls of the corallites at the surface, but generally less than their width. In parts of the corallum, possibly where the regularity of growth has been disturbed, the calyces are nearly or quite at right angles to the surface and irregular in shape, with rounded outlines and without a lip. Often on one side of the expansion, as in *Cladopora turgida*, Rominger, the outlines of the calyces are less sharply defined and more depressed than on the other, the difference in the two sides resulting possibly from the corallum not growing quite erect, the side on which the more sharply defined calyces are being probably uppermost. The calyces are frequently closed by opercula. Mural pores of moderate size, about 1 mm. apart vertically, and not occurring in regular rows. Tabulae complete, few in number.\n\nThis species is apparently nearly related to *Cladopora turgida*, Rominger, from which it can be readily distinguished by the comparative thinness of its corallum and more delicate form of growth generally, and by the smaller size of its calyces, which have thinner walls and are consequently much closer together.\n\nAbundant in the Hamilton formation of Ontario, and found occasionally in the Corniferous limestone of the same province.\n\n**Cladopora frondosa**, Nicholson.

Corallites subpolygonal or circular, '3 mm. in average diameter, beginning with moderately thin walls that become gradually thickened as they proceed outward from the central axial plane to the surface on both sides, where their greatest thickness, which is often considerable, especially in the basal portion of the corallum, is reached. Calyces small, lunate or crescentic, about \u00b76 or \u00b77 mm. in breadth, provided below with a sharp lip that is more or less prominent and often depressed below the general level; generally about their own breadth apart, or even\nless, but often more widely separated, especially near the base. Lips of the calyces more or less indented at the centre. As in *C. Fischeri*, Billings, and *C. turgida*, Rominger, the outlines of the calyces are more rounded off or less sharply defined on one side of the corallum than on the other, and on this side also faint polygons, surrounding the calyces, are sometimes seen marking the limits of contiguous corallites at the surface.\n\nAbundant in the Hamilton formation of Ontario. Mural pores rather small, few in number. Tabulae not observed, but they are mentioned by Nicholson as being present in specimens examined by him.\n\nThis species is distinguished from *C. Fischeri* mainly by the smaller size of the corallites and the decidedly crescentic shape of the calyces; it appears to form a link connecting this genus with *Coenites*, Eichwald, in which the walls of the corallites are very much thickened at the surface, and the calyces have the form of curved or linear fissures.\n\n**Cladopora turgida**, Rominger.\n\n*Cladopora turgida*, Rominger. 1876. Geol. Surv. Mich., Foss. Corals, p. 48, pl. XIX., fig. 2.\n\nCorallum in the form of flabellate expansions with rounded edges, attaining a height of over 5 inches with a thickness of about 10 mm., and of varying breadth. Corallites diverging upward and outward from an imaginary inner axial plane, which is often nearer one side of the expansion than the other, and issuing obliquely to the surface on both sides and on the edges of the corallum; calyces generally slightly over 1 mm. in maximum width, circular or transversely oval, with a slightly thickened lip forming the lower boundary, and generally less than their width apart. The corallites, owing to the excentricity of the axial plane from which they ascend, are often longer on one side of the expansion than on the other, the longer corallites having more prominent and less oblique calyces than the shorter ones. Corallites almost circular and greatly thickened as the surface is approached. Mural pores, distant, rather small. What appear to be tabulae are seen in a few specimens at distant intervals. The calyces, especially in the lower portions of the corallum, are frequently closed by opercula.\n\nOccurs in the Corniferous limestone of Ontario. A fragment of a specimen of this species was collected by R. Kennicott at the \"Ramparts,\" Mackenzie River, and is the property of the United States National Museum at Washington.\nCladopora lichenoides, Rominger.\n\nCorallum spreading horizontally in rather thin laminar expansions, from 2 or 3 mm. to over 10 mm. in thickness, with an epitheca on the lower side; frequently the expansions occur one above the other in an approximately parallel sequence, one tier connected with the one immediately below it at one or more points, but otherwise distinct and separated by varying distances. Corallites averaging 1 mm. in diameter, at first prostrate and as a rule slightly flattened, then bending upward and becoming more nearly circular in transverse section, and finally emerging at a slightly oblique angle to the surface. Walls of the corallites thin below, but gradually thickened as the surface is approached, in some specimens considerably more than in others. Calyces rather variable in shape, irregularly subpolygonal or oval, 1 mm. in average width, three or four occurring in a space of 5 mm.; they are without a definite lip except when their obliquity to the surface becomes pronounced. Tabulae complete, distant. Squamulae, as shown in one specimen, occurring on the inside of the walls of the corallites. Mural pores of moderate size, not abundant.\n\nThis species in having corallites that are more or less flattened when prostrate near the base of the expansion shows a certain likeness to Alveolites, which, however, disappears when the walls of the corallites become thick; it is readily distinguished from other species of Cladopora by its general form of growth.\n\nFound in the Corniferous limestone of Ontario.\n\nCladopora Remeri, Billings.

McConnell).\n\nThis species was defined by Mr. Billings in the following short description\u2014\"Stems from two to three lines in diameter, usually cylindrical, but sometimes sub-palmate, branching. Cells transversely oval, about half a line wide and one-fourth of a line in length; in general distant from each other from half a line to two-thirds of a line in the longitudinal direction of the stem, and half that distance in the transverse direction.\"\nThe branches or stems are generally found in a fragmentary condition, in pieces an inch or two in length. An examination of the type and other specimens in the collection of the Geological Survey tends to show that the only difference between this species and *C. Fischeri*, Billings, is found in the shape of the corallum, which in the former is ramos\u00e8 with cylindrical or subpalmate branches, and in the latter irregularly palmate or flabellate.\n\nWhat has already been said about the general structure of *C. Fischeri*, as regards the form and size of the corallites and calyces, the disposition of the mural pores and other details, applies equally to *C. R\u00e4meri*, the only differences being those incidental to the change in the form of the corallum. Although in the latter species the cylindrical stems become at times subpalmate, no specimens of either species have apparently been seen that would justify the opinion that the two forms passed the one into the other; in the meantime therefore the writer is inclined to regard *C. R\u00e4meri* as worthy of specific distinction.\n\nFound in the Hamilton formation of Ontario, and recognized by Mr. Whiteaves in a specimen collected by R. G. McConnell, in 1875, from the upper Devonian of the Peace River, in the district of Athabasca.\n\n**Genus Michelinia**, De Koninck. 1842.\n\n*(An. foss. des terr.

The point of attachment of the corallum is at the centre of the base which is covered by a strong, concentrically wrinkled epitheca. Corallites large, polygonal, thin walled, attaining a diameter of 9 or 10 mm., with small ones interspaced among the large ones; in some specimens the average size of the mature corallites is much less. Tabulae strongly convex, numerous, with many secondary tabulae or cysts resting on the complete tabulae, principally nearer the walls of the corallites than at the centre, the whole forming a vesiculose mass filling the interior of the corallites. The presence of the secondary tabulae on the primary ones gives to the latter a peculiar blistered appearance when seen from above. In corallites of average size about forty parallel, longitudinal striae occur on the inner surface of the walls, which are further decorated on the spaces between the striae by numerous short blunt septal spines. Pores of rather unequal size, edged with a raised rim, generally irregularly distributed though sometimes becoming more numerous and forming regular vertical rows between the longitudinal striae.\n\nOccurs in the Corniferous limestone of Ontario at Port Colborne, Cayuga and near Woodstock.\n\n**Michelinia Clappii**, Milne-Edwards and Haime.

The corallites are thin walled, constricted at varying intervals, polygonal when in contact, circular and separated by a space from each other where constricted. In some specimens the corallites are large, nearly 8 mm. in average diameter, and slightly but sharply contracted at intervals of from 1 to 4 mm., the average width of the corallites where constricted being a little over 5 mm.; as seen from above the corallites appear circular. In other specimens the corallites are smaller, averaging\nabout 5 mm. in diameter when in contact, and the constrictions are much more pronounced and very variable in their distance apart, causing the corallites to appear as slender cylindrical tubes from 2 to 5 mm. in diameter, with abrupt thin horizontal expansions at intervals of from 1 to over 10 mm. apart; the spaces separating the cylindrical portions of the corallites are here seen to be frequently much wider than the diameter of the corallites themselves. Between these extremes intermediate gradations occur in the same or in different specimens. The expansions in some specimens occur somewhat in the same plane, forming a floor in which the polygonal outlines of the corallites are seen in juxtaposition. The interior of the corallites is obscurely marked by from about thirty to fifty longitudinal striae. Pores unequal in size, sometimes over .5 mm. in diameter, generally in one or two horizontal rows, where the corallites are in contact. Septal spines represented by close set, longitudinal, often interrupted rows of stout sharply pointed tubercles, generally more clearly defined on the contracted parts of the corallites than elsewhere. Tabulae numerous, and of the same nature as those of *M. convexa*. The exterior surface of the corallites is marked by fine encircling rings of growth and by longitudinal lines corresponding to the inner striations. In a part of one specimen in particular the corallites, which are elsewhere normal in structure, approach closely in structure those of *M. convexa* in that they are constricted only at rather lengthy intervals, leaving the corallites polygonal and in contact for some distance.\n\nOccurs in the Corniferous limestone of Ontario, near Woodstock, and in the townships of Walpole and Cayuga.\n\n**MICHELINIA FAVOSITOIDEA**, Billings. em.

About twelve, sharply defined, longitudinal grooves pass outward from the interior of the corallites over the faces of the calyces, at the bottom of which they are most clearly marked.

Oval calyces, with slightly raised margins, open on the surface in four or five longitudinal rows; sometimes one or two calyces occur separately between the rows. The raised margin of the calyces is frequently not continued across their\nupper ends, or is not as well defined there as at the sides and below. The calyces average 1\u00b75 mm. in height or length and 1 mm. in width, those of a row being at a distance from each other about equal to their length, and the rows themselves are at varying distances apart proportionate to the thickness of the stems or branches. The size of the calyces is about the same in large as in small stems. The surface between the calyces is delicately sculptured longitudinally by interrupted, generally wavy stri\u00e6.\n\nIn longitudinal sections, short, slightly curved corallites are seen to pass upward and outward from an imaginary axial line to the surface, the calyces pointing slightly upward. The corallites on opposite sides of the axial line are at the same height and alternate with those of the other rows; this alternation is seen in longitudinal sections and is continued in the arrangement of the calyces at the surface. In the centre of the stems the corallites are small, about 5 mm. or less in width, subpolygonal, with thin walls, which rapidly grow thicker toward the surface. After the walls become thick all trace of the boundaries of contiguous corallites, as far as can be learned by transverse and longitudinal sections, is lost; and no indications of them are seen on the surface. Mural pores, small, few in number, confined apparently to those parts of the corallites where the walls are not excessively thickened. Tabulae few in number, complete, directly transverse. It is noticed that when the stems are flattened on four sides the rows of calyces occur on the angles. No septa or strike are seen, in longitudinal or transverse sections, in the interior of the corallites, but near the edges of the calyces obscure striations are observed passing out over the raised margins in a radial direction.\n\nDevonian.\u2014Hamilton formation; not uncommon at Thedford, Ont.\n\nGenus Calap\u0153cia, Billings. 1865.\n\n(Canadian Naturalist, new series, vol.

Corallites usually nearly equal in size in the same specimen and varying in diameter in different specimens from 2 to 4 mm.; either in contact and polygonal, or circular and separated from each other by a space of varying width. In the same specimen circular and polygonal corallites with intermediate gradations, sometimes occur, or they may be all circular or all polygonal, the circular corallites being at times nearly their own diameter apart but more frequently about half that distance and often almost in contact. Walls of the corallites of moderate thickness, about 25 mm. through, apparently completely amalgamated when the walls are in contact, perforated by large pores placed close together and forming regular horizontal and longitudinal rows. Pores circular, oval or quadrangular and so numerous as to reduce the walls to a mere reticulation of upright bars and horizontal rings the former of which are generally somewhat the stronger of the two and appear in the inside of the corallites as longitudinal ridges. Spiniform septa stout at the base, sharply pointed, about 3 mm. long and inclined slightly upward, occurring in from about eighteen to twenty-two longitudinal rows, a spine springing from each intersection of the mural ridges with the transverse rings. Tabulae complete, horizontal, sometimes slightly concave or convex, often somewhat irregular from the introduction of secondary tabulae; from four to six in a space of 2 mm. When the corallites are not in contact the interven-\ning spaces are crossed by horizontal diaphragms somewhat stouter than, but at about the same distance apart as, the tabulae and showing the same irregularities of growth. The longitudinal ridges appear on the outer surface of the walls, in the spaces between the corallites, as costae; they pass over the edges of the calyces and connect with corresponding ridges in contiguous corallites. The costal ridges at the surface, when the corallites are separate, extend radially but a very short distance, about 5 mm. beyond the confines of the calyces, leaving the surface of the corallum between the corallites smooth; this intercalicular surface is at times marked by obscure, contiguous, polygonal outlines surrounding individual corallites, but no trace of this demarcation is seen in transverse or longitudinal sections. The edges of the calyces are but slightly elevated above the intercalicular surface and in worn specimens appear as smooth raised rings. No definite traces of a basal epitheca have been detected.\n\n*Calapoeia Canadensis* occurs in the Birdseye and Black River, and Hudson River formations. In the former it is found in the Ottawa district and in the latter on the islands at the north end of Lake Huron, on Snake Island, Lake St. John, Que., and on the Island of Anticosti; it is also found in the Galena-Trenton limestone of the Lake Winnipeg district and of the region to the north.

Huronensis* cannot be retained as distinct species.\nand also that between *C. Canadensis* and *C. Anticostiensis* intermediate forms exist connecting these two species. In the specimens from East Selkirk, Manitoba, particularly, a gradual transition can be traced from those specimens, structurally identical with either *C. Canadensis* or *C. Huronensis*, in which the corallites are in contact and polygonal, to those, indistinguishable from *C. Anticostiensis*, in which the corallites are even perhaps slightly farther apart than in the type specimen of that species. On the evidence of these specimens the writer has been forced to regard *C. Canadensis*, *C. Huronensis* and *C. Anticostiensis* as belonging to the same species, no constant structural or other difference having been found that would justify their being kept separate.\n\n**Genus Syringolites**, Hinde. 1879.\n\n*(Geological Magazine, decade II., vol.

These are at first oblique or somewhat parallel with the main tube, and are connected laterally; they then radiate like the spokes of a wheel, at right angles to the parent corallites, each soon giving birth to a similar circlet of new tubes.\"\n\nDr. Rominger points out that the parent stem after having given forth a circle of branchlets grows on in a straight line and again produces a similar circle at a higher level; he also mentions that within the group of young corallites the main stem is generally inflated.\n\nIn one of the type specimens in this museum a few small circular openings between contiguous branchlets, and between them and the parent stem are plainly seen; these appear to be structural, and are evidently the same as the pores mentioned by Rominger in his description of the species. The tabulae are irregular in disposition, from 1 to several lines apart; they appear to be generally convex or obliquely transverse. The exterior of the tubes is annulated by stri\u00e6 of equal strength, about eight occurring in a space of 1 line. No septal spines have been observed.\n\nThis species was first consigned provisionally to the genus *Aulopora*, by Billings, who stated, however, that it possibly should constitute a new genus. Later this idea was carried out by Rominger, who proposed *Quenstedtia* as the name of a genus for the reception of this species as the type. Unfortunately this name was preoccupied, and Nicholson substituted the name *Romingeria* in its stead, in honour as he says \"of one who has so largely contributed to the elucidation of the fossil corals of North America.\"\n\nDevonian.\u2014Corniferous limestone of Ontario; also from rock of the same age at Long Portage, Missinaibi River.\n\nGenus *Fletcheria*, Milne-Edwards and Haime. 1851.\n\n(Polyp.

He has had difficulty in satisfying himself as to whether the increase in growth of the corallum is due to lateral or calicinal gemmation, but the combination of characters is thought to be more in accord with those of Fletcheria than with those of any other genus.\n\nDr. Nicholson* is of the opinion that Vermipora, Hall (stated by Rominger to have mural pores) is most nearly allied to, if not an actual synonym of Fletcheria.\n\nGenus Nyctopora, Nicholson. 1879.\n\n(Pal\u00e6oz.

The hollow connecting processes are obsolete and replaced by a single circular opening when the corallites by flexure or geniculation are brought into contact with each other.

In these specimens it is seen that the corallites in some individuals are so close together as to be nearly in contact, in which case the connecting bars are almost obsolete; in others the corallites\nare not so crowded, or are comparatively distant from each other, as in Goldfuss's figure.\n\nA favourite place for the commencement of the growth of the corallum, as is evinced by the Lake Temiscaming examples, was the rounded upper surface of hemispherically shaped masses of *Favosites*.\n\n**Formation.\u2014Niagara.**\n\n*Syringopora bifurcata*, Lonsdale.\n\n*Syringopora bifurcata*, Lonsdale. 1839.

This laxity of growth is apparent in a specimen from Owen Sound, Ont., which bears a striking resemblance to *S. tenella*, Rominger, as figured on plate XXX. of the Fossil Corals of Michigan. One of the principal characteristics of *S. tenella*, from the Niagara of Point Detour, Michigan and Drummond Island, Lake Huron, is the coming together of the corallites without the intervention of connecting tubes, a feature particularly noticeable in the above mentioned example of *S. retiformis* from Owen Sound. In other examples of *S. retiformis*, in which there is a more general parallelism of the corallites, it is difficult frequently to determine whether there are short connecting tubes present, or whether the corallites are in juxtaposition, at the geniculations. The corallites in *S. retiformis* are described as being \"much geniculated, frequently anastomosing or connecting by stout processes.\" Judging from Dr. Rominger's description and figure the writer is led to believe that *S. tenella*, Rominger, is the same as *S. retiformis*, Billings. It may be well to state that the Niagara rocks extend in an apparently unbroken line from Point Detour and Drummond Island eastward to Owen Sound.\n\nNiagara group.\u2014Isthmus Bay, Lake Huron.

Nicholson, in the Pal\u00e6ozoic Tabulate Corals, p. 208, qualifies this by describing them as \"well developed, usually more or less regularly funnel-shaped, and often giving rise to a more or less continuous tube occupying the axis of the visceral chamber.\" On p. 211 of the same work excellent figures are given of the corallites of *S. reticulata*, Goldfuss (the type of the genus) as seen in longitudinal and horizontal sections showing the inner structure. The tabulae are here shown to be imperfectly funnel-shaped, as a rule not continuous round the inner circumference of the corallites and to have their regularity broken at times by the introduction of cysts or blisters such as are found in *Cystiphyllum*. The inner structure of the corallites, as shown in these figures, is a fair example of what is to be found in most of the Pal\u00e6ozoic species of *Syringopora* in Canada.\n\nJudging from the figure appended to the description of *Cystostylus infundibulus*, Whitfield, there is nothing in the structure of this coral, in the writer's opinion, to necessitate its removal from the genus *Syringopora* as generally understood. It is possible that *Cystostylus infundibulus* may be found to be not distinct from *S. verticillata*, Goldfuss.\n\nThe coral described by Prof. R. P. Whitfield occurs in the upper part of the Niagara group of Wisconsin, in the vicinity of Wauwatosa and Milwaukee. It is stated to have been found only in the solid limestone, the inner structure being revealed on fractured surfaces but the exterior surface of the corallites has not been seen.\n\nIn specimens of this species from the Guelph formation at Durham, Ont., the coral is preserved in a manner similar to that of the Wisconsin specimens.

These have a diameter of about one line and a half, and owing to their flexuosity, are at times in contact, and often two, three or four lines apart. In large colonies which have grown luxuriantly without the interference of disturbing causes, the corallites are more regular than in the smaller or\nstunted groups, in which the corallites are much bent and confused. The connecting processes are very short and distinct, and appear to be sometimes mere inosculations of the stems. The corallites after growing separately for a short distance, approach each other and seem to grow together or adhere to each other for the space of a line and a half or more, they then diverge and again unite. These points of contact occur at distances varying from three lines to six, nine, or even twelve lines. Externally they exhibit numerous other indistinct annulations, and also faint indications of longitudinal striae.\u201d (Billings.)\n\nIn 1860 Mr. Billings, who had previously identified this species with *S. tubiporoides*, Yandell and Shumard, found that it was really quite distinct and proposed the specific name *Maclurei* for the Canadian coral. He also qualified the original description by stating that the average diameter of the corallites is more nearly one line than one line and a half (vide Can. Jour., vol. V).\n\nThe exterior of the corallites of this species presents a rather smooth surface, the annulations or lines of growth being faint and indistinct, but indications of longitudinal striae have not been observed by the writer. The diameter of the corallites varies in different specimens from $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to 1 line, and there is a certain amount of variation in individual specimens; the average thickness appears to be slightly over 1 line or about 2.5 mm. In specimens with very flexuous corallites the growth seems to be more robust than when the corallites are comparatively straighter and closer together. Connecting tubes proper, though seldom seen, are short and stout, most frequently the corallites touch each other and are brought into communication with each other without the intervention of tubes.\n\nThe writer has examined the type specimens of *Aulopora cornuta*, Billings, in the museum with a view to the elucidation of, if possible, some of its characters. The fossils are fragments only and have been damaged by the action of acid so that many details of structure are lost. On a close examination, however, the broken ends of some of the tubes show what appear to be the remains of \u201cinfundibuliform tabulae,\u201d seen in cross section, with evidences of a central tube. Also, a longitudinal section obtained by rubbing down one of the branches, revealed the usual syringopora-like structure, from which the writer is led to believe that this fossil should properly be referred to the genus *Syringopora*. Further, a comparison of the types of *Aulopora cornuta* with examples of *Syringopora Maclurei*, Billings, suggests the probability that the former species was founded on portions of the basal growth of the latter species.\n\nDr. Rominger (op. cit, p. 71) regards *A. cornuta* as a synonym of *Romingeria umbellifera*, but seems to be guided entirely by external char-\nacters. In the writer's opinion he does not prove conclusively that the fossils described by Billings are referable to *R. umbellifera*, in fact the inner structure of the types of *A. cornuta* leads to quite a contrary conclusion.\n\n**Devonian.\u2014Abundant in the Corniferous limestone of Ontario.

Survey of Canada, Rep. of Progress for 1877-78, p. 50, Provisional list of fossils collected between the Long Portage of the Missinaibi branch of the Moose River and Moose Factory, by Mr. Whiteaves, in Dr. Bell's Report on the east coast of Hudson's Bay.*\n\n\u2020Fig. 3, pl. XXXI., evidently represents a specimen of *S. Maclurei*, Bill.\nThe corallites of this species are as a rule moderately straight and seldom approach each other close enough to be in contact, they are connected together by straight tubes of about half the thickness of the corallites themselves, and are frequently deeply constricted at intervals of about 1-2 mm., sometimes more and often less. In some specimens the corallites are often two lines apart.\n\nFrom different specimens in the survey collection it is seen that the base of the corallum may consist of an open reticulation of prostrate corallites, or that the corallites, diverging from one or more centres and closely packed together in one plane, may form a single undulating leaf-like horizontal basal expansion, with at times secondary ones parallel to and at no great distance above the main one. Dr. Rominger figures* a portion of the latter form of basal expansion of this species; the sudden up-bending of the corallites is well shown.\n\nThe name of this species was changed by Mr. Billings from *S. elegans* to *S. perelegans*, the former name being preoccupied, as stated in a footnote on page 117 of volume IV, of the Canadian Journal.\n\nThis species differs from *S. Maclurei* in having corallites that are slenderer, much more strongly annulated, straighter and therefore more nearly parallel to each other, and in having the connecting tubes more highly developed. Dr. Nicholson considers it to be nearly related\u2020 to *S. reticulata*, Goldfuss, from the Carboniferous rocks of Europe.\n\nDevonian.\u2014Abundant in the Corniferous limestone of Ontario.

Hisingeri* seems to have had, as a rule, a comparatively small base of attachment and to have had an upright growth with the height much greater than the breadth. As in *S. perelegans*, the corallum began its growth as an aggregation of flattened, prostrate corallites, forming a lamellar or an open reticulated base, from which at regular intervals the corallites ascend by a sudden upturn. The corallites in some specimens reach a thickness of half a line.\n\nMr. Billings was of the opinion that this species is closely allied to Edwards and Haime's *S. Verneuili* and *S. Cleviana*, both from the Onondaga and Corniferous limestones of Ohio. Unfortunately the Ohio specimens were not figured, and in the case of the last named species the description is very meagre and altogether inadequate. As regards *S. Verneuili* it differs, judging from the very short description, from *S. Hisingeri* in having its corallites much farther apart. In the numerous specimens belonging to the collection of this survey, the corallites are seen to be almost always separated by a space equal to or less than their diameter, whereas in *S. Verneuili*, the corallites are said to be distant two or three times their diameter.\n\nDevonian.\u2014Found in the Corniferous limestone of Ontario; Long Portage, Missinaibi River to Moose Factory (Corniferous), R. Bell, 1877.*\n\nAn examination of the type of *Aulopora filiformis*, Billings, has led to the conclusion that it belongs to the genus *Syringopora* and is most likely the basal reticulation of *Syringopora Hisingeri*, Billings. The specimen described by Billings is adherent to and covers a dorsal valve of *Streptorhynchus Pandora*, Bill. with an open reticulation of prostrate tubes which are attached to the shell by the entire lower surface. Toward the centre and on one side of the reticulation the tubes rise to a greater height than elsewhere and are connected together by transverse processes. The broken ends of some of the tubes show in transverse section what appears to be a syringopora-like structure, viz.: the remains of a central tube and of, though less clearly, invaginated tabulae. On account of the slenderness of the tubes and the damage already done to the specimen by having been\n\n* See foot-note on page 56.\nimmersed in acid, it was found impracticable to obtain a longitudinal section of them. The presence alone of transverse bars connecting adjacent corallites would probably justify, without further corroboration, the conclusion that in *Aulopora filiformis* we have a true *Syringopora*.\n\nA comparison of the basal reticulation of one of the types of *Syringopora Hisingeri*, Billings, with the type of *A. filiformis*, shows the resemblance between the two to be so strong as to scarcely leave any doubt as to their being specifically identical.\n\nThat *A. filiformis*, Billings, is in all probability a *Syringopora* was first suggested by Mr. Whiteaves in 1891 (op. cit. p. 211). At this time, in describing *Hederella Canadensis*, Nicholson, he had occasion to refer to *A. filiformis*, Billings, and in connection with the latter species remarks that it appears to him \"to be the immature state of a species of *Syringopora*.\"\n\nThe type specimen of *A. filiformis* bears the label Rama's Farm, Port Colborne, Ont., Corniferous limestone; E.

The connecting processes in this species have not been observed, but the size of the corallites is quite sufficient to separate it from any known species.\" In 1859, Mr. Billings (Can. Jour., vol. IV.) further says \"This species is distinguished from all others of the genus by the great size of the corallites, which sometimes attain the diameter of five lines. In the young state the form is that of an *Aulopora*, but the adult specimens have branches three or more inches in length, with an internal arrangement of infundibuliform diaphragms, which are so blended together as to produce a structure somewhat similar to the vesicular tissue of the genus *Cystiphyllum*. The external wall is thick and rather strongly annulated.\"\n\nNicholson in the Pal\u00e6ontology of Ontario refers to this species in the following words\u2014\"Corallum lax, spreading, increasing by the production of lateral buds. Corallites very large, varying with age from one and a half to five lines in diameter, apparently not connected by transverse processes. Septa obsolete; tabulae infundibuliform. Epitheca-\nthick, with encircling striae and stronger annulations.\" He also considers it doubtful \"if the species can with propriety be retained under Syringopora\" principally on account of the apparent absence of transverse connecting tubes.\n\nIn the individuals upon which the original description was based connecting tubes were not seen, but Dr. Rominger (op. cit) figures a specimen in which a horizontal process connecting two corallites is clearly shown, proving beyond doubt that this coral has been properly referred to the genus Syringopora and that connecting tubes, though not generally seen, are still sometimes present.\n\nFrom the specimens in the collection of this survey it is seen that on the inner surface of the corallites there are about twenty longitudinal rows of short septal spines. In each row the spines are about 0.5 mm. apart. The inner arrangement of upwardly and outwardly curved plates, which in the original description of the species are referred to as \"infundibuliform tabulae,\" is identical with that which is found in other species of the genus, and the more or less central space frequently left by the inclined imperfect tabulae, and sometimes referred to as a \"central tube\" is also seen.\n\nDevonian.\u2014Corniferous limestone of Ontario; also in the Hamilton formation of Ontario.\n\nSyringopora intermedia, Nicholson.\n\n*Syringopora intermedia*, Nicholson. 1874.

The corallites have an average diameter of 1\u00bd line and are about from 1 line to 1\u00bd line from each other, although they are frequently closer together and often coalesce. The corallum grows upward in an irregular manner from a spreading, prostrate net-\nwork of rapidly budding corallites; the irregularity of growth is caused by the constant twisting of the corallites, and the giving off of many young corallites at different angles. One specimen in the collection shows a basal reticulation, about three by two inches across, adherent to the upper surface of a Favosite.\n\nDevonian.\u2014Hamilton formation; township of Bosanquet, county of Lambton, Ont., Johnson Pettit, 1868, and Thedford, Ont., Rev.

Transverse connecting tubes occur at rather long intervals. The inner structure is well preserved and consists of more than usually large inclined plates (funnel shaped tabulae).\n\nThe Canadian fossil differs from the type of *S. ramulosa* principally in the corallites being somewhat straighter, and in there being apparently fewer connecting tubes. The principal point of agreement is the size of the corallites. The characters of the species as set forth by McCoy (op. cit.) sustain the writer in the opinion that the coral under consideration is in all probability more properly referable to this species than to any other of the genus.\n\n*S. ramulosa* occurs in the Lower Carboniferous or mountain limestone of England (the \"Eubergangskalke\" of Goldfuss).\n\nThe specimen here referred to was collected in 1879, from the \"Lower Banff limestone\" by Prof. John Macoun, in the Bow River Pass, Alberta, about fifteen miles west of Morley, at the \"Gap.\"\n\nThe \"Lower Banff limestone\" is a term applied by Mr. McConnell to the lowest division of a series of limestones and shales of Carboniferous age, found in the valley of the Bow River. It immediately overlies limestones that in his opinion represent the Devonian in that locality. Mr. McConnell also believes that the limestones of Fossil Point, Peace River, from which the specimen of *S. reticulata* previously mentioned, was obtained, are the same as those found at the base of the Banff limestones in the Bow River Pass.\n\n**Genus Cannapora**, Hall.\n\nThe generic characters of this genus are given by Rominger (Fossil Corals of Michigan) in the following words,\u2014\u201cColonies of closely approximated, erect tubules, with stout walls, sprouting from an incrusting basal expansion formed of prostrate tubules growing and multiplying in the same manner as an *Aulopora*. The erect ends of the tubules are annulated by wrinkles of growth and by sharp-edged, periodical offsets marking an interruption and renewed growth from the inner circumference of the old orifices. The sides of the tubes are partly connected by horizontal expansions of the walls, partly in direct contiguity, in which latter case the otherwise circular tubes are pressed into a polygonal shape, and connect in the contiguous parts by lateral pores. The orifices are slightly dilated at the margins, radiated by twelve spinulose projections, rows of which extend through the whole length of the tubes. Diaphragms are not often developed,* direct transverse, and not funnel-shaped as in *Syringopora*.\u201d\n\n---\n\n* The diaphragms are, judging from specimens from Ontario, horizontal, numerous and placed rather close together, but are frequently not preserved.\nCannapora junciformis, Hall. 1852.

XXX., fig. 3.\n\nThe original description and figures of this species and the general characters assigned to the genus, of which this species is the type, are necessarily imperfect on account of the poor state of preservation of the specimens primarily at Professor Hall's disposal.\n\nThe Niagara rocks of Ontario have yielded specimens in which the general form of growth is seen to better advantage and the inner structure is more clearly defined. A certain amount of variation, often accentuated by the state of preservation of the fossils, is noticeable in the size of the corallites and in the surface markings.\n\nIn this species the corallites are very close together, parallel, nearly straight, and annulated by more or less well defined sharp-edged ridges which are prolonged at intervals and serve as a means of connection between contiguous corallites. The base evidently adhered to foreign objects and is made up of an aggregation of close-set, prostrate corallites, diverging from one or more centres and forming a crust from which the corallites at regular intervals grew erect. This basal lamellar expansion is formed on the same principal as that of some species of Syringopora. Corallites from about 0\u00b775 to 2 mm. in diameter in different specimens. Tabulae rather regular in disposition, horizontal, close set. Septa spiniform, occurring in about twelve longitudinal rows.\n\nThe corallites in the specimens available for study in this museum show a decided variation in the amount of development of the annulations as well as in the size of the corallites themselves. One example from the vicinity of Owen Sound, Ont., bears a strong resemblance to the specimen figured by Hall (op. cit. pl. XVIII., fig. 1b) in having comparatively smooth tubes, another from the same locality, with strongly annulated corallites, agrees more with the form described by Nicholson and Hinde under the specific name annulata but which is, in the writer's judgment, not separable from Hall's species, or at the most could only be regarded as a variety.\n\nSyringopora fibrata, Rominger (op. cit.) from the Niagara of Drummond Island, Lake Huron, seems to belong to this species, and is represented, in the museum collection, by some specimens from this\nlocality as well as from the vicinity of Owen Sound, Ont. These specimens are silicified, and in many cases deceptive in appearance on account of the apparent smaller diameter and greater distance apart of the corallites. The apparent smallness of the corallites is due to the fact that in some cases the silicious casts only of the tubes remain, which are connected together by horizontal processes. These connections are evidently the casts of the \"lateral pores\" by which, according to Rominger, the contiguous corallites of Cannapora are placed in communication with one another. In a specimen from Owen Sound, a weathered surface presents the appearance of Syringopora fibrata, but on the other side of the same specimen, where the corallites have been less exposed, the true characters of the coral are apparent. On the weathered side comparatively distant casts of corallites, about 5 mm. in diameter, are seen, whilst on the other side the corallites themselves are shown, about 1 mm. in average diameter, very close together and indistinguishable from specimens of Cannapora junceiformis from the same locality, in which the more or less annulated tubes, horizontal tabulae and spiniform septa are better preserved.\n\nNiagara formation.\u2014Lot 13, concession 2, township of Derby, county of Grey, Ont., R.

Alleyne-Nicholson has proposed an arrangement dependent on the internal structure, still there remains some doubt as to whether a number of well defined species exist or whether there is only a single species with perhaps some varieties.\n\nIf an arrangement according to the outside form be attempted, or if the inner structure be relied on only as a basis for classification, it will be found almost impossible to arrive at satisfactory conclusions.\n\nThe variations in the general manner of growth of the corallum (caused by the size and shape of the corallites and inclosed spaces) and the marked differences to be found in the inside structure, appear to be sufficiently constant at different geological horizons to allow of varieties with certain characteristics being considered distinctive of the horizons in which they are found.\n\nThe examination of a large number of Canadian specimens shows that not only do they vary in the size and shape of their corallites and of the inclosed spaces, but they also differ in their internal structure to a very considerable extent, with variations between the extreme forms. As regards the mere outward shape so great a diversity exists that it is almost possible to trace a gradual transition of such forms with small corallites and meshes as *H. catenularia* var. *micropora*, Whitfield, to those with large corallites and meshes similar to *Catenipora labyrinthica* of Goldfuss. In the same individual the size and shape of the meshes may change to a marked degree: as for example, in a specimen from the Niagara limestone of Ontario, the manner of growth is found to be similar in one portion of the corallum to that of *H. escharoides*, Lam., as figured by Goldfuss, with small but rather regularly shaped meshes and in another part to that of *H. agglomerata*, Hall, with rows of corallites running in parallel lines. The corallum seems to have adopted the latter mode of growth when its lateral expansion was interfered with or restricted.\n\nThe corallites show a marked difference in their size and shape as seen in horizontal section. In a specimen from the Lower Helderberg rocks near the mouth of the Little Cascapedia River, Que., the corallites measure as much as 4 mm., by 2\u00b75 mm., but in another specimen from the north-east side of the Columbia River near\nDonald, B.C. (Silurian) they do not exceed '7 mm. by '45 mm. in size; between these extreme forms may be found specimens with corallites of various sizes. Corallites that are markedly quadrangular in transverse section are met with, as well as those, in different specimens, that are almost quadrangular, oval, both broadly and narrowly oval and circular, whilst both circular and oval corallites frequently occur in the same specimen. *H. gracilis*, Hall, was separated as a distinct species principally on account of its corallites being \"quadrangular\" as seen in horizontal section; as will be seen further on, there are other reasons for still considering it as distinct from the typical form of *H. catenularia*, at least as a variety indicative of distinct geological horizons.\n\nIf after finding so many transitions in outward appearance between extreme forms of this coral as to render a specific classification upon this basis alone extremely difficult, if not impossible, one passes on to an examination of its internal structure, difficulties arising from transitional changes are again met with. Nicholson has adopted a classification of the different forms based on a microscopical study of the internal construction, and has separated them into two groups; in one he places those forms in which the corallites are found apparently contiguous, in the other those having a tabulate space of variable width separating the corallites. In his \"Manual of Palaeontology,\" 3rd ed. vol. I., p. 339, Dr. Nicholson observes \"The species of *Halysites* may be divided into two groups, according as the corallum is composed throughout of corallites of one size or consists of two sets of corallites of different sizes. The common *H. escharoides* of the Silurian rocks is an example of the forms in which the corallites are similar. On the other hand, in the familiar *H. catenularia* of the same formation, the corallum consists of large corallites separated by the intervention of small closely tabulate tubes.\" An examination of the structure of Canadian specimens reveals the fact that in different specimens the small closely tabulate tubes or tubules described by Nicholson are not constant in their proportionate size to the corallites and differ in size from those which are wider than the corallites themselves to those which have a scarcely appreciable width, making a gradual transition to the forms in which the tubules appear to be obsolete. In a specimen from l'Anse au Gascon, Baie des Chaleurs (Lower Helderberg) the tubules sometimes exceed the corallites in width and are furnished with very close set tabulae which have an almost vesicular appearance on account of the introduction of secondary tabulae; the tabulae are depressed in the centre and are bent downward at their edges. In the Niagara formation in Ontario examples occur in which the tubules are slightly less than one half the width of the corallites, but the majority of the specimens from this formation in Ontario, at Lake\nTemiscaming, at Cross Lake Rapids on the Saskatchewan River and at Cedar Lake, and from rocks of nearly if not the same age in Anticosti, the tubules are from \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) the width of the corallites.\n\nParticular stress has been laid on the presence or absence of septal spines by Dr. Nicholson. In his \"Palaeozoic Tabulate corals,\" p. 229, it is stated that \"the form known as *H. escharoides*, Lam., is distinguished from the typical *H. catenularia*, Linn., not only by the superficial characters just mentioned,* but also by the constant possession of spiniform septa, and the apparently constant absence of small tubes between the large ones.\" This is not borne out, however, by Canadian specimens. An example from the Niagara limestone of Ontario has tubules between the corallites admirably shown as well as rows of septal spines; other examples with tubules and septal spines have been collected at Lake Temiscaming (Niagara), at Cross Lake Rapids on the Saskatchewan River and at Cedar Lake (Niagara) and from the Lower Helderberg rocks of l'Anse-au-Gascon, l'Anse \u00e0 la Barbe, &c., Baie des Chaleurs. When the tubules are present and the septal spines are not seen, it is possible that the latter, on account of their small size, have not been preserved or are not sufficiently distinct to be recognized.\n\nThe gradation of one form of *H. catenularia* into another would lead to the belief that it consists of one typical form with several stratigraphical varieties; the typical form not being the oldest.\n\nIt is found however that the *Halysites* of different geological horizons have distinctive characteristics which are apparently constant. This is important as affording a guide to the determination of the relative ages of the earlier Palaeozoic rocks in this country, and as placing a value on the occurrence of *Halysites* in these rocks far greater than it has hitherto had.\n\nTaking *H. catenularia*, L., as the type of the species and regarding the coral as found in rocks of Niagara age, and distinctive of that formation in Canada, as its equivalent in this country, it is the opinion of the writer that the divergent forms, whilst sufficiently distinct for varietal differentiation, would scarcely admit of specific separation: they are here regarded as varieties yet distinctive of definite horizons.\n\nA table,\u2020 for comparative use, has been prepared from data obtained from Canadian specimens, the property of the Geological Survey, giving measurements of the corallites and tubules, the shape and distance apart of the tubulae, and stating whether septal spines have been observed or not, with the name of the collector, date of collection and formation\n\n---\n\n* The size of the tubes (corallites) and the dimensions of the meshes of the corallum.\n\u2020 Page 74.\nfrom which the specimens were obtained. From this table it can be seen that *H. catenularia* and its varieties range from the Black River limestone at the base of the Trenton formation up to the rocks of the Lower Helderberg group; and that the Black River limestone in eastern Canada, the Galena-Trenton of the Lake Winnipeg region, &c., in the west, the Hudson River, Niagara, Guelph and Lower Helderberg formations have their distinctive varieties.\n\nMr. Whiteaves has drawn my attention to the fact that the chain coral was collected (probably for the first time in North America) at Drummond Island, Lake Huron, by Dr. J. J. Bigsby, in 1819 or 1820 (see p. 204 of the first volume of the second series of the Transactions of the Geological Society of London, published in 1824). Also that the next mention of *Halysites* as occurring in Canada, if not in America, was made by William Henry Fitton, M.D., F.R.S., G.S., &c., on p. 559 of appendix No. 4 to the \"Narrative of the Arctic Land Expedition to the mouth of the Great Fish River, and along the shores of the Arctic Ocean, in the years 1833, 34 and 35, by Capt. Back, R.N., London, 1836.\" In reference to the limestone fossils brought by Capt. Back, from Lake Winnipeg, Dr. Fitton says........ \"There is also one specimen which, though not in good preservation, is doubtless a *Catenipora* or chain-coral....... \" The exact locality is not given, but the fossil is in all probability the same as one of the forms from Lake Winnipeg or vicinity mentioned in the table accompanying this paper.\n\n**HALYSITES CATENULARIA**, L.\n\nPlate III., figs. 1, 1a, 1b, 2, 2a and 3, 3a.\n\nThe typical form as identified by United States and Canadian palaeontologists under this name, or that of *Cutenipora escharoides*, Lam., and *C. agglomerata*, Hall.\n\nThe most typical form of the chain coral, in the writer's judgment, occurs in the Niagara formation of Ontario, at and near Owen Sound, on Cockburn Island, and at Lake Temiscaming; near the mouth of the Saskatchewan River; and in rocks of nearly if not the same age in Anticosti and near Donald, B.C.\n\nThe specimens show a considerable variation in the size of the meshes, within certain limits, as can be seen from the table of measurements; tubules are present between the corallites, averaging about .5 mm. in width, and having close set, almost at times vesicular, strongly arched tabulae; septal spines are well preserved in some specimens, in others they are only indicated and at times not preserved.\n\nSpecimens have been collected from the Guelph formation which are possibly referable to the typical form; they are preserved in the char-\nacteristic yellow dolomite, and do not show any very minute details of structure; there are indications of spiniform septa, but tubules so far have not been recognized with any degree of certainty, although there are evidences of what might be tubules with rather arched tabulae. Mr. Whiteaves records the occurrence of *H. catenularia* in the Guelph formation of Ontario (vide Pal. Foss. vol. III., pt. II., p. 47), at Guelph, collected by E. Billings, 1857; at Elora, R. Bell, 1861; at Hespeler, T.C. Weston, 1867; and at Durham, J. Townsend, 1878\u201482.\n\n**Halysites catenularia**, var. Quebecensis. *(Var. nov.)*\n\nPlate IV., figs. 1, 1a, 1b.\n\nIn the Geology of Canada, 1863, p. 165, Billings mentions the occurrence of *H. catenularia* at Lake St. John, Que. Speaking of the lower Silurian strata exposed between the mouth of the Metabechouan River and Blue Point, he says, \"the lower rocks of the series are limestones, and their fossils indicate that they belong to the Birdseye and Black River and Trenton formations.\"......The chief part of the limestones are of a yellowish-grey, and at the Ouatchouan in a three foot bed of this description at the base of the series......there was met with *Halysites catenulatus*, in no other place found so low on the American continent.\" The specimens from this locality bear a strong resemblance in outward form to *H. escharoides*, Lam., as figured by Goldfuss in the Petrefacta Germaniae, vol. 1, figs. 4a, 4b, 4c. In most of the specimens the inner structure is difficult to make out, but in one specimen in particular remarkably narrow tubules are observed. The corallites are oval and the tabulae rather flat and not very close together. This variety can be recognized by its general form of growth with small meshes and rather small corallites, and by the presence of very narrow tubules with rather distant, flat tabulae. Some of the most perfect specimens are hemispherical in shape and attain a breadth of 6 to 8 inches.\n\n**Halysites catenularia**, var. gracilis, Hall.\n\nPlate III., figs. 5, 5a, 5b, 6 and 7.\n\n*Catenipora gracilis*, Hall. 1851. Geol. Lake Superior Land Dist., vol. 2, p. 212, pl. XXIX., fig. 1a, 1b.\n\nThis form is distinctive of the Galena-Trenton, as it occurs at Lake Winnipeg and further north, and of the Hudson River formation in Anticosti and the province of Ontario. Hall described this form in 1851 as a distinct species under the name *H. gracilis*. The rocks of Hudson River age at Green Bay, Wisconsin, from which the specimen described\nby Hall (op. cit.) was obtained are seen further to the east in the Manitoulin Islands. The original description is as follows\u2014\"Coral massive, or hemispheric; cells quadrangular or sub-oval; walls thin; interspaces rarely thicker than the walls; arranged in a single series, in wide irregular reticulations. This species differs from the C. escharoides in the almost quadrangular form of the cells and the extremely thin walls, the reticulations are wider and the whole aspect less solid than in that species. From C. agglomerata, it differs essentially in the form and arrangement of the cells.\" . . . . . . \"Eastern shore of Green Bay, Wisconsin.\" What is particularly noticeable in this variety is the marked angularity of the corallites, their sides being flattened, and the apparent absence of tubules between them. The longitudinal rows of septal spines are beautifully preserved in some specimens, especially in a few from East Selkirk, Manitoba. The variability of the size of the meshes is again seen in this variety, showing that something apart from the mere shape of the coral-lum is necessary for differential use.\n\n**Halysites catenularia**, var. micropora, Whitfield.\n\nPlate III., fig. 4.\n\n*Halysites catenulatus*, var. microporus, Whitfield. 1882. Geol. of Wisconsin, vol. IV., p. 272, pl. XIII., fig. 6.\n\nIn the Niagara formation of Ontario specimens are met with that have very small corallites. These are similar to the specimen, already mentioned, from near Donald, B.C. (Silurian) and one from the Jumpers, Anticosti (Silurian). In most of the specimens seen the meshes are rather small, but in some they are comparatively large and irregular. In none, however, was the inside structure seen by means of sections, so that the writer is unable to state whether tubules are present or not, nor could this be decided from the fossils when examined at the surface.\n\nThis form appears to be similar to *H. catenularia*, var. micropora, Whitfield, from the Niagara group of Wisconsin; its corallites are of about the same size, nearly twenty occurring in the space of 1 inch.\n\nPending further knowledge of the details of its structure, this small form is, for the present, referred to the Wisconsin variety.\n\n**Halysites catenularia**, var. simplex. (Var. nov.)\n\nPlate IV., figs. 3, 3a.\n\nThe principal characteristics of this variety are, the large size of its corallites, its long narrow meshes and the absence of tubules. A single\nspecimen was obtained from rocks of Lower Helderberg age, near the mouth of the Little Cascapedia River, Que.; it is preserved in limestone and there is no evidence of tubules being present; what appear to be septal spines are indistinctly seen.\n\n**HALYSITES CATENULARIA**, var. **AMPLITUBULATA**. (Var. nov.)\n\nPlate IV., figs. 4, 4a.\n\nThis might rightly be considered the most striking of the varieties of this species; in it the tubules are found to be as large as and even larger than the corallites themselves. It occurs in the Lower Helderberg rocks of l'Anse \u00e0 la Barbe and l'Anse au Gascon, Que. Only portions of different coralla were collected, so that it is difficult to make out exactly its general form of growth, although it appears to be rather spreading. The details of structure are stated in the accompanying table and the figures will give an idea of the great development of the tubules. Septa have not been seen. The tabulae of the tubules are noticeably coalescent; they are close set, concave at the centre and abruptly bent down at the edges. The corallites are almost circular and their tabulae are comparatively regular and distant.\n\n**HALYSITES CATENULARIA**, var. **NITIDA**. (Var. nov.)\n\nPlate IV., figs. 2a, 2b.\n\nA number of specimens, sometimes in masses 6 inches and more across, from the Lower Helderberg rocks found at l'Anse \u00e0 la Barbe and vicinity, Baie des Chaleurs and Neigette Falls, near Rimouski, Que., represent this variety in the collection. The meshes made by the corallites are small; the corallites themselves are small, oval in section and separated by moderately narrow tubules; in longitudinal sections the compactness and regularity of the tabulation of both the corallites and tubules is noticeable. Septal spines are present.\n\n**HALYSITES COMPACTA**, Rominger.\n\nPlate IV., figs. 5, 5a, 6, 7 and 8, 8a.\n\n*Halysites compactus*, Rominger. 1876. Geol. Sur. Mich., Foss. Corals, p. 78, plate XXIX., fig. 3.\n\n\" \" Whiteaves. 1884. Pal\u00e6oz. Foss., vol. III., pt. I., p. 2.\n\n*Halysites agglomeratus* var. *compactus*, Whiteaves. 1895. Ibid, vol. III., pt. II., p. 48.\nThis species is thus defined in Dr. Rominger's work on corals: \"Tubes * oval, in chain-like, lateral conjunction, but these laminae are so closely approximated, that no retiform loops are formed by them; they come in contiguity with each other from all sides, and leave only small, angular, lacunose interstices in the corners of their intersection, which are not larger than the tube orifices themselves. By this close approximation of the tubes on all sides many of them become pressed into a polygonal form and resemble a Favosites, from which they differ, however, in the absence of lateral pores. The diaphragms of the tubes are closely approximated, flat, concave or convex in the same specimens. Their diameter is about one and a half millimeter. Found in the Niagara group along the outcrops of the Upper Peninsula, at the shore of Lake Michigan. In a stratum of an outcrop at the mouth of Manistique River this species is quite common.\"\n\nHalysites compacta occurs in Canada, as far as is now known, in the Niagara formation at Lake Temiscaming, Ont., in the Guelph formation at Galt, Elora and Hespeler, Cnt., and near Donald, B.C., in rocks of Silurian age. The Guelph specimens in the collection of the survey were seen by Dr. Rominger, who testified to the correctness of Mr. Whiteaves's identification (vide op. cit. p. 2). Dr. Robert Bell in 1887 obtained three specimens from Lake Temiscaming, one of which (Plate IV., fig. 5) is identical with the type as figured by Rominger, and agrees at all points with the specific description. Another (Plate IV., fig. 6) shows a slight variation in that the corallites are not always in contact, there being interspaces which are at times slightly larger than the corallites. The third is similar to a number of specimens collected in 1893 and 1894 by Mr. A. E. Barlow, of this Survey, also at Lake Temiscaming, at a locality about two miles distant from where Dr. Bell collected his, which although belonging most probably to Dr. Rominger's species, still depart from this typical form in so decided a manner as to be worthy of notice. A single specimen was also collected in 1885, by Prof. A. P. Coleman, on the N. E. side of the Columbia River, near Donald, B.C., from rocks of Silurian age, and another was obtained by J. B. Tyrrell, in 1890, in rocks of the same age at the foot of Grand Rapids, near the mouth of the Saskatchewan River.\n\nIf we imagine a specimen of H. catenularia, L., with the corallites brought so close together as to be in actual contact, and to have the meshes so far reduced in size as only to be represented by small, generally triangular, spaces at intervals round the corallites, then we have a typical specimen of H. compacta, Rominger.\n\n*The word \"tube\" used by Dr. Rominger, has reference to the corallites, and not to the tubules between the corallites.*\nIn Dr. Bell's Lake Temiscaming specimen (Plate IV., fig. 5) the corallites have an average diameter of 1\u00b75 mm., and are hexagonal or pentagonal in section; the interspaces are roughly triangular, about 0\u00b75 mm. across and occur at the sides of the hexagonal corallites one to each side. The septa are only obscurely indicated. The tubules found in *H. catenularia* between the corallites are present here also; they are about 1/3rd the width of the corallites in diameter, and are seen in longitudinal sections to have tabulae; they are difficult to recognize in transverse sections. Flat or concave and occasionally convex close-set tabulae, about fourteen in a space of 5 mm., are present in the corallites and the tubules have evenly rounded convex or arched tabulae, about fifteen to twenty in a space of 5 mm. (Plate IV., fig. 5a).\n\nThe second specimen from Lake Temiscaming, (Plate IV., fig. 6) collected by Dr. Bell, might almost be regarded as a connecting link between specimens of *H. catenularia*, L., in which the meshes are very small, and the typical form of *H. compacta*. In this specimen the spaces between the corallites are generally about the same size or slightly smaller, but occasionally larger than the corallites, and are rather quadrangular in shape; in other respects this fossil is identical with the above mentioned specimen. In parts, however, of the same specimen the corallites are seen to be in contact and to have the subtriangular interspaces as in Rominger's type. The average diameter of the corallites is 1\u00b75 mm.\n\nThe specimens brought by Mr. Barlow from Lake Temiscaming differ in the following respects from the first mentioned form, viz., the corallites are smaller, circular instead of being hexagonal in shape, and the interspaces instead of being triangular are roughly oval or circular and reduced in size: generally six are seen surrounding a single corallite. Longitudinal sections reveal the presence of tubules, from 1/3 to 1/2 the width of the corallites, with close set, narrowly arched tabulae, about twenty of which are found in a space of 5 mm. The tabulae of the corallites are flat or concave and there are from fourteen to eighteen in 5 mm. In some of the specimens the spiniform septa, twelve in number, are beautifully preserved (Plate IV., figs. 8, 8a). The corallites in this form are further apart on account of their walls being proportionately thicker and it is difficult to discern the difference between the tubules proper and what now represent the interspaces greatly reduced in size. In fact, Mr. Barlow's specimens might readily at first sight be mistaken for a form of *Heliolites* with very few \"small corallites\" between the larger ones.\n\nProf. Coleman's fossil (Plate IV., fig. 7) agrees in the arrangement of the corallites and interspaces with Rominger's figure and Dr. Bell's first\n| Species and variety | Locality | Formation | Shape and average size of corallites | Average width of tubes |\n|--------------------|----------|-----------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **H. catenularia, var.

In this specimen the coral is well shown on a weathered surface, but below the surface the structure is not sufficiently preserved to reveal anything in longitudinal or transverse sections.\n\nThe Guelph representatives of this species have corallites about or slightly over 2.5 mm. in diameter, and the interspaces are generally rather irregular in shape and as a rule narrower than the corallites, although their length is sometimes as much as the breadth of two corallites, thus showing a tendency to form true meshes and to depart from the typical growth of *H. compacta* in which no meshes are formed and the corallites touch each other on every side. The corallites are circular in section and have rather thick walls. The specimens available for study are preserved in a light yellow dolomite which does not admit of much detail of structure being made out: the presence of septal spines is indicated but no tubules between the corallites have been detected. The tabulae of the corallites are flat or concave and occasionally convex; from five to seven occur in a space of 5 mm. It will be thus seen that *H. compacta* as found in the Guelph formation of Ontario is much coarser or more robust than those forms found in the Niagara formation at Lake Temiscaming, Ont.\n\nMr. Whiteaves records the collection of this species at Galt, Ont., by the Rev. A. Bell, 1846-50; at Elora, Ont., by Dr. R. Bell, 1861 and D. Boyle, 1883; and at Hespeler, O., by T. C. Weston, 1867. There is in the survey collection a specimen from Durham, Ont., collected by J.

In its initial stages the corallum is of a pyriform or subspherical shape. Corallites proceeding radially from the basal beginning and issuing at right angles to the surface; they are from 1 to 3 mm. apart, circular, averaging 1\u00b75 mm. in diameter and showing little variation in size in the same specimen. The spaces between the corallites are occupied by numerous polygonal tubules, parallel to the corallites, from \u00b725 to \u00b733 mm. in diameter in different specimens, there being from three to twelve tubules in a straight line between adjacent corallites. The horizontal tabulae of the corallites are rather regular in disposition, from three to four occurring in a space of 1 mm. The tubules have tabulae similar to those of the coral-\nlites and at very regular intervals apart but closer together, about six occurring in a space of 1 mm. In transverse sections the corallites exhibit twelve, delicate, sharply pointed septa of equal size, but whether they are in the form of longitudinal ridges, septal spines or spinulose carin\u00e6 has not been determined from the specimens available for study. The tubules are devoid of septa.

Diameter of the calices about one third of a line.\" The authors of this species referred it to the genus *Heliolites*, but the irregularity of the \"canaliculae of the coenenchym\" suggests the possibility of the spaces between the corallites being filled with vesicles rather than with tubules having tabulae. If after further research this surmise prove correct, *Heliolites Grayi* would of necessity be removed to the genus *Lyellia* and the two species perhaps united under the older name, as the similarity between the two forms would then be such as to make this step expedient.\n\nOccurs in the Niagara group of Ontario.

When the corallites are circular and only partially in contact, small interspaces of irregular shape and size are left between them; these are reduced to a minimum in size and number, or are absent when the corallites are polygonal and touch each other on all sides.

In the Silurian Fossils of Girvan, pl. I., in the figures illustrating L. favosa, McCoy, sp. the great thickness of the walls is not so very apparent, especially in fig. 1a. In L. Goldfussi the septa are equal, always twelve in number, and the tubular spaces between the corallites form a marked feature of some of the specimens, viz., those in which the corallites are circular. These interspaces appear to have tabulae, a feature which, if taken with the cylindrical form of the corallites and the number of the septa, suggests an approach to the genus Heliolites.

Calyces shallow, circular or subpolygonal, from 1 to 1\u00b75 mm. in diameter, nearly touching or from '5 to 1\u00b75 mm. apart, with twelve stout septa whose inner ends combine to form a pseudocolumella having the appearance at the bottom of the calyces of a number of tubercles. Between the calyces at the surface are numerous subpolygonal openings, from one to five or six in a straight line between adjacent calyces; these become contracted a little below the surface and are continued vertically downward as parallel narrow tubes with thick walls. The structure, as seen in longitudinal sections immediately below the calyces, is obscure and not definitely defined from the surrounding tubules, but the spaces between the septa are apparently crossed by independent transverse dissepiments which are not of the nature of true tabulae. The tubules are crossed by horizontal tabulae at rather close intervals. The rounded, exsert ends of the septa at the edges of the calyces, together with the tubercles at the bottom of the calyces and the presence often of tubercles in the intercalicular areas, give the surface of the corallum a granular appearance.\n\nOccurs in the Trenton formation at and in the vicinity of Ottawa, Ont., in division I of the Anticosti group, Anticosti, and in the Hudson River formation in Manitoba. The specimens in the possession of the Geological Survey were collected at Ottawa by Dr. Van Cortlandt, at Ottawa, by H. M.

Lambe, those from Anticosti at Junction Cliff by T. C. Weston, 1865. Nicholson mentions its occurrence (op. cit.) in the Trenton limestone at Peterborough, Ont. The specimens described by Hall are from the lower part of the Trenton formation at Watertown, Jefferson county, New York. It has been recognized from the lower beds of the Hudson River formation at Stony Mountain, Manitoba, by Mr. Whiteaves, but is not known to occur elsewhere at this horizon in Canada, although it appears to be a not uncommon fossil in the Cincinnati group.\nof Ohio.

VII., figs. 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, (not 1a).\n\n*Tetradium fibratum*, Safford, the type of the genus, is described as having a corallum which is \"massive, hemispherical, or flattened hemispherical, composed of diverging tubes. Cell tubes four-sided with thin and slightly rugose walls; the four lamell\u00e6 distinct, nearly reaching the centre of the tubes; breadth of full-grown tubes usually about, or but little more than half a line, varying occasionally from $\\frac{1}{3}$rd to $\\frac{3}{4}$ths of a line. Transverse septa usually absent. A few have been seen in one specimen, which were about twice the breadth of a tube apart.\" From the upper half of the Lower Silurian rock of Middle Tennessee (Hudson River).\n\n*Tetradium minus* was characterized by Safford as having smaller corallites than *T. fibratum*, viz., from $\\frac{1}{4}$th to $\\frac{1}{3}$rd of a line in breadth. No other distinguishing characters were given. This fossil was collected in the rocks of the upper division of the Lower Silurian series of Middle Tennessee (Hudson River).\n\nNicholson, in his Pal\u00e6ontology of Ontario, p. 28, expresses a doubt as to whether specimens of *T. minus* from the Hudson River of the River Credit, Ont., and at Manitouaning, Grand Manitoulin Island, are really distinct from *T. fibratum*, as described by Safford.\n\nIn Canada *Tetradium* is found at many localities in rocks of the Birds-eye and Black River formation. The corallites in these specimens are of rather unequal size, varying in specimens from different localities from $\\frac{1}{4}$th to $\\frac{3}{4}$ths of a line in width, and in individual specimens from $\\frac{1}{3}$rd to $\\frac{3}{4}$ths, from $\\frac{1}{4}$th to about $\\frac{1}{2}$, and from $\\frac{1}{4}$th to $\\frac{1}{3}$rd of a line in breadth; a specimen from Gloucester Co., near Ottawa, has corallites with an average width of $\\frac{1}{2}$ a line. The septa in some specimens reach nearly to the centre of the corallites, in others they are not so highly developed. The tabul\u00e6 are seldom seen in longitudinal sections.\n\n*Nicholson in his Pal\u00e6ozoic tabulate corals, p. 232, and in his manual of Pal\u00e6ontology, vol. I, p. 341, apparently regards *T. minus* as the type of the species. As *T. fibratum* was described by Safford before other species of *Tetradium*, it may be presumed that the founder of the species looked upon *T. fibratum* as the type.*\nSpecimens of *Tetradium* have been collected from the Hudson River formation at Cape Smyth, Lake Huron, and at Streetsville, Ont., that have corallites varying in width from \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)rd to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a line. The tabulae in these specimens are as a rule preserved; they are flat and from four to ten occur in a space of 1 line. The septa show the same variation in development as is found in those of the Birdseye and Black River specimens, and the corallites also vary in size to some extent in individual specimens.\n\nA specimen of *Tetradium* collected by Prof. J. H. Panton from rocks of Galena-Trenton age at East Selkirk,* Manitoba, has corallites of rather unequal size, varying in width from not quite \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a line. The tabulae are delicate, flat and placed about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of a line apart. The septa extend only a very short distance from the walls of the corallites toward the centre.\n\nIf in *T. fibratum* the corallites vary in width from \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)th to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)ths of a line, and in *T. minus* from \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th to \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)rd of a line, and that this constitutes the sole difference between the two species, then it would be difficult to tell to which of these species many Canadian specimens from the above mentioned horizons belong, as the majority of those examined have corallites that range in width from \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a line.\n\nThe writer has not observed any differences in structure in Canadian specimens of this coral that are, in his opinion, sufficient to warrant a specific or even a varietal subdivision; they are therefore here referred to under the name *T. fibratum*.\n\nIn his \"Contributions to the Micro-paleontology of the Cambro-Silurian rocks of Canada\" Mr. A. H. Foord has described under the name *T. Huronense* two distinct forms, one the *Stenopora Huronensis* of Billings, since found to be a *Labechia*, the other *T. fibratum*, Safford. The specimens referred to and figured by Foord are in the museum of the Geological Survey, and are from the Hudson River formation at Cape Smyth, Lake Huron. The specimen represented in plate VII., fig. 1, of Mr. Foord's paper, is a mass of *T. fibratum* coated* to a thickness of from about 11 to 2 lines by *Labechia Huronensis*, Bill. Figure 1a is a representation of a portion of a mass of *Labechia Huronensis* and figs. 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e illustrate the structure of *T. fibratum* (poorly preserved) as seen in horizontal and longitudinal sections, taken from the specimen shown in fig. 1.\n\n* This specimen was received as a donation from the Peter Redpath Museum through Sir J. William Dawson, and had previously been recognized as *Tetradium fibratum* by Prof. Panton and Mr. Whiteaves.\nA number of specimens from the Birdseye and Black River formation at Pakenham, Ont., and in the township of McNab, Ont., show the corallites, on a weathered surface, strewn about separately or in fascicles. Mr. Billings referred these to *T. fibratum* and they are labelled as such in the museum. The fossil in this state of preservation is very probably what Safford named *T. apertum*; the separation of the corallites of *T. fibratum*, perhaps after the death of the colony, from each other, or the division of the corallum into small bundles or fascicles of corallites might give a result such as is found in these specimens.\n\nIn the Geology of Canada, 1863, mention is made of *Tetradium fibratum* as occurring in the Birdseye and Black River formation in the vicinity of Montreal, Que.; at Pointe Claire and Joliette, Que.; at Les Ecorch\u00e9s, near Murray Bay, Que.; at Vanluvin's Mills in Storrington township, county of Frontenac, Ont., and in Loughborough township of the same county; in Marmora township, county of Hastings, Ont., and on La Cloche, Thessalon and Campement d'Ours Islands, Lake Huron. In the same report its occurrence in the Hudson River formation at Cape Smyth, Lake Huron is referred to.\n\nThe size of the corallites of specimens from the following localities are:\n\n| Formation                  | Locality                                      | Size of Corallites                      |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Plantagenet township, Prescott county. | J.

A corallite in which these secondary septa are developed suggests a stage of growth preparatory to its division into four smaller ones, and strengthens the idea that the manner of increase of the corallum was by fission of the old tubes. When by the union of the primary septa young corallites were formed, the secondary septa became in turn primary ones in the new corallites, in which septa were probably also developed on the newly completed septal-walls. At a certain stage of growth it is thus seen that a corallite may have as many as twelve septa, four of them being primary and eight secondary.\n\nApril, 1897.\nPLATE I.\n\nFavosites Gothlandica, Lamarck (page 3).\n\nFigure 1.

Corallites polygonal, unequal in size, varying when fully developed from about a little over 2 to 6 or 7 mm., closely connected with one another throughout their length and diverging slightly from a central basal point. Septa, numbering from about twenty to over thirty, alternately large and small, the latter extending a very short distance beyond the walls of the corallites, the former almost or quite reaching the centre. Tabulae complete, horizontal, generally bent downward at their edges, about from two to four in a space of 2 mm. Calyces polygonal, rather shallow, exhibiting the septa. The division lines between contiguous corallites are generally distinctly seen in transverse sections.\n\nThis species occurs abundantly in the Hudson River formation, and Dr. Whiteaves has recognized it in the Trenton limestone of the Lake Winnipeg district. It is represented in the museum of the Geological Survey by specimens from Anticosti, from various localities in Ontario, and from Lake Winnipeg and the Red River valley. Its corallites vary somewhat in size in the same and different specimens; in some they are\nof considerable size interspersed with much smaller ones, in others they are uniformly rather large, or they may be small with little disparity in size.\n\nThe coral from Snake Island, Lake St. John, Que., (Hudson River formation), described by Billings under the name *C. Blainvilli*, is here referred to this species, from which it was separated specifically on account of the supposed smaller size of its corallites. It does not differ, however, in this respect from specimens of *C. alveolata*, Goldfuss, in which the corallites are rather below the average in size. In the Lake St. John specimen the corallites have an average diameter of 3 mm., but are sometimes nearly 4\u00b75 mm. in diameter, the septa are alternately large and small and number about twenty-four. The tabulae as well as the septa are identical in shape and disposition with those of *C. alveolata*.\n\nAs has already been stated, the tabulae are generally deflected at the margin, but in some specimens they are less depressed where they touch the septa than they are between them, causing the tabulae to have a crinkled or plicated appearance near their edges, a not uncommon development in some species of *Favosites*.\n\nRominger mentions (op. cit. p. 90) the occurrence of this species in rocks of Niagara age at Point Detour, Lake Huron.\n\n**Hudson River formation.**\u2014North Point, Drummond Island, Lake Huron, J.

Ells and the writer found, at Stewart's quarry (near Sand Point), lot 18, concession 11, township of McNab, Renfrew county, Ont., in the Black River limestone, specimens of *C. alveolata*, Goldfuss, and *C. Halli*, Nicholson, in situ, within a few feet of each other. The writer is not aware that *C. alveolata*, Goldfuss, has previously been recorded in Canada or the United States from as low a horizon as the Black River limestone. A transverse section of the corallites of the specimen from Stewart's quarry is shown on plate VI.\nCOLUMNARIA HALLI, Nicholson.\n\n(Non Columnaria alveolata, Goldfuss.)\n\nPlate VI., figs. 2, 2a.\n\nColumnaria alveolata, Hall. 1847.

Corals, p. 200, pl. X., figs. 3, 3a.\n\nCorallum attaining to a considerable size and formed of polygonal corallites in close contiguity throughout their length. The corallites vary in width from 4 to nearly 11 mm., and are much more irregular in size than in C. alveolata, Goldfuss. The septa, in the form of lamellar keels and numbering in all from about twenty-five to forty, are of nearly equal size and project only a short distance into the visceral chamber; their free edges are denticulated and in well preserved specimens their differentiation into two alternating sizes is distinctly seen. The tabulae are horizontal, entire, often slightly concave or convex, but not turned down at the edges, nor crenulated as is frequently the case in C. alveolata. In some specimens the division line between the corallites can be seen clearly in transverse section or when weathering has taken place. The initial corallites seem to be larger as a rule than those of the corallum when it has attained a larger growth.\n\nThis species is typical of the Birdseye and Black River formation in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. In the Geology of Canada, 1863, it is recorded as occurring in the province of Quebec at Montreal and Pointe Claire, at St. Lin and Joliette, north of Montreal, also on the Riviere au Lard, Cap de la Magdelaine township, county of Champlain.\n\nIn the museum of the Survey it is represented by specimens from Paquette's Rapids, Ottawa River; from Cornwall township, county of Stormont, Ont.; from Pakenham, McNab and Stafford townships west of Ottawa; from Rockland quarry in the vicinity of Ottawa; from St. Vincent de Paul, Isle Jesus, Que.; from Rivi\u00e8re au Lard, county of Champlain; also from Gravel Point, St. Joseph Island, Lake Huron and from the west shore of Great Manitou Island, Lake Nipissing, Ont.\n\nThe specimen of C. Halli, from which the figures on plate VI. are taken, is from the Black River limestone at Stewart's quarry, near Sand Point, on the Ottawa River, a few miles west of Arnprior.\nCOLUMNARIA RUGOSA, Billings.

The supposed absence or rudimentary condition of tabulae being the only character distinguishing Paleophyllum from Columnaria, the knowledge that tabulae exist removes the barrier to the union of these two genera.\n\n\"Columnaria rugosa may be defined as follows:\u2014corallum consisting of an aggregation of circular or rounded polygonal corallites, from about 3 to 9 mm. in diameter, which are in contact with one another or free for greater or less distances. Septa, numbering about forty in well developed corallites, alternately long and short, the long ones reaching to or almost to the centre, the short ones almost rudimentary. Tabulae complete, horizontal, slightly irregular, at times slightly concave or convex and often turned downward at their edges, about four in a space of 2 mm. Increase by lateral calicular gemmation. Exterior of corallites marked by annular lines of growth and faint longitudinal lines corresponding with the septa within.\n\n\"The corallites in this species vary considerably in size in some specimens, in others they are more uniform, and when in contact whether circular or polygonal, they still remain distinct one from another, generally with interspaces between them.\n\n\"Columnaria erratica, Billings, was described as 'forming large masses of corallites, either in contact or separate. The separate cells are round, those in contact more or less polygonal, the radiating septa rudimentary, forming about four sulci in the breadth of one line upon the interior;\ndiameter of corallites from two to five lines, in general about three and a half lines. The transverse diaphragms are not visible in the specimens examined. The walls of the separate corallites are thick and concentrically wrinkled.' This species is now represented in the museum collection by a single specimen, labelled in the handwriting of Mr. Billings, which consists of a portion of a corallum with corallites that are circular when free or almost polygonal when crowded together; it unfortunately does not show the septa, but tabulae are clearly distinguishable. Judging from the manner of growth of C. erratica, the presence of tabulae and the stated presence of septa, the writer is inclined to believe that the description of C. erratica was based on imperfectly preserved specimens of C. rugosa, and that the two species are identical, especially in view of the fact that out of a number of examples of the latter species only one shows the septa at all, but fortunately in this case very well.\" (Lambe, 1899.)\n\nTrenton formation.\u2014Lake St. John, Little Discharge, Blue Point, Que., J. Richardson, 1857; near Blue Point, A. R. C. Selwyn and J. Richardson, 1870; 2 miles south of Blue Point, W. McOuat, 1871; all the specimens are silicified, and the structure is best seen where weathering has taken place. Also at Lower Fort Garry, about 19 miles below Winnipeg, on the Red River, Manitoba, four specimens, one collected by Donald Gunn in 1858, the other three by T. C. Weston in 1884.\n\nThe specimens from Lower Fort Garry have their structure well preserved and are, in the writer's opinion, clearly referable to Billings's species.\n\nColumnaria calicina, Nicholson.\n\nPlate VI., fig. 4.\n\nFavistella calicina, Nicholson. 1874.

X., figs. 2, 2a.\n\nThis species was described by Nicholson from specimens obtained from the Hudson River formation at the Credit River, Ont.; it is represented in this museum by specimens from the typical locality, as well as by others from the same geological horizon at Cape Smyth, Lake Huron, and from the Hudson River of Anticosti.\n\nSpecific characters.\u2014Corallum, attaining at times a diameter of over 15 cent., composed of corallites that may be either free and circular in section or aggregated and polygonal or subpolygonal in section. The corallites may be to a great extent free from the beginning of the growth of the corallum, or they may only attain a circular form at a later stage\nof growth, or they may form reticulated loops, not unlike a large *Halysites*, or loose fascicles, with free corallites irregularly interspersed. The corallites are from about 3 to 6 mm. in diameter, and the line of division between them, when closely crowded together, is quite distinct. The septa vary in number from about twenty-eight to thirty-eight, of which one half pass to the centre or nearly so, the remainder are very short and might easily escape notice. The tabulae are horizontal, entire and deflected at the periphery. The outer surface of the corallites is strongly marked by encircling lines of growth and longitudinal ridges. New corallites seem to be reproduced by lateral calicinal budding.\n\nThis species approaches very closely to *Columnaria rugosa*, Billings, from the Trenton of Lake St. John, Que., indeed it is questionable whether it would not be best to consider it as a variety of the latter species. Its corallites have not such a free growth as those of the Trenton form, and are, when crowded together, more decidedly angular and in closer contact. In *C. rugosa* the corallites are more generally circular in section, even when aggregated, and the appearance of the corallum suggests a somewhat stronger growth.\n\n**Hudson River formation.**\u2014Cape Smyth, Lake Huron; Credit River at Streetsville, Ont., J. B. Tyrrell, 1888. The largest specimen from the last named locality is over 10 cent. high and nearly 15 cent. across; the initial basal point is present and the divergence of the corallites, the gradual growth of the corallum and the admixture of circular and polygonal tubes are well shown. A slightly worn and evidently loose specimen labelled \"East of White Cliff, Gamache Bay, Anticosti, J. Richardson, 1856,\" is probably from the Hudson River formation of this island.\n\n**COLUMNARIA DISJUNCTA**, Whiteaves.\n\n*Columnaria (Cyathophylloides) disjuncta*, Whiteaves. 1892. Contr. to Can. Pal\u00e6on., vol. I, pt. IV., p. 269, pl. XXXIV., figs. 3, 3a, 3b.\n\n\"Corallum composite, consisting apparently of a colony of cylindrical, straight or flexuous, ascending or erect corallites, which are separate but sometimes partially in contact, or more or less closely aggregated; diameter of the corallites averaging about five millimetres, their mural investment single and external. Surface markings of the corallites unknown, though in transverse sections there are indications of longitudinal ribs, corresponding to the septa within. Calyces deep, with erect sides: primary septa thirteen, simple, neither crenulated nor denticulated, very thin, laminar and extending to the centre at and below the bottom of the cup: secondary septa similar in number and structure to the primaries, but reaching only half way to the centre. The only internal structures\nbesides the septa, are rather distant, thin and laminar horizontal diaphragms, which partake partly of the nature of tabulae and partly of dissepiments. These diaphragms either form almost continuous floors across the corallites (at intervals of from one to two millimetres apart) and thus resemble tabulae, except that their continuity appears to be interrupted by the septa, or they are disconnected and not on the same plane and thus partake more of the nature of dissepiments, though they are never curved.\" (Whiteaves.)\n\nOf this species Dr. Whiteaves says: \"It is clearly congeneric, and may even prove to be conspecific, with the *Cyathophylloides Rhenanum* of Frech, from the Devonian rocks of the Eifel, which Dr. Frech informs the present writer (Dr. Whiteaves) is also a *Columnaria*.\"\n\nThis coral, as its name implies, has corallites which are normally separate and cylindrical, but when at times they are crowded together they become polygonal, as is shown by some of the specimens in the collection.\n\n*C. disjuncta* may be regarded as an extreme form of the genus; *C. alveolata* and *C. Halli* are species in which the corallites are contiguous, *C. rugosa* and *C. calicina* species in which the corallites are as often free as in contact and *C. disjuncta*, a species in which the corallites are generally free.\n\nDevonian (*American Stringocephalus zone*).

A constriction of the calicular surface seems to be not uncommon and results in a slight thickening of the corallum.

In some adult or nearly adult specimens the sides are so much compressed (perhaps abnormally so) that the convexly arched region is obtusely angulated in the centre, longitudinally; in some young specimens this region is distinctly flattened, but others are circular in outline in transverse section, or as seen from above. Septa alternately long and short, varying in number in large specimens from one hundred and sixty to one hundred and seventy in all, the longer ones extending to the centre at the bottom of the calyx. Surface marked with transverse wrinkles and numerous fine striae of growth in well-preserved specimens, but often so much worn, apparently prior to fossilization, as to be almost smooth.\n\n\"Longitudinal sections through the centre of large specimens show that the calyx is not very deep, and that its cavity occupies, but a small proportion of the entire length. Below the calyx the corallum is filled with strongly developed and apparently thickened septa, with well-marked dissepiments between them, and these septa, with their dissepiments, unite in the centre in such a way as to form a large irregularly reticulated pseudo-columella, which projects slightly above the centre of the base of the calyx, as a boss of irregular shape, but with a narrowly rounded summit.\n\n\"This fine coral is especially abundant, and attains to a large size in the Red River valley, at Lower Fort Garry and East Selkirk, Manitoba, where it was collected by Dr. R. Bell, in 1880, by T. C. Weston and A. McCharles in 1884, by L. M. Lambe in 1890, and by D. B. Dowling in 1891.\n\n\"On the western side of Lake Winnipeg a few comparatively small and very imperfect specimens, which may be referable to this species, were collected at Deer Island by T. C.

Richardson in 1857.\" (Billings.)\n\nThe types of *Zaphrentis Canadensis* are from the Hudson River formation of Drummond Island, Lake Huron, and were collected by A. Murray in 1847. A number of specimens, in the museum of the Survey, and labelled *Petraia rustica*, were collected at Cape Smyth, Lake Huron (Hudson River formation) by R. Bell in 1859. Since then a few specimens were obtained by Commander J. G. Boulton, R.N., at Cape Smyth in 1884.\n\nA comparison of the types of *P. rustica* from Lake St. John with the types of *Z. Canadensis* from Drummond Island and the specimens from Cape Smyth, forces the writer to the opinion that all are the same specifically, and are properly referable to the genus *Streptelasma*.\n\nThe following description of the species has been drawn from all the available material:\n\nCorallum simple, elongate conical, sometimes straight but more often moderately curved near the bottom, expanding slowly from a pointed base, and usually becoming somewhat cylindrical above the midheight; length in mature individuals measured along the convex curve from 70 to 90 mm., with a diameter at the top averaging a little over 30 mm. Outer surface rather smooth, transversely ribbed with obscure growth accretions interspersed with finer growth markings. Epitheca complete, with longitudinal septal furrows only faintly indicated. Calyx moderately deep, with steep sides and a convex floor; its depth at the side varying in different specimens from about 18 to 25 mm. Septa numbering from about one hundred to one hundred and fifty, the primaries and secondaries alternating, the former passing to the centre, where they are often considerably twisted, the latter very feebly developed; the primaries are very short near the calicular rim, gradually lengthening until they project about 4 mm. from the wall a short distance above the bottom of the cup in the floor of which they reach the centre. Free edges of the septa in the cup denticulated. Dissepiments arched inward to the centre, occupying the interseptal loculi, forming with the twisted inner ends of the primary septa the confused central structure characteristic of *Streptelasma*. The dissepiments show a considerable variation in the amount of their development and regularity, they generally rise upward toward the centre forming at the bottom of the calyx a rough convex floor, but less frequently they are more nearly horizontal and less irregular, at which time they may have a Zaphrentine appearance that points to the near relationship existing between the genera *Streptelasma* and *Zaphrentis*.\n\nAs regards the illustrations of *Z. Canadensis* on p. 105 of volume I., Palaeozoic Fossils, it may be said that in figure a the distinctness of the septal furrows is exaggerated and suggests a rough surface not seen in the\nspecimens examined, and in figure b, a longitudinal section of the type specimen, continuous tabulae are represented as stretching across the visceral chamber with no indications of septa; the specimen itself shows dissepiments that arch upward and inward on either side, but that are unusually flat at the centre, and primary septa that cut into the dissepiments and disturb their regularity at the centre.\n\n**STREPTELASMA ANGULATUM**, Billings.

They are irregularly conical, moderately curved, expanding from an acute point to a width of seven lines at a height of about eight lines, acutely angulated on the side opposite the concave curve. Surface with a few obscure annulations of growth, and besides engirdled with numerous smaller obscure lines, from four to six in one line. The cup appears to be about four lines deep in a specimen eight lines in length. There appear to be three or four septal striae on the outside in the width of one line. The specimens being imbedded in stone, the number of the septa cannot be ascertained.\n\n\u201cThe distinctive character of this species consists in its acutely angular shape.\u201d\n\n*Localities.*\u2014Island of Anticosti, Que. at Charleton Point and at the west end of the island, collected by J. Richardson, 1856; Hudson River formation.\n\nTransverse and longitudinal sections of the type specimens of *S. angulatum* show that the cup is equal in depth to one-half the height of the corallum, the septa number about seventy-five and are alternately long and short, the former reach the entire whilst the latter are quite diminutive. Further details of structure are not clearly shown; the specimens are small and probably immature.\n\nThe angularity of the convex curve of the corallum is a noticeable feature of some of the specimens of *S. robustum*, Whiteaves, from the Galena-Trenton formation of the Red River valley, Manitoba, and it is not in the western species considered to be a character sufficiently reliable for specific differentiation.\n\nPossibly the species *S. angulatum* is founded on young, angulated specimens of *S. selectum*, Billings.\n**Streptelasma selectum**, Billings.

Outer surface frequently showing rings of growth and when not worn longitudinally marked by fine, distinct septal furrows. Calyx steep-sided, having a more or less prominent, conical projection rising centrally from its base, with a depth equal to about one-half the height of the corallum, but sometimes shallower. Septa in the largest specimen numbering about eighty, in smaller specimens between fifty and sixty; primaries reaching the centre where they are slightly twisted and form with the dissepiments the vesicular mass that projects from the bottom of the cup, secondaries short and inconspicuous. As in the majority of the species of this genus, the primaries frequently unite in sets of twos and threes near the centre of the visceral chamber. In the cup the primaries decrease in size and near the top are scarcely distinguishable from the secondaries; both orders of septa are apparently denticulated on their thin, free edges and carinated on their sides.

Outer surface conspicuously marked by longitudinal septal furrows that indicate the pinnate mode of addition of new septa and the positions of the cardinal and alar septa, transverse growth markings faint. Calyx with thin erect sides, its depth often nearly equal to about one-half the height of the corallum. Septa about fifty in number in moderately large specimens, of two sizes, alternating, the primaries passing to or nearly to the centre, the secondaries small and projecting only slightly inward beyond the mural investment. The inner ends of the primary septa often coalesce in sets of twos or threes near the centre of the visceral chamber. In longitudinal sections, thin, delicate dissepiments, partaking somewhat of the nature of tabulae, are seen to arch upward and inward in the interseptal loculi to the centre, forming with the inner ends of the primary septa an axial cellulose structure that has a convex surface at the bottom of the cup. In the calyx the primary septa standing out prominently from the wall are seen to be carinated on their sides and to have denticulated free edges, the secondaries being reduced almost to uniserial rows of denticles; in longitudinal sections of the corallum the inner edges of the primaries have the appearance of being strongly serrated.\n\nLocalities.\u2014Grimsby, Ont., T.

Calyx with steep sides, its depth equal to about two-fifths of the height of the corallum, in immature individuals rather deeper proportionately, its floor convexly elevated and showing the primary septa as thin keels passing to the centre. In the calyx the primary septa ascend as sharp-edged ridges,\ngradually decreasing in size upward, their free edges bearing denticulations that extend over their sides as obscure carinae; the secondary septa are similarly formed but are conspicuously smaller, and at times are scarcely more than uniserial rows of tubercles. Septa in average sized individuals from about sixty to eighty in number, the primaries beneath the floor of the cup passing to the centre, their inner ends being slightly twisted and frequently united in twos and threes before reaching the centre, the secondaries very small. Dissepiments comparatively large, directed convexly upward and inward toward the centre in the intersusal spaces and forming with the septal ends the central structure whose upper surface constitutes the convex floor of the cup.\n\nWith this species is identified the small Streptelasma from the upper and lower beds of the Hudson River formation at Stony Mountain, Man., collected by R.

Calyx with steep walls, its depth often nearly equal to about one-half the height of the corallum: in large specimens not quite so deep. Septa well developed, of two sizes alternating, some of the primaries generally extending to the centre where they are twisted, the secondaries equal in length to about one-sixth the diameter of the corallum; in large specimens numbering in all up to about one hundred and thirty or even more, in small specimens from ninety to one hundred. Dissepiments occupying the interseptal loculi, large, arching from the walls upward and inward toward the centre where they are more or less horizontal and often contorted and twisted. The inner ends of the primary septa appear in the broadly convex cup bottom as sharp-edged converging keels that either combine at the centre to form a more or less exsert laterally compressed boss or become twisted together without the formation of a decided central prominence or as is not infrequently the case the centre may be smooth and comparatively free of septa. The primary septa often coalesce in twos and threes near their inner ends. A deep lateral septal fossette is present in the bottom of the calyx and extends toward the centre in line with the longer axis of the central projection; its position is independent of the curvature of the corallum. In the calyx the septa gradually change into low, rounded ridges as the rim is approached.\n\nLocalities and formations.\u2014Abundant in the Corniferous limestone of Ontario; collected by E.

Septa of two sizes, primaries and secondaries alternating, and numbering in all about seventy-two, of which the former, as seen in a natural transverse section about 10 mm. beneath the bottom of the cup, pass a little more than half way to the centre as carinations on the tabulae, whilst the secondaries are little more than thin ridges on the inside of the wall. On the margins of the calyx the primaries appear as sharp-edged raised plications, with the secondaries between them as uniserial rows of denticles. Tabulae, as seen in a radial vertical section, complete, regular, 1 or less than 1 mm. apart, extending from one side of the corallum to the other, concave, flat at the centre, suddenly bent down at the edge; the flat, central, smooth part not encroached on by the septa is about one-third of their breadth. Fossette deep, narrow, placed at one side of the calyx and occupied by a primary septum.\n\nThe measurements of the type specimen as already given in the original description are as follows:\u2014\"The specimen is broken off at nine lines below the margin of the cup. Diameter of the lower extremity, twenty-one lines, and of the cup at the margin, thirty-three lines. It thus expands, in this part, one inch in a length of nine lines.

Drummond Island (Lac Huron).\u201d\n\nRominger gives a fuller description from specimens from the Niagara of Point Detour, Drummond Island and mentions the occurrence of the species at Masonville, Iowa in the same formation.\n\nThree simple corals from the upper beds of the Anticosti group in Anticosti were referred to this species by Mr. Billings as early as 1866.\n\nIn 1893 Mr. A. E. Barlow of the Geological Survey obtained, from the exposure of Niagara rocks at the north end of Lake Temiscaming, a good series of a simple coral that is thought to belong to this species.\n\nThe Lake Temiscaming specimens may be characterized as follows.\u2014Corallum simple, elongate, conical, slightly curved, sometimes annulated by low growth ridges, ranging in length as measured on the convex curve in mature individuals from about 60 to 100 mm. with a diameter at the\ncup rim of from 25 to 50 mm. Epitheca complete, with longitudinal septal furrows moderately distinct. Septa numbering from about sixty-four to one hundred and thirty-six, alternately long and short, the primaries reaching the centre and generally curved, the secondaries 2 or 3 mm. in length sometimes apparently almost obsolete. Calyx averaging about 15 mm. in depth, with steep sides and a very slightly convex floor above which the primary septa converge as sharp keels to the centre; the free edges of the septa on the sides of the calyx are denticulated. Tabulae numerous, close-set, stretching across the visceral chamber, turned down at the edge and flat at the centre. A septal fossette is present on the convex curve. Laterally the septa are continuous vertically but toward and at the centre they often become mere carinations on the upper surfaces of the tabulae.\n\nThis species in some respects resembles *Streptelasma rusticum* of the Hudson River formation and more particularly the extreme forms of that species that have been described under the name of *Zaphrentis Canadensis*. Its Streptelasmoid affinities are indicated by a thickening of the outer ends of the septa and by the strong development of the primary septa which, however, often have their vertical continuity broken near the centre by the tabulae. On the other hand there seems to be, with few exceptions, an absence of the axial cellulose structure characteristic of *Streptelasma*, true tabulae extending across the entire visceral chamber. On the whole *Z. Stokesi* may be regarded as a species intermediate between the two genera *Streptelasma* and *Zaphrentis*, combining as it does structural peculiarities suggestive of both genera.\n\nDr. Rominger has expressed the opinion that a strict distinction of the above genera is not possible and has placed *Streptelasma* with *Zaphrentis* as a sub-generic form.\n\n**Localities.**\u2014Cormorant Point, Anticosti, Que., division III. of the Anticosti group, J.

LIV., upper row.\n\nRepresented in the collection of the Geological Survey by two specimens (the types of Z. cinctosa) from the Clinton and Niagara formations, one from Cockburn Island, Lake Huron, the other from near Owen Sound. The general shape, manner of growth and structure of the corallum leaves little doubt, at least in the mind of the writer, as to their being referable to Milne-Edwards and Haime's species described from specimens from the upper Silurian of Perry County, Tennessee. Rominger's specimens are from the Niagara group of Drummond Island and Point Detour, Lake Huron, and from Masonville, Iowa.\n\nThe Canadian specimens may be described as follows:\u2014Corallum simple, cylindrical, curved, and annulated at somewhat regular intervals by distinct, prominent, angular ridges or frill-like expansions, from .5 to over 1 cent. apart, that represent periodic arrests of growth and the position of former calyces; reaching a length of over 8 cent. measured along the convex curve and from 2 to 2.5 cent. in diameter at the summits of the annular ridges. Epitheca striated transversely by fine lines of growth crossing the well-marked longitudinal septal furrows at right angles, so as to cause a cancellation of the surface. Calyx deep, with very steep, thin enclosing side walls. Septa, in the neighbourhood of sixty, alternately long and short, the former passing to or almost to the centre, the latter poorly developed and very short; in the calyx they ascend the sides as low denticulated ridges, becoming gradually less prominent and more rounded as the rim is approached. Tabulae extending from wall to wall, flexuous, irregular and turned down at the edge.\n\nLocalities.\u2014East side of Cockburn Island, 2 miles north of McLeod's Harbour, R. Bell, 1859; and in the township of Derby, lot 13, concession 2, near Owen Sound, R. Bell, 1866: in the Clinton and Niagara formations.\n\nIt is probable that the fossil occurring in the Guelph formation at Hespeler and Guelph, Ontario, and referred by Nicholson (Pal\u00e6on. of Ontario, 1875, p. 67) to Amplexus Yandelli, really belongs to this species.\n\nA comparison of the types of Zaphrentis rugatula, Billings, with the specimens from the above mentioned localities, Cockburn Island and Owen Sound, reveals a similarity of form and structure that carries with it a conviction that they are not separable specifically. The specimens of Z. rugatula were collected at Cape Gasp\u00e9, Que., by Sir W. E. Logan in Gasp\u00e9 limestone No. 1, of whose age Mr. Billings in discussing the\nrelative geological positions of the eight divisions of the limestones (op. cit. p. 2) says, \"The two lower divisions (1 and 2) are most probably Silurian; about the age of the Helderberg of the New York geologists.\" In 1858 nearly fifty specimens were obtained by J. Richardson at Cap Bon Ami near Dalhousie, N.B., in rocks of the same age; these show the decided cancellation of the surface and the periodic annular swellings, as well as in many instances the basal extremity which is quite pointed and sometimes has a scar of attachment preserved.\n\n**Zaphrentis incondita**, Billings.\n\n*Zaphrentis incondita*, Billings. 1874, Paleoz.

From the acute base upwards it expands to a thickness of about fifteen lines in a length of two inches, and to twenty-four lines, in four inches; above which the body of the coral becomes more nearly cylindrical, or only very gradually increasing in diameter. Surface with numerous engirdling ridges of various size, the larger are from half a line to five lines in width, and are often angular on their crests. Upon these larger ridges and in the grooves between them are numerous smaller ridges, or transverse striae, generally two or three in a width of one line. The longitudinal, or septal striae, are in general only obscurely seen, being obliterated by the transverse grooves; there are five or six of them in the width of three lines.\n\n\"In the interior of the coral, the radiating septa reach the centre in the basal portion. But, above a diameter of one inch, there is a large space in the centre occupied by the transverse diaphragms alone, the septa not extending more than half an inch inward. There are two sets of them, the smaller projecting inward rarely to the depth of one line. There is one of the smaller between each two of the longer.\n\n\"The transverse diaphragms are well developed. They are much undulated in the central portion and strongly curved downwards near the exterior. There appear to be ten or twelve of them in the length of one inch; but owing to their undulations, there are sometimes places in which they are separated to the distance of two or three lines, while elsewhere they may be nearly in contact. The septal fossette has not been observed.\n\n\"Varieties.\u2014Occurring along with the above is a somewhat more slender form with, in a general way, the same external characters, but with the transverse diaphragms more regular and the septa extending in-\nward nearly to the centre.

Billings to be nearly of the age of the Oriskany sandstone; collected by R. Bell in 1862.\n\nThe typical form of this species appears to be more slender than Z. gigantea, of a higher geological horizon, and differs from it principally in having shorter and rather fewer primary septa and more irregularly disposed tabulae, as well as in having a more pronounced curve at the base. In the type specimen of Z. incondita there are one hundred and twenty-five septa, alternately long and short, seen in a transverse section four and a half inches above the basal end, as measured along the convex curve; in this section four or five of the septa are observed to extend inward almost to the centre of the corallum.\n\nZaphrentis cingulosa, Billings.\n\nPlate VIII., figs. 5, 5a, 5b.\n\nZaphrentis sp. undetermined, Billings. 1863.

Epitheca cancellated by longitudinal septal furrows and almost as distinct transverse growth lines. The corallum consists of a succession of invaginated, inverted, truncated cones, the result of periodic expansions, representing arrests of growth and former calyces, from within each of which the renewed growth of the corallum in turn began.

Some enlarge their diameter rapidly to a certain thickness, and then grow on in a uniformly cylindrical shape; others are in the young state, slender, flexuose, and irregularly constricted stems, and grow gradually to larger diameters. The surface of the polyparia is covered by an epitheca with shallow annular wrinkles of growth, and longitudinally ribbed by septal stri\u00e6, which, however, are not in all specimens equally distinct. Calyces spacious, with erect walls, and acute, wedge-like margins; bottom broad, marginally depressed and flat in the centre. In one place of the circumference the diaphragms are more deeply depressed by a septal fovea. Radial lamell\u00e6 stout, linear, alternately long and short, but appearing\nnearly equal on the margins of the calyces, where the sharp crested leaves of the inside expand into low rounded rugae. The extension of the radial crests toward the centre is subject to variations; in some the central part of the diaphragms remains smooth, and the crests are confined to their peripheral circumference; in others the crests reach as low carinae to the centre and become irregularly entangled in their convergence, but these central portions of the crests are merely superficial, and do not intersect the diaphragms to form continuous vertical leaves. The number of lamellae in calyces of about two and a half inches diameter is 150 to 160, half of which are of the smaller size.

Surface with fine engirdling striae, in general four or five in the width of two lines, but in some places, the same number occur in the width of one line. There are also numerous angular rings of growth, distant from two to fifteen lines from each other, with sub-concave spaces between. Septal costae rounded, distinctly defined by sharp striae between them, seven or eight in the width of three lines near the base, and four or five in the same near the calice. There are about forty large septa at the calice, where the diameter is about eighteen lines, with the same number of small ones between them. The larger have a depth of three or four lines and the smaller one line. All of the septa are more or less curved, sometimes very tortuous. The tabulae have not been observed.\n\n\u201cThe above description was drawn up from a specimen, eleven inches in length, measured along all the curves. It is fifteen lines in diameter at five inches from the base, and about eighteen lines at the cup. The\nseptal cost\u00e6 are very distinctly defined at the base but become more flattened and obscure upwards. In external characters it resembles *A. exilis*, but the much greater development of the septa distinguishes it therefrom. (Billings.)\n\n\"This species is regarded by the present writer as belonging to the genus *Zaphrentis* on account of its well developed septa; it appears to differ from *Z. gigantea*, Lesueur, principally in being more slender, in having fewer septa and in being typically more strongly annulated. In the type specimen a longitudinal section through the cup shows complete, slightly concave tabulae stretching across the visceral chamber from wall to wall and abruptly turned down at their edges.\n\n\"The types of *Z. invenusta*, *Z. Egeria* and *Z. subrecta* are believed to be identical with *Z. mirabilis*, and to the same species are assigned a number of other specimens in the collection that possess the slender form and the comparatively few septa that are characteristic of the species.\n\n\"Using the type specimen as a basis *Z. mirabilis* may be described as follows:\n\n\"Corallum simple, long, cylindrical, slender, pointed at the base, generally curved or variously twisted, ending above in a moderately deep cut with thin vertical side walls and a flat or slightly undulating bottom; reaching a length of a foot or more and apparently not exceeding between four and five cent. in diameter. Septa of two sizes, alternating, the primaries somewhat flexuous, reaching generally rather more than half way to the centre, the secondaries somewhat variable in their length, being in different specimens from less than one-third to about three-fourths as long as the primaries; numbering in all from about sixty to one hundred. On the surface of the corallum the position of the outer ends of the septa is indicated by distinct, shallow, longitudinal furrows. Tabulae complete, numerous, flat or undulating, turned down at the edges.

Corallites subcylindrical, strongly expanded and constricted at unequal intervals with generally free thin margins to the expansions, coming together and adhering to each other where enlarged, of unequal size, the young corallites often proceeding upward with little increase in diameter, at other times rapidly gaining breadth; varying in diameter from about 5 to 20 mm., the largest being sometimes slightly over 20 mm. in diameter. Outer surface covered by an epitheca with numerous slight rings of growth and with strongly marked septal furrows. Septa, tabulae and dissepiments well developed. Septa numbering from sixty to over seventy in the large corallites, of two alternating\nsizes, the primaries passing quite to or nearly to the centre of the visceral chamber, in the latter case leaving the tabulae smooth at the centre, the secondaries small, reaching generally less than half way to the centre. Tabulae forming a definite central zone equal in breadth to about half the diameter of the corallite, flat or slightly concave, often deflected at the margin. Dissepiments, as a whole, rather small but unequal in size, occupying the interseptal spaces between the tabulae and the outside wall, encroaching at times on the tabulae. Calyces moderately deep, with steeply ascending sides and most often with expanded thin margins.\n\n\"In the description given by Milne-Edwards and Haime of this species (Brit.Foss.Corals) the septa are stated to be 'about sixty in number, thin, equally developed.' This is evidently a misprint as far as the equality of the septa is concerned, as in fig. la supplementing the description, the septa are shown as of two orders, numbering in all about sixty, half of which almost reach the centre of the visceral chamber, whilst the remainder are only about half that size.\" (Lambe, 1899.)\n\nLocalities.\u2014\"The Forks,\" Scaumenac River, Que., R.

Frequently spaces are left between the corallites at or near the edge of the corallum due to the less crowded growth of the corallites and their assumption of a more nearly cylindrical form. A line of contact between contiguous corallites is recognizable, showing that each corallite is contained inside its own walls, also some specimens have been preserved in such a manner as to admit of the corallites being separated from each other along this line of contact. Surface of corallites irregularly ribbed transversely, with fine growth lines between, and longitudinally striated by shallow septal grooves.

XXXV, figs. 1, 1a, 1b.\n\nA few specimens of a simple coral from a number of localities on Lake Winnipegosis and its vicinity have been referred by Dr. Whiteaves to the above species, on the authority of Dr. Frech.\n\nIn these Lake Winnipegosis specimens the corallum varies from a short, straight and rather stout form to one that is more cylindrical, proportionately longer and somewhat flexuous; length in different specimens from 3 to nearly 5 cent. and breadth from 2\u00b75 to 3\u00b75 cent. The surface exhibits numerous, slight, annular ridges and constrictions, whilst the epitheca is smooth but marked by minor transverse lines of growth and\nfaint longitudinal septal furrows. The calyx has sloping sides and is moderately deep, its width is equal to about two-thirds the diameter of the coral above and its depth about three-fifths its width. The septa vary in number from about sixty-five to eighty, and are alternately long and short, one half passing to the centre where they are often twisted, the remainder reaching not quite half way. In the calyx the septa have their free edges denticulated and at the bottom their twisted ends form a slightly raised boss in some specimens. The tabulae are very feebly developed, they average about 5 mm. in width, are flat, and seem to be much interfered with by the longer septa. The central confused area of tabulae and twisted septa gives way laterally to a broad vesicular zone, made up of oblique dissepiments, that become more regular in disposition and smaller in size as the outside of the coral is approached. A septal fossette is indicated in two of the specimens.\n\nLocalities.\u2014A number of places on the Red Deer River, Dawson Bay and Lake Winnipegosis, District of Saskatchewan and Province of Manitoba; Devonian; collectors, D.

But the specimens from the Hay and Athabasca rivers seem to the writer to agree remarkably well with Hall and Whitfield's description of *C. ellipticum* and with the internal structure of a specimen of *C. ellipticum* sent by Dr. Griffith, from Rockford, Iowa, the typical locality; for this reason Dr. Whiteaves's original identification is retained.\n\nA variety of this species, from the Upper Devonian rocks of Lake Winnipegosis, has been recognized by Dr. Whiteaves, who makes the following descriptive remarks thereon:* \"It differs from the types from the Devonian rocks of the Athabasca River only in having its central area occupied by flexuous, irregularly disposed, but for the most part continuous tabulae, rather than by large interseptal dissepiments, and in its narrower vesiculose peripheral zone, the inner margin of which is more clearly defined.\"\n\nOne specimen from the south-western shore of Cameron Bay, Lake Winnipegosis, J.

The specimen in question may be described as follows: corallum bushy, made up of a loose aggregation of corallites, averaging, when full grown, about 9 mm. in diameter, that diverge radially from a basal central point and form a mass 6 or 7 cent. high and about 12 cent. in diameter. Small corallites spring from the sides of the calyces of the mature ones. Corallites cylindrical, slightly but definitely constricted at irregular intervals. Epitheca rather smooth, with feeble transverse lines of growth and faint longitudinal septal striae. Calyces moderately deep, with steep sides, showing primary and secondary septa, the former of which pass nearly to the centre of the bottom of the cup. Septa, numbering in all from about forty-four to forty-eight, alternately long and short, the primaries, as seen in transverse sections, almost reaching the centre of the visceral chamber, whilst the secondaries are scarcely discernible beyond what appears to be a thickening of the wall, formed by the union\nof the outer ends of the septa with the secondaries; their free edges in\nthe calyces are denticulated and their sides carinated. Tabulae distinct,\nflat, often slightly irregular in disposition, not quite one-half the diameter\nof the corallites.

G.\nMcConnell in 1887 from the Devonian rocks of Hay River, Mackenzie\nDistrict, forty miles above its mouth. The following description has reference to these specimens, four of which have been slit to show longitudinal or transverse sections:\u2014corallum simple, conical when young, later becoming cylindrical above, generally curved, sharply pointed below, marked by annular, more or less decided, ridges and constrictions. Epitheca smooth, with faint transverse lines of growth, but with scarcely any indication of septal grooves. The largest of the conical specimens has a diameter of about 2 cent. and a length of 4 cent. measured along the convex curve, the more cylindrical ones have a maximum diameter of less than 2 cent. with a length varying between 6 and 8 cent. Calyx sometimes as deep as wide, more often shallower, narrowing slightly toward the bottom where it is flat or evenly concave. Septa from about fifty to seventy in number, alternately long and short, the long ones almost reaching the centre, thick near their outer ends, the short ones, stout, seldom more than 2 mm. in length; their outer ends, when the epitheca is wanting, appearing at the surface as strong costal ribs. Septa delicately denticulated at their free edges and carinated on the sides, prominent and sometimes appearing to pass over the somewhat rounded margin of the calyx. Tabulae numerous, close set, equal in breadth to about half the diameter of the corallite, generally concave. Vesicles of the peripheral area, enclosing the tabulae, rather large, unequal in size; numerous, much smaller vesicles occur between the costal ends of the septa.\nCyathophyllum Dawsoni, Lambe.\n\nPlate XII., figs. 4, 4a, 4b.\n\nZaphrentis Minas, pars.

Increase by lateral calicinal gemmation, sometimes as many as eight or nine buds springing simultaneously in a circle from the sides of the calyx. Calyx with numerous modifications in shape, in the short coralla, generally rather shallow with broadly expanding, more or less reflexed margins, more inclined to become deep with steep sides in the elongate forms, the sides radially ribbed by the free denticulated edges of the septa that converge toward the bottom of the cup, where the longer ones either meet with straight or twisted ends, at times uniting to form a low boss, or falling short of the centre leave exposed a smooth surface formed by the upper tabulum. A narrow septal fossette is present in the cup. Septa of two orders, primaries and secondaries, the former passing to or almost to the centre, the latter reaching a little past half way, strongly carinated on their side faces, the carinae curving upward and inward from the wall, each corresponding pair forming, by their union on the free edges of the septa in the cup, a prominent tooth-like projection or short transverse rib: near the margin of the cup the difference in size between the primaries and the secondaries is generally not recognizable. The distance apart of the carinae from each other is subject to considerable variation in different specimens and to a small extent in the same individuals, from four to twelve occurring in the space of 5 mm. The septa number from about sixty-eight to one hundred in specimens having a diameter of from 4 to 6 cent., in thicker specimens sometimes as many as one hundred and fifty can be counted.

Tabulae smooth, presenting a somewhat vesiculous or blistered appearance, forming a conspicuous and sharply defined axial area slightly less than one-half the width of the corallite. Septa nearly of the same size, though generally there is a sufficient difference in their length to allow of the two orders being distinguished, from about twenty-eight to thirty-six in\nnumber, strictly confined to the extratabulate area, sharply carinated on the sides and denticulated at the edge.

McConnell in 1888 at the \"Ramparts\" on the Mackenzie River; Devonian (Cuboides zone).\n\nThese two specimens may be described as follows:\u2014corallum made up of intimately connected, polygonal, generally hexagonal tubes that diverge from a single basal corallite, the increase being apparently only by interstitial gemmation, and form small masses, convex above and obtusely pointed below; larger specimen 8 cent. in breadth and 5 cent. in height. Calyces on the upper convex surface. Lower surface covered by a protecting epitheca striated by roughly concentric lines of growth. Corallites unequal in size, varying in diameter from about 9 to 16 mm. in the larger specimen and from 5 or 6 to 10 mm. in the other. In trans-\nverse sections the line of division between the walls of adjacent corallites is well shown. Calyces moderately deep, their depth being about equal to or somewhat more than half their diameter, flat at the bottom, their sides steep with well defined septa of two sizes, the larger of which reach the middle of the bottom; marginal junction of contiguous calyces sharply angular. Septa from thirty to fifty in number, alternately long and short, the longer extending to the centre, the others less than half that length, carinated on their sides. Tabulae about one-half the width of the diameter of the corallite, flat or concave, irregular, inclined to become vesiculous, bounded exteriorly by a narrow zone of rather small, outwardly ascending, curved dissepiments between the septa.\n\nIn describing *C. arcticum*, from the Mackenzie River basin, Meek notices the resemblance of his specimens to *C. quadrigeminum*, Goldfuss. In the figures of *C. quadrigeminum* in the Petrefacta Germaniae two sizes of septa are clearly shown as well as both interstitial and calycinal gemmation.\n\n**Genus Crepidophyllum**, Nicholson and Thompson. 1876.\n\n*Crepidophyllum*, Nicholson and Thompson. 1876.

Corallites touching each other or separated by spaces generally less than their half diameters, usually somewhat flexuous, with not very pronounced annular constrictions and growth-swelling at unequal intervals; furnished with a complete epitheca exhibiting fine transverse lines and longitudinal septal furrows; varying in diameter from 5 to 20 mm., with an average diameter of about 15 mm. The young corallites rapidly reach a mature size; they appear to proceed from expansions or outgrowths of the side of the parent stem that represent lateral extensions of former calyces. Septa about fifty-two in number in average sized corallites, of two sizes, alternating with each other, the larger of which by the union of their inner edges forming a wall that encloses a narrow axial tabulate area as in *Crepidophyllum colligatum*, whilst the shorter are only two-thirds as long. Their sides bear arched carinae that curve upward and inward from the outer wall and appear on the free edges of the septa in the calyx as small transverse teeth. Tabulate area, cylindrical, varying in diameter from a little less than 2 to 4 mm., with frequently a gap in the inner wall indicating the position of the septal fosette. Tabulae flat, horizontal, about six occurring in a space of 5 mm. Interseptal spaces, as far inward as the inner edges of the secondary septa, filled with outwardly ascending rows of small vesicles.

Corallites periodically and ab-\nruptly expanded at corresponding levels, the expansions, generally concave-\nly curved below and flat above, meeting in polygonal outlines and forming\na succession of continuous level floors one above the other, representing\na repetition of calicular extensions, between which the cylindrical unex-\npanded parts are separated from each other by spaces generally less in\nwidth than, although sometimes equal to or exceeding, the half diameters\nof the cylindrical parts. The distance apart of the horizontal floors is\nmoderately constant in the same individual, but variable in different\nspecimens; in one specimen as many as sixteen occur in a space of\n5 cent., in another only three or four are observed in the same distance,\nthe average number being eight or ten in 5 cent. Average breadth of\ncylindrical parts of corallites about 9 mm., that of the expansions about 12\nmm., the difference, however, between the unexpanded and the expanded\nparts is often much greater in some specimens, the latter reaching a breadth\nat times of over 2\u00b75 cent. with a breadth in the former of about 10 mm.\nThe whole of the exposed surface of the corallites is covered by a strong\nepitheca marked by fine annular sculpture lines, about 12 in a space of\n2 mm., as well as by occasional slight but distinct growth swellings or\nconstrictions and longitudinal, narrow septal furrows. The thin edges of\nthe expansions of adjacent corallites not entirely coalescent but separated\nfrom each other by a thin wall which is evidently the upward extension of\nthe epitheca. Calyces circular, rather shallow with horizontally expand-\ned margins slightly raised above the surrounding floor, flat at the bottom\nwhere the inner wall with its enclosed upper tabulum appears.

Increase by lateral gemmation, the young corallites springing from the upper surface of the connecting processes and growing upward parallel to the parent corallites, frequently for some distance with little increase in size. Septa, with arched carinae on their sides, about fifty in number in adult corallites, of almost equal length, reaching halfway to the centre where they abut against the tabulae. Dissepiments small, regular, entirely filling the interseptal spaces. Tabulae flat or concave, often turned up at their margins, from four to ten occurring in a space of 5 mm. Epitheca showing fine transverse growth lines and longitudinal septal markings. Both in transverse and longitudinal sections\nof the corallites, the sharp division between the septal area and the enclosed tabulate area is noticeable, especially in transverse sections, where the cut edges of the innermost dissepiments often assume the appearance of an inner wall, which, however, is apparently not present.\n\nThe single specimen in the collection has corallites in which the vesicular area is rather larger than is usual in *Diphyphyllum*, a development suggestive of an approach to *Cyathophyllum*, to which genus, however this coral cannot properly be referred, on account of its mode of growth and increase; it shows affinities to both the genera *Diphyphyllum* and *Crepidophyllum*, but is precluded from the latter by the apparent absence of an inner wall.

Corallites varying in diameter from 3 to 6 or 7 mm. frequently roughened by annular swellings of growth and constrictions, covered by an epitheca showing minor growth markings and longitudinal septal furrows. There is a marked variation in different colonies in the number of horizontal spurs connecting the corallites: in some specimens they are numerous, from about 2 to 4 mm. apart vertically, springing outward from all sides of the corallites, in others they occur at less frequent intervals, whilst in some they appear to be almost absent. Septa short, bearing arched carinae on their sides, divisible into two sizes, primaries and secondaries, numbering in all from about thirty to forty, the primaries seldom reaching half-way to the centre of the visceral chamber, the secondaries very short,\nprojecting but little inside of the single row of curved dissepiments in the interseptal spaces. In transverse sections of the corallites the dissepiments have the appearance of an inner wall about 5 mm. distant from the wall proper, as in the Silurian species *D. caespitosum*, Hall.

Of the mode of increase and of the size attained by the coralla, Mr. Billings, in his original description of the species, says:\u2014\"The young corallites sometimes spring from the side of the parent, with a slender base, and curving upwards immediately, become parallel with those of the whole group. In large colonies frequent instances may be seen where, instead of this lateral budding, a bifurcation takes place, both branches being of the same size. In large groups, owing to the numerous additions of young, the corallites diverge slightly, as if radiating from a point. The colonies are from six inches to several feet in diameter, and large blocks of stone are of frequent occurrence, which are penetrated at right angles to the stratification by the closely crowded stems.\" Corallites free from sudden constrictions, provided with a well-\ndeveloped epitheca, with slight annular growth lines and strongly marked septal furrows. Lateral connecting spurs short, distant, developed only when the corallites by their flexions are brought almost into contact with each other. Septa well developed, numbering from about forty to sixty, carinated on their sides, alternately long and short, the longer not quite reaching the centre of the visceral chamber, the shorter about half the length of the primaries. Vesicles small, formed by regular curved dissepiments in two rows, occupying the interseptal spaces near the wall. Tabulae broad, flat or concave at the centre, deflected downward near the margin, from about five to eight in a space of 5 mm.\n\nLocalities and formation.\u2014Corniferous limestone of Ontario; also a loose specimen from Peace River, B.C., between Fossil Point and the Ca\u00f1on of the Mountain of Rocks, collected by Professor John Macoun in 1875 (Devonian).\n\nGenus Acervularia, Schweigger. 1820.\n\nAcervularia, Schweigger. 1820.

The specimen is silicified and not preserved as well as might be desired, but by a careful examination of natural longitudinal and transverse sections, the structure can be made out with sufficient clearness to give the following data:\u2014Corallum astr\u00e6iform, made up of polygonal corallites, from 3 to 7 mm. in diameter, with deep calyces that join each other in sharp-edged outlines and that have steep sloping sides and a rounded boss, roughly 2 mm. in breadth at the bottom. Each corallite is contained within its own walls from which spring lamellar vertical septa, whose free edges are moderately conspicuous in the calyces. Septa, numbering from about thirty to forty, alternately long and short, the former continued to the centre, where they are twisted, the latter about one-half, or slightly more than one-half, the length of the former. Dissepiments convex, arching evenly upward and outward, and filling the interseptal loculi in a circumferential area whose breadth is equal to the length of the secondary septa, or about one-fourth the diameter of the corallite. Within the outer area is a zone of dissepiments or vesicles that rise upward toward the centre and, in combination with the proximal ends of the primary septa, form a subvesicular mass that appears at the bottom of the calyx as a rounded projection.\n\n\"The presence of continuous vertical septa, such as the above, in corallites that are enclosed by definite walls, makes clear the necessity of removing the species represented by this specimen from the genus *Arachnophyllum* (Strombodes); although some details of structure are obscured by crystallization, yet sufficient characters are preserved to suggest affinities to *Acervularia* to which genus this species is for the present assigned.\" (Lambe, 1899.)\n\nLocality.\u2014Manitouaning, Grand Manitoulin Island, Lake Huron, collected by A.

Murray in 1866, in the Corniferous formation near Woodstock, Ontario.\n\nIn the form and structure of the corallites this specimen agrees with the above description: the septa number from forty-four to forty-eight, are thin throughout their length, carinated on their sides and alternately long and short, the longer reaching the centre, with their ends twisted together, the shorter a little more than half the length of the long ones. A pseudo inner-wall, seen in horizontal sections, and a well marked feature in the calyces, is formed by the sudden stoppage of the interseptal dissepiments near the proximal ends of the shorter septa. The small circular openings in the dissepiments between the septa noticed in specimens of *Phillipsastr\u00e6a Billingsi*, Calvin, and *P.

In no particular does this species differ from *P. Billingsi*, except in the smaller size of its corallites and in a diminution in the number of the septa. In transverse sections and in weathered specimens it is observed that a single row of pore-openings occurs between each pair of septa, the pores piercing the dissepiments where they rest on each other, the distance apart of the pores in a single row thus depending on the size of the dissepiments. This pore structure, which appears not to have been noticed previously in species of this genus, and which is well shown in some specimens of *P.

In transverse and longitudinal sections the corallites are seen to be made up of an axial area of irregular tabulae surrounded by a cycle of septa that is in turn enclosed within a peripheral zone of vesicular tissue confluent with the like tissue of adjacent corallites. Septa thick, with smooth sides, numbering from about thirty-six to forty-two, of two orders, primaries and secondaries, the for-\nmer converging to the centre where they generally meet and are frequently twisted, the secondaries about one-quarter the length of the primaries; both sizes of septa start inward at an equal distance from the centre, the primaries becoming suddenly thin and continuing so for the inner half of their length. Outer zones of neighbouring corallites by their union forming a continuous vesicular tissue surrounding and separating the septal cycles.

Septa, numbering from about one hundred to over one hundred and seventy in individuals of different degrees of slenderness, of two orders, alternately long and short, continuous vertically within the pseudowall formed by the innermost plates of the vesicular area, the primaries cutting through the down-turned edges of the tabulae for some distance, but leaving the broad, flat or concave central portion untouched; in the vesicular area their vertical continuity is broken and they pass outward as sharp carinations on the calicular margins, their differentiation in size being still well marked. Tabulae broad, flat, undulating or slightly concave at the centre, bending downward when they meet the septa and passing between them to the inner limit of the vesicular zone. The blister-like plates of the outer area, large, directed upward and outward, supporting the periodic calicular margins formed in the growth of the corallum.

Annulated by numerous strong and decided wrinkles of growth and provided with an epitheca marked by minor transverse lines of growth and longitudinal septal furrows corresponding to the primary and secondary septa beneath. The surface for a distance of 5 or 6 cent. from the base is often decorated by numerous transverse rows of spinous outgrowths up to 2 or 3 mm. in length. Calyx deep, with a sharp rim and steep sides, in which the free edges of the septa appear as thin lamell\u00e6 surrounding a prominent, conical, twisted boss that rises abruptly from the bottom; from about one-third to nearly one-half the diameter of the coral in depth. A narrow fossette is present in the bottom of the cup. Septa numbering from about one hundred in slender specimens, to over one hundred and ninety in large individuals, of two orders, primaries and secondaries, alternating, the latter so small as to be almost obsolete, the former strong, cutting the edges of the tabulae, a variable number passing over the tabulae as carin\u00e6, some reaching, others falling short of the apex of the central boss and all partaking of the twist of that prominence. Tabulae well developed, form-\ning an inner zone, in breadth about five-sevenths of the entire diameter, turned down at the edges and raised centrally, in the form of a large cone that appears as the striking projection in the bottom of the cup. This conical boss is from 1 to over 1\u00b75 cent. in height, and is twisted in a direction contrary to that of the hands of a watch when viewed from above; the carinal septa that reach the apex stand out as sharp ridges, giving the cone a rugose appearance.

As another distinctive character of *Omphyma*, the development of four septal fove\u00e6 is mentioned by Milne-Edwards, but they are generally not all equally distinct, while very frequently only one of them is obvious, the others being almost obsolete. The genus *Ptychophyllum*, described by Milne-Edwards as being organized like *Chonophyllum*, differing from it in the twisted converging ends of the radial lamell\u00e6, forming a central false columella, is likewise in close structural relationship with *Omphyma*, and in the special case of *Ptychophyllum stokesii*, I found its affinity with *Omphyma verrucosa* so great that I altered the name of the first from *Ptychophyllum* to *Omphyma.* (Rominger).\n\n**Type species.\u2014** *O.

The specimen described by Mr. Billings under the name Zaphrentis Bigsbyi is from rocks of the same age on the east side of Cockburn Island, two miles north of McLeod's Harbour, collected by R. Bell in 1866.\n\nRominger's specific description is as follows:\n\n\"Conical polyparia, attaining in larger specimens the length of one decimeter by a calyx diameter of from seven to eight centimeters. Surface of the silicified specimens generally exfoliated; if perfect, it is covered by an epithecal wall with annular wrinkles of growth, and longitudinally striate by septal furrows. From the sides of the conical walls numerous cylindrical, root-like prolongations grow out, serving for attachment of the coral to other bodies: these appendices were not distributed equally over the surface, but seemed to form only on those sides where a chance for attachment was offered by close proximity of an object. Calyces spacious, with steeply ascending sides and a gently expanded margin; bottom broad, convex, with depressed circumference, flat or somewhat concave in the centre, which may be almost smooth, or the lamell\u00e6 may extend over it as carinations, becoming twisted in the centre. On the ascending sides of the calyx the lamell\u00e6 have the form of acute linear laminae alternating in size, a smaller and a larger one near the bottom of the calyx always united into pairs. In the marginal portions of the calyces, the two plates forming the linear crests diverge at the base, and open into a tent-shape. The four septal fove\u00e6 are scarcely ever distinct\u2014two of them, or it may be only one, being plainly developed.\n\n\"The centre of the polyparia is, in vertical sections, seen regularly intersected by large transverse plates, and the continuity of the vertical crests is interrupted. Number of lamell\u00e6 in calyces of six or seven centimeters diameter from one hundred to one hundred and ten. Associated\nwith the elongated type form already described are shorter conical specimens, with broad, expanded calyx margins, and generally with a very prominent bottom, covered by twisted radial crests, seeming to be a mere variety of the former kind.\n\n\"Occurs in the Niagara group of Drummond's Island.\"\n\n**Omphyma Eriphyle**, Billings.

Polyparia upright, very slightly divergent, confluent, opening above in shallow calyces, impressed at the centre with a small pit, and meeting in obtusely elevated polygonal outlines.

Central pit from about 2\u00b75 to 6 mm. wide, or averaging about one-fourth the diameter of the calyces. Septa numbering from thirty to forty at the margin of the central pit, within which they are lamellar and continuous vertically; of these half reach the centre of the visceral chamber, whilst the remainder stop short of the centre, frequently all or some of the septa coalesce in sets of twos near the bottom of the pit, each pair continuing to the centre as a single septum.\nOn emerging from the central pit the septa become augmented in number, many of them bifurcating or trifurcating, and continue outward as superficial radial foldings of the calycinal margins. A double row of minute pore-openings occurs in each septal ridge, one row on either side of the central line, the openings in either row generally alternating with those of the other. In vertical sections each corallite is seen to be composed of a series of invaginated calyces whose margins, uniting with those of adjacent calyces at the same level, form a succession of superposed continuous floors. In the interseptal spaces in the vicinity of the central pit occur small arched dissepiments rising obliquely outward; these continued outward, in the area to which the septa do not extend as vertical lamellae, become larger and more unequal in size, forming vesicular tissue, on which the successive calycinal floors rest.

Basal surface wrinkled, covered by an epitheca showing concentric growth lines, and with a small central point of attachment. Corallites slightly divergent, opening on\nthe surface in radially septate calyces with narrow, sunken confluent margins and broad cone-shaped central prominences enclosing deeply excavated pits that are from 1 to nearly 2 cent. apart and vary in width from 5 to 7 mm. The septa average thirty-six in number, are alternately long and short in the pits, half passing to the centre, the others terminating in the vertical pit sides; the differentiation in the size of the septa is apparent at times on the outer descending slopes of the central projections but is lost on the sunken marginal floors where the septal ridges attain a maximum breadth of nearly 1 mm. The presence of septal pore-openings has not been detected.

Calyces, varying in width from 8 to 12 mm., flat or shallowly concave in the marginal area, with a circular, elevated rim surrounding a central pit 3 or 4 mm. in diameter from which radiate the septa as narrow convex ribs having a maximum breadth of about .5 mm. The elevated rims surrounding the pits stand, in some specimens, much more prominently above the surrounding, sunken, calycinal extensions than in others, whilst at times they develop into salient, conical projections with the pit forming an excavation at the top. Lateral junction of contiguous calyces sometimes very slightly raised, more often seen as a plane surface in which no dividing line is apparent. Septa averaging thirty in number as in other species of the genus, lamellar and continuous vertically in the vicinity of the central pit, converted on the flat calicinal margin into surface ribs that join those of neighbouring calyces; of two\norders, alternating with each other within the pit, the primaries reaching the centre or leaving a narrow, circular, smooth spot at the centre, the secondaries not continued beyond the sides of the pit. As in *A. pentagonum*, Goldfuss, a coalescence of the inner septal ends in sets of twos, and their continuance as single septa is often observed. Double rows of pore-openings are present in the septal ridges. The dissepimental and vesicular structure is similar to that of *A. pentagonum*, only proportionately smaller.

Septa numbering from forty to about fifty-two, lamellar and uninterrupted in a narrow area surrounding the tabulae, of two orders, the primaries reaching the centre\nof the tabulae carine, the secondaries not infringing on the tabulae; beyond the confines of the central pit their vertical continuity is interrupted and they radiate outward as gradually broadening, flatly convex ribs, reaching a maximum breadth of 2 mm. at the edge of the calycinal extension where they meet the septal ribs of adjacent calyces. Pore-openings in the septal ribs have not been recognized in specimens belonging to this species. The vesicular structure supporting the calycinal floors, developed at intervals in the upward growth of the colony, is composed of blister-like plates that are proportionately rather smaller and less convex than in other species of the genus, also the radially folded calycinal floors appear to be developed with greater frequency and are consequently closer together than in *A. pentagonum*, Goldfuss, from which this species differs in many essential points. Between the lamellar septa arched disseiments curve downward to meet the tabulae.\u201d (Lambe, 1899.)\n\n**Locality.\u2014**West Point, Grand Manitoulin Island, Lake Huron, R.

Height of the central part enclosing the calyx, above the level of the surrounding surface, in large individuals, from about 1\u00b75 to 2 cents. Calyx * about twice as wide as high, with a diameter of about one-tenth the breadth of the corallum, flat at the bottom and with very steep sides. Septa, in the visceral chamber, lamellar, of two orders, primaries and secondaries, alternating, the former meeting at the centre with a slight amount of twisting, the latter not quite half the length of the former; ascending the sides of the calyx as sharp-edged lamellae they pass down and over the extracalicular surface as gradually broadening, flatly convex, radiating ridges having a maximum breadth near the periphery of 7 mm.; they number in different individuals from about seventy-four to eighty-four. Well developed flat or concave tabulae, turned down at their edges and as broad as one-half the width of the calyx, are seen in a radial section, beneath the bottom of the cup. The whole of the upper surface is marked by fine, raised, interrupted and concentric, ripple-like growth lines, generally less than 1 mm. apart, those of one septal ridge sometimes continuous with, at other times alternating with those of adjacent ridges; the basal surface presents a similar appearance except that here the septal radii are concave instead of being convex. The structure of the walls of the calyx and of the extended frill-like margin appears to be very dense. In radial sections the gradual growth of the corallum outward is indicated by parallel lines approximately at right angles to, and joining the ripple-like markings on, the upper and lower surfaces. In vertical tangential sections the septa are seen to be made up of superimposed convex layers resembling the septal structure of C.

Septa as seen in the calyx, radiating outward with little or no incipient twisting, sharp-edged at first and when ascending the steep sides of the central pit but developing on the expanded margin into low convex ridges about 1 mm. broad at the periphery where they are of nearly equal size although elsewhere they show a differentiation into alternating primaries and secondaries most noticeable on the side of the pit. The rapidly increasing area of the calyx outside the pit necessitates the addition of new septal ribs which are supplied by intercalation or by the bifurcation or trifurcation of the old ones.\n\nAn inner axial area, showing in the bottom of the calyx of the type specimen as a rounded projection, is formed by the presence of narrow tabulae, turned down at the edges, over which the septa pass, either meeting at a point or not continued quite so far, so as to leave a small, smooth, central space, 3 or 4 mm. in diameter. Outside the tabulate area is a broad zone of arched plates, of unequal but rather large size, that fill the spaces between and support the periodic calycinal expansions. Strengthening acanthiform growths developed from the under, concave surface of the arched plates are noticed in many places. Septa, in the type specimen, numbering about ninety, thin, apparently carinated on their side faces, of two alternating sizes, the larger passing almost to the centre, the shorter not encroaching on the tabulae, their vertical continuity interfered with by the vesicles as the periphery is approached; represented on the calycinal margins by the low septal ridges.\n\nLocality.\u2014Grand Manitoulin Island, Lake Huron, collected in 1865 by R.

Basal surface apparently provided with an epitheca. Calyx shallow, convex at the centre, with broadly expanding reflexed margins exhibiting about eighty low, rounded septal ribs that increase in breadth outwardly. In a radial section a central area, about 1 cent., in breadth, is disclosed; it\nis made up of small slightly convex plates arching upward and inward so as to form an axial vesiculo-tabulate mass whose surface appears in the calyx as a rounded protuberance. Surrounding the central area is a broad vesicular zone in which can be detected the gradual growth upward of the corallum by the superposition of vesicular layers, 2 or 3 mm. in thickness, each layer terminating above in a thin covering of flexuous, continuous laminae representing the position of the surface of previous calyces. The convex plates composing the vesicular layers are small, generally 1 mm. or less in length. The septa, starting at the confines of the central vesicular area, radiate outward as their vertical laminae and disappear in the peripheral region; they are represented on the calicular surface by the gradually broadening superficial convex ribs, that are connected with each other laterally. In tangential sections at the margin of the calicular expansions the cut edges of the septal ribs, here about 3 mm. in breadth, appear as horizontal continuous parallel wavy lines.

Septa lamellar on the sides of the pit, bifurcating when about half way up and gradually changing on the expanded margin into low, convex ridges, from about 3 to 5 mm. broad, in the type specimen, near the periphery where they are seen in\nvertical tangential sections to be made up of a series of thin, separate, superimposed convex layers, of which from about eighteen to between thirty and forty occur in a space of 5 mm. and between which are numerous small granules or short supporting pillars. The broad septal layers as they converge become gradually more compressed laterally until they form, by the bending down of their sides on each other, comparatively thin, double, lamellar plates. The septa that pass down into the pit from above do not apparently extend inward to the centre, but stop at the bottom of the steep sides where they meet and alternate with an equal number of septa that reach the centre and are there slightly twisted; how far the latter septa extend outward has not been ascertained, but they do not appear on the sides of the central pit. Small, convex, dissepiments arching upward and outward occur in the very narrow interseptal spaces; toward the centre of the visceral chamber they become larger and more irregular in disposition. Of the septal layers W. H. Sherzer in his monograph of the genus *Chonophyllum* where an accurate and detailed description is given of the complicated structure of *C. magnificum*, says: \"Along the medial plane of each septum these layers are approximately horizontal for a short distance, curve gradually downward toward the sides, and finally are sharply deflected, fusing with one another along their edges to form the side faces of the septum. Occasionally a layer, or a series of layers, unites directly with those just beneath before reaching the side, and thus takes no part, for some distance at least, in the actual formation of the septal faces. When the septum has become too narrow, an upper layer may send down its edges upon each side completely enwrapping as many as twelve or fifteen older ones, thus suggesting their method of growth. In general, these layers are not continuous from one septum to its neighbour, but each septum is made up of an independent series. Occasionally they pass completely across for a short distance, arching upward in the interseptal cavity and assisting in the formation of the vesicles.\" \"In radial sections through the septa the cut edges of these layers appear as delicate parallel lines, sloping gently from the edge of the calyx downward toward the centre. Intersected at right angles by the supporting growths they present, in typical forms, a *Stromatopora*-like appearance.\" Epitheca complete, thin, with concentric growth markings, and with narrow slightly raised lines directed toward the base, indicating the position of the interseptal spaces, between which the surface is gently concave.\n\n**Localities and formation.**\u2014Corniferous limestone of Ontario; Rominger mentions its occurrence at Mackinac Island, in the drift of the lower peninsula of Michigan, at the Falls of the Ohio, at Charleston Landing, Indiana and in other exposures of the Upper Helderberg (Corniferous) group.\nAlthough this species is retained in the genus to which it was originally assigned by Mr. Billings, the writer is strongly of the opinion that it should form the type of a separate genus as its structure is quite dissimilar in its main features to that of the Silurian corals grouped round the type *C. perfoliatum*, Goldfuss, sp.\n\n**CYSTIPHYLLID\u00c6.**\n\n**Genus Cystiphyllum**, Lonsdale. 1839.\n\n*(Ety. \u03ba\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, cavity, \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, leaf.)*\n\n*Cystiphyllum*, Lonsdale. 1839.

Rominger has pointed out that *Conophyllum Niagarense*, Hall is in\nreality a *Cystiphyllum* and mentions its occurrence in the Niagara group of Drummond Island, Lake Huron and at Point Detour, as well as in the Niagara of Kentucky, Iowa and Indiana. The specimen from Cockburn Island is preserved in such a way as to show the longitudinal ribbing of the surface, the form, size and direction of the cystose plates within and the radial rows of denticulations on the calicular margins as a root-like extension near the basal extremity; details of structure such as these, taken with the general form and manner of growth of the corallum, induce the writer to believe that *C. Huronense* should properly be referred to Hall's species from the Niagara of the State of New York.\n\n\"Rominger's description of this species is comprehensive and accurately describes the Canadian specimen: it appears in the following words\u2014'Conical polyp cells attached to other bodies at the base, and by additional root-like prolongations from the sides. Stems elongated, sub-cylindrical, or shorter turbinate, annulated by superficial constrictions with tortuous flexions, or by periodical total interruptions in the growth of a calyx, and the formation of a new cell from within. The calyces are moderately deep, uniformly spreading from an obtusely angustated bottom; margins erect: their surface is blistered, and is radially striate by spinulose crests, developed in some specimens with more distinctness than in others. The surface of the polyp stems in well preserved condition is longitudinally ribbed by septal striae, but it often happens that the outer walls are destroyed, and that the stems are of rough exfoliated aspect, exhibiting the concave side of the blisters composing the cell cups, and the free edges of the single invaginated cups composing the stems.'

As a result of their mode of growth from a small basal beginning, the corallites are somewhat divergent, those near the confines of the corallum sometimes growing almost horizontally. Corallites strongly and irregularly annulated, growing close together, frequently touching each other, their coherence being often strengthened at the points of contact by an increased development of the ridges of growth, or from want of space they may be closely pressed against one another for some distance. Mature corallites varying in diameter from 1 or 2 to over 3 cent., the young ones beginning with an average breadth of about 5 mm. and growing upward beside the old stems with a very slow increase in size.

As viewed in longitudinal sections, they appear as lenticular cells which radiate obliquely upward and outward from the centre of the coral.\"\n\n**Localities.**\u2014Lake Winnipegos, at various localities; collected by J. W. Spencer, 1874; J. B. Tyrrell and D. B. Dowling, 1889; Devonian (American Stringocephalus zone). Collected also by R. G. McConnell in 1888 from the Devonian rocks of the Mackenzie River, at the \"Ramparts\", and by A. P. Low, on the Moose River, Ont., 1896 (Devonian).\n\n**Genus Cayug\u00e6a.** (Gen. nov.)\n\nCorallum simple, conico-cylindrical. Epitheca complete. A broad, vesicular, peripheral area surrounds a central, axial, tabulate area, the two areas being separated from each other by an inner wall. No septa.\n\n**Type species.**\u2014C. venusta, mihi.\n\n**Range.**\u2014Devonian (Corniferous formation.)\n\n**Cayug\u00e6a Whiteavesiana.** (Sp. nov.)\n\nPlate XVIII., figs. 4, 4a, 4b.\n\nCorallum simple, large, conico-cylindrical. Outer surface strongly ringed by rather regular and sudden constrictions of growth, from about 7 to 14 mm. apart. Epitheca, complete with transverse fine growth lines and obscure broken, longitudinal, depressed, linear markings. The only specimen known is about 18 cent. long and represents the upper part of the corallum which, judging from the slow rate of increase in thickness, may have attained a total length of 60 cent. (or roughly 2 feet); diameter of specimen above about 7 cent., below about 6 cent. Longitudinal and transverse sections reveal a central tubular area about 25 mm. in width, filled with numerous tabulae, and separated from a surrounding peripheral vesicular area by a well defined inner wall. Tabulae flat or slightly concave, generally turned up near the edge, moderately regular in their disposition. Vesicular area made up of outwardly ascending cystose plates, very unequal in size, resting on each other and enclosing spaces from 2 or 3 mm. to about 2 cent. in length. Septa absent and only indicated in a feeble way by the longitudinal epithecal markings. The specimen is crushed above, so as to obscure the form of the calyx, and the basal part is broken off.\n\n**Locality and formation.**\u2014Cayuga, Ont., collected by J. DeCew; Corniferous limestone.\nThis coral has structural characters of so peculiar a nature as to preclude its being referred to any described genus known to the writer. The combination of well developed tabulae enclosed within a distinct wall surrounded by vesicular tissue, is certainly most curious as well as interesting, more particularly when the absence of septa is considered. The name of the new genus founded for the reception of this Corniferous coral, is suggested by the locality from which the specimen was obtained.\n\nThe absence of septa and the strong development of vesicular tissue suggest affinities to *Cystiphyllum*, and for the present at least *Cayugaea* is placed with the *Cystiphylid\u00e6*.\n| Generic Name                  | Page
