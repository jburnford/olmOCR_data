A report just received from another Residential School this morning contained the information that the boys, under the direction of a member of the staff, had made some 50 screen windows at a minimum of expense.\n\nIf the Principal is prepared to carry out the suggestion made in this letter the Department would consider supplying the material that would be necessary.

There is also a request that certain plumbing changes be made in the main building.\n\nThe Local Plumber was asked to submit a quotation on this work. To install two baths, four basins, four closet combinations, one urinal trough 4' with flush pipe, one apron sink 42\" cast (in dairy), build one partition and taking up floors and repairing same in the addition, moving bath and supplying new closet combination for Sisters' bath room adjacent to the room they propose to use for a dormitory and doing all repairing and supplying all necessary fittings, he asks the sum of $354.00.\n\nTo make the necessary changes in the dormitories as the removal of a wall, making a door and putting a partition in the Sisters' dormitory, it is estimated that the cost will exceed $200.00.\n\nThe total cost of the changes, including the plumbing will then be in the neighbourhood of $600.00 and this does not include the storm windows for the addition. The plumbing changes are necessary and so is most of the work if this school with its new addition is to overcome the overcrowded condition. Please instruct us in this as the work should be done during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nJune 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 1st instant with reference to the Crowfoot Residential School.\n\nIn our current year's appropriation the amount of $750.00 was provided for repairs, improvements and new equipment at this school. We have already expended $22.90 for rebuilding the chimney and $90.00 for painting, or a total of $112.90. This leaves a balance of $637.10 and it will, therefore, be possible to favourably consider the recommendations made by you in the second and third paragraphs of your recent letter.\n\nHowever, before authorizing you to proceed with the work I would appreciate your advising the name and address of the \"local plumber\" from whom you have obtained a quotation. I presume that his quotation of $384.00 includes both material and labour.\n\nIn connection with the changes to the dormitories I think you mentioned this when you were in the Department last winter and I am under the impression that your estimate of $200.00 refers to material only. In that event, or even in the event of the material costing more than $50.00, it will be necessary for you to supply full particulars regarding what is required in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.

However, on June 7th a cheque for $1,310.85 was forwarded to Mr. Holmes, being a refund of his deposit plus accrued interest.

This is much used and important.\n\n\u00a7. IN NEW ADDITION:\n\n1. Toilet, bathroom and dairy in basement - new partition 8 x 23 and door; moving from main building 2 baths, 3 toilets 4 wash basins with partitions and setting up. Dairy already equipped with 2 motors, drain boards etc. - a splendid dairy and the Department did not buy any new equipment for it.\n\n2. Principal is installing a drinking fountain on main floor also in Indian waiting room of Main building at no expense to the Department.\nThe action of the Principal is something new but is refreshing. We have gone over the programme of work and consider every move is either very necessary or a decided improvement over the existing layout. In fact, the new addition is of little value unless these changes are made nor will the overcrowding in the main building be eliminated without them. Needless to say, it is the least costly method and we are satisfied that the Principal and his assistants are quite capable of doing all the work set out on the list.\n\nAn early reply is requested as the work should proceed through the holiday period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nGleichen, Alta.\nJuly 7, 1938.\n\nAttention Mr Phelan - Schools Division\n\nRE: Crowfoot Residential School - Blackfoot Res.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUpon receipt of yours of June 7th file 1004-2-5 I got in touch with the Acting Principal of the school, Revd. Father Lessard. When it was known that only $637.10 was now available for repairs etc., it was quite evident that all could not be done that should be done unless labour costs were reduced materially. So Father Lessard got busy and worked out a programme of work using cheap labour and I think you will agree that he will do more with this allowance than we've ever done in the past, if the scheme is authorized.\n\nIn the first place, he would eliminate all high-priced mechanical labour by using a handy man whose wages are $40.00 per month. He then went to the Crown Lumber Co. with a bill of material and ascertained the cost of lumber required. Attached hereto is a list of the work already done or to be done and the Lumber Company's quotation on material. You will note that the Crown Lumber Co submits an net price of $466.00 which leaves $174.00 to pay for everything else. The Revd. Father asks for necessary hardware and paint which he estimates at $75.00 and an allowance of $90.00 to assist in paying for the labour. This will bring the cost to slightly more than the allowance for this school but I trust this may be authorized.\n\nThe Crown Lumber Co in Gleichen is the only firm in these parts and is on the Patronage List. Hardware should not exceed $50.00 and can be purchased locally from firms on the list; likewise paint. In regard to the labour, would it be possible to allow the Principal $30.00 per month for the months of June, July & August for a mechanic, by submission of a Voucher through this office as is done in the case of the Night Watchman?\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nOttawa, July 14, 1938\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nCrowfoot Indian Residential School, Cluny, Alberta.\n\nVOTE: 76 Allotment\n\nSHIP TO: O.

The Indian Agent has secured a quotation of $465.02 from the Crown Lumber Company, Gleichen, Alberta. This firm is on the approved list.\n\nThe Indian Agent considers that the price mentioned is very reasonable. The school management is prepared to do practically all the work without cost to the Department. The school is now closed for holidays and any repairs should be made within the next few weeks. I therefore recommend that purchase order be issued, authorizing purchase of the articles mentioned on the quotation from the Crown Lumber Company, Gleichen, Alberta, at a cost of $465.02.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 15, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the repairs that you consider necessary at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School.\n\nThe tender of the Crown Lumber Company has been submitted to the Purchasing Agent and we have recommended the purchase of the material from them. As soon as we have the decision of the Purchasing Agent, you will be advised.\n\nYou may purchase, from firms on the approved list, the necessary hardware and paint, the cost of which is estimated at $75.00. I understand from your letter that two or more accounts will be submitted in connection with these purchases. This method will bring each account under the $50.00 limit.\n\nI am sorry that present regulations will not permit our paying the $90.00 for labour in the manner that you suggest. However, this amount can be expended by keeping paylists. As soon as we hear from the Purchasing Agent regarding the tender of the Crown Lumber Company, I will forward you an accountable cheque for $90.00 to cover the cost of labour to that amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG.

The children, of course, were still on holidays and did not return until the sixth of July. The improvement and repair work to the Crowfoot school was being carried out with local labor and the acting Principal is to be commended on the class of work and the amount that he was able to do with very limited expenditure. This school was in good shape to properly care for all the pupils this year. The crop at this school was excellent and is now being threshed. At the Old Sun School the staff was concentrating on the harvesting which came off irrigated lands. This land has produced abundance of feed and a good garden as well as some threshed grain. Both schools had done well with their exhibits at the Calgary Fair and prize money was here for the pupils on their return this fall. This coming year more stress will be given to handicraft work and the general work will undoubtedly be more pleasing to the Indian pupils.\n\nG. H.

This resulted in a serious clogging of the sewer last February and it was necessary for the Principal to secure the services of Mr. Michael, a plumber of Gleichen, to clear it. There will undoubtedly be a repetition of this same thing again unless certain changes are made. Mr. Michael has submitted to me the cost of these changes, which include breaking into the sewer, installing a Barrett cleanout and necessary fittings, 60 feet of cleaning rod, couplings and labor. This would cost $27.15 and the school, of course, would take up the floor and replace it at no expense to the Department.\n\nWould authority be given to incur this expenditure, please?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

Home-made equipment is used and this is not satisfactory. Eighteen new desks should be supplied. Otherwise, equipment is sufficient for present needs in all three classes. There is room in these class rooms to accommodate more pupils.\n\n(Sgd.) C. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nExtract from Inspector Schmidt's report on the Crowfoot Indian residential school dated March 31, 1939:\n\nConsiderable paint will be required to do the interior of the old building. If this is supplied then the school staff will do the work themselves.\n\nThe kitchen range, a very old one, is badly warped; the ovens are burned out and cannot be used. It is not worth repairing. This range was brought to Crowfoot in 1923, from the old Dunbow School, where it had been in use for sometime.\n\nThere is no mangel in the laundry; one is badly needed.\n\nThe new addition built last year fills a much-needed want; the two class-rooms are large and bright with high ceilings, as is the large boys' playroom in the basement. I am told there are days in winter when the wind is from the North-east, that it is impossible to heat the class-rooms, even though storm-sash have been put on. Apparently the heat cannot be forced through.\n\nI noticed the steampipe in the corridor (basement) between the two buildings, is bare. It might be that if this were covered with hair and asbestos that it might help. I do not understand steam-heating, but am told there is no (return) in this system, and that there should be. I would suggest having someone who understands same check it over.\n\n(Sgd.) C. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nMay 8, 1939.\n\nEX'D\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from Inspector Schmidt with reference to his recent inspection of the Crowfoot Indian residential school. He mentions that considerable painting is required in the interior of the old building and suggests covering the steam pipe in the corridors with asbestos. He also refers to the condition of the kitchen range and the mangle in the laundry.\n\nThe amount of $600.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Crowfoot school. Of this amount $27.15 was authorized in my letter of the 12th ultimo. The balance is still available and for your information I may say that in view of the present setup of our appropriation it is impossible to exceed the amount specifically provided.\n\nI, therefore, suggest that you confer with the Principal and decide the best manner in which the amount available should be expended. In the event of its being decided to purchase any equipment full details should be given in order that our Purchasing Branch may make the purchase.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG.H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCleichen, Alta.\nAttention: Supt. Welfare & Training\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the Crowfoot Residential School there is a very large John Bull Range. This is a stove which has two ovens and was brought to this Institution from the Dunbow Boys School at Midnapore, Alberta when this school was dismantled, and it was with considerable difficulty that we got it into the basement at Crowfoot.\n\nFor some time it has not been operating very well and certainly requires some repair work. The local people were not in a position to handle it so I got Green's Greater Stove & Repairs Products of Calgary, a concern which does a very great deal of this work throughout the province, to look the stove over and make an estimate of costs.\n\nI am advised that it requires a complete top over one fireplace, one outside section of sectional lid, one grate and grate frame, one ash pan, four oven racks, one damper, tin over one oven and ovens relined with asbestos. This firm quotes a price of $95.00 for the complete job.\n\nThe stove is valuable and I hope that it will be possible to authorize this expenditure and put it in good condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nMay 10, 1939.\n\nEXD\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant you may expend an amount not exceeding $95.00 in repairing the range at the Crowfoot Indian residential school. This amount will be taken from the sum of $800.00 provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Crowfoot school. In this regard I would refer you to my letter of the 8th instant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of May 8th, file No. 104-2-5, and appropriation for repairs, improvements, etc., at the Crowfoot Residential School, the writer discussed this with the Principal of the School, the Rev. Father Riou.\n\nFather Riou states that as only $600.00 was provided for the current year, he must first look after the immediate requirements which include repairs to the kitchen range, new beds for the dormitories and basins for the washrooms.\n\nIf you will refer to my letter of May 6th, you will see that I have already contracted with the Green's Greater Stove Co. to do the work on the stove at a cost of $95.00. This work, however, may not be done until the end of the term.\n\nBeds. 18 small single beds are required for the Junior dormitories. I regret that I cannot locate in any of the trade journals, a bed of the specifications desired, namely: a bed not more than 2\u00bd ft. wide and 5 ft. long, of the hospital type with springs a part of the unit and a mattress to fit. I trust the Purchasing Agent can place an order from information which he may have.\n\nBasins. The required basins and fittings are as follows:\n\n- 6 - Cast Iron Enamel Basins 17 x 19 with apron\n- 6 - Fair Basin Taps\n- 6 - Basin Traps 1\u00bd P with P.O. Plug\n- 10 - Recess T.Y.'s 1\u00bd\n\nFather Riou will not attempt any other expenditures, other than the ones mentioned, until he knows just what these will cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

School\nBlackfoot Reserve.\n\nI am attaching hereto a copy of a letter from the Principal of Crowfoot School and I doubt if there is very much that I can enlarge upon.\n\nAs you may remember, an addition, used for classrooms, was erected at the east end of the main building some two years ago and the heating pipes were carried through to this addition from the central boiler. During the past winter there was apparently considerable loss of heat owing to the fact that the steam pipes were not covered. I presume that the steam fitters, as represented by Metals Limited, one of the outstanding firms of Calgary, have suggested that these pipes be covered with the proper material to retain the heat. It is noted that this is estimated to cost $9.25.\n\nThe Principal quotes Mr. Michael, who is the local steam fitter, and I doubt if there is more information necessary than what he has given, i.e., that the valve conduit in the new addition will have to be repaired. Mr. Michael states that this will cost\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. H. Goodham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare and Training\nOttawa Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: your letter of the 4th instant, I take advantage once again to report conditions at the Crowfoot Res. School.\n\nWhen your enclosed circular of Feb. 10th 1938, was first received, a detailed report was given to the Indian Agent, Mr. G.H. Gooderham and through him to your office. Moreover said Indian agent inspected fire-escape apparatus and concurred in the decision which I had previously taken of not allowing any more drills till the situation was remedied.\n\nEvery time a drill was held there was a casualty, either among the staff or the pupils, some serious enough to warrant transfer to the hospital. The Indian Agent requested that at least a partial fire drill be held regularly to show what should be done in case of fire. This however is wholly inadequate. The children know that they will not have to slide down the fire-escape poles and not much profit was derived from these drills.\n\nThis situation was reported last year and the only answer was that lack of funds prevented the Department from installing proper apparatus.\n\nHoping these remarks will be given proper attention,\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nRion\nOttawa,\nNovember 3, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter just received from the Principal of the Crowfoot Indian residential school. As you will note it refers to circular letter recently forwarded to all residential schools regarding steps to be taken to avoid fire hazards.\n\nI should appreciate having your comments on the Principal's letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I believe the principal of the school drew this to the attention of the Director on his visit to Ottawa, when he returned from France a year ago.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Nov. 14, 1939.\n\nAttention: R. A. Hey, Supt. Welfare & Training.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 3rd, file 104-2-5, re a circular letter on fire hazards, and a copy of a letter which you received from the Principal of the Crowfoot Residential School on this reserve.\n\nMay I be permitted, first of all, to draw your attention to my letter of November 15th, 1937, when I suggested that something should replace the iron poles as fire escapes, and your subsequent letters, particularly yours of March 3, 1938.\n\nI did require the school authorities to carry on with fire drill and as a result one of the Sisters was badly injured and the Principal refused to proceed with drill after that. I understand he spoke to the Director about conditions of escapes at this school when he visited Ottawa a year ago, on his return from there, and he informed me, on his return here, that Dr. McGill had said it would not be necessary to carry out the full drill. Therefore, as intimated in his letter dated October 28th, there has been no fire drill.\n\nI made an inspection of this school yesterday, and Father Riou and I went about to see what could be done. The poles still stand and access to the poles is over beds and through a window; these take care of the larger pupils. The smaller children, whose dormitories are on the south side of the institution, have easy access to wooden stairs leading down to a back verandah. Aside from the regular inside stairs, these are the only means of escape. We could see no other alternative but to erect iron fire escapes at the east and west end of the institution, near or where the old escapes now are. The window could be replaced by a fire door. Whether the Department would be in a position to go to this expense, I don't, of course, know. I can say one thing, however, that the Staff of this institution is now fire conscious. The night watchman is an active young man and I think he will keep the fire apparatus in good condition.\n\nI have no other remarks to make.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. H. Gooderham, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nGHG:R\nOttawa,\nNovember 23, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with reference to the Crowfoot residential school. At the present time the Department has no funds available for the erection of new fire escapes. You should, however, direct the Principal to remove the beds from near the window which is the exit for the pole fire escapes. There should be a reasonably large vacant space around this window. You should also have this window converted into a door opening outwards.\n\nSimply because a member of the staff was injured in using the pole fire escapes there is no reason why regular fire drills should not be held and you should, therefore, instruct the Principal immediately that the Department expects that our instructions regarding fire drills will be put into effect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Some changes should be made at the Old Sun School in the staff; the nurse is not efficient, nor is one of the Matrons. The principal also advises me that he proposes to strengthen his teaching staff by putting a more capable teacher in the junior room. In this I entirely agree, as it is this room that the real ground work is done. One member of the staff, Mr. Bell, the farmer, has enlisted. He has been replaced by Mr. Toone, who has been at this school for some time and will carry on very well, I believe. Mr. Bell was an especially good farmer and brought the farm and the dairy herd to the highest point of efficiency and productivity in the history of this institution.\n\nAt the Crowfoot school the spring run-off cut a deep canal right through the middle of their farm, at the rear of the institution. This canal has been in existence for some years in draining off the water from north of the town of Cluny and the artesian wells in the town. The existing canal is dangerous and something must be done to prevent further erosion and it is now our duty to find out with whom the responsibility of fixing this rests.\n\nAt both institutions everything is ready to go ahead with seeding when conditions will allow.\n\nG.

What is really required is a tailor's, motor driven sewing machine. This will cost considerable more than an ordinary foot-driven machine and if the motor cannot be supplied, this school should be supplied with a foot-power tailor's sewing machine.\n\nAt this same time, the hot water heating coils in the large kitchen range burst and I had to get a plumber to shut off the water. Fortunately, the stove has two fireboxes and, at the present time when there are no pupils at the school, the stove can be used but no water is being heated. The new coils must be brought from Winnipeg with the linings, which are beyond repair. This is an old stove which was bought by the Principal many years ago from Dumbol School, when that institution was closed. Although these repairs will cost considerable, it is a very small charge compared to a replacement. At the moment it is not known just what these repairs will cost.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

Michael.\n\nHe had noted this condition three weeks ago and he believes there are leaks in the system but this can only be known by opening up the end of the hot water boiler and breaking into the brick wall on the side of the heating boiler. The cause must be located else the brick wall will disintegrate. The jacket heater for the hot water boiler cannot be operated because of water.

School, we have found that it is in very bad condition and that considerable repairs & replacements will be necessary before this institution can get hot water or fire the heating boiler. To date, I have only received requirements & estimated costs for the hot water plant; the repairs to the heating plant will include the services of a steam fitter, a brick mason & a welder. I have asked the steam fitter, Mr Michael, to get these men to give him an estimate of the cost of material & labour and then submit the total estimated cost. This plant has been in operation since 1912.\n\nMr Michael spent some time going over the plant and found the hot water boiler half full of sediment so he cleaned it out. The jacket heater was also in very bad condition; the bottom fell out of it and it must be replaced by a new heater large enough to heat a tank of 380 gallons capacity. He has submitted the attached estimate to cover the cost of replacement - it appears to be reasonable and as good, if not better, than any other quotation we might get, I think, as there is no other plumber or steam-fitter nearer than Calgary.\n\nAuthority for this expenditure is required as early as possible, please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.H. Gooderham\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nJuly 27, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant it is noted that the hot water boiler at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School has to be replaced immediately. Consequently an expenditure of $138.00 for this purpose is approved.\n\nSince writing to you on the 16th ultimo advising that there was slightly over $400.00 still available for repairs and improvements at this school we purchased a sewing machine at a cost of $86.40. We are authorizing in this letter $138.00 and have not yet received the account for the hot water heating coils for the large kitchen range.\n\nYou will, therefore, note that the amount available is gradually diminishing and consequently repairs to the heating plant will have to be kept to a minimum. I note you will report later with regard to the expenditure that will be necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G. H.

Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nYours truly,\nCrown Lumber Co.\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nFor W. Birch\nBlackfoot Indian Agency\nGleichen, July 31st, 1940\n\nAttention: Chief, Training Division.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge yours of the 27th inst. authorizing an expenditure of $138.00 for the hot water boiler at the Crowfoot Res. School.\n\nI have now received an estimate for the repairs to the heating boiler; it is higher than anticipated. Attached is an estimate from L. Michael, one from the welder D. MacDonald, and one from the Crown Lumber Co for material. The bricklayer J. Davenport states that the labour costs of re-bricking will not exceed $50.00; he says that it will take him and a helper almost a week, his rate of pay is therefore very reasonable. All these mechanics are the best in their line in the district.\n\nWith regards to brick, the bricklayer wants all new bricks but Mr. Michael contends that salvaged bricks could be used on the North wall because it is only a fire travel - this would reduce the purchase of new bricks by 500 and the amount by $60.00. We find that considerable damage has been done to the brick work and foundation by seepage water. Not only seepage but from water which comes from outside in rainy weather. This keeps the foundation & brick work wet all the year round. Mr. Michael loaned The Principal a small rotary pump with a \u00bc h.p. motor attached. This is now in the boiler room and pumps water from the ash-pit. It is slow but it does the work. A large automatic sump pump installed will cost about $125.00 but if funds are not available, I would seriously recommend the purchase of the one loaned by Mr. Michael. He will accept $30.00 for the outfit. The pump is new and I know the price is right.\n\nThe water front for the range arrived today and is being installed, the cost is $30.00. I have instructed Mr. Michael to install a new hot water boiler. I shall await your instructions about the heating plant.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.M. Gooderham\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nAugust 3, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo the following additional expenditure at the Crowfoot Residential School is approved:\n\n1. Repairs to heating boiler ............... $53.60\n2. Repairs to cast iron front frame of boiler 42.00\n3. Labour costs of rebricking wall .......... 50.00\n\nThe quotation from the Crown Lumber Company for the brick simply states the unit price and as you do not mention the number of bricks that will be required it is not possible for me to decide the total cost. I presume, however, that this will be less than $50.00 and, therefore, you may arrange for purchase.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G. H.

At the Crowfoot school an inspection was made of the heating plant which has been in use for some 30 years and needed repairs badly. I am pleased to say that authority has been given for these repairs to be done and it is expected that the plant will be in good working order when school opens.\n\nThe same condition, only on a smaller scale, existed at the Old Sun School, this work is now done. The crops at both schools is very good; at the Old Sun a good crop of Alfalfa is being harvested while at the Crowfoot the Rev. Father Kiou purchased about 80 tons of prairie hay from the Indians to augment the feed which he will harvest off the farm.\n\nG.H.

As these prices seemed to be rather high, I went to the T. Eaton Company, Calgary, and got their prices; I am attaching hereto copies of the two prices.\n\nAn explanation is in order with regard those quoted by the T. Eaton Company: These blinds are of metal slats and the price quoted is special - the same price this firm would have quoted on the wooden blinds. They appear to me to be very much more durable and better in every way than the wooden slatted blinds.\n\nI recommend the purchase of these metal blinds from the T.

Welfare and Training\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Crowfoot School\n\nIt is understood here that a certain sum of money has been allocated for the necessary repairs and improvements at the Crowfoot Residential School, Cluny, for the current fiscal year. To date very little has been expended at this school, but there certainly are immediate requirements as follows:\n\n1. Paint is needed for the interior of the school building, as per the attached list, at a cost of approximately $275.00.\n\n2. The Principal, Father Forestier, has a qualified man to instruct in manual training, but there is no place that this can be done. A careful survey has been made of the situation and certain obsolete and unsightly old buildings are being pulled down, but they are of little or no value. Therefore, to meet immediate requirements it is suggested that a four room Indian house which is situated about a mile from the school, be moved to the school grounds and put into shape to use as a workshop. If the sum of $250.00 can be authorized to pay for the moving and repairs, the Principal with the assistance of this office will take steps to have this building moved and put to use during the fall term.\n\nIn preparing the estimates for 1942/43 it is assumed that the workshop will be allowed during the current fiscal year and nothing will be included in these estimates to cover this. Should this assumption be wrong it would be appreciated if a wired reply could be forwarded. Could we also please be advised, at the earliest possible date whether or not the above expenditures will be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

The Department finds it difficult to understand why the school Principals wait until the end of the holidays to do the painting. We realize, however, that the Principal of the Crowfoot School has just been appointed and expect that the administration will proceed smoothly. We are turning over your request for paint to the Purchasing Branch.\n\nAs regards the moving of the Indian house to the Crowfoot School the Department has not made any provision in the estimates for the establishment of a workshop. We are ready, however, to allow a grant not to exceed $300.00 toward the moving of the above-mentioned house and its repairs in order that it may be turned into a workshop. Needless to say the Department would desire to have this workshop in operation as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nDear Sir:\n\nIt was reported to this office on the 25th instant that the large pressure tank which supplies water throughout the Crowfoot Residential School and its new addition had burst. This tank has a diameter of five feet and is 24 feet long; it is buried in the ground at the east end of the school with its west end through the foundation into what is known as the Tank Room in the basement of the school. It has remained in this position since 1912. In 1938 an annex was added to the school and the east end of the tank leads in through the foundation into the west end of the basement of the annex. I am submitting a small rough sketch which I have made and which may be of value in helping you to picture this situation. This is the unit which supplies all the water for this school and is, therefore, all important, for without it there is no water in the pipe lines and no real fire protection.\n\nI instructed Steam Fitter Michael of Gleichen to investigate and report on this case. He found that the west end was blown from a concave to a convex condition and that the water glass was broken and where this end was riveted it had been loosened to such an extent that it was no longer air tight. He believed, however, that it might be electric welded and considered this was worth trying before considering a replacement or an auxiliary system. I instructed him to take Electric Welder McDonald of Gleichen and attempt this. On the 28th instant he reported that the welder had worked for some hours and failed to make an air tight job although it was possible to pump air into the tank and give pressure for a limited amount of water, but as the air continuously escapes the automatic cut-out works very frequently. This automatic cut-out, by the way, was ordered only one week before the tank burst and had not yet been installed.\n\nIn company with McDonald, Michael and a representative of Metals Limited, I inspected the plant at the school and thoroughly discussed the situation as it now existed. I have also since consulted the head of one of the best welding concerns in Calgary and am now prepared to make certain recommendations.\n\nI recommend that two 30\" x 72\" tanks be installed in one end of the tank room and connected up with the water system. These tanks are the largest size that can be brought through existing windows in the foundation and their combined capacity-\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\ncapacity is 370 gallons. The tank room is small and there is but room for these two at one end of the room near enough to the existing connections to require very little extra piping. It will be necessary, however, to carry a line of half-inch pipe around the corridors to the annex in order to supply water for the boys' toilets and the dairy room. Mr. Michael and Metals Limited have quoted, for the tanks and installation, a price of \u00a3237.00. With an automatic cut-out and careful use of water these tanks will supply the needs of the school for months, if necessary.\n\nThis recommendation is made because it is believed that the large tank may still be in good condition. The outside has been protected from weather and is as good as new; the inside, however, can only be inspected by cutting out one end and cleaning it. The procedure recommended for this would be to cut the rivets from the west end and remove it, wash and clean the inside and examine for pits. If found in good condition, the end would be taken to some reliable welding concern in Calgary and either strengthened or replaced and electric welded into position about six inches in from the present head. If, of course, a new tank is needed such would have to be built to order and considering what size could be placed in the location of the existing tank, unless some other location was found to be more practical and applicable. After the large tank was repaired or replaced the two auxiliary tanks could be used elsewhere.\n\nDelivery and installation of these small tanks can be made immediately. At the moment there is only the Staff living in the institution and it is not advisable to bring pupils in until there is a proper water system operating.\n\nPlease instruct by Air Mail or wire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H.

The repairs and improvements will not exceed $120.00. This includes electric light extension, heating stove, extra windows, work benches & cupboards.\n\nIf the question of ownership is a deterrent, I am advised by Revd. Father Forrestier that the building can be purchased for a small sum as it is of no value to the Oblate Order where it stands.\n\nPlease advise if this is acceptable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Father F. Forestier, O.M.I., that nothing has been done for the current year in the matter of repairs to his School. I do not know exactly what the amount is, but I am under the impression that a fairly generous sum was voted for this purpose in the current estimates.\n\nRev. Father Forestier calls my attention to the following urgent repairs which might be done out of this year's vote:\n\n1. Paint for exterior of buildings... $300.00\n2. Repairs to boiler room roof which is now leaking badly............. 50.00\n3. Renewing of stairs in the girls' Department......................... 50.00\n4. a) New floors in girls' sewing room\n   b) Repairs to walls of vegetable and store rooms.\n   c) Repairs to floor in girls' and boys' dormitories, girls' playroom and children's refectory........... 225.00\n5.

We have authorized the purchase of new pressure tanks at a cost of $237.00 and have also ordered paint at a cost of $852.05. In addition we are corresponding with the Agent now in regard to providing a workshop. This will probably involve an expenditure of an additional $200.00. You will, therefore, note that we have expended at this school a great deal more than was actually provided. This action was only made possible by reducing our small unexpended amount to the vanishing point. Under the above circumstances it will not be possible to expend any further amount at the Crowfoot School this year.\n\nFrom information received from Father Forestier it is evident that he considers extensive\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nrepairs are required as he has already forwarded to us a copy of his 1942-43 estimates. The total amount of these is $3,536.00. In view of present conditions you will immediately realize that it will be impossible to consider providing this amount for one school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 22, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant in which you suggest renovating a workshop rather than moving the Indian house.\n\nI am informed that this workshop is at a considerable distance from the school and if this information is correct it is doubtful if it would prove suitable even though renovated. Besides, I understand from your letter that this workshop is not located on school property.

I, therefore, request that you will send to this office for testing purposes a sample of the flat white wall paint delivered on purchase order No. 8995. A one-pint sample will be required and it should be thoroughly mixed, preferably by using two cans in the process of mixing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G.H.

Pupils were apparently happy to return but the parents have been very slow in bringing in children who were entering for the first time. As usual, there was the unfortunate situation where there were mixed marriages and many disputes as to which school the child should attend. Our only interest is that the child of school age should go to school and we do not consider it our duty to either advise or dictate to the parent where the child must be placed. Very little vocational work has been started at either school as accommodation has not yet been provided. A temporary plant to supply necessary water at Crowfoot School has been set up. From a recent survey and information given to me, I am glad to report that the children returned to school generally in very good physical condition. The T.B. Clinic will commence almost immediately, when the real condition will be known.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nG.H.

I recommend the purchase and repair of this building because I am positive that it will cost less than the moving and repairing of an Indian house, besides answering the purpose much better.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nGHG:R\nOttawa,\nOctober 24, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant with reference to the workshop for the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. It is not clear from your letter if you propose moving the workshop to the school site but I am under the impression that that is not your intention. If our supposition is correct, we could not purchase the building without moving it and even then it would likely involve securing an order-in-council.\n\nAll the correspondence in connection with this matter has been carefully reviewed with Mr. Doucet who is under the impression that the Indian house would provide a great deal more accommodation than the workshop mentioned in your letter. The academic term is advancing and presumably no vocational work along the specific lines desired by the Department has yet been put into effect. It is, therefore, felt that the Indian house should be moved immediately to a site reasonably close to the school. In your letter of August 20 you stated that certain obsolete and unsightly old buildings had been pulled down and consequently there should be plenty of room for the new vocational building. You should keep the cost of moving and repairing this building as low as possible but the main point is that we want the work done immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. G.H.

The local plumber was sent to do this work and he repaired the safety valves, but when he started on the tubes he found so many were burnt and leaking that he discontinued this work and reported that in his opinion it should all be retubed as it had to be moved off its base and turned on its side to do any retubing.\n\nThe Boiler Inspector was here again yesterday and he confirmed Mr. Michael's report.\n\nI have today received from Mr. Michael an offer to retube this boiler at a cost of $135.00, subject of course to the securing of tubes, which are, at present, available in Calgary.\n\nThis boiler is used in heating water for the laundry at this institution and has had nothing done to it in 18 years. Though antiquated, it does the job alright and I would like to be instructed as to whether Mr. Michael should proceed with this work. It can be operated temporarily but must be repaired within the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOffice of Indian Agent,\nBlackfoot Indian Agency,\nGleichen, May 22, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I refer to your letter of the 20th instant, re authority to spend $1000.00 on repairs to the Crowfoot School roof.\n\nFurther to your suggestion of yesterday, I am now satisfied that it would be the proper procedure to secure the services of Mr. Snelson or some other qualified departmental building inspector to attend to this matter. The eaves troughing, as well as the roof, should be repaired and such a qualified man would best know what to do and how to allocate the work.\n\nIt is hoped that you can secure the services of such an inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) \"G. H. GOODERHAM,\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPublic Building,\nCALGARY, Alta.\nCalgary, May 26th, 1948\n\nSir:\n\nReference Departmental letter No. 104-2-5 of the 27th ultimo, re repairs to the roof of the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, I beg to report that I discussed this matter with Mr. G. H. Gooderham, the Indian Agent, and Rev. F. Forestier, the Principal.\n\nIn looking over the roof, which has a dome; also the cornices and eaves-troughing, all of which need to be repaired, it was decided that a qualified and competent tradesman be employed to check same over carefully, and take charge of the work. I suggested to Agent Gooderham that he ask our Department to approach the Department of Public Works and ask that an engineer or architect from the Banff, Alberta, staff be instructed to do this. I mentioned Mr. Snelson, who supervised the construction of the class-room annex at this (Crowfoot) School in 1938, and who also took charge of and supervised the alterations and repairs to the Ermineskin School at Hobema, in the same year. If Mr. Snelson's services can be obtained, I believe that the work will be done very economically: this was proven to us last Autumn when the matter of installing a new pumping unit at the Blood Agency was being looked into, and the work done under Mr. Snelson's guidance, cost less than one-half of the estimate submitted by a firm in Cardston. (Reference Dept. No. 21-103 dated January 21st, 1942).\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of Agent Gooderham's letter to me, and would ask that the matter be taken up with him direct, as my absences from this office are oftentimes the cause of delay in matters of this kind, and it is imperative that the roof, &c., be repaired as soon as possible, to protect the walls and ceilings from rain seeping through.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

It would be appreciated if Mr. Snelson's services could be secured to supervise the work. In the current year's appropriation an amount of $1000.00 was provided and it is hoped that the necessary work can be done for this amount.

In my letter of May 15 an expenditure of $135.00 was authorized for retubing the boilers. An amount of $500.00 was also made available for repairs to the manual training building. In addition to these two amounts it is estimated that it may require $1000.00 to repair the roof of the school. The latter requirement has already been brought to the attention of the Surveys & Engineering Branch. You will note from what has just been said that the amount specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for the Crowfoot School has now been exceeded. Consequently at the present time we are not in a position to favourably consider purchasing the range. If the repairs to the roof are not as expensive as first quoted we may be in a position to provide funds for the range later in the year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJune 24th, 1942\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Repairs to Roof, - Crowfoot Indian Residential School, Blackfoot Reserve, Cluny, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your notation dated the 2nd instant on Dr. McGill's memorandum to you of May 30th, 1942, in connection with the above, I may say that following a request from this office Mr. Walker arranged for an inspection of the roof, cornices, eavestroughing and flashings at the school.\n\nThe inspection was carried out on the 15th instant, and we are now in receipt of Mr. Walker's report in which we are advised as follows:\n\n1. The shingles on the main roof, including that portion covering a two storey verandah, have been in position since 1912, and are badly warped, decomposed, and in many places missing.\n\n2. A concealed gutter in the roof over the verandah has deteriorated, and has resulted in considerable damage to the structural members of the roof and wood cornice.\n\n3. The metal flashings, valleys and gutters to the main roof are badly rusted, broken and out of position.\n\n4. The metal roof covering of the boiler room is rusted through, and flashings are out of position.\n\n5. Repairs and insulation are required to cupola.\n\n6. Repairs to stucco work, and new flashings are required over windows in pediment.\n\nMr. Walker reports that Mr. Snelson, in the company of Mr. L. Michael, plumber and tinsmith of Gleichen, Alberta, made a thorough examination of the points mentioned, and on this basis our engineer estimates that the necessary material and labour to carry out repairs will involve an expenditure of approximately $1000.00.\n\nIn his .......\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nIn his report Mr. Walker advises that the only workmen available in the vicinity appear to be:\n\n1. L. Michael - Plumber and Tinsmith, Gleichen, Alta.\n2. Kelly and Reid - Carpenters\n\nboth of whom have done work for the Agency and are considered reliable.\n\nIf the Indian Affairs Branch transfers $1000.00 to our Service for the above work, it is recommended that authorization be granted for our Banff office to obtain prices from L. Michael for tinsmithing work, and from Kelly and Reid for shingling and carpentry work, or a total price for the complete work, if possible, from either of the foregoing.

I forwarded a copy of the letter to the Principal of the School and he recently interviewed me and stated that the Sisters were having a terrible time trying to cook on the old range. The situation was so serious that I got the local furnace man, Mr. Michael, to make careful inspection and report his findings.\n\nHere they are: There are two fire-boxes and two ovens; both ovens are cracked and cannot be used. Anything put in the ovens is burnt on one side and not cooked on the other. The top of the stove is alright and can be used. For some time all roasting and baking has been done in the bread baking oven. This is not in the kitchen but in another part of the basement. Mr. Michael says that the ovens of the range cannot be repaired.\n\nThe stove is an ancient relic and I am satisfied that Michael knows his business. Can anything be done about replacement?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) \"G. H. GOODERHAM\"\n\nC. Fant.

Forestier, the principal, when both stated that it was imperative that a new range be procured.\n\nI have examined the old range, and can only repeat what I said in my report on this school under date of April 22nd, 1939:\n\n\"The kitchen range, a very old one, is badly warped; the ovens are burned out and cannot be used. It is not worth repairing. This range was brought to Crowfoot in 1923, from the old Dunbow School, where it had been in use for sometime.\"\n\nIn his letter forwarding his Estimates for the current fiscal year, under date of September 11th, 1941, Agent Gooderham wrote:\n\n\"Re Crowfoot School:\n\n...the kitchen range now in use must be 40 years old; it came from Dunbow Industrial School. It has two ovens and two fire boxes; the ovens are so badly cracked that the kitchen Matron does considerable cooking in the bread baking ovens.\"\n\nI understand that the kitchen staff at the School have protested at having to begin a new year with this old, burnt out range.

M. Walker, Chief Engineer,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nBANFF, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Walker:\n\nI was advised on June 30th by my Branch at Ottawa that you had taken on the work of seeing that the necessary repairs were done to the Crowfoot Residential School on this Reserve, and that you had reported these would cost about $1000.00.\n\nYour Mr. Snelson interviewed L. Michael, Plumber and Tinsmith of Gleichen, and later I understand that Michael was requested to complete a tender for certain definite repairs calling for the re-shingling of the roof, repairs to verandahs and eavestroughing, etc. Mr. Michael states his tender of $961.00 was accepted.\n\nMr. Michael employs a former lumberman whom he sent to the local Crown Lumber yard with the measurements of the roof of the school with instructions for this chap, McDonald, and the local lumber agent to figure out the requirements. In some way they placed this at 25,000 shingles and after obtaining the cost of these, plus the cost of laying, Michael completed his tender. He then obtained the 25,000 shingles and later, when checking the roof, found that he needed about 109,000 shingles. He states he then reported this fact to you.\n\nMr. Michael is a responsible business man and has been taking contracts and doing repairs on this Reserve for over twenty five years and he has never made a mistake of this nature. He is a man of high business integrity and I am satisfied that this is a very unfortunate error. I interviewed the Crown Lumber Company's agent and verified the statement made to me by Mr. Michael.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to the Inspector of Indian Agencies for Alberta, as well as to Ottawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nGHG:R\nBlackfoot Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Sept. 9, 1942.\n\nAttention: Superintendent Welfare & Training\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 104-2-5\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of June 30th where it is stated that the Surveys & Engineering Branch had estimated the repairs required at Crowfoot School would amount to $1000.00. An error on the part of Mr. Michael, who tendered on this job, would apparently indicate that it will cost nearly $1700.00 to complete the work required in the tender submitted by the Surveys & Engineering Branch, Banff.\n\nI attach hereto a letter (copy) to the Chief Engineer at Banff which Mr. Michael asked me to write. I believe it explains the error. According to figures supplied by Mr. Michael the extra shingles and labor is estimated to cost $735.00.\n\nThe part of the school roof which caused the damage to the verandah and foundation has already been straightened out and re-shingled and the water is now carried away in the proper manner. Michael has also repaired the roof of the Laundry-Boiler room. He has used about 10,000 shingles and these, together with labour and other material expended, will amount to approximately $450.00. He has 15,000 more shingles on the job but tells me that he cannot locate the extra 84,000 which would be required to complete the job. I do not know the situation with regard to shingles but I do know that it is very fortunate that none of the shingles on the main part of the building had been removed before this error was found; the original roof is intact.\n\nIf you find that the necessary shingles cannot be located and are prepared to release Mr. Michael from his contract and pay him for the work which must be done, I sincerely believe that the existing shingle roof will be weatherproof, under normal conditions, for sometime if the cupola is insulated and the chimneys flashed. Driven snow has been getting into the cupola and melting and, as is common, driven snow also gets around chimneys. A careful job of insulating and flashing would prevent this and would not cost much. The total cost, including that already done, would not exceed $500.00.\n\nNo further work will be done until a decision is made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

The contractor estimating on 25,000 shingles when he should have estimated on 25,000 square feet of roof to be covered.\n\nThe contractor is being instructed to proceed on the following basis; to execute all necessary repairs to woodwork, to provide and install all flashings, gutters, cornices and valleys covered by the specifications to insulate and repair the cupola, to provide and lay 25,000 shingles now on the job to the best advantage. This will cover all work now covered by the contract for the main roof verandah and entrance also boiler-room roof except that the shingling will not be completed, and is to be carried out at a cost not to exceed the tender price of $961.00.\n\nThe completion of the shingling will have to be postponed as it is impossible at this time to secure the shingles that would be required.\n\nJ.M. Wardle\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, September 25, 1942.\n\nRe: Repairs, Crowfoot Residential School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a memorandum received from the Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch.

H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nOttawa,\nOctober 2, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Manual training building, Crowfoot School.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo and to state that there was in the estimates of this year a sum of $1000.00 for supplies, repair of buildings, etc., at the Crowfoot School. At this date, however, it would appear that an amount equal to or greater than this has already been spent on repairs to the school building. At least $1000.00 was transferred for this purpose to the Surveys & Engineering Branch some time ago.\n\nIt so happens that the amounts set apart for repairs at residential schools this year have, in the majority of cases, been insufficient to meet the demands. If, however, the repairs to the vocational building are urgently required it might be possible to secure $300.00 from other sources. The supplies, of course, will have to be purchased through the Purchasing Branch. You might let me know at once the nature of these supplies and the approximate cost. Am I to understand that the labour will be supplied by the school?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Manual Training Bldg.- Crowfoot School\n\nI have your airmail letter of the 2nd instant and note that funds for repairs to schools have already been exceeded and that this will particularly apply in the case of the Crowfoot Boarding School. Following my letter of the 26th ultimo I wrote you on the 29th to report certain necessary repairs to plant that had cost in the neighborhood of $90.00, most of which has already been done. This adds, of course, another amount which you didn't have at October 2nd.\n\nCrowfoot School used a small building for manual training during the fiscal year of 41/42 and it answered the purpose very well indeed. I do not know of any other use that the Principal wishes to make of it; I realize that storage space is limited at this institution and possibly he has in mind using it for this purpose and even using some of the four-roomed house which would be made into a training building for the same purpose. However, under conditions existing these days I am satisfied that the repairs to the vocational building could be left at least until the fiscal year of 43/44. This may break into his plans, but whose plans are not broken into these days? In the first place, material is going to be very hard to get and in the second place I doubt very much if the school will be in a position to supply all the labour. I am, therefore, not going to mention your letter of the 2nd instant to the Principal and unless you so desire, I am prepared to tell him that it is regretted that the money is not available for this work this fiscal year.\n\nPlease reply immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nO T T A W A, Canada.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Sept. 29, 1942.\n\nAttention: R. A. Hoey, Supt. Welfare & Training\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe pipe system leading from an outside storage tank to the main building at Crowfoot School was leaking so badly that I asked the Principal to put his man to work to uncover it. It was found that the pipeline was eight feet underground and the work entailed was more than this man could cope with so I hired a qualified helper. The pipe, which had been there for 32 years, was found to be badly pitted and leaking in many places. After cribbing, a new pipe was laid and I am pleased to say that water, which has been seeping into this building for some time, has now ceased. At the same time as I was inspecting this work I noted that the safety valves on the pressure tanks were totally inadequate and on learning that they could not be repaired, ordered new ones. I also had the new cooking range set up at this school and the old one torn down and removed. It was hoped that the existing pipe system would be large enough for the new range but it was found that there wasn't sufficient draft, as the pipes were too small. The stove is giving good service but the pipes must be enlarged, necessitating the making of special shaped pipes to travel between the water line and other pipes. The local plumber, L. Michael, could do this work.\n\nThe foregoing repairs will cost in the neighborhood of $90.00. While labour was available and as the work was considered urgent, I have had everything done except the enlarging of the stove pipes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H.

The children were very well and happy. The class work was well handled, with 3 teachers in charge; the mid-day meal was exceptionally good. The staff work under certain difficulties; the laundry at this institution is very poor; there is no ironer, the washing machines and extractor are thirty years old and next to impossible to operate. It is hoped that this school can be supplied with an ironer and an extractor, even if these machines are second handed.\n\nA new hog house is needed; during the cold weather, litters of young pigs were lost despite their endeavor to save them.\n\nG.H.

I have reviewed our files for some months past and cannot find that we have ever received any request from either the Principal or yourself for material for a pig pen. I should appreciate hearing further from you in regard to this matter at the earliest possible date and at the same time you should forward a requisition for the material which you consider necessary for the erection of a pig pen.\n\nR.A.

The bill of material would cover that which would be required for a Piggery 30x66 a combination of the Canadian and Danish type, (Plans attached). Walls would be only 5\u00bd feet high, the floor cement, and walls well insulated to keep out the cold. This should be a real good Piggery but I am not an authority and do not know if it is the most satisfactory for the money. No doubt, on competitive basis the building material would be purchased at less than $1430, quoted by the Crown Lumber Company.\n\nIn any event, the school authorities have given their assurance that they will supply all labour. They have further stated that there is some material which has been recovered and that they are anxious to get the building that they will assume all financial obligation above $1100 or $1200.\n\nA requisition for material has not been made as the work would not be proceeded with until spring and I would appreciate further instructions before submitting it.\nOttawa,\nMarch 12, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Doucet advises me that during his visit to the Duck Lake School he was pleased with the success that you were having in the raising of hogs. I should appreciate your advising me what type of building you use for your hogs and I should also like to know if you simply endeavour to raise the hogs necessary to provide pork for the school, or if you raise a number for sale. Do you find it cheaper to raise your own hogs for use at the school? Are the senior pupils interested in the raising of these animals? What training in this regard do you attempt to give them? Any other information that you may have regarding this matter would be appreciated, as we are being confronted with the problem of hog raising at other Indian residential schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing list of material required for the erection of a new piggery at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School.\n\nThe contents of your letter have been very carefully considered and it is quite evident that the piggery suggested by the school management would handle a very large number of pigs.\n\nIn raising pigs, or other live stock, at a residential school the Department feels that the first matters to be considered should be the provision of food for the pupils and staff and, combined with this, the possibility of training the older pupils at least in the proper manner of raising such stock. We feel that it is inadvisable for Indian residential schools to attempt to raise live stock on a commercial basis. This involves a great deal of work and, while the boys might receive some training, there are so many routine duties requiring attention that the pupils soon develop the feeling that they are simply being worked for the benefit of the school and consequently the value of the training is nearly all lost. From our consideration of the plan suggested by the Principal of the Crowfoot School, we are under the impression that he contemplates raising hogs on a wholesale scale rather than on the scale which we consider advisable and which I have outlined above.\n\nI understand that the Indian residential school at Duck Lake, Sask., which is also operated by the Oblate Order, has been raising a considerable number of hogs for school purposes in the last few years and they have not\nTO STANLEY BROCK LIMITED DR.\n\nSOLD TO Crowfoot Indian Residential School,\nCluny, Alberta.\n\nC.S.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDuck Lake, Sask.,\nMarch 20th, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI make haste to reply to your letter No.104-2-5 dated the 12, and which I received the 16 instant.\n\nFor several years at the Duck Lake School, we have been trying to get the senior boys interested in the raising of hogs. And now, over one third of the former pupils of the school raise these animals, not only for their own use but also for the market. This enterprise has not yet met with full success, but we have good reasons to hope that the near future will bring about still better results.\n\nThe boys who desire any training in this line have every opportunity of learning all that is required to carry out the work successfully later on. At present from six to eight boys are thus occupied and show great interest in the work.\n\nWe have always found it more profitable to raise our own hogs and thereby furnish the school with an ample supply of fresh meat as well as with bacon and ham, which we also teach the pupils to prepare.\n\nFrom January 1942 to January 1943, we consumed 6,907 lbs of pork and sold for the amount of $1002.97. These figures show the importance of raising hogs, especially during war time.\n\nThe shelter which we provide for our pigs is very simple and sanitary at the same time. It has been constructed with material which the Indians may get on their reserves, i.e., logs, slabs, straw, hay and mud and green poles. It consists of two rectangular enclosures one of which is built inside the other at a distance of two feet from the outer one. The dimensions are 80' X 20' for one and consequently 76' X 16' for the other. Each of these two enclosures is built of upright slabs eight feet in length and placed but a few inches apart. Between these two walls we have piled straw mixed with hay. The roof consists of poles overlaid with straw and mud. The interior of the building is divided into five compartments each 15' X 16' X 6', there being a log floor half way across each compartment. Upon this floor is thrown the straw on which the hogs lie. Moreover, each compartment has but one opening which gives access to a pen 16' X 50' also made of upright slabs...and in and out of which the pigs may freely go at all times of the year.\nLast fall, our senior boys constructed a log building 30' x 20' upon a concrete foundation two feet high. The walls were plastered with mud both inside and outside. The roof being covered with mud and hay. The structure has four windows and two doors and is divided into six compartments the partitions being made of small poles placed upright and two inches apart. It is in this building that our sows bring forth their litter during the cold months of December, January, February. Out of seventy (70) little pigs born during the winter, we have rescued sixty (60).\n\nThe aspect of such structures, not too pleasing to the eye could be improved by keeping the surroundings clean and orderly, and perhaps also by planting trees.\n\nOur modernized buildings may be far more appealing to the stranger than our lowly constructions of slabs and straw. Still I believe that we are making our boy better fitted for the future by training them to work with the different materials and in the same conditions which will be less likely to be handicapped as would happen should they attempt at home to proceed with what their economic conditions would not permit.\n\nHoping that the above information may prove to be of some value to you, and assuring you of my willingness to co-operate with the Department in its efforts to improve the condition of our Indians,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nG.M.

You will note that the general trend of this letter is along the same lines as my letter of the 12th instant; namely, that an expensive building is not really necessary for the successful raising of hogs and, besides, an inexpensive building is a better training for the pupils because, if they can be made interested in raising hogs while attending a residential school, they will be able to build a similar building when they return to their home reserve.\n\nR.A.

Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCrowfoot Indian Residential School,\nCluny, Alberta.\nMarch 27, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, our Indian agent has sent me a copy of your letter dated the 13th of this month concerning the new pigery at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. Before replying to your letter, I did what you suggested, namely, inquired from Father Principal of the Duck Lake School concerning their pigery, of which you also possess information. Upon receipt of the letter from Father Latour, the Principal of the same School, I immediately went to our agent to show him the contents and to discuss the matter. The discussion was brief, because under our present situation, that is, living in the prairie where there is not a single pole or slab available, what has been done at the Duck Lake School is practically out of the question in our location. This I am sure, the Department will be aware of.\n\nThe dimension we had given for our new pigery was 66 by 30, and the one in the Duck Lake was 80 by 20, and another 76 by 16, and also another of 30 by 20. You can see that these are much larger than the one we ask for. We would be contented with such a type of pigery if the Department would purchase slabs, posts, and legs, which Mr. Gooderham told me are not available. Last spring we bought some fence posts, 'cedar posts' and as you know, we had to pay 25 cents a piece and we had a very hard time getting them. Transportation amounted to 3 cents a linear foot. I inquired about slabs, and I was told that they are not available around here, that we would have to get them from the mountains west of Banff, and that it would cost us much.\n\nSo every angle being considered and our present situation taken into consideration it would cost the Department just as much, if not more to build such a pigery here at the Crowfoot School.\n\nI wish to tell you dear Sir, that if we were in the same kind of country as northern Saskatchewan, where logs, poles, and slabs are plentiful, and this I know by experience, because my home town is Duck Lake, you may believe me; we would do everything we can to show our good will in assisting it in every way.\n\nYou seem to infer in your letter, I quote, \"From our consideration of the plan suggested by the Principal of the Crowfoot School, we are under the impression that he contemplates raising hogs on a wholesale scale.\" I wish to point out regarding this, that first, until now we have been providing ourselves with our own meat; secondly, that we are trying our best to train the older pupils in all branches of farm work; thirdly, that we have also to find means to have a certain cash revenue from the farm, for this reason that the School is being paid for 68 pupils and we have 95 in School. We have 23 children for which we receive no assistance from the Department. This cannot be done with the per capita grant we receive.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. H. Forester, M.A.,\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 104-2-5\n\nPiggery Crowfoot Residential School\n\nI have yours of the 24th with enclosures. The Rev. principal of Crowfoot had already shown me a copy of the letter from Father Latour.\n\nStructures such as Duck Lake School has erected are undoubtedly practicable and serviceable and certainly not costly in that part of the country. The Crowfoot school is built on the open prairie where there is no timber, from which to secure the logs. Timber must be obtained from the Rocky Mountains or the foothills.\n\nLogs are very difficult to procure now, and the cost, if transportation must be included, is nearly as much as rough lumber.\n\nI am quite familiar with the straw barn which is used by farmers who can not afford a better building. This is certainly not the type for an institution; it is unsightly, the life of the building is short and great care must be taken to avoid fires.\n\nIt is granted that the Indians will not have an elaborate Piggery on their farms but in this part of Western Canada it is just about as cheap to erect a building with lumber and cement as it is to erect one like the one at Duke Lake.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nOttawa, April 5, 1948.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nCrowfoot Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 - Allotment 10 - 691\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

The extractor has been repaired many times and is now practically useless. The bread mixer in use is a sausage mixer which has been converted to the use of mixer. It can no longer be repaired. There has been a shortage of beds this past year and with a sure prospect of increased pupilage in Sept. beds are an immediate necessity.\n\nThe above equipment would of necessity have to be installed for September.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. F. Forestier, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRE: Crowfoot Residential School\n\nI am attaching hereto a copy of a letter received from the Principal of this school, in which he asks for certain laundry, kitchen and dormitory equipment which are badly needed.\n\nThe present laundry equipment has been in use thirty years and is beyond repair. It is now a terrible ordeal to do the washing.\n\nThis institution was never supplied with a real bread mixer. Some years ago the late principal got a sausage mixer which we rigged up with a small gasoline engine to do the mixing. It was a cheap set up but it served the purpose for a long time.\n\nPrevious to that all bread was mixed by hand; this work is far too heavy for growing children.\n\nIf the principal takes in new pupils, he must have beds. It is realized how difficult it is to get what is needed but it must be stressed that the need is urgent.\n\nIndian Agent,\nG. H. Gooderham\nOttawa, July 15, 1943.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. While I am not certain if the funds at our disposal will permit our purchasing all the items requested by the Principal, I would like to have more definite information regarding the type of washer, laundry extractor and bread mixer which you consider are required. No doubt, the Principal has been giving some consideration to the matter and will be able to supply definite catalogue numbers regarding each of the items. It will be more satisfactory if he supplies us with this information, as we could then endeavour to secure exactly what he thinks would be most suitable for the school.\n\nThis school has an authorized pupil enrollment of 75, but we only pay for 92.24% of this number. I presume that there are beds in the school for the number for whom grant is allowed and, consequently, we do not understand your reference to taking in new pupils this fall. According to our records, 75 pupils are all that can be accommodated at the Crowfoot School, and, for health reasons, we do not wish to see any of our residential schools overcrowded, if it can be avoided. With this in mind, we will not consider ordering the 15 beds. Inspector Schmidt has recently received mattresses from surplus supplies of the Department of National Defence. No doubt, he will send a number of these mattresses to the Crowfoot School.\n\nR. A.

I have also had an opportunity this morning of reading your report regarding your inspection of the Crowfoot School on the 1st instant.\n\nOn the 15th instant Mr. Gooderham was written and requested to furnish more definite information regarding the type of laundry equipment and bread mixer required. When this information is received the matter will have our very careful consideration, although I doubt if the funds at our disposal will permit our purchasing all the equipment suggested. With regard to the request for additional beds, I cannot do better than quote from our letter of July 15 to Mr. Gooderham:\n\n\"This school has an authorized pupil enrolment of 75, but we only pay for 92.24% of this number.

This is being built East of the barn, where there is a natural slope for drainage, to the South and away from the other buildings.\n\n**Implement Shed** This is a fairly large frame building, almost square. The roof is too flat; when built it was not properly placed. The light foundation and the studding are giving way under the weight of the roof. This building should be taken down and rebuilt; otherwise it may collapse. The new Principal and his Assistant have done considerable work around this institution, dismantling old, tumble-down shacks, outdoor toilets, &c., repairing fences and tidying up generally.

To secure approval for this proposed expenditure, amounting to upwards of $660.00, some additional information is required.\n\nPlease advise what similar equipment, if any, is now used at the school, and what power is available (single phase or three phase). We understand the washer would serve the needs of approximately 100 people. The washer asked for is the domestic style with a capacity of 8 lbs. dry wash per load, which appears to be rather inadequate.\n\nWe would be pleased to have any additional information or specifications or illustrations you have regarding the two machines.\n\nH.

The specifications and illustrations sent forward by the Pendrith Machinery Company, Limited, 775 West King Street, Toronto, relating to the bread mixer, and the descriptive cuts received from Wilson Electric Supplies, 335 Eighth Avenue West, Calgary, Alta., have already been sent forward to the Purchasing Division.\n\nEncl.\n\nR.

Stairs to girls quarters renewed\n2. New floor in girls sewing room\n3. Paint for interior and also some exterior.\n\nIt is realized it is probably impossible to supply everything that was estimated but the stairs to the girls quarters and the floor in the sewing room are in such bad condition that they should be renewed this year. The new piggery and the workshop, which is an Indian four roomed house, should be painted and the bakery and store room floor and walls should also be painted.\n\nAttached hereto please find quotations from the Crown Lumber Company for the material required for the stairs and hardwood for the floor, also the necessary paint.\n\nAn explanation is necessary, I believe, in regard to the flooring in the sewing room; this floor has been renewed various times with soft wood and is not satisfactory as it wears into large holes and ridges where the machine stands or is moved. The hardwood floor is the cheapest in the end and can be secured.\n\nIn regard to the paint, \"Monarch\" brand is an Alberta product and reasonably good paint and the price as submitted by the Lumber Company, while mostly in line with other firms.\nThe principal is prepared to supply all the labour if the foregoing material is supplied and the work would be done this fall.\n\nIndian Agent,\nG. H. Gooderham\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Your File 104-2-5\n\nIn reply to yours of the 21st, the school has had a barrel type washer in use for 20 or 25 years. This is still working.

They require a large, domestic, electric type washer to take care of all the laundry. The power supplied is single phase.

What make of machine is being used and what is the model or size of same.\n\nYour memorandum of the 13th instant does not say what size, kind, condition, or age of bread mixer the school authorities have been using, whether hinged flat cover and spout are wanted, nor the capacity and size of the Pendrith \"R\" mixer quoted on.\n\nWill you please communicate with the Indian Agent with a view to securing the above information.\n\nH.

Attached hereto please find a cut of Capital washer, manufactured in Ottawa, which would be ideal for this institution. The number four Capital with a forty sheet capacity would be required. This school has now in use 2 - 15 sheet - power driven washing machines, numbers 3043, 3044 which were purchased from the Toronto Laundry Machine Company and installed in 1912. They are still working all right. If the institutional washer could not be supplied the domestic washer added to the two now in use would do the work, with more labour and inconvenience.\n\nRe: The Bread Mixer - This institution has not got a real mixer but has used a meat mixer called the \"Buffalo\", manufactured by the J.E Smith and Sons Co., Buffalo, N.Y. It has been in use for 10 years. It is too small and is not finished for bread mixing. The rust has to be scraped off it very often. It is recommended that a Power driven mixer similar to that supplied to the Old Sun Residential School be supplied. This was purchased from the Fletcher Manufacturing Company, Toronto.

Washing Machine\n\nThe washer is required to supplement the large washing machine which is now in constant use. The Indian Agent states that it would be suitable if we supplied a Capital Washer No. 4 with 40 sheet capacity. He enclosed the attached cut of this washer, but does not state the name of the firm by whom it is manufactured.\n\n2. Bread Mixer\n\nAt the present time this school has no bread mixer, but has been using a meat mixer for the past ten years. This is too small and is not suitable for bread mixing. The rust has to be scraped off it very often. The school requires a power driven mixer similar to that supplied to the Old Sun School in the year 1930. This particular bread mixer was manufactured by the Fletcher Manufacturing Company, Toronto. Its serial number is 1536 and it has a two bag capacity. I have reviewed our files for the year 1930 and, while I find a reference to the mixer having been purchased,\nno details are given, due to the fact that it was purchased locally. However, I hope the information stated will be sufficient.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. R.A. Hosey\n\nWe have your memorandum of the 30th ultimo, (file 104-2-5) regarding washing machine and bread mixer for the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. This memorandum, by the way, is not signed.\n\nThe explanation regarding the need for the bread mixer is satisfactory, but to obtain permission to call for tenders on the washer, additional information is necessary. For instance the original requisition with enclosure indicated that an ordinary domestic washer handling 8 lbs. of dry wash was the kind wanted, whereas in your memorandum of the 30th ultimo, a large commercial type washer (Connor's #4 Capital) with a sheet capacity of 40 lbs. is specified. The price of the latter f.o.b. Cluny, Alberta, is over $500.00.\n\nIf the larger washing machine which you state is at present in use at the school is in good running order, will you please advise why a second washer is required.\n\nH.J.

The Principal has only asked for a domestic washer.\" \"If the institutional washer could not be supplied the domestic washer, added to the two now in use, would do the work with more labour and inconvenience.\" From these two sentences and also the remainder of your letter the Department inferred that both the Principal and yourself would prefer the institutional washer and we submitted this to the Purchasing Branch. In reply they request us to state why the second washer is required, in view of the fact that the large washing machine at present in use in the school is in good running order. This information was obtained from your letter of September 25, although in your letter of July 10 you stated: \"The present laundry equipment has been in use 30 years and is beyond repair. It is now a terrible ordeal to do the washing.\"\n\nWe have had a great deal of correspondence on this matter and the information available is somewhat contradictory. Under the circumstances I find it necessary to again write to you in the matter. I would like to know the necessity for supplying a special washer for the staff if the washing equipment is, as\nstated in your letter of the 25th ultimo, working satisfactorily. Possibly there is a very good explanation for needing an additional washer for the staff clothes, but we do not appear to have any particular reasons stated. When replying you might let me have more detailed information regarding the Easy Spin-Dry washing machine mentioned in your letter of August 11. The information required is outlined in the Purchasing Agent's memoranda of August 20 and September 20 enclosed respectively with official letters of August 21 and September 21.\n\nR.A.

Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: File 104-2-5\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOur agent, Mr. Gooderham, has submitted your letter of the 6th inst. to me for information concerning a washer for our school.\n\nFor the past years a washer had been asked for on the yearly requisition list; we attributed the failure to provide one due to circumstances brought about by the war. As a meagre substitute for a power washer we suggested a domestic type, as some type or other was urgently needed. A machine of institutional type is by all means preferred. Our two washers in use at present are good but far too small to handle the amount of washing that a personnel of 120 accumulates. A third washer had to be discarded and it was to replace this one that a domestic type was requested. If the Dept. can give us a large one, a 40 sheet capacity, the domestic type is out of the question altogether.\n\nI wish to make it clear to the Dept. that we have no large washer, but rather two small ones of 15 sheet size. With the acquisition of a large washer, one of the small ones could be used for the staff laundry.\n\nThe Easy Spin which was submitted to you could have been delivered in two weeks at the time we asked for a washer and that was the main reason this type was requested, thinking a larger one would be out of the question.\n\nWe trust that the above is sufficiently clear.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nRev. F. Forester, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReplying to Mr. Hoey's letter of the 6th, file 104-2-5, in regard to the institutional washer wanted at the Crowfoot Residential School, I am attaching hereto a copy of a letter which I had the Principal of the School prepare.\n\nFrom this I think it has been made clear that the present equipment is not large enough to handle the washing for 120 people.\n\nIndian Agent,\nG. H. Gooderham\nOttawa,\nOctober 18, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 5th instant, I am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Crowfoot Indian Residential School which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"For the past years a washer had been asked for on the yearly requisition list; we attributed the failure to provide one due to circumstances brought about by the war.

Davidson, Esq., Purchasing Agent,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Langevin Block, OTTAWA.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your radiogram of the 27th ultimo, which reads:\n\n\"PLEASE OBTAIN QUOTATION FROM CALGARY OR WESTERN SOURCES ONE ONLY DOMESTIC WASHING MACHINE TWO COMPARTMENT ONE FOR WASHING AND ONE FOR DRYING CAPACITY EACH COMPARTMENT 8 LBS DRY WASH EASY SPIN DRY MODEL A1 OR SIMILAR STYLE FOR CROWFOOT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL CLUNY ALBERTA\".\n\nOn Friday, the 29th ultimo, I made enquiries in Calgary. Not knowing who handles the \"Easy\" Spin Dry Domestic Washer, I first called on Stanley Brock, Ltd., Manufacturers' Agents for Laundry Machinery and Supplies, at 563 - 8th Ave., West, who informed me that they did not handle domestic size washing machines; therefore they were unable to quote. They informed me that they could supply only with one of their No. 1 size belt-driven units, which consists of a Globe-Wood Washer, extractor, together with the necessary pulleys, shafting and motor -- capacity: 40 pounds, dry wash; price - $368.00 F.O.B. Cluny. They can also supply a No. 2 size, same make, capacity - 50 pounds, dry wash; at a price of $400.00. They remarked that the latter is the better buy for a school or institution such as the Crowfoot School.\n\nFrom there, I went to the Canadian General Electric Company, and was told that they did not have an electric washer in stock from Coast to Coast. Mr. B.A. Chopin, the Appliance Sales Manager, very kindly phoned the Fairbanks-Morse Company, Ltd., who stated that they did not have a washer on hand, and did not know where they could get one.\n\nI then called on the Beatty Appliance and Repair Company's representative at 814 - 6th Street, West, who suggested one of their machines -- size 15 pounds -- which he thought could be procured from their head office at Fergus, Ontario. He gave me an illustrated pamphlet which I am enclosing herewith.\n\nI then went to the Northern Electric Company, 709 - 8th Avenue, West, and was told that they did not have a washing machine on hand, had not had for some time past, and did not know where or when they could get one.\n\nI then called on the Wilson Electric Supplies, Limited, 335 - 8th Ave., West, who said that they handled the \"Easy\" Washer, domestic size (as mentioned in your radiogram); but that they did not have one on hand, and did not know whether they could get one. I was told that Mr. Wilson, of that firm, was in Eastern Canada and was expected back at the week-end; that they would bring the matter to his attention. I phoned today, and was told that Mr. Wilson had been contacted, and that there is not a machine of the model specified in your radiogram, to be obtained. They added, \"We could probably supply you, later this month, with a ringer machine -- capacity 6 pounds; we are expecting to receive one or two, but we do not even know what model will be sent us; there are three models of \"Easy\" ringer machines made.\" It would therefore appear that it will be impossible to get an \"Easy\" two-compartment machine.\nI then called Harrison and Crosfield (Canada) Limited, who stated: \"We do not have the household type of washing machines; we have only the institution and laundry size; we do not have a combined washer and drier. I suggest that you have your Branch at Ottawa contact the Beaver Laundry Machinery Co., Limited, of Toronto, who have an Agent in Ottawa; they could discuss the whole matter.\"\n\nI then called the A.W. Maguire Company of 514 - 11th Ave., West, who stated that they did not have any washing machines for sale.\n\nI called on the Marshall-Wells Hardware, Company, Ltd., who informed me that they have not had an electric, domestic washer in stock for several months, and have no idea when they will have one, or what model; nor have they any idea where one could be located in a retail store.\n\nI then called on the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Company, who informed me that they did not have a domestic washing machine on hand, nor did they know when they would receive any, or what model or make. However, they very kindly stated that they would write - Air Mail - to the manufacturers of the \"Easy\" washing machine in Toronto, making enquiries as to whether it would be possible to get a machine for our Branch, who could obtain the necessary priority rights for the purchase of same. Upon receipt of word from Ashdown's I will communicate with you further.\n\nC. Pant.

Ashdown Hardware Company, that they have been advised by the manufacturers of the \"Easy\" washing machine at Toronto, that they cannot provide a machine, as their supply is exhausted.\n\nRe that part of my letter above-mentioned, wherein I quote prices for a \"Globe Wood\" washer, I beg to say that I have since been informed that the figures I quoted are incorrect, and that these figures are for part of the unit only.\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nS/B\nCalgary, November 13th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter I have addressed to the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nI was at the Blackfoot Agency on the 6th instant, and called at the Crowfoot School, and looked over the washing machines and extractor, which consist of:\n\nWashing Machines: There are two of these all-metal washers, same size, Serial Numbers 3043 and 3044, manufactured by the Toronto Laundry Machine Company, of Toronto, Canada; these are belt-driven; The inner, revolving drum being 30 inches long and 30 inches in diameter, would, I am told, classify them as having 40 pounds dry wash capacity.\n\nThe outer casing or shells of both machines became worn and leaked, and were renewed with heavy galvanized iron some years ago. These machines are still working, but I am told these two units are too small for the amount of washing that has to be done at this school. When they were installed by the Department when the school was built (in 1913, I believe) they were intended to do the work for 60 pupils; today there are 51 boys and 51 girls in residence, plus the personnel.\n\nA third -- small-sized, second-hand washing machine, which the school picked up and repaired, was used for a time as a supplementary washer; this has been discarded (taken out and junked) being completely worn out and useless.\n\nExtractor: The all-metal extractor -- also belt-driven -- now in use, is referred to as a 15-inch inner basket size, capacity 20 pounds dry wash. I am told that this extractor was a gift from the Sisters of the Cranbrook, B.C. Hospital, it being too small for their requirements. This extractor is now in very poor shape: The cast iron frame or arm which holds the spindle shaft, having broken has been welded twice, and again has a flaw and may break at any time.\n\nThis extractor is also one of the Toronto Laundry Machine Company's make; this Company closed and were bought out in 1912 by the Canadian Laundry Company. I am informed that these models -- both washer and extractor -- have not been made since, and have been off the market for several years, and that repairs cannot be got.\n\n(Over)\nFor the Department's information, please.\n\nC. Fant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\n/B\nOttawa,\nNovember 19, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI desire to refer you to our requisition of August 19 and subsequent correspondence, with reference to supplying a washing machine for the Crowfoot Residential School. Inspector Schmidt has recently forwarded to us copies of his letters to you dated November 2 and November 13 and it appears that a domestic type machine is not available. I attach copy of a report that has also been received from Inspector Schmidt, regarding the washing machine at present in the school. These communications have been very carefully considered here and it is felt that it would be advisable to supply, for this school, the semi-commercial type, having a dry sheet capacity of from 35 to 40 pounds. This will be much more satisfactory than the small domestic type as it will have to serve the needs of approximately 100 persons.\n\nR.A.

I have just received a letter from the Principal of the Crowfoot School in which he states that this bread mixer had not reached the school on February 12. Considerably more time has elapsed than that stated in your letter and, as we are very anxious to obtain this machine, I should appreciate your advising by return mail when you expect to ship it to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Crowfoot Indian Residential School.\n\nOn a recent visit to this institution, it was brought to my attention that there were not sufficient beds to care for all the children who should be attending school in the new year. There are now 103 in the school, and some makeshift beds are temporarily in use.\n\nThe school is not overcrowded and the request for more small beds is considered to be reasonable. Attached hereto is a copy of a letter from the Principal stating the size desired.\n\nIt is hoped this can be approved.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\n/HM.\nOttawa,\nDecember 5, 1944.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, requesting 12 additional beds for the Crowfoot Residential School. I note that there are now 103 pupils in the school. The authorized pupilage for which we allow grant is 75. It would appear from a review of these two figures that the school must be overcrowded. Under the circumstances it is difficult for the Department to purchase new beds when they are simply going to be used for a large number of pupils who cannot be adequately accommodated and as a consequence other difficulties might arise owing to this condition existing in the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**FORM No. I.A. 506A**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Nov. 20 | EX'D. |        |\n\nWages of night watchman at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School for the month of NOVEMBER 1944:\n\n- Apr. 30: $40.00\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

The east wall - tile, brick and cement - has cracked badly in spots; no outside storm windows were put on, though inner French type windows were but these do not keep out the wintry gales. The foundation has no footings, so far as can be ascertained and as the building settles, the cracks in the wall become bigger.\n\nI took carpenter contractors over it, in company with the principal, recently.

The east wall - tile, brick and cement - has cracked badly in spots; no outside storm windows were put on, though inner French type windows were but these do not keep out the wintry gales. The foundation has no footings, so far as can be ascertained and as the building settles, the cracks in the wall become bigger.\n\nI took carpenter contractors over it, in company with the principal, recently.

PLOURDE, O.M.I.,\ndated November 9, 1945.\n\nOriginal on 104-2-11\n\nRe: Crowfoot Residential School\n\n5. The Principal is very much worried over fire hazards for the school and deprecates the ruling of the Department which pays the salary of the night watchman for the winter months only. He says that fire hazards exist at all times when the children are in school, and he would appreciate it if the Department would pay the salary for the whole year or at least for ten months, as it was done formerly. He also states that with $40.00 it is now impossible to secure the services of a first class man and he also desires that this be raised to $60.00 per month.\n\n6. The root cellar is very old and needs re-building completely. Would it be possible this year or early next year to have the sum of $1500.00 included in the estimates for this purpose?\n\n7. The school received two sewing machines from the Department but there are still three machines that ought to be replaced, immediately. You may judge of their age by the following serial numbers: G.1859599 - JA 532428 - IB34978. If at all possible, he wishes to have Tailor's instead of the ordinary house machines.\n\n8. The stable has not been painted for a very long time and really needs two coats of paint. Would the Department supply two gallons of black stain and twenty gallons of S.W.P. bright red. The school did receive last year ten gallons of paint with which the poultry house and the shop were painted. Moreover twenty gallons of white paint are also needed for general interior and exterior painting of the school. To the above should be added ten gallons of linseed oil, three gallons of turpentine and four paint brushes. It would also be very much appreciated if the Department could supply twenty-five gallons of liquid wax which could be used with great advantage in the classrooms and halls.\n\n9. The school itself, particularly the roof, has not been painted in several years and something should be done about it. The quantity of paint required for this job could be ascertained by writing the Agent. That is something which ought to be done early next year.\n\n10. The floors of the dormitories, of the girls' recreation room and of the refectory are all in very poor condition and must be replaced. In spots, the rough floor can be seen through the holes in the top floor.\n\n11. The tables and benches of the dining room have been in use since the school was built. They have been so often repaired that they hardly hold together. It is now\nproposed that the Department supply the material and that new tables and benches be made by the boys under their new teacher. In order to make the tables last longer it is suggested that linoleum be used as a top finish.\n\n12 - Linoleum is desired for several rooms particularly the Indians' parlor, the hall in the basement and that on the second floor leading to the Chapel.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOttawa, December 15, 1945.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nCrowfoot Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 ALLOTMENT 12-415 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

The cold water pipe is 2\" and the pressure satisfactory, but the pressure is negligible and the resistance considerable in the \u00bd in pipe; this resulted in a small flow of lukewarm water at the taps.\n\nThe Principal offered to install a larger pipe if supplied, and yesterday the required lengths and fittings of 1 inch pipe were secured from the local plumber at a cost of $44.33.\n\nReferring to your 104-2-5 dated Sept 6, 1945 authorizing $245.50 for repairs to structure and $110.00 for repairs and replacements of plant, the total expenditure to date has been $121.24. Building material was unobtainable and this represents the cost of storm windows. The jacket heater in use was cleaned and not replaced.

In view of the fact that these machines cannot be obtained in Alberta and that the Company has the modern type \"15-88-404\", with stool, at $56.10, would it not be possible to supply them instead of the ones originally ordered? Please note that these new machines have the reverse-stitch feature, which would be very useful in the school sewing-room.\n\nHoping that you will be in a position to acquiesce to Father Charron's request, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.O. Flourde, O.M.I.\nDear Sirs,\n\nRe Purchase order No. 5274\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 10th October 1945, we understand that on the 11th instant you advised the Principal of the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, Cluny, Alberta, that you could not supply the two- No. 127-3-404 sewing machines, but that you could supply your model No. 15-88-404, with stool at $56.10 each f.o.b. Calgary.\n\nAs these machines are urgently needed, it will be in order for you to supply the latter at a total cost of $112.20.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nThe Singer Sewing Machine Company,\n325-8th Ave. W.,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, January 24, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nRe: Purchase Order No. 5274.\n\nI enclose the copy of your memorandum of October 10th, 1945.\n\nApparently, the Singer Sewing Machine Company placed the business with their Calgary office which is located at 325 Eighth Avenue West, Calgary. Under date of letter dated January 11th, 1946, the Manager of that Branch wrote to the Principal of the Crowfoot Indian Residential School as follows:\n\n\"We are unable to supply 127-3-2 sewing machines, three of which have been ordered for our school by the Department of Mines and Resources, nor can they be obtained in Alberta.\n\nWe wish to suggest that you order the modern type, 15-88-404 with stool, at $56.10, or without stool at $50.95.\n\nThese machines are of a stronger design, have the reverse-stitch feature which is invaluable for darning, and many other improvements over the older 127-3-2 style\".\n\nIf the firm will not supply the machines mentioned in your memorandum from any of their branches, I suggest that you purchase type 15-88-404 with stool at $56.10 each.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Crowfoot Indian Res. School.\nYour File 104-2-5.\n\nAnswering yours of December 15/45, concerning root cellar and floors of this institution, the following materials will be needed:\n\n(1) For the root cellar:\n\n108 sacks cement,\n1 - 2x8-18,\n5 - 2x6-12,\n13 - 2x4-20,\n23 - 2x4-14,\n17 - 2x4-12,\n800' - 8\" Shiplap,\n2 only doors 13/8\" - 3x6'.\n\nTo this bill of material will be added necessary gravel which the Principal of the school agrees to get. Considerable of the lumber is needed for cribbing and can be used again. Low grade stuff will answer.\n\n(2) For Floors:\n\nThe principal asks that hardwood floors be laid in two dormitories, the girls recreation room and in the refractory. All these floors are in bad condition and should be replaced or covered with a good Battleship linoleum. The school authorities prefer the hardwood. The bill of material will be 8900' - 13/16\" Second grad Maple - 2\" face.\nThe sub floors in the dormitories and recreation room are good and the hardwood can be laid on them. As the present floor in the refactory is laid on cement, it would be used as sub flooring for the hardwood.\n\nNo table and bench material is required at present; the principal will make the existing ones do.\n\nG.

A. Charron, O.M.I. Principal, Crowfoot Indian Residential School, Cluny, Alberta.\n\nIn October we received a certified account for two singer sewing machines, style 127-3-40H, Purchase Order No. 5274, which is in order. On December 15th, we ordered three more sewing machines for the Crowfoot school, Purchase Order No. 7416.\n\nWe have received an account from the Singer sewing machine Company dated January 30th which also is Purchase Order No. 5274. This, I believe, is wrong. It should read No. 7416 and should also read three machines instead of two. However, I am sending this account to you since the account is not certified as to goods received. Please check this carefully and if you have received these two machines certify the account and send it to the Agent in order that he may send us a voucher for payment.\n\nA.J.

VINCENT,\n\nTwo sewing machines were purchased for the Crowfoot Residential school under Order No. 5274, dated September 4, 1945. These two machines were paid for on November 6, 1945.\n\nOn December 15th, 1945, we sent a requisition for three more sewing machines. These were purchased on December 27, 1945, Purchase Order No. 7416.\n\nWe have received an account from the Singer Sewing Machine Company, Calgary Branch dated January 30th, 1946 for two machines for the Crowfoot school. Purchase Order No. 5274. This probably should read 7416 and should be for three machines instead of two.\n\nI am sending you a copy of this account. I was just wondering if for some reason or other there has been a duplication. I am writing to the Principal of the school to make sure what machines he has received.\n\nA.J.

Pump at the Crowfoot Indian School Cluny.\n\nThis pump was installed but does not work satisfactory. As Father A. Charron was in to see me today, I may say that when this pump was under consideration no allowance was made to pump down to suction. The pump now installed will pump to suction. And when doing so the efficiency of the pump drops both in pressure and delivery. Under circumstances I am prepared to leave the pump now installed. To supply water for the School until another pump is put in its place.\n\nI would suggest that you cancel my contract. And re-open tenders. The Pump Father A Charron is asking for is a No. 15BP4 with a 1\u00bd H.P. Motor. Capacity 1250 U.S. Gals and 60 Lbs Pressure. To install this pump it is necessary to empty the reservoir and install a foot Valve.\n\nI may say that I wish to tender on this pump or any specified pump. As soon as I can obtain prices from the Factory and a proximate date of delivery. Thanking you for your consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL. Michael  \nGleichen  \nAlta.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources OTTAWA.\n\nReplying to yours of May 3rd last re MAPLE flooring for the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, I wish to advise that neither the Crown Lumber Co of Gleichen nor the Revelstoke Sawmill Co of Arrowwood is prepared to submit tenders for maple flooring at this time. There is none on hand and any coming in is booked for months ahead. The demand in Calgary alone is very heavy.\n\nHowever both Companies submit a price of $15.20 per M for 2\"x 13/16 second grade Maple flooring subject to change. This size is the most suitable for the floor at the School. Both Companies have promised to advise me immediately if any maple flooring is available within the next three months.\n\n[Signature]\nH.M.

Plourde, O.M.I.\nGleichen, July 19, 1946\n\nDept. Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI have your letter of June 28, File 104-2-5, with copy of Father Charron's letter, in regard to pump installed at Crowfoot School. Mr. L. Michael has also given me a copy of his letter to you, re this pump, dated June 25, 1946.\n\nThis matter was discussed fully with Mr. Michael and with Father Charron. Mr. Michael is satisfied that the pump installed is not suitable for the pressure required and regrets very much that he recommended this pump.\n\nHe now recommends a new type pump, described in his letter to you of June 25th; a Jacuzzi Pump, No. 15SP4, 1250 U.S. Gals. Capacity and with a 1\u00bd H.P. Motor.\n\nFor installing, and the use of the present pump until a new one is installed, Mr. Michael expects no payment whatever for his labor or material. His estimate on the recommended pump (No. 15SP4) is: Pump, $495.00; Installing, $15.00. To install this pump it is also necessary to empty the reservoir and install a foot valve at an additional cost of $47.00, making a total of $557.00.\n\nWe recommend that this offer be accepted and would ask you to please advise by Air Mail as it will take four or five weeks to secure the pump; there are none in store in Calgary.\n\nH.E.

Michael who supplied the pump ordered on the above requisition. Also enclosed is a letter from the Clerk in charge of the Crowfoot Agency.\n\nWe have not made any payment to Mr. Michael for the pump which he supplied. In this connection I would refer you to the second last paragraph of the Clerk's letter.\n\nI attach a requisition for a new pump that is required.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMO: Superintendent of Welfare and Training\n\nInvoice No. 4829, June 26, 1946 - $97.50\nInvoice No. 4830, June 28, 1946 - $74.00\nCrossland & Beale, Limited, Calgary, Alta.\n\nThe above noted accounts were paid on July 27, 1946 by cheque numbers 3539 and 2981 respectively.\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that the charge for $74.00 - 40 gals. of stain as per invoice 4830 is also charged in invoice No. 4829, and it is thought there may be duplication.\n\nIf a duplication of $74.00 has been made a refund of this amount in the name of the Receiver General of Canada is necessary.\n\nHM/G\n\nChief Treasury Officer\nMEMO: Superintendent of Welfare and Training\n\nAttenti\nOttawa, August 2, 1946.\n\nRev. S. Charron, O.M.I., Principal, Crowfoot Residential School,\nCluny, Alberta.\n\nWe have recently received two accounts from you as follows:\n\n1. Account dated June 28, 1946 - 40 gals. shingle paint $74.00\n2. \" \" \" \" - 40 gals. shingle stain $74.00\n   - 5 \" Prepared paint 25.18\n   - 5 \" Boiled oil 5.25\n\n$97.50\n\nDid you purchase eighty gallons of black shingle paint or did you forward a duplicate account. We have already issued cheques in payment of both accounts. The Auditor-General wants definite information regarding the quantity of shingle paint purchased, so as to make certain no duplicate payment is being made.\n\nBernard J. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nGlenchen, July 29, 1946\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources\nOTTAWA\n\nRe: Crowfoot School\n\nThe Principal of the above school has been fortunate in securing the services of painters who are now painting the large barn at this institution, as well as the roof and outside woodwork of the school proper. The material was supplied but no authority has yet been received for the labor which is estimated to amount to $600.00.\n\nAuthority is also required to purchase three urinals and two dozen wall basins at an estimated cost of $300.00 installed. These should be installed as soon as procurable.\n\nWould authority please be given to submit accounts to pay for the above. At the same time can information be given as to what other expenditures have been allowed for, if any, for the Crowfoot School in the present fiscal year.\n\nH.E. James,\nClerk-in-Charge.\nOttawa, August 6, 1946.\n\nMr. H. E. James,\nClerk in charge, Indian Agency Office,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the amount provided for repairs, etc., at the Crowfoot Residential School, I would point out that we purchased cement and lumber at a cost of $203.00. The new pump will cost $557.00 - see purchase order #12635 enclosed with this letter.\n\nWe do not appear to have received any previous correspondence regarding painting the barns. However, as the work has been started, we will allow the amount required for wages, namely, $600.00.\n\nIn view of the above expenditure, the amount provided for this school has been exceeded and consequently it will not be possible for us to consider any further expenditures for repairs and improvements during the current fiscal year.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F.

This well has been in use now for over ten years, according to the Principal, and the flow is diminishing rapidly. Besides this, the pipes are badly rusted and corroded.\n\nSupply of water has dropped rapidly during the last month and there is not now enough water to supply all demands, even with careful use. It is feared that the well is quitting, as all artesian wells do after a number of years, and if this is found to be true authority is hereby asked to drill another artesian well.\n\nIt is estimated here that we will have to drill 120 feet at a price of $1.75 per foot; besides this of course there will be the necessary casing.\n\nR.

Ragan, Clerk in Charge,\nGLEICHUN, Alta.\n\nWe have received your letter of the 3rd instant and are extremely sorry to learn that the Crowfoot School is having trouble with its water supply.\n\nPlease let me know the approximate location of where it is proposed to dig a new well. You should give the range and latitude.\n\nYou mentioned that the well will have to be drilled to a depth of 120 feet. What assurance have you that we will obtain water at that depth? We have had a number of unhappy experiences in endeavouring to obtain water on other reserves in southern Alberta and before proceeding we intend to submit the matter to the Surveys and Engineering branch with a view to obtaining the opinion of their water experts.\n\nPlease let me have the information requested in this letter by airmail.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReference your 104-2-5 (W.T. 1) of the 12th instant re the Crowfoot School water supply.\n\nThe proposed new well will be dug on the Southwest quarter of Section 32, Township 21, Range 21 West of the Fourth Meridian, approximately ten miles south of the 51st Latitude and east of the 114th Longitude.\n\nThe only assurance we have that water will be reached between the depths of 100 and 125 feet is that this is an artesian flowing well area and water has always been obtained at a depth less than 120 feet. In fact, flowing wells have been dug by hand as shallow as thirty feet. On the Crowfoot School grounds, however, it has been necessary to go to 100 feet.\n\nIt is just possible that the reduction in flow of the existing well is due to corroding and rusting pipe. Mr. Michael, our well expert, states however that it is likely any tampering with this pipe will stop the flow altogether - as artesian wells are peculiar in this respect. As soon as he can spare the time he has promised to go into this thoroughly to ascertain if the well can be saved. In the meantime, however, we thought it advisable to obtain authority to drill a new well, if this was found necessary, so that it could be done with as little delay as possible.\n\nR.D.

They have been pumping it steady all summer with apparently good results and it has cleared of sediment to a great extent.\n\nThe purposes of this letter is to fore-warn you of considerable more expense that is a pump and motor, pipe for the well and piping the same to cistern also a shelter over the pump, it will also entail cement sump for frost purposes. The reason that none of this work has been completed is on account that I did not want to go to unnecessary expense before the well had proved itself.\n\nI am not prepared to give a detail estimate but I am of the opinion by the time the pump and motor and necessary work is done it will run well over $500.00. I would ask you to keep this in mind when you deal with Crowfoot Indian School. Details will follow shortly.\n\nW. F. B.

It is difficult for the Department to\nunderstand why these sinks were replaced, apparently\nat the Department's expense, without authority\nhaving been given.\n\nWhile it is true that Miss McCready may\nhave recommended certain changes, authority for\nsuch changes can only come from the Department.\n\nBefore making any definite decision in\nthe matter, we will await another communication.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttention Mr. B. F. Neary, Supt of Welfare and Training.\n\nRe: Crowfoot School - Root House.\n\nReference to the above and your Purchase Order #10433, dated April 25, 1945. This Purchase Order originated out of your letter dated December 15, 1945, and Mr. Gooderham's reply thereto dated December 22, 1945. The material for the Root cellar was supplied in the sum of $201.76 from Crown Lumber Co., Gleichen, Alta.\n\nHowever in discussing the matter with the Principal of the School, Father Charron, he stated that he understood that the Department were going to pay for the labor for rebuilding the root house. However there does not appear to be any correspondence to that effect.\n\nIn checking over the present root house I find it in very poor condition and badly in need of replacement. In order to arrive at a conclusion I had qualified cement workers and carpenters go down to the school and check the root house over carefully.\n\nThe following is our findings:- that owing to two years more of deterioration more work and material is needed, the present entrance having caved in. Extra material required.\n\n- 42 sacs of cement,\n- 27 yards of gravel (will be supplied by school),\n- 250 ft. of Ship Lap,\n- 18 pieces of 2x4 - 12' long,\n- 12 \" 2x6 - 12' (Beams 2)\n- 4 \" 2x6 - 14' (Upright)\n\nHardware: - Nails, hinges, etc.\n\nApproximate cost of extra material: $125.00\n\nSkilled Cement and Carpenter Labor: Installing forms, taking out forms, building entrance to root house; Size of Root House 12 ft wide x 22 ft long x 7 ft high with cement roof: Approximate cost: $625.00\n\nThe above in addition to the material supplied on Purchase Order #10433. School to do all excavating and rough labor.\n\nI might remark that I am in no way responsible for this expenditure as it originated before I took over and an estimate of labor should have been made at the time.\n\nI would further say that the present root house is falling down and should be replaced somehow. Regret that it was not put into 1947/48 Estimates.\n\nYour reply by return mail would be appreciated.\n\nW. P. B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Res., Ottawa.\n\nAttention: Mr. B. F. Neary, Supt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRe: Crowfoot School - Boys' Entrance.\n\nI beg to report that the entrance to the Boys Cloak Room in the basement has always been through a window about 2'6\" x 3'6\" with 5 steps from the window to the floor of the cloak room. Apparently this has continued since 1937 when the new wing was erected. This direct entrance into the Boys' Cloak Room was made in order to avoid a long walk with muddy shoes through the main corridor in the basement - main entrance in the centre of the building and boys' cloak room and playground are in the east end of the building and east side.\n\nSince the window only gives half height to the door, I would suggest that the entrance be enlarged to full height door that a stairs be put into the boys' cloak room from the entrance.\n\nI would also point out that the foundation under the present window door exit has a very large crack endangering the east wall of the school.\n\nI would strongly recommend that this exit be made into a safe entrance for the boys and that the foundation be repaired at an estimate cost of $100.00.\n\nW. P. B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Well at Crowfoot Res. School.\n\nReference to my letter of July 30th last, I beg to ask for authority to now make the necessary installation of an Electric Pump, pump head, motor cylinder and pipes, and connecting same to the present water supply\u2014this new installation being an auxiliary supply of fairly soft water. The necessary frost pits and entrance to the same from school boiler room, concrete work, material and skilled labor supplied for $450.00. School to do necessary excavating. Pump installation complete with electrical work for $369.00\u2014total of $819.00.\n\nThe well has been continuously tested all summer and found good as to supply water, analysed\u2014found very good, only one exception a few grains of sand have shown up in every sample. We have had a borrowed pump installed all summer when this is taken out, through examination of this cylinder, we will ascertain if the sand is causing much wear and if the cylinder does show much wear, the above concrete plans will be reduced by approximately $200.00. The reason if the wear is shown from past experience the life of the well might be limited to 10 to 15 years.\n\nI would appreciate your authority by Air Mail.\n\nW. F. B.

However, in view of the expenses already made and the funds available we can only authorize the following at the present time:\n\n1. Repairs to boys entrance to the school $100.00\n2. Labour for digging frost pits and entrance to the same - concrete work etc. in connection with the new well $450.00\n3. We are also prepared to supply an electric pump but we are not certain from your letter if the estimate of $363.00 covers the cost of the pump as well as the installation. In any case we should have complete information regarding the type of pump required giving catalogue numbers so that the matter may be submitted to our Purchasing Branch.

I will deal with your letter as follows:\n\n1. Repairs to Boys entrance to the school $100.00 now underway. Should be completed by end of month\u2014weather permitting.\n2. Labor for digging frost pits and entrance to the same concrete work etc in connection with the new well $450.00. This work is now underway however I would point out that the school are doing all the digging. I only estimated for the skilled concrete labor and material.\n3. Re Electric Pump. I herewith enclose Estimate of L. Michael, Gleichen, Alta in the sum of $365.00. In this connection I would point out that he is quoting on a reconditioned second hand pump which is in excellent condition. I regretted that I did not point this out, as no new pumps are available either here or in Calgary. The Crowfoot School are supplying the motor, we are not able to purchase a motor of this size anywhere, and they had one available, that is the school. The pipe we are using in the well is second hand and will have to be replaced, we expect the new pipe available any day. I might say that we have been using the above pump on loan from Mr. Michael\u2019s all summer in testing the well. He will however recondition the pump before installing. This is an awkward explanation but just one of those things growing out of short supply, trusting the quotation is satisfactory.\n\nThe last paragraph of your letter, I have included the cost of rebuilding the Root house in the 1948-1949 Estimates.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.P.B.

James, Clerk-in-Charge, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 26th in which you refer to material required for the root cellar and floors for the Crowfoot Residential School, the Purchasing Branch advised me that they have been unable to obtain quotations for the 6,900 feet of second grade maple flooring.\n\nIf you can obtain any tenders for this flooring please secure same and forward to this office by air mail so that tenders may be submitted for the consideration of our Purchasing Branch.\n\n(signed) Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, November 27, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Requisition of April 2nd, 1946.\nYour memorandum of April 30th, 1946,\nfile 64443-15-2 Alta.\n\nOn requisition mentioned above we requested 6,900 ft. of maple flooring and in your memorandum of April 30th you authorized us to communicate with the Indian Agent to secure tenders.\n\nOn May 3rd, 1946, we wrote to the Clerk in Charge of the Agency and I enclose a copy of that letter. We heard nothing further about the matter until we received Indian Agent Pugh's letter of September 25th, 1947, a copy of which I enclose. We replied on October 7th, 1947, and I also enclose copy of this letter. I also enclose copy of the Agent's letter of October 11th and our reply of October 14th, 1947.\n\nYou will note that the school management is providing the necessary labour to install the new floors without cost to the Department. I also submit the account which we have received amounting to $1,441.70.\n\nYou will note that the principal could have obtained maple flooring but preferred the oak flooring and has paid the difference in price, namely $545.59.\n\nCrowfoot is a Government-owned school and apparently the floors have been in very bad condition. We would appreciate it if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. Coding is as follows: 516-752-10-691.\n\nBernard F.

Rossy, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttached hereto you will find a copy of a letter from Mr. R. D. Hagan, Superintendent of the Blood Indian Agency, in answer to a letter which was sent out from this office regarding surplus government buildings, and particularly regarding certain buildings located at the R.C.A.F. Training Center near Macleod.\n\nMr. Hagan has suggested, as you will note, that two Link Trainer buildings from the Macleod and Peaceau stations be moved on to the Blood Reserve as additional classrooms at the two residential schools. I recently inspected these buildings, and I am satisfied they would answer the purpose very well for some years, if they were not dismantled and set up again.\n\nMr. Hagan had an experienced contractor, Mr. Kaufman, who has moved similar buildings from the stations for the P.E.I.R.A. and other concerns, examine them. This gentleman states that he could move them in the winter time across the river.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the only time he could move them is during the winter months, as they are too large to cross ordinary bridges and must be taken over when the ice is strong.\n\nIf these buildings are still available and it was agreed that it was good business to move them to the schools, the cost is a plus item in the Education Vote, is it not? I recommend they be secured, if available, and moved.\n\nRegarding Building No. 12, Recreation Center, Macleod, it should be noted that this building be located, if at all possible, near the school hall. The Bloods have no hall, and this building needed not only as a social center but also for meetings. The Band fund is small, and I believe that the cost of moving this building should be charged against Welfare Account. All expenses could end and would be, I am sure, borne by ourselves.\n\nIf authority was given to Mr. Hagan, this building could be moved intact and placed on a suitable site near the agency headquarters.\nCareful consideration has been given to the moving of all of these buildings during the winter months across the river, before submitting the request that they be requisitioned. It is hoped they are still available, and that you will agree that they are a valuable asset to the Blood Reserve, and will act promptly to try to secure them.\n\nG. H.

Neary Esq., Supt. of Education.\n\nRe Crowfoot School - Repairs.\n\nReference to your letter of June 4th last I beg to report that I have consulted with Father Charron in regards to the above and your letter and considered the Estimates as prepared last year and would ask for authority as follows:\n\n1. Rebuilding of Root House.\n   Material for this work was purchased last year, no doubt there will be some unforeseen or extras - these are hard to requisition for but I expect the sum estimated for last year will be sufficient:\n   Skilled labor for Cement & Carpenter work - $650.00\n   $750.00\n\n2. Replace flooring in dairy barn - approximately 1500 ft of 2\" planking (750 square feet) 2\"x10\"x14 ft (fir)\n   @ $110.00 per m approximately - $150.00\n   (requisition attached)\n\nIn regards to general repairs, the fire bricks in the heating boiler have to be recemented and some replaced. A skilled man in Cluny, Alberta Mr. Davenport has done this same work previously, so I have asked him to again do this job. At the same time we are also going to endeavor to repair the front of the heating boiler.\n\nWhen the above repairs have been completed, it will be possible then to have an idea if enough money will be available to consider Item No. 3. of 1948 Estimates.\n\nI can assure you that repairs will be given close surveillance.\n\nW.P.B.

Your voucher 667 shows that the material cost slightly over $200.00.\n\nIf we had been informed that the material would amount to the sum just mentioned, we would have insisted that you forward a requisition so that the order could be placed through our Purchasing Branch.

Henry\n\nRE: Crowfoot Root House\n\nReference your letter of Nov. 30, I beg to report that I have a lot of explaining to do in this connection so far, that owing to heavy drainage water conditions last spring which totally inundated the old Root House at the Crowfoot School. Father Charron was prepared to do the excavating for the Root house in a new location. I informed him that the expenditure would have to be kept around $750.00. This meant that the skilled labour would have to be cut about one half, but more materials would be required. I regret that I miss used your letter of authority in making local purchase of materials and not Requisitioning for same. Father Charron had a supply of material on hand, which we used some of rather than purchase from Crown Lumber at Gleichen 10 miles away from the job, and I am attaching hereto, Voucher 781 in payment of same, in favour of Father Charron.\n\nMy records show the total cost of the Concrete Root House charged to our Branch, size 12 x 24 inside measurements, is approximately $765.00. Father Charron paid for the excavation over\nin the sum of $260.00, supplied 75 yds of gravel at $2.60 per yard. His own men put in 176 hours of labour. He also electrically wired the Root House at his own expense.\n\nI am sure this Root House will last longer than any of us who are now in the service, where if we had repaired the old Root House, we would have had very little satisfaction and a repeat job in a few years.\n\nI appear to be transgressing the purchase Regulations but I assure you without intention and they have been cases of expediency.\n\nW.E.B.

Foamite fire extinguishers (new)\nRequires 9 - 2\u00bd gallon Model C.A. Foamite fire extinguishers\n\nThere are 2 #2 Vaporizing Liquid fire extinguishers on the premises and these are corroded through the outer shell and leaking badly, therefore are of no further use.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nNo. of new extinguishers recommended - 6 2\u00bd gallon Model C.A. Foamite fire extinguishers\n\nPrice $25.50 each f.o.b. Toronto less Sales Tax\n\nWe would appreciate delivering any new extinguishers ordered from our Calgary stock at the Toronto price plus freight.\n\nWe will be pleased to do the necessary recharging work at this school at the same time as we do your annual recharging at the Gleichen Indian Hospital.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLA FRANCE FIRE ENGINE & FOAMITE LTD.\n\nPerf.

Father Charron was prepared to do the excavating for the Root House in a new location. I informed him that the expenditure would have to be kept around $750.00. This meant that the skilled labour would have to be cut about one half, but more materials would be required. I regret that I miss used your letter of authority in making local purchase of materials and not Requisitioning for same. Father Charron had a supply of material on hand, which we used some of rather than purchase from Crown Lumber at Gleichen 10 miles away from the job, and I am attaching hereto, Voucher 781 in payment of same, in favour of Father Charron.\n\nMy records show the total cost of the Concrete Root House charged to our Branch, size 12 x 24 inside measurements, is approximately $765.00.

Charron has already purchased in the fall of 1947 and installed in the school windows in January 1948. These windows had been purchased from the Crown Lumber Company, Gleichen, Alberta, and delivered to the Crowfoot School, Cluny, Alberta.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith prices which Father Charron obtained and I would appreciate your authority to submit the invoice for same.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh\nSuperintendent\nAugust 23rd, 1949.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nRe: Crowfoot Indian Residential School\n\nReference your 104-4-2 of August 10th.\n\nI presume from your letter that Father Charron purchased these windows and now wants the Department to pay for them. This is not possible, as the Purchasing Agent cannot issue a purchase Order for goods delivered in 1947.\n\nWe do not understand the tenders from the Revelstoke Sawmill Co., Ltd., and Chinook Building Supplies, Ltd. These are dated August 2nd, 1949. Are they for additional storm sash required?\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRE: Crowfoot Indian School Storm Sashes\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of August 23rd last stating that owing to the fact Father Charron had purchased the storm sashes in 1947 you did not see your way clear to reimburse same. While the procedure of asking to have him reimbursed for the amount of the storm windows is strictly out of the usual procedure, I would ask you to kindly reconsider as the storm windows he put on the school made a vast difference to his heating bill in so far as a number of his windows and frames particularly are in poor condition, the storm windows have been of great assistance in this connection. We will be faced sooner or later with renewing a number of window frames.\n\nReference to the last paragraph of your letter, the tenders enclosed from Revelstoke Sawmill Company, Chinook Sawmill Building Supply Limited more as a proof that the price given by the Crown Lumber Company was in order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.P.B.

Accordingly we wired them that if the oven was not needed, it could be shipped to the Crowfoot School, as we were not aware that it was too large for that school. The Superintendent, however, neglected to advise us of the shipment.\n\nIt is hoped that the oven will be suitable for the Blood R.C.

P. R. at Cluny, the oven and large size dough mixer to the Principal of the Roman Catholic School at Cardston. When it leaves Cluny there will be $188.93 freight plus $5.65 storage charges, a total of $194.48. It appears that there was also shipped in a separate shipment, Bill of Lading reading \"one piece baking oven crated,\" when Father Charron was transferring this piece from one car to the car in which the baking oven was in, it was discovered that this second piece is a brand new dough mixer. Father Charron has no use for it, so I undertook to ship it on to you.\n\nEnclosed original Bill of Lading. Trust the oven is satisfactory for your purposes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. P. B.

Plasterers are difficult to obtain near the school which is situated at Cluny, Alberta but can be obtained from Calgary.\n\nWe have need of a replacement of eight hundred square yards of plaster which costs seventy-five cents a square yard for labour or an amount of $600.00.\n\nThere are two plasterers available:\n\n1. Mr. E. Jager, 2401-28th Street West, Calgary, Alta.,\n2. Mr. D.P. Evans, 1022-12th Ave. West, Calgary, Alta.,\n\nCould you please advise the plasterer who should be given preference for this project and your approval for an expenditure of $600.00 for this work.\n\nActing Director.\nGLEICHEN ALTA 31\nSUPT OF EDUCATION 865\nINDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA\nRE CROWFOOT SCHOOL MY LETTER JULY FIFTEEN PLASTERERS ADVISE MAY USE\nEVANS OR JAGER STOP YOUR LETTER TWENTY SEVEN JUNE NO INDIAN LABOR\nFOR PAINTING COULD USE OUTSIDE PAINTERS ADVISE\n\nW P B HUGH\nOttawa, August 1st, 1950.\n\nMr. W.P.B.

They were unanimous in endorsing the scheme and authorized me to continue negotiations with the Department in view of making the change. The Board is agreeable to giving up the site at Red Deer and the ranch at Morley towards helping the scheme financially. Of course it is understood in doing so that the interests of our educational work at Morley shall stand on its own merits and that this sale of the ranch will in no way prejudice our educational interests in Southern Alberta. I hope that the Department will find the Red Deer farm may be purchased by the military authorities for work that they require in caring for our returned soldiers.\n\nAs soon as I return to Brandon I will communicate with your commissioner, Mr. Graham, and try to arrange for a suitable date to accompany him to Edmonton to look over all prospective sites.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTF/M\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esquire,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have just returned from Alberta. While there I attended the Conference. The situation at Red Deer Institute has reached a crisis and the question of changing the site to Edmonton must be decided in the near future. This was the unanimous conviction of a committee appointed to look into the situation. Dr. Endicott, Secretary of the Foreign Department of our Mission Board and myself were appointed to interview the Minister of Indian Affairs. Dr. Chown would have been on this committee had it been possible for him to attend. As he is going to Newfoundland this was not possible until after the 10th of July. The date that will suit Dr. Endicott and myself would be Friday, the 20th or Monday the 23rd. Would it be possible for you to arrange for us to meet the Minister on either of those dates? You will understand that I am assuming that you will be present too at the interview. This of course from my point of view is a necessity. Address your reply to me at the Methodist Conference, Winnipeg, and if the strike is still on it might be well to send a copy to Brandon so that I would be sure to receive it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nSince writing you yesterday, we have a date to meet the Minister's friend that Monday 23rd or Tuesday 24th. Will visit either then Friday 20th. If possible arrange for 23rd or 24th. You would confer a favor by wire message in reply. G. Methodist Conf.\n\nWinnipeg. Dr. Essdell will be at the Conf.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nMemorandum\n\nHonourable Mr. Meighen,\n\nI am in receipt of a communication from Rev. Dr. Ferrier, of Brandon, Man., in which he states that he and Dr. Endicott, Secretary of the Foreign Department of the Mission Board of the Methodist Church, are very anxious to see you, and that either Monday the 23rd or Tuesday the 24th of June would be convenient for them to be here. They desire to discuss questions concerning the future of Indian schools in which they are interested. I would be glad to know if you could see them on either of the above dates that I may inform Rev. Mr. Ferrier.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJune 11, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communications of the 4th and 5th of June, with reference to the desire of yourself and Dr. Endicott to have a conference with the Hon. Mr. Meighen, regarding questions concerning the future of the Indian schools in which you are interested. In reply I beg to say that the Minister expects to be here on Monday, the 23rd, and Tuesday, the 24th of June, but, as you will, of course, understand he is extremely occupied and his time is pretty fully taken up. He wishes, however, that you will see me first, and, after that, if it is deemed necessary, he will grant you an interview.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education received a communication from Rev. Joseph Woodsworth, Principal of the Red Deer Institute, re the financial situation, number of pupils in attendance and other matters of vital importance in connection with the Red Deer Institute. On account of the crisis that has been reached in connection with the work at Red Deer, it was thought advisable to have a conference of a few who were directly interested and Mr. Woodsworth. This was done at the Alberta Conference in Calgary. Mr. Woodsworth presented the case to the following and his presentation is herewith appended.\n\nRev. S. D. Chown, D.D., General Secretary of Foreign Missions,\nand the following Superintendents - Rev. T. C. Buchanan, D.D., Rev. Thos. Powell, Rev. Arthur Banner and Rev. T. Ferrier, and the Hon. W. H. Cushing. After hearing Mr. Woodsworth's presentation of the case the opinion prevailed that our educational work for our Indian people in Northern Alberta would be better served by changing the site from Red Deer to Edmonton. As a result of this Conference the Secretary of the Foreign Department and the Superintendent of Indian Education on June 23rd interviewed Mr. Dunham C. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. Mr. Scott received us very cordially and sympathetically. He concurred in our presentation of the case and is in hearty sympathy with the proposed change of site from RED DEER to EDMONTON, but pointed out that no money could be secured by Vote of Parliament at its present session in as much as the estimates and supplementary estimates were all completed and Parliament would be closing in a few days. He, however, assured us that he had $60,000 in the Supplementary Estimates and if passed by Parliament would be at the disposal of the Methodist Church and that we as representatives of the Church would be at liberty as far as the Government was concerned to say in what direction and for why\npurpose this $60,000 should be used. Its present proposal is that it should be used for small buildings required at Mancey, Brandon, Norway House, Coqualeetza and some Day Schools on Reserves. All of which are greatly needed. At the same time we are of the opinion that the general interests of our entire work would be better served by the expenditure of this $60,000 for our educational work this year in making the change from Red Deer to Edmonton assure. If we decided to expend it in the purchase of a site and the commencement of a building in Edmonton, Mr. Scott would heartily recommend the expenditure of this $60,000 as we suggested, to the Minister. It being understood that the Minister must give his sanction to the whole scheme.\n\nWe also discussed the property at MOREY which consists of some fifteen hundred acres of ranching land upon which the Methodist Church erected the McDougall Orphanage some thirty years ago. There is also a building that has been used for class room purposes. The other outbuildings are not of much value. This land is owned by the Government. There is also a section and three-quarters of land in connection with the Red Deer Institute. We proposed that both of these properties should be sold and that the Methodist Church should receive credit for the same and the proceeds be put into the new plant at Edmonton. Mr. Scott assured us that this would have to meet the approval of Parliament but that he would strongly recommend that this be done.\n\nWe recommended to Mr. Scott that a Commission consisting of representatives from the Indian Department and of the Methodist Church visit the following Reserves - HOBENA, WHITE FISH LAKE, GOOD FISH LAKE, SADDLE LAKE, WHITE WHALE LAKE. These form a Constituency that would be served by a school situated in Edmonton, Edmonton being geographically in the centre.\nAnd, that this Commission secure if possible the endorsement of the Indian people through their Councils and others interested, to the proposed new school and a written promise that they will support the school if built in the vicinity of Edmonton.\n\nAnd, that this Commission further be instructed and empowered to select the new site. This received the approval of Mr. Scott.\n\nFrom the representations made by Mr. Woodsworth, the principal of Red Deer School, we recommend that the school be closed with the dismissal of the children for holidays. We also recommend that if there are orphan children who have no place to go that they be transferred to Brandon until the new school is built. Mr. Scott assures us that this will meet with the approval of the Department and that the Department will pay the cost of transportation. We also recommend that Mr. Woodsworth keep the farm going and retain such members of the staff as will be required to gather and secure the harvest and that he spend all the time possible during the Conference year in visiting the reserves for the purpose of popularising the scheme with the Indians as much as possible.\n\nALL OF WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED.\nDear Doctor Endicott:\n\nThe following is the statement or report which you requested me to send to you. There are a number of angles from which the problem may be approached. I shall try to present them all, and relate them to the main issue. They may be taken up under the following heads:\n\n(a) The Red Deer problem past, and present.\n(b) Attendance.\n(c) Plant.\n(d) The Edmonton proposition.\n(e) Financial.\n(f) Temporary closing of the school.\n\nThe problem we are at present facing in regard to the future of the Red Deer Industrial Institute is by no means a matter of recent growth. It is the result of the development of events of years past. Things have now reached a climax. For a number of years workers among the Indians of Alberta have realized that this school has not been fulfilling its function as an educational institution for the Indians. In the FIRST place it has acquired a bad name among the Indians through years of mismanagement. Second it has been in the wrong place from the first, being too far from the homes of the Indian and more than once the lack of pupils has been a menace to the prosperity of the Institute. About ten years ago a special commission recommended that the school be closed, and boarding schools be established on the reserves. On the strength of this recommendation, which to the Indian amounted to a promise, the Red Deer school was filled to its capacity. Seven years ago the school reached its maximum attendance. At this time Mr. Barrer resigned as principal when he found it impossible to carry out his program, and I was appointed in his place and carried out the Industrial School plans. For a time, in hopes that the Boarding Schools might yet be established on the reserves, the Indians continued to send their children, and for two years a splendid attendance was maintained. However at the end of this time the Government definitely rejected the proposals of the Mission Board and decided to continue the old policy. As soon as this was known to the Methodist Indians of Alberta, a meeting was held at Hobema at which it was decided to boycott the Red Deer School.\n\nATTENDANCE.\n\nFor two years following this decision not a single child was admitted to the Institute. Since then a few have come in but many of the have come under compulsion. At the end of June 1919 we shall have but forty children in residence at the school. It will thus be seen that the\nboycott has been effective, and that in spite of every effort to maintain the attendance. The result of this reduced enrolment makes further operations most difficult and with little hope of improvement. This applies particularly to the household work where next year there will be only twelve girls old and young to do the work of the institution. Under our present system this will be almost impossible.\n\nBUILDINGS - In connection with the problem of policy and attendance has been the matter of plant. For a good many years it has been a recognized fact that the buildings have been entirely insufficient for the requirements of the institution. Only sufficient has been spent year by year to keep them from falling to pieces. Of course during the war we realized that extensive repairs were impossible and the principal of your school all during this time of tension refrained from making requests for repairs or buildings other than were absolutely necessary. This policy was followed regarding expenditure by both Government and Church. Lack of accommodation in various ways has now become a decided hindrance to our work. The buildings are in such a condition, and the whole plant so dilapidated that it seriously affects the morale of our school life, and enormously increases the difficulty of operation. And not only has it retarded our work but the General Board today is paying hundreds if not thousands of dollars because of this condition of the Government plant.\n\nWith the closing of the war and the necessity and probability of extensive changes the question of future policy again arose. I felt that in view of the past failure of Red Deer in attendance, location, and appeal to the Indian, it was questionable if it was right for the Missionary Society to allow the Indian Department to put large sums of money into this plant without first a clear understanding of the whole situation. It must be understood that to make the plant at all suitable to the management, not only must the main buildings be entirely rebuilt but the whole arrangements of outbuildings and stables must be taken into consideration. Then came the thought; even though the Government gives us a modern plant we will be no nearer our end in serving the Indian. The school will still be a drag, largely because of its position, the increasing protest from the Indian is \"it is too far to send our children\".\n\nTHE EDMONTON PROPOSITION\n\nWith this came an idea for a solution of the problem, at least in part, namely, transferring the institution to Edmonton. This move would place the school almost exactly in the centre of our Indian Constituency and bring us more intimately in touch with them. The proposition met with hearty approval by all who were interested including the General Board, and the Department. Since making the suggestion, Mr. Perrier and I have made selections of possible sites near Edmonton, and negotiations are in progress to make purchase of land and complete arrangements with the Government.\n\nTHE IMMEDIATE CLOSING OF RED DEER -\n\nSince making the above suggestion, matters of finance, attendance staff, and policy, has become so acute, that I felt that immediate action must be taken to meet the situation. With this in view I recommended that the school be closed 30th June 1919 to be reopened as soon as possible in Edmonton. My reasons for this suggestion are as follows:\nFinancial - It will save the Missionary Society about $10,000.00.\n\n(2) It will give me, as principal, an opportunity of doing valuable work on the reserves in the interests of the school doing the interim. It will also enable me to give attention to the closing of this school (which is not a small task) and also be on hand to keep in close touch with the establishing of the new institution in Edmonton.\n\n(3) If we close immediately we shall retain the initiative in regard to the guidance of school affairs. Otherwise this initiative will pass from our hands to that of the Indians, and this is not desirable. This last reason seems to me to be the strongest of all. Not even a large money grant would suffice to take the place of loss of initiative. I cannot emphasize this point too strongly in its application to this problem. To me, looking at it from every standpoint, we will gain much by closing at once. This school has had its day and without further blinking at facts we should insist upon new and proper conditions in operating our school.\n\nFINANCIAL - At the end of June 1919 we shall have a deficit of about $5000.00 which the Missionary Society will have to meet in some way. Besides this, this institution, if it is operated next year will cost the Missionary Society between six and seven thousand dollars. If the school is closed nearly this entire amount of between ten and twelve thousand dollars will be saved.\n\nThis in brief is the position of the school both past and present. There are so many phases of the question that are familiar to me that it is somewhat difficult to present them in a formal manner and in their proper light and relationship. However this short statement may be of value to you.\n\nAs principal now, for six and a half years, I have watched developments very closely, and have endeavored to deal with problems as they presented themselves. I believe that with my experience behind me I have a pretty fair grasp of the essential needs of this institution and of our Indian work in Alberta. From time to time I have advised the authorities both Church and Government of the conditions which exist so that the present situation is not new. I have been planning for the new school in Edmonton and am ready to go into this new scheme with energy and enthusiasm. If in dealing with these matters you require further information or detail or my presence, I shall be glad to serve the Missionary Society in the interests of the Indian.\n\nJ. F. WOODSWORTH.\nThe Executive at its last meeting appointed the Foreign Secretary and the Superintendent of Indian Education as a Committee to form a basis upon which we would take over the management from the Government of the hospital at Norway House. After interviewing Mr. Scott, the Deputy Superintendent General we are of the opinion that in as much as the Government is willing to assume the entire financial obligation, we recommend that this proposition should be deferred.\nJune 26th, 1919.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott;-\n\nI enclose you a copy of the Report that Dr. Endicott and I are submitting to our Board re the general situation at Red Deer and the change of site to Edmonton, including our Conference with you. I also enclose our recommendation re Norway House Hospital. These reports are accompanied by a statement that Mr. Woodsworth sent to Dr. Endicott on June 5th. You will understand that this communication is just as Dr. Endicott and I understand the situation up to the present. I trust it conveys a correct report of the interview we had with you. It is at least as we understood it.\n\nThanking you for the courtesy we received from you in connection with this whole matter,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Kerrison\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been informed by Rev. Mr. Woodsworth, principal of the Red Deer Institute that he has sent the children home on holiday and he wishes to be instructed re the closing of the school with a view of dropping the work until the plant is completed on a new site at Edmonton. I would like to receive the instructions of the Department confirming such a move before advising Mr. Woodsworth.\n\nIn the report made by Dr. Endicott, Foreign Secretary and myself we suggested that a commission be appointed representing the Methodist Church and the Indian Department to visit the Reserves that form the constituency and also to select a site in the vicinity of Edmonton. I would suggest that this commission meet in Edmonton during the first week of September. Would the Department make arrangements with this in view?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Mr. Meighen -\n\nIn 1892 the Red Deer Industrial school was established at Red Deer, Alberta, and has been conducted since that time under the auspices of the Methodist Church. There are 1140 acres of land in connection with the institution. This school was designed to take care of the Methodist pupilage in the northern part of the provinces of Alberta - the Bobbema, Edmonton and Laddie Lake Agencies. The school has not prospered as it should, due principally to two facts: first, its location is too far distant from the recruiting grounds, second, mismanagement in periods on the part of the church authorities.\n\nSome two years' ago the Methodist Church had under consideration the question of closing the school and establishing some smaller boarding schools adjacent to the reserves from which they draw their largest number of pupils. This scheme, however, was never carried out.\n\nThe buildings are all in a dilapidated condition and previous to the war we had under consideration the erection of new buildings or extensive repairs to the existing ones. The Church, however, now represents that it is impossible for them to continue the work on the present location and they wish to remove to a site near the city of Edmonton, which would be almost in the centre of their constituency. The establishment of a new school in this location will entail a large expenditure in the purchase of land, the price of which in the vicinity of Edmonton is very high, and in the erection of modern buildings.\n\nThe proposal of the church is that the Indian agencies above referred to should be canvassed with a view to securing the support of the Indians to the proposition, by way of a definite promise to send their children to the school, and that the Department should dispose of the Red Deer property and also the property in connection with the old McDougall Orphanage at Morley on the Stony Reserve, purchase a new site this year and proceed with the erection of the buildings at as early a date as possible.\n\nThe matter has been discussed with me by the representatives of the Methodist Church, and I wish now to lay the proposal before you. I am not yet convinced of the advisability of embarking on this scheme, I think the matter should be very carefully considered. The suggestion has been made that an informal commission, on which the Department would be represented, should meet at Edmonton during the first week in September. This, I think, would be the proper course to take and I would propose to have Mr. Graham represent the Department. In passing I may mention that Mr. Graham is disposed to favour the removal to the vicinity of Edmonton. We must not, however, take any preliminary steps that would involve us in any obligation until fully satisfied as to the merits of the proposition. At the same time the\nmatter is one of grave importance to the church.\n\nWith your approval I shall arrange for the meeting of this commission at a date that will be convenient to Mr. Graham.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJuly 31st, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nYour letter of the 11th July suggesting the appointment of a commission to consider the Red Deer industrial school problem has been brought to my attention. I have already submitted this matter to the Minister for his consideration and expect a decision within a few days.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Z. Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nAugust 6, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Graham -\n\nReferring to the proposed change in the site of the industrial school from Red Deer to Edmonton, I recently received a letter from Mr. Ferrier in which he stated that he wished a commission appointed representing the Methodist Church and the Department to visit the reserves that form the constituency of the school, and also to select a site in the vicinity of Edmonton. It was suggested that this commission should meet at Edmonton during the first week of September. I immediately placed the whole matter before the Minister suggesting that you should represent the Department on this commission, and that it should meet at a date that would be convenient to you. In a brief way I laid before the Minister the reasons submitted by the church why a change in the location of the school should be made, and in reply he stated that he had no objections to your meeting the authorities of the Methodist Church, but that he was not disposed to favour the project at present, and that he wished you to be so informed.\n\nI myself am not fully convinced of the need and desirability of embarking upon the large expenditure that would be entailed to institute a new school at Edmonton, but it is advisable to hear all representations that can be made by the church, and also to obtain your views after you have had an opportunity of carefully considering the matter. The question will then be presented to the Minister for his further consideration. You will no doubt hear from Mr. Ferrier in the near future, and I hope you will be able to spare the time to look into the question with the committee selected by the Church authorities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nAugust 6, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier -\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 11th ultimo, regarding the commission to consider the Red Deer School problem, I beg to state that it is considered advisable that you should confer with Mr. Commissioner Graham at Regina, who will represent the Department and fix a date suitable to him and the members of your committee. I am writing Mr. Graham today on the subject.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOctober 8th, 1919.\n\nHon. Mr. Meighen -\n\nI beg to submit herewith a report received from Commissioner Graham dated 19th September on the project of removing the industrial school conducted by the Methodist Church at present located at Red Deer to a location to be chosen at Edmonton. In this connection I would refer you to my memorandum of July 5th last and to letter to Commissioner Graham of August 6th. In the letter you will note that I followed your directions and informed Mr. Graham you were not disposed to favour the project at present. Notwithstanding that fact Mr. Graham has reported in favour of the change.\n\nHe condemns unreservedly the buildings at Red Deer and says they are simply unfit for habitation. He states that there is no doubt in his mind that Edmonton is the proper place for an industrial school and not Red Deer, and he finds the property which had been selected by the Church authorities, and upon which they have an option, is admirably adapted for the purposes of the school.\n\nI am now pleased to recommend that the change take place in the interests of this institution, and would propose to purchase the property from funds provided by Parliament for the educational work of the Methodist Church among the Indians. It will probably cost us \u00a370,000.00 to erect a new building; but as against the total outlay, both for land and buildings, we have assets that will be worth at least \u00a350,000.00. We own 1,300 acres near the Stony Reserve, Morley for which we have been offered \u00a318.00 an acre, and we ought to get at least \u00a340,000.00 out of the Red Deer property. I would like your authority to investigate the title to this property and proceed with its purchase if that is satisfactory. The option expires on the 15th inst.\n\nDuncan Scott\nDeputy Superintendent-General.\nour children are better out of doors than in school.\"\n\nI have wired you several times regarding the Edmonton proposition. I also wired the Minister. The situation is very critical. It would be a great pity to miss the opportunity of buying the land in question. I have been sending and receiving wire messages from Edmonton daily holding the option for a few days longer. If the decision is not made today I am afraid that Monday will be too late. A larger offer is being made for the land. No mistake can be made by the Department in purchasing this land, and if we let this opportunity pass I do not think that any suitable site can be purchased for less than one hundred dollars an acre.\n\nI trust the whole matter will be settled today.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI enclose you a paper clipping from Cochrane, Alberta. Mr. Miller has evidently succeeded in growing a garden at Morley. I also give you a quotation from his letter regarding the attendance at school. If this is a correct interpretation of the situation something ought to be done by the Department to compel the children to attend school.\n\n\"Miss Court has, during the last week, kept the Indian school open for business; but has yet to see the first pupil and this in spite of the fact that several of the parents had promised me to send their children. Miss Court too is much liked by the Indian children and Mrs. Stocken, the clerk's wife who was for many years a teacher in Indian schools declares that the children made great progress under her instruction. In trying to find out the cause of the non-attendance I have at last got the right clue I believe. An Indian put it to me like this:\n\nHe said, 'For many years we have always had two stores here, and the competition kept the prices down. Last year one of the stores was closed to make a place for the school. Since that every time we go to the store we find things are dearer than before. We don't like this and want to have two stores again. But while the school is running there is no place for another store. We would sooner have another store than a school.

Thompson Ferrier Tells of Methodist Church Educational Work\n\nRev. Thompson Ferrier, superintendent of Indian Missions for the Methodist church of Canada, who occupied the pulpit at the First Methodist Church on Sunday morning has left the city for Regina where he will spend several days on the good work of supervising and directing the educational work among the Indians of that province. Before leaving Edmonton Mr. Ferrier was interviewed by The Edmonton Journal and gave interesting facts regarding the educational work being done among the Indians by the Methodist church among the Indians of the prairies.\n\nThe interest which has been shown in the program in Alberta and with particular reference to the Alberta Institute just north of the city a bright outlook was prophesied for the future work among the prairie Indians.\n\nHave Waiting List\n\n\"The educational work in British Columbia and in Ontario is much more advanced than that now being done among the Indian people than on the prairies,\" said Mr. Ferrier. \"In the schools conducted in the two provinces mentioned we have a waiting list which has not been the experience in the case of the residential schools conducted on the prairies.\n\nThe education of the Indian boys and girls, on the whole, is very encouraging. Many of them proving themselves to be good citizens and contributing to the state. About 5,000 young Indians from the various schools and reserves being overseas, the group held gave an excellent account of themselves. Forty seven of these are buried abroad and ten of these are \"buried where the poppy grows.\"\n\nMr. Ferrier makes his headquarters at Brandon, Manitoba, but during the course of his duties is called upon to visit all parts of Canada. Next Monday he goes to the Queen Charlotte Islands and on the following Sunday at Fort Smith, he will turn his face once more eastward, reaching Ottawa somewhere around February first.\n\nNew Era Appears\n\nWith the opening of the new Edmonton Institute a new era appears to open in the work of the Methodist church among the Indians of this province, according to the superintendent. The institute covers a tract of 825 acres, which was purchased for $16,000. It will be used for the splendid new $100,000 school, which will serve as a center for the province and is expected to look after the wants of the province in this direction for a long time to come.\n\n\"Indian boys and girls will come to the institute from the missions and reserves at Holeson, Duffield, \"Pine Lake, Red Deer, Fish Lake, Saddle Lake and other places,\" said Mr. Ferrier. \"There will be accommoda- tion for about 135 children and staff of twelve teachers. The boys are kept at the age of seven and are kept until they are eighteen. The girls are kept until they are fifteen years of age while the boys are taught farming, mechanics, carpentry, etc., and the care of all kinds of stock. In addition to the regular school work, religious instruction is given. The half day system is followed in the institute and here, the children spend half a day in the class room and half a day in one of the practical branches.\n\nPurchase of Hume Farm\n\nMr. Ferrier stated he was particularly well satisfied with the purchase of the Hume farm. He stated that a large number of farms had been purchased recently and that many had arrived to buy the Hume acreage. Located as it is part way between Edmonton and Athabasca, and close proximity to the Sturgeon river with its abundant water power running through the property, its location is an ideal one.\n10336 - 121 Street\nEdmonton, Alta.\nApril 10/20.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn view of the fact that the Red Deer Industrial School has been closed and operations here commenced, and also that I have moved to this city, I thought that it would be well to inform you and give you my present address.

I spent three days on the Blackfoot Reserve, two at Calgary and Sarcee Reserve, one on Hobbema Reserve and two at Edmonton. Doctor Corbett accompanied me and as soon as I receive his report I will forward it to you. I have today forwarded the report I have written in connection with the Edmonton School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C.Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

Grissbach, K.C., I would say that we are engaged in establishing an Indian industrial school at Edmonton, to take the place of the one formerly located at Red Deer. The buildings at the latter place became very much dilapidated, and the situation was not considered favourable. We purchased a property near Edmonton, and have erected, by day labour, certain out-buildings, which will later be used in connection with the school. Plans are being drawn, and we intend to ask for tenders for the main building this spring, if our Estimates are approved.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nEDMONTON, ALTA. May 20th, 1921.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am taking the liberty of writing you in reference to the matter of equipping the buildings on the Edmonton Industrial School's Farm with the Dodd's system of lightening rods.\n\nUpon interviewing Mr. Wilson here, the supervisor of the Edmonton Industrial School, he states that this matter is one that will be dealt with by the Department at Ottawa, but I understand from him that he has recommended that lightening rods be installed.\n\nWe understand that you are conversant with the Dodd's System and would like to know if it is your intention to have this building rodded. If so we would be very glad to submit a price for the job.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. E. Tysoe\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp: DEPT. OF INDIAN AFFAIRS]\nCOPY OF RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY GENERAL BOARD OF MISSIONS\nOF THE METHODIST CHURCH IN CANADA.\n\nOctober 20th, 1921.\n\nRESOLVED:\n\nTHAT this General Board of Missions of the Methodist Church wishes to express its approval of the purchase of the farm at Edmonton and the erection of the buildings that have been already completed. But we regret that the work of construction of the main building has been delayed during the present year.\n\nAND WHEREAS, our Church is without an Indian Institute in the Province of Alberta;\n\nAND WHEREAS, the Methodist Church gave up its claim on 1500 acres of ranching land at Morley, and also closed the Red Deer Institute and gave up this plant, with a Section and three-quarters of land, with the understanding that the new plant at Edmonton would be ready about October 1921,\n\nWE, therefore, request that the Department of Indian Affairs provide for the completion of this plant during the year 1922.\n\nCERTIFIED CORRECT.\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary of Missionary Society of the Methodist Church in Canada.\nOctober 24th, 1921.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose a Resolution that was passed by our General Board of Missions at its recent Meeting in Toronto. I would add to this resolution a further word of explanation.\n\nIt will be no doubt remembered by the Department that the $60,000.00, that was used for the purchase of a farm at Edmonton, was at the disposal of the Methodist Church for other purposes in the year 1919; that, on behalf of the Methodist Church, Dr. Endicott and myself assured the Department that all minor requests on this appropriation, that was at our disposal during this year, would be withdrawn in favor of the Department spending the whole of the amount in the purchase of this farm. It will also be remembered that we relinquished the 1500 acres of ranching land at Morley, and the plant with a section and three-quarters of land at Red Deer, with the understanding that the values of these properties would be, in a sense, earmarked, to help carry on the building operations in connection with the new plant on the Edmonton farm.\n\nAs the Methodist Church is without any institutional educational work in the Province of Alberta, it is vital to our educational interests that this institute be completed at the earliest possible date. I would like the Department to consider this of primary importance; and from the Church's point of view it cannot very well be delayed longer than the year 1922, without serious injury to our interests.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTF.MT\n\nENCL.\nNovember 2nd, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 24th ultimo, enclosing a resolution of the General Board of Missions of the Methodist Church relative to the completion of the Edmonton Industrial School plant during the year 1922. I have noted also your word of explanation concerning the relinquishing of the properties at Morley and Red Deer. The Department agrees with you that it is vital to the Methodist Church educational interests in Alberta that this school be prepared for the reception of Indian pupils in the immediate future.\n\nI am aware of the importance that you place upon the completion of the plant at Edmonton, and I can assure you that it will receive prime consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRev.

T. C. Buchanan, D.D., referring to the Edmonton Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that the Department is giving, at this time, most earnest consideration to the claims of the Methodist Church Indian work in Alberta. I realize that the situation at Edmonton is unique among the Indian residential schools of Canada. The main building at Edmonton will be erected as soon as we are successful in the matter of getting the necessary funds voted.\n\nAt the present writing, I am unable to state whether or not an item in this connection will be allowed in the Supplementary Estimates for the current fiscal year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSuperintendent General.\n\nD.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nFred J. Dodson, Esq.,\nAlderville,\nOnt.\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has just become known that that portion of our district known as the Edmonton Indian Industrial School farm has collapsed. This is no surprise to us the near residents. The manner in which that property has been operated seemed ridiculous. In the first place they were located in the centre of our school district. A portion of the farm adjoining our school house. Because of them not paying either school or municipal taxes it has created a great hardship on all of us, in the upkeep of both school and roads. Although we taxpayers feel this very much, that does not give me cause to write you at this time. As a farmer and one\nof this pest who takes an interest in our farm lands. I would like to bring to your attention the fact that this is a menace to the whole neighbourhood on account of it being overrun with stick weed. No doubt you will know what that means. I would suggest, should your Department see fit for a change that steps be taken to stamp out this pest by summer following and thorough farming. I might say that I own, and operate nearly a section adjoining the farm. Trusting you will examine and act on this matter and that you will favor me with a reply.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours truly,\nJohn Harold\nBox 5-37\nEdmonton.\nOttawa, Nov. 22, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed by the Honourable the Superintendent General to acknowledge your letter of the 11th instant, in which you inform this Department that the Edmonton Industrial School farm is overrun with stinkweed.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that immediate inquiries are being made, and steps will be taken to remedy any conditions on our property that are a menace to farms in the vicinity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJohn Harrold, Esq.,\nBox 537,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, Nov. 22, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that a farmer, whose land borders the Edmonton Industrial School property, has written to the Honourable the Superintendent General complaining concerning the manner in which the school farm has been operated. May I quote in part from the above mentioned letter in which our correspondent refers to the school farm:\u2014 \"As a farmer and one of this part who takes an interest in our farm lands, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that this is a menace to the whole neighborhood on account of it being overrun with stinkweed. --- I would suggest, should the Department see fit for a change, that steps be taken to stamp out this pest by summer fallowing and thorough farming\".\n\nThe Department would be pleased to have a report from you in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth,\nEdmonton Industrial School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nIndian Industrial School,\nEdmonton Alta.,\nNov. 30th 1922.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 522194-I of Nov. 22nd., in reference to stinkweed on the Indian Industrial School farm.\n\nI may say that since we came to the place nearly three years ago we have had no visit from the weed inspector nor any complaints from this source, and indeed only one complaint has reached our ears and we immediately took what steps we could to remedy the evil. I do not think however that this was the writer of the letter which you quote. There is a patch of about forty acres pretty badly infested with stinkweed. This no doubt is the source of complaint. This patch of ground has I understand been infested with this weed for many years before we took possession. So the matter is not new. The pest is pretty well confined to this one area. Precautions have been taken to keep all feed and produce from this field together, and the manure from the same has not been put in other fields.\n\nIt might also be mentioned that the fences around this part of the farm are in bad condition thus making it possible for horses and cattle to wander over the place, thus helping to spread the seeds. It will be remembered that the attention of the Department was drawn to the condition of the fencing on this farm and I stated that we needed some ten miles to properly protect the place. The fencing done last summer was but a small part of what is required.\n\nI might also point out that this fall from the same section we sold a carload of wheat which graded No. I Northern with only 2% dockage and that largely consisting of ordinary cultivated oats. We are quite aware that everything about this farm is not as we would like it, I am merely trying to hold and operate\na very large farm under very trying conditions with the aid of\nthese men and with very limited financial resources. This condition\nis inevitable until the school opens when we will be able to\nattend to some of these matters under normal conditions. At present\nit is simply impossible to attend to everything unless proper\nfinancial support is given. It might be pointed out that during\nthe last three years the returns of this farm have been up to the\naverage of this district and equal to that of our neighbors. I am\nglad of the criticism, but I would be glad if our worthy and\nzealous neighbor had the courage to talk this matter over with me\nbefore taking his complaint to Ottawa.\n\nIf I may be allowed to speculate a little bit, I may say\nthat I am not surprised at such a letter as you evidently received.\nThis Industrial School is not exactly popular in this vicinity. I\nwas given to understand that when we first took it over. The fact\nthat nearly a thousand acres was taken out of the municipality\nand School District with the accompanying taxes explains a good\ndeal. We are constantly reminded of this fact. If the Department\ncan heal the financial sore I am sure the stinkweed will cease to\nstink and otherwise cease to annoy the sensibilities of the\ncommunity.\n\nI shall be glad to cooperate with the Department in\nadjusting ourselves to the needs of this community, but until\nnormal conditions exist we can only do our best.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, Dec. 15, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to certain weeds on the farm of the Edmonton Industrial School. I have noted that fencing improvements will assist in keeping the property clean. In the spring, you should intimate exactly what fencing is necessary and make an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth,\nIndian Industrial School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nFebruary 12th, 1923.\n\nPursuant to Mr. Ferrier's conference with you on Saturday last, re the financial situation in connection with the maintenance account of the Edmonton Industrial School for the period from October 1st, 1919, to November 30th, 1922, and in answer to your request, we herewith enclose you a statement showing the Receipts and Expenditure for this period.\n\nThe Red Deer Industrial School ceased to earn per capita grants from September 30th, 1919. Since that date this enterprise, now known as the Edmonton Industrial School, has received no financial aid from the Government for maintenance. The Methodist Missionary Society has maintained a Principal and farm help on the new school property for the past three years. Due to poor harvests and low prices our entire operations have been conducted at a loss. Every energy has been bent towards preparing a farm suitable for Industrial School purposes.\n\nA study of the statement of expenditure will show that certain items appear to be fair and just charges against parliamentary appropriation for Indian education; and had the accounts been presented at the time the expenditure was incurred, we have every reason to believe that the Department would have paid the same. The reason that the accounts were not presented was that we hoped that the entire cost of maintenance would have been met by the proceeds of the farm. The liabilities as on the 30th November last were $6,049.17. This amount would have been more serious if the Mission Board had not, since the closing of the Red Deer Institute, made grants totalling $4,200. Further, the estimated expenditure from the first of December, 1922, to the 31st of July, 1923, - at which time we hope the School will be earning a per capita grant - is at the rate of $500 per month, or a total of $4,000, when the Methodist Church, without assistance from parliamentary appropriation would be facing a total deficit of $14,249.17, including the $4,200 already advanced by the Missionary Society to maintain this institution.\n\nThe work carried on from the closing of the Red Deer School to the time when the Edmonton Institute opens its doors for Indian children cannot be considered a missionary enterprise, and whereas no opportunity to earn Government grants has obtained because of our inability to house, educate and Christianize Indian children, therefore we respectfully urge the Department of Indian Affairs to arrange for a special grant for the maintenance of the Edmonton Industrial School.\nInasmuch as the Missionary Society has paid for maintenance of this enterprise $4,200, we would respectfully request that a similar amount be granted by the Indian Department from parliamentary appropriations for Indian Education. We make this request in the hope that the receipts from the Farm sales of next harvest will meet the estimated expenditure up to the time specified.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.E. Manning\nGeneral Secretary, Home Missions.\n\nT. Ferrier\nSuperintendent, Methodist Indian Schools.\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq., F.R.S.C., Litt.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nFebruary 20, 1923.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart:\n\nThe Red Deer Industrial School was closed and ceased to earn per capita grant from this Department, as from September 30, 1919. Since that date this Indian educational cause, now known as the Edmonton Industrial School, has received no financial aid from the Government, for maintenance. The Methodist Missionary Society has maintained a principal and certain farm help on the new school property for the past three years. Due to poor harvests and low prices, the operations have been conducted at a loss. Every energy has been bent towards preparing a farm suitable for industrial school purposes.\n\nThe activity, from the closing of the Red Deer School to the time when the Edmonton Institute opens its doors for Indian children, cannot be considered a missionary or church enterprise. The Rev. Principal and the Church have had no opportunity to earn government maintenance grants, because of their inability to house, educate and Christianize Indian children. The Methodist Missionary Society has approached me by deputation, and now by letter, with the request that this Department, for maintenance purposes, make a grant similar to that which has been made from church funds.\n\nThe Methodist Church has paid $4,200 during the past three years, for the maintenance of the Edmonton Industrial School. The net liability, as on November 30th, last, was $5,240.66 and consisted of a bank overdraft of $3,670 and outstanding accounts. The Missionary Society hope that, if this Department can make a grant of $4,200, the remainder of the deficit and the maintenance expenses for the current months can be met from the farm proceeds in the fall of this year.\n\nIn the Supplementary Estimates, 1922-23, $75,000 was voted to commence work on the new main building. It is proposed to let the contract early in the building season and have the funds provided expended for materials and labour during the months of March and April. The funds necessary to make the special grant requested could be taken from the $75,000 already voted.\n\nAs the maintenance of the Edmonton Industrial School is a fair and just charge against parliamentary appropriation, and as the Methodist Missionary Society has already paid the earlier deficits, I respectfully recommend that you give your authority for a special grant of $4,200 to the principal of the school. A cheque, if directed, will be deposited to cover the overdraft and to pay the outstanding accounts.\n\nDuncan C.

Farming operations have been carried on under Rev. J. F. Woodsworth as principal, and a small staff. Certain building operations have also been carried out in the way of providing buildings and accommodation for staff. This work has been conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, and the liabilities over and above proceeds received from the farm amount to $6240.65 as at November 30, 1922. During the past three years, the Methodist Church has contributed $4,200 towards the cost of the maintenance, and this Department has agreed to provide a like amount to be applied towards the payment of the overdraft and outstanding accounts.\n\nThe Minister's authority has been secured.\n\nCheque to be drawn in favour of and sent to:\n\nBank of Montreal, Edmonton, Alta.,\nfor deposit to Credit of Rev.

Woodsworth,\n(in trust) for Edmonton Industrial School.\n\nCertified Correct\n\n27/3/25.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, Dec. 18, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nIn the new Indian Residential School now nearing completion at Edmonton the Department has installed a heating system and a lighting system of the highest standard obtainable, but in order to give the results desired it is absolutely necessary that this equipment receive the proper attention at all times, from a man fully competent to carry out these duties. I have, therefore, to request that you appoint to your staff a competent engineer, who will have full charge of the heating system and all other mechanical equipment in the building, his salary to be paid by the school. This appointment will have to be made subject to the approval of the Department, and before submitting the name and qualifications of the man you propose to trust this work to, I would ask you to obtain from the Provincial Boiler Inspector a certificate stating that the man you have in view is fully competent to undertake this work.\n\nIf the mechanical equipment is not properly looked after it will be a great source of expense and the Department is not prepared to pay any accounts for repairs to the plant which are caused by carelessness or neglect, and it is therefore in the interests of the school that a thoroughly competent man be put in charge of this branch of the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H. Goodsworth,\nPrincipal, Edmonton Indl. Sch.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your enquiries regarding Mr. Spencer S. Copper, I have known Mr. Copper for about five years, and have come in personal contact with him in the course of his work as an engineer on quite a number of occasions.\n\nHe has always impressed me as being a very conscientious and capable engineer, and his experience would warrant me in having confidence in his ability to take charge of the steam boilers and all mechanical equipment in the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nM.

I may say that Mr. May has seen his work for some days now and I would be glad if the Department would make any other inquiries regarding the capabilities of Mr. Cooper. I have asked some of his fellow engineers and they all hold him in high esteem.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, Jan. 8, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to the employment of a competent engineer for the Edmonton School.\n\nI note with pleasure the recommendation in favour of Mr. Coppen and it would appear that he is competent to undertake the supervision of the mechanical plant at the school. I think that it would be well, however, to employ him temporarily for sixty days before you make his appointment permanent. In that time you will be able to judge whether he is fully competent to look after the installation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend J. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal, Edmonton Indl.

In fixing the dates, it might be well to have them three days apart so that any officials of the Government or the Church could attend both openings.\n\nI am expressing the wish of the principals concerned in hoping that you may be able to attend and take part in the ceremonies. If this is not possible, it might be that the Honorable Charles Stewart could be present. Personally, I would like the date fixed so that Dr. Chown, General Superintendent of our Church and Dr. Manning, General Secretary of the Mission Board, might attend. Our General Board of Missions meets in Toronto on the 30th of this month and the Superannuation Fund Board will be called immediately afterwards, so the earliest possible date which would be satisfactory to the officials of the Methodist Church would be some time after the 15th of October.\n\nIn fixing the dates, I would be glad if we can arrange a time which would be suitable for representatives of the Indian Department and the Methodist Church to attend. Kindly let me know your thought on the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

I learned from Mr. Pratt that there would be little hope of securing your presence for the B.C. function, but I venture to suggest that your presence at the Edmonton opening would be very popular. The Methodist Church authorities have urged me to ask you to be present and they will allow you to fix a date.

The Honourable Mr. Stewart will be glad to be present in the case of the function at Edmonton, provided it is between the 12th and 29th of October. Please fix a date tentatively and I shall ask Mr. Stewart to concur.\n\nThe Superintendent General cannot at the present time consider an engagement at Coqualeetza. The Rev. Mr. Haley has been in correspondence with me in this connection and I am trying to arrange for the presence of the Prime Minister who, I understand, will be in British Columbia during the latter part of October. I shall advise you immediately I learn concerning the probability of Mr. King's acceptance. In the interim, I believe you should correspond with Mr. Haley and fix a date for the ceremony at Sardis also. I would then have a definite suggestion to make to the Prime Minister.\n\nI regret that it will not be possible for me to be present at these interesting functions; but I can assure you that the Department hopes that the completion of the physical equipment at these two institutions will be in an era of unprecedented success to Methodist Indian educational work in the West.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Mr. Woodsworth of Edmonton that he has fixed October 23rd for the opening of the Edmonton Institute. I would judge from your letter that this will be satisfactory to the Hon. Charles Stewart.\n\nI have already written Mr. Raley suggesting the 26th of October as a suitable date for the opening of the Coqualeetza Institute. If as you say, the Prime Minister is going to be in British Columbia during the latter part of October, probably this date would be as suitable as any for him. I would be pleased indeed if in your absence or in the Superintendent General's that a date suitable for the attendance of the Prime Minister could be arranged. I am writing Mr. Raley to find out if the 26th will be satisfactory to him.\n\nPersonally I regret very much that you will be unable to attend either of these functions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

He has intimated that it will be a pleasure to represent the State, as far as he is aware at present. He plans to be in either Edmonton or at his home at Killan, Alta., all the week of October 26th. At a later date, you will be informed as to how to get in touch with him locally.\n\nWith reference to the Coqualeetza ceremony, I am unable to inform you at present concerning the probability of the Prime Minister's presence.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

I trust the Department is making arrangement to have some one represent them upon this occasion. We are endeavoring to make it a function of interest to the public in general and we are very anxious to have some of the department representatives present.\n\nWe were unable under the circumstances last fall to have a corner stone laying. I have thought it would be suitable however to have a small marble tablet installed at the assembly hall and unveiled on the day of the opening. I have made enquiries and find that a stone suitable engraved and installed would cost about $40.00. This would do nicely in place of a corner stone such as they had at Boqualeetza. I would request authority to have this stone so placed at this cost.\n\nI would be glad to have an immediate reply as the opening is only two weeks from today.\n\nYours Truly;\n\nJ. P.

Scott.\nMUST GUARANTEE THAT EVERY INDIAN CHILD GETS EDUCATION\n\nSo Declares Hon. Charles Stewart in Unveiling Memorial Tablet at the Indian School Near St. Albert Which Was Officially Opened on Thursday\n\n\"We want a guarantee that every Indian child will be given a free education,\" was the request made by Hon. Charles Stewart, Superintendent General of Indian affairs, and Minister of the Interior, in connection with the fact that Indian educational institutions, both in this province and other districts, has resulted in the opening of an Indian residential school in the midst of the white district near St. Albert.\n\nThe best we can do for this great people, from whom we took their names and who gave them children,\" declared Mr. Stewart, in unveiling the memorial tablet on Thursday to commemorate the occasion.\n\nLarge crowds attended the official opening ceremonies, coming from great distances, and Indians and whites mingled in the new white-walled building.\n\nChief Samson Speaks\n\nChief Samson of the Edmonton Reserve was the official native spokesman and delivered an inspiring address to the gathering. Also present was the Rev. Mr. Steinler, also a Cree Indian.\n\nRepresentatives of official and scholastic groups were numerous. Provincial Secretary Mr. Agar, Agriculture M. A. Craig, who is also chairman of the Board of Education, presided over the proceedings; Mr. M. Bradshaw, Western Commissioner of Indian Affairs, was present; Mr. F. Woodworth, superintendent of Methodist Indian schools; Mr. F. W. Woodworth, principal of the new school; the Rev. C. E. Manning, general-secretary of Methodist Church; and the Rev. F. Stacy McCall, principal of the Alberta College North, were also present.\n\nA Change in Life\n\nMr. Steinler addressed the gathering at the conclusion of the official opening ceremonies, saying that the right and duty of the Government was to confer children every possible educational chance. He said that the north country several years ago had improved considerably, with the necessity for providing more intensive facilities for native children, and with this end in view he had been successful in inducing the Government to provide an additional $400,000 for this purpose.\n\nWhen he first took charge of the Indian Department, he found it necessary to reduce expenditure throughout the country as well as any other, but he hoped that within the next few years, many more schools would be built throughout the Dominion.\n\nHe had been asked that every facility for education should be given to Indian children in return for concessions made by the Government in British Columbia, and he had answered that such a thing desirable and necessary. He found that the Indians were not so far advanced as those in the West, and he was particularly anxious that all throughout the Province they should receive a fair share of free education. He expressed the desire for education among Indians and asked the Government to give the initiative to the Government to give this matter its proper attention, and he looked for considerable progress in this direction in the near future.\nI have something this morning to write you expressing my satisfaction in Mr. Woodworth's work as Principal of the Edmonton School.\n\nHe worked well here at Red Deer for four years and I am happy to say that in my opinion he was a very conscientious principal.\n\nI do not think he has changed his attitude toward his work and this letter is simply to state that as a former co-worker I believe him to be a very careful, conscientious principal.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nFred J. Dodson\n\nSecretary\nIndian Department\nOttawa, Canada\nOttawa, May 12th, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, expressing your appreciation of the services which Rev. J. F. Woodsworth is performing as Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School. I have noted your opinion regarding his services, and the work which he is doing at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. J. Dodson,\nMuncey, Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that I left here on August 28th., to visit some of the western agencies.\n\nI found a great improvement in the grounds at this school since my last visit. The Principal has given a great deal of attention to this improvement. The children at this school appear to be quite healthy, and I am told they are advancing well in their classroom work. The building was clean throughout, and everything in the way of machinery was in splendid working order. The Principal would like to have some slight changes made in the main hall. The stairs leading from the main hall to the basement are open, and he would like to have this boxed in, with a door at the head of the stairs, as there is a tremendous amount of draft passing all the time, which makes it almost impossible to live in during the severe weather. I quite agree that this change should be made. It would not take much money for this work, and if you will give me the necessary authority I will see that it is done. The farm work in connection with this institution is up to its usual standard; it could not be much better. I am told that approximately ten thousand dollars worth of grain will be sold here this year.\n\nThe difficulty in recruiting is evident here; there is trouble in getting the children from the Hobbema Agency. Some of the children who attended the Methodist Day School are now attending the Roman Catholic Boarding School, as the parents claimed they were Roman Catholic before they even entered the Day School on the reserve. There were a number of children still on the reserve who should have been in the Edmonton School, and I gave instructions to the agent to see that they were sent without delay, and these instructions will be carried out.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nCommissioner's Office,\nREGINA, Sask.\nMarch 5th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nYou will note from the report of this Nurse that the Indian girls are not being taught to milk. This is a most serious situation and I think something should be done about it. What are we going to do when these women return to their reserves to live as farmers and are not able to milk cows? Are they to employ maids? The Department should insist on these girls being taught to milk cows at the school. One of our greatest difficulties is to get these people to keep milk cows so that their children and sick ones can have the necessary milk which is prescribed by the medical officers. It is a very difficult matter to get the men on the reserves to milk the cows and it is, therefore, very necessary that these girls should learn how to milk while they are at the schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) W. M. Graham.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, March 22nd, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is informed that no provision is made to instruct the girls in the Edmonton Indian Residential School in milking. It is considered that this is a most important part of the girls' training, as it is requisite, after leaving the school and returning to their reserves, that they be fully competent in this respect. The Department will, therefore, expect you to arrange that the older girls, under competent instruction and supervision, are given the opportunity to become trained in milking before being granted their discharge. I shall be pleased to hear what arrangements are being carried out in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, March 22nd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to that portion of your No. 403-11B of the 5th instant, enclosing the report of the nurse who recently visited the Edmonton Residential School relative to the girls not being taught to milk, I enclose, for your information, a copy of our communication to the Principal regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA.

The girls seem to like it and also seem to know how to do it. This is of course only a start and we hope to develop our program as time goes on.\n\nThe girls are sent out under the supervision of the farm instructor, Mr. Goodland, and there seems no difficulty as far as discipline is concerned.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nLife in an Indian Residential School\n\nAnother Phase of Home Mission Work\n\nBy J. F. WOODSWORTH\n\n(From \"The New Outlook\")\n\nThis year has been a very busy and a very interesting one. About eighty children came to us from Brandon during the period of their incarceration there, and also we are glad to report that we have had a total enrollment of nearly two hundred and fifteen pupils. This has of course been due to the enlargement of our quarters and considerable addition to our personnel, our usual attendance is only about half that number. These children come from all over Canada. We have now about twenty-five children from British Columbia. The Brandon children are from Lake Winnipeg and Ontario, representing a good many different tribes and languages. Our own Alberta children represent at least six different reserves, so that we have a great aggregation to mould into a harmonious working school. When the children came back from their holidays in August there were times of ecstatic times. Sometimes it was quite exciting. Sometimes there were tears; sometimes it was highly amusing. There was a great clash of loyalty and prejudices; however, after months of patient and conscientious work, we think we have a very fine group of children.\n\nIt may be of interest to let you know how we spent the Easter holidays. Perhaps you will get from it a good idea of activities just a little out of our ordinary routine. On Thursday night just before the class-room teachers went for holidays, we had a very interesting programme. The numbers were chiefly musical and rendered to the delight of everyone. The Indian people do not go to school. The next day was Good Friday. Of course our usual duties had to be looked after, but in the afternoon everybody had a holiday. The chief boys came back again with the boys of Rev. W. H. Pike's mission. These boys and our Indian boys are great friends and often have contests of various kinds. We played a long time, but our boys won. We had a very good Good Friday service in the evening when Dr. A. C. Farrell, of Wesley Church and Mr. Pike assisted me in instructions. Dr. Farrell preached a very fine and helpful sermon upon suitable theme. Our Sunday services were very impressive and were enjoyed by all. The Easter decorations and flowers were beautiful. I say nothing of the eager cooperation of over two hundred children who filled our chapel. I find my Indian congregation very inspiring and appreciative.\nLIFE IN AN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nAnother Phase of Home Mission Work\n\nBy J. F. Woodsworth.\n\n(From \"The New Outlook\")\n\nOn Monday evening another treat was in store for us. We secured from the Extension Department of the University of Alberta four reels of moving pictures: two on the old story of \"Sleepy Hollow\" and two on life in India. The work was greatly entertained. To this we added a fine talk by Rev. Capt. Bob Pearson on some of his varied experiences. On Tuesday evening four of the pupils went to the city to assist in a Mission Band concert which was being put on at Norwood United Church. We finally finished our week of holidays with another one of our larger giving dinner party as guests at a C.G.I.T. affair at Central United Church in Edmonton.\n\nI mention this week's program not to indicate our life in the residential school. The Indian people are taking their part in the life of the community and we are trying to fit them for community usefulness. Each day each girl and boy completes something in the way of school work. The girls in the various household departments, the boys about the farm. We are working five hundred acres this year. It is interesting to see the development of the life of a boy from the time he comes in from the reserve a child. Frequently his early days are spent in making mischief, but he usually makes up for it afterwards by becoming a real man and a fine worker before he leaves the school.\n\nOur class-room work is progressing. Last year two girls took the Grade 8 or this year high school. One of them is now a nurse in training in the Royal Alexandra Hospital, Edmonton. The other is a helper at our Industrial School. This year we have two boys taking their Grade 9 and quite a good-sized entrance class. The Department of Indian Affairs is making a special grant to assist in this high school work. The difficulties of the residential schools are upon us, and every advance creates problems for the school. The methods of fifteen years ago are no longer suitable for our needs. We have met in this school grandfathers of former pupils. It is interesting to see the ex-pupils bring along their children. There is now none of the former hostility and suspicion. They know that the school is good for their children, not only from an educational standpoint, but from the health consideration. During this last year the Department has spent thousands of dollars on the treatment of these children. Tonics have been removed in about twenty-five cases. Under-nourished and children physically defective have been treated. Quite a number of persons in cases have been successfully handled, although we lost two little chaps who were not able to fight their way back to health again.\n\nOur work here is essentially human in all its aspects and our greatest satisfaction is in seeing our pupils develop into good men and women who will take their places in the world.\nan unbroken drop and in practice serious injuries to the smaller children have been averted only by a member of the staff catching them as they came down the pole. This danger could be overcome by placing a landing platform at the second floor which would cut the length of the drop in half. I would recommend that this be done.\n\nIt was also noted that there are no seating facilities in the boys playroom and they have been using the wash stands to rest on. I would suggest that plank seats or lockers be furnished for this room. A second bath is also needed for the boys. Only the tub is required as there is a connection already in place and practically no expense will be entailed in installing the second tub.\n\nThe pumping equipment is working satisfactorily and there appears to be an inexhaustible supply of water in the well. I mentioned in a former report that a second well would be advisable to ensure a continuance of the water supply in the event of the pump in the present well going out of business as it did at one time leaving the institution without water for several days.\n\nI am still of the opinion that a second well would be advisable and upon looking into the matter I find that the present pump house is large enough to take care of both wells and the outlay for the additional would be the cost of another pump and sinking the well.\n\nThis school is now connected up with the Calgary Power Company's system which supplies energy for lighting the school and running the laundry and pumping machinery.\n\nThere is a new bread mixer two barrel capacity on hand which the Principal has no use for and he will gladly turn it over to any other institution upon receiving advice to do so from the Department.\n\nFARM\n\nWater is piped from the pump house to the piggery and it will be an easy matter to connect the system to the cow barn. This system would be more efficient if a small pressure tank was installed in the pump house. A 500 gallon tank would fill the requirement.\n\nSince my last visit a frame building has been moved from an outlying part of the farm and has been fitted up as a hog house the work being performed by the members of the staff. This building is dry, well ventilated and makes a good piggery. There are 20 brood sows and 175 other pigs on hand. The raising of hogs has proved a profitable source of income.\n\nThere are 60 heads of cattle on hand including a bull and 24 milch cows. They were milking 20 cows at the time of my visit which provides plenty of milk for their requirements.\n\nThe cow barn provides accommodation for the milch cows only and part of the horse barn is being used to house the other cattle. A shed is required for the young stock and the Principal stated that if he were granted $600.00 for the necessary material he could have a suitable shed built and would have the work done by the members of the staff.\n\nThe farm produced 16,200 bushels of grain, 100 tons of ensilage and sufficient hay and green feed for their feed requirements. The grain included 1200 bus wheat, 12,000 bus oats and 3000 bus barley.\n\nThe garden produced 3,000 bus of potatoes of good quality as well as enough turnips for their use but the carrots and other vegetables did not grow so well and they will not have sufficient to last them through the year.\nGeneral\n\nThere are 147 children in attendance, 71 boys and 76 girls. I visited both class rooms and noted that the pupils were clean, well clothed and had a healthy and well nourished appearance. They spend one half of the day at class and the other half at domestic and other work. The girls assist in the kitchen and in the general house work of the school. They are also given instruction in sewing, mending and knitting.\n\nThe boys assist with the feeding and care of the stock and in season they work on the farm.\n\nIn view of the healthy appearance of the children I was surprised that the cost for medical attendance has greatly increased since the appointment of Mr. Williamson and this is causing the Principal some anxiety. The account for October last was $208.50 for November $300.00 and for December $164.00.\n\nAmongst the items noted are 13 tonsil treatments at $15.00 each. Five intravenous injections (five children syphilis) at $25.00. Four trips at $25.00 in one month. I also noted an $8.00 charge for a visit and the only work apparently performed was the examination of one child for admission to the school.\n\nThe Doctor is appointed on the call system but after being called he uses his own discretion regarding return visits. While the Principal feels that he is not qualified to say that these visits are not necessary he has a feeling that they might be curtailed. I am informed that the cost for medical attendance is three times as much as it was when Dr Holmes had the work.\n\nIn concluding this report I may state that I find the general conditions at this institution very satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. Murison\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nEdmonton Residential School (United Church)\n\nI visited this school on the 20th instant and made a complete inspection of the residence and outbuildings.\n\nThis school is under the auspices of the United Church with the Rev'd J.F.Woodsworth in charge as Principal; Miss McDonald Matron, Mr Goodlands in charge of the Farm and outside work also acts as assistant Principal when the Principal is absent on business trips. There are two qualified teachers as well as the necessary staff to carry on the work of the Institution all of whom have been selected with care and are reported as giving satisfactory service.\n\nMr Woodsworth impresses me as being an energetic and capable Principal. He keeps in close touch with all departments of the institution and I consider that his school reflects credit upon himself and the Department.\n\nMain Building\n\nThis building has been fully described in former reports. I found the building in good condition throughout and well kept in a scrupulously clean manner.\n\nThe fire hose and extinguishers were examined and found in good condition. The building is provided with pole as well as iron stairway fire escapes. The Principal pointed out that the pole escapes from the dormitories were too long an\nYou will note what the Inspector has to say regarding the pole fire escapes, which have too long a drop. I think the suggested change could be made by the Principal and his staff if he were told that he should do it. Of course, if the Department will consent to attend to the matter he will not turn a hand to it.\n\nThe Inspector draws attention to the fact that there is no seating accommodation in the boys' playroom and they have been using the washstands to rest on. He suggests that plank seats or lockers be furnished. I think they should have seats of some description in their recreation room, otherwise they will sit on the floor. It would not cost much to put plank seats around the playroom, and this should be done.\n\nMention is made of the need for a second well at the Edmonton School. Personally, I cannot see why there is any more urgency for a second well at this point, than to have second wells at all our schools.\n\nI have today written a special letter to the Department regarding the bread mixer which was sent to this school in the spring of 1924 and which has never been used. It is too large for use in any school that I know of. Perhaps the Department can issue some instructions regarding the disposition of it.\n\nThey had a fine crop of grain at this school. Unfortunately it was of little value, but a great deal of it will be fed to the animals.\n\nYou will note the Inspector comments upon the increased cost of medical attention at the Edmonton School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, February 16, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 403-11, enclosing Mr. Inspector Murison's report on his recent inspection of the Edmonton and St. Albert Indian Residential Schools.\n\nRegarding the Edmonton School, the Department notes that conditions generally are satisfactory.\n\nRegarding the pole fire escapes, the change suggested by the Inspector in having a landing platform placed at the second floor, to cut the length of the drop from the pole fire escape, should be carried out by the school authorities, and the expense required should be provided from per capita earnings or other receipts. I shall be pleased if you will arrange to see that this platform is installed.\n\nRegarding the seating accommodation in the boys' playroom, you may authorize that plank seats be installed around the playroom. It is considered, if the plank or other material required were supplied, that the staff could perform any labour required. Accounts may be submitted in the usual manner covering the cost of the material.\n\nRegarding the installing of a 500 gallon tank, which is required to connect the water system with the cow barn, and the erection of a shed for the young stock, I have to say that these requirements have been noted.\n\nA separate communication will be directed to you regarding the bread mixer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, July 7th, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI desire to advise you that the Department has provided grant for a pupilage of 150 at the Edmonton Indian Residential School from April 1st, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I am not getting along fine up here because I work all the time, and I don't go to school right. I'd rather stay home, with my parents, or go to the other school instead I work whole day on the farm, I just went to school, three days since I came here. That isn't why my father send me here to work, he send me here to go to school and study hard, and to learn to read and write. It will be better for me to go home before Christmas, because I am working too hard, and I am real tired, and I'll ask your kindness to send me home before Christmas for sure, please, because I am not fooling Mr. Mortimer please. I always get into trouble amongs the boys, like fighting, so I don't want to get into trouble this year or to get hurt, by working. I didn't show this letter to Mr. Woodsworth and I send it to you, because, I was so tired from working, so please answer this letter right away if possible, all the B.C. boys hate this place, I don't know anything at all, I don't even know how to write, I didn't write this letter myself, but somebody wrote this for me, and all the B.C. boys and myself don't like what we are eating in our dinning room, we couldn't hardly eat anything, because we are not used to them kinds of food, and some times we would find some broken tin or anything like that in our plate, we even saw a mice in our teapot so all the B.C. boys hate this place, they sure hate it and I hate it myself too, I guess this will be all for just now, so I am closing with best regards to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Eddie Smith.\"\nSir:- Re - Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter received from a Kitwancool pupil of this Agency, now at the Edmonton Residential School. The letter is self explanatory but I cannot say as to it being authentic.\n\nTo explain the situation more fully I had great difficulty in getting the pupils to return on September 1st last to the above school, the complaints chiefly being, from both parents and children - especially the boys - that they are continually working on the farm, thereby getting little or no education.\n\nDealing with the writer of the enclosed letter, Eddie Smith, this boy, who was a pupil of the above mentioned school and who was very anxious to learn, went to the Alert Bay School and positively refused to go to Edmonton. As this was contrary to Departmental orders the boy was returned to the Edmonton School on Departmental instructions from Ottawa.\n\nI feel that if rumours of this description are circulated amongst the Protestant Indians it will have a bad effect and great difficulty will be experienced in getting the children to enter the said school.\n\nMay I be permitted to ask that if Inspector Barry is in the vicinity of the Alberta Border he proceed to Edmonton and check up all pupils of this Agency which, I am given to understand, are the only ones attending from B.C.\n\nNo doubt a part of the time should be devoted by the Indian boys to agriculture but a larger amount of time should be devoted to education.\n\nEncl.

Ditchburn.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure\nP/AC\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 4th, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nThe Department is informed that there was considerable difficulty in connection with the return last September of Hazelton Indian pupils to the Edmonton Indian Residential School. It appears that both parents and children, especially the boys, complained of long hours on the farm at a consequent sacrifice of classroom opportunities. It is, also, claimed that there is considerable fighting among the boys, with the British Columbia lads getting the worst of it. Further, it is stated that the food is not what children from Hazelton are accustomed to.\n\nThe Department does not pay undue attention to complaints of this character but I thought you should be aware of the complaints that have been current in the Babine Agency. Please let me have a report so that I can place Mr. Indian Agent Mortimer in a position to answer the Indians who criticize.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

J. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\nFeb. 10th 1937.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have your letter of 4th Inst. No. 110-0-1 in reference to complaints of parents and children from the Babine Agency.\n\nI am rather glad of this letter as it gives me an opportunity to discuss matters which otherwise I might not mention. I wish I might talk rather than write, as there is nothing in these complaints as I see things and yet I know that these complaints exist and a certain amount of agitation goes on, which of course one cannot help. I have an idea also that the complaints come from, chiefly, one or two sources, and that from a family which did not send their children back to the school last August.\n\nAs far as work on the farm is concerned, the boys have been treated the same as our own Alberta boys, only better. For a few weeks during harvest some of the big boys were out getting the harvest in. The B.C. boys were put on the regular school schedule first, as I wished to prevent this very criticism. Practically all the B.C. boys were in from the harvest field by the end of September. As a matter of fact all the boys were rather anxious to have a hand in the harvest. But, the extra work done was no more than was necessary at a school farm. The Department is quite aware of the benefits of a school farm as a form of vocational training and I do not think I need apologize for having the boys do their share in getting in a harvest. I may say in passing that this year we had\none of the biggest crops, of all kinds, in the history of our school. We harvested 15,000 bus of grain, several thousand bus of vegetables of various kinds. A wonderful crop of green feed, and a fine herd of cattle to which to feed it, to say nothing to the finest herd of hogs in this part of the country. In the cases of many of these boys, I consider this farm education the best kind of training they could have, and many of our Alberta boys, and parents, appreciate this training, and ask to stay out of the class room. In the case of the B.C. boys however I have not allowed this except during the short time during harvest.\n\nThe whole trouble, of course, is that nearly every parent in B.C. asks that his boy or girl be allowed to go to school all day. They do not wish them to do any work on the farm. They want them suddenly to become fine scholars, after allowing them to run the streets of their villages until they are big boys and girls. There are a number of cases where these big boys are still in grade I and II. I cannot allow our Alberta children to do all the work and the B.C. children to sit down and look on. We cannot destroy our half day system. I know it is unpopular with them, but I am afraid I am forced to be unpopular at times with a certain class. Then too I fancy the village life on the Skeena has not been overly healthy. For the most part these big boys have wandered the streets since children and of course resent the first indication of discipline or restraint. Practically all are in Grade I when they come here, and have no idea at all of school life. Naturally some will complain to parents.\n\nIt may only be a coincident, but the two B.C. young people who from the first have gone to school all day and upon whom we have expended the most care are the two who have been sick most. Again there are about 35 children who are in the class room both morning and afternoon. Of these 15 are from B.C. Yet we have twice as many children\nfrom Alberta as from B.C., I might also point out that those B.C. children who have kept in school regularly have made splendid progress with their studies. As far as work is concerned, we cannot depend upon the B.C. boys for any real duties. It is always the Alberta fellows. The last two mornings we have gone off for ice, an all day drive. Three Alberta Boys, and without a complaint. If the Department wishes to do real work among these young people I know of nothing which will do it like our present policy. As I understand it we are here to guide these children educationally, and not allow our parental interference as long as justice is done. I am not ashamed of our graduates, but we cannot do this work by allowing children to have everything their own way.\n\nAbout fighting:- This is nonsense. I have found that the B.C. boys are just like other boys and have their tiffs like other boys do. In cases of bullying I have punished the offenders severely. Sometimes one must act with decision. John Brown a B.C. boy attacks Sam Bird with a pitch fork. John of course is jacked up. Sometimes it is fit for tat. Joshua-I6-Alberta takes a swipe at Mike/I2-B.C. John-I6-P.C., in revenge kicks the shins of Norman/I8-Alberta. This is about as serious as our little tragedies amount to.\n\nAbout food:- I went to the dining room this morning. I found at each plate-I4S children, a good bowl rolled oats porridge, a big cup of milk, three or four slices of bread or toast. Potatoes, Jam, and meat, and tea or cocoa. True it is served on a granite plate, but it was real food. The two Steinhauer children who have a ten mile drive to Alberta College where they are taking Grades Ten and Twelve sit at the same table as these children and there is never complaint. One B.C. boy informed me that he wanted Bacon and eggs for breakfast. However I concluded that I was not serving a menu A'La Hotel MacDonald. There is\ntoo much the attitude that the Government owes us everything and we should get it. I fancy food is about the same in Alberta as in B.C., and our meals are open to Government inspection, and have been approved by Visiting nurses. If fish were more plentiful we might give them some more frequently, but as it is we have it in season.\n\nProbably I have written enough. I trust you will write Mr. Indian Agent Mortimer, if you are satisfied that this school is giving the children fair treatment, so that he may definitely inform the Indian People of the Babine Agency that the children are receiving their education, not merely according to the plan of a particular Principal but also after a policy which has the full backing of The Department. There were seven or eight children who did not come back last August when I went for them. It is possible that The Indian Agent did not care to enforce their return for various reasons. I think they should have come back, as their absence was a mere whim of their parents. They were registered in this school and considerable expense was involved in getting them here.\n\nI have considerable stake in B.C. I believe we can give these children a good training for a few years and prepare them for future educational developments later in B.C. I would appreciate very much the backing of the Department and also the local Indian Agent in this task.\n\nI shall be glad if the Department enquires further into our educational work and our treatment of the children here. Any information is welcomed. I shall be glad to hear further from the Department upon matters relative to the B.C. situation.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.G. Woodworth\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nre - Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nI respectfully beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 16th, No. 110-0-1, with enclosure from the Rev. J. N. Woodsworth, Principal of the above named Residential School.\n\nAfter carefully perusing Mr. Woodsworth's letter and from past investigations of the reports which I have received concerning the pupils of this Agency, I am of opinion that the treatment meted out to these pupils are in accordance with the syllabus carried through by Mr. Woodsworth and appear to be satisfactory. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the complaints submitted to me by the parents emanated from the children themselves and no doubt were greatly enlarged upon by the parents with a view of trying to get an Indian Residential School built in this Agency. I had the same complaints from the parents of children attending the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School at Leduc, B. C. These complaints raised a doubt in my mind until I personally visited the Fraser Lake School and found the complaints were a series of untruths. I have great pleasure in stating that I have met Mr. Woodsworth and have heard from him regarding his procedure of tuition in both the class room and on the farm and I am fully convinced that Mr. Woodsworth and his staff are doing their best to educate Indian children so that in the future they will become an asset to Canada. Mr. Woodsworth may rest assured that he will receive every assistance from this Agency.\n\nDealing with the matter of Indian children of this Agency whose parents refuse to return them to Edmonton, I may say that these parents are well able to look after their children locally and send them to the Indian Day Schools. This, I think, meets with the wishes of the Department.\n\nIn conclusion may I be permitted to say that I am of opinion that the holiday season should be curtailed as far as possible when one takes into consideration the long train journey and expensive transportation between Hazleton and Edmonton.\n\nI return herewith Mr. Woodsworth's letter as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\nCCM/SM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 2, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 10th ultimo, regarding the complaints of the parents and children from the Babine Agency concerning the Edmonton Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith, for your information, copy of a communication which has been received from Mr. Agent Mortimer, Hazelton, B.C. In reviewing the correspondence from the Agent and yourself, the Department is of the opinion that there was no cause for the complaint made by the parents as to their children being overworked at the school.\n\nYou will note the opinion of Mr. Mortimer regarding holidays for these pupils. Owing to the cost involved in their transportation and the difficulty in having the children returned after their leave has expired, it is considered that it would be advisable, as far as possible, to keep them at the school instead of allowing them home on holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE,\nCALGARY, ALTA., February 28th, 1933.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of the Edmonton Indian Residential School. My inspection covered a period of about 30 hours which I spent at this institution.\n\nThere are 158 children in residence: 81 girls and 77 boys. The government grant provides for 150 children, or 8 less than they have in attendance. The children in residence there are from the Edmonton, Saddle Lake and Hobema Agencies, and there are something like 60 from British Columbia Reserves.\n\nThere are two classrooms in the school. During my time there I spent considerable time in both of these, and I found that excellent work was being carried on. The grades taught are from I to VIII. Both teachers are well qualified and getting good results. Three graduates from the school are attending high school in Edmonton: They drive into the city every morning and come out at night. I will not dwell on the classroom work here, as the school was inspected last November by the Provincial Public School Inspector.\n\nFARMING:\n\nThe school has 855 acres of land all fenced. They have 550 acres of this land under\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\nFarming (Continued),\u2014\n\ncultivation. The crop harvested this year was 2500 bushels of wheat, 9000 bushels of oats and 3000 bushels of barley\u2014a total of 14,500 bushels of grain. Besides this they had 3000 bushels of potatoes and an abundance of all other varieties of vegetables and garden truck. One hundred and fifty (150) tons of green feed were raised and placed in the silo.\n\nDuring the summer I called at the school on two different occasions and saw the farming, gardens, &c., and all outside work was well performed.\n\nLIVE STOCK:\n\nThey have 15 horses and 59 head of cattle, of which 29 are cows. At the time of my visit they were milking 24 head. They have also 135 pigs, 50 chickens and 25 turkeys.\n\nThe milk cows at the school are probably the finest herd in Alberta, as quite a number of them came from the C. P. R. Farm at Strathmore. The cattle and horses are very well looked after; the same applies to the pigs: Mr. Woodsworth has made a real business of raising hogs. He sells quite a number each year and they are all sold as \"selects.\"\n\nBUILDINGS, &c.,\n\nThe buildings throughout are in very good shape and the same applies to machinery, furniture and equipment of all kinds.\n\nTraining outside of Classroom Work:\n\nThe girls get about the same training as at all other boarding schools in the way of cooking, housekeeping, sewing, &c.\n\nThe boys here get exceptionally good training in farming and stock raising. From the results of their farming operations you may judge that the farming is well performed.\nHEALTH:\nThe children at this school looked very well. The school is in good financial condition, and as they raise practically all their food requirement the children get all they can eat. For instance, all the older boys and girls get meat and potatoes three times a day, and the children get butter at practically every meal. The wheat is ground into flour, and all the pork and beef used at the school is slaughtered right there.\n\nGENERAL:\nThe management of the school is exceptionally good. Mr. Goodland the Farming Instructor, has been there for 10 years. Before that he had been at Brandon for 20 years. He now has an assistant and they are accomplishing a great deal.\n\nMiss MacDonald the Matron has been in the work for 21 years, first at the File Hills School, then at Birtle and then she came to the Edmonton School shortly after it was opened. She is very capable and is doing splendid work.\n\nRev. Mr. Woodswroth, the Principal, is certainly to be congratulated on the splendid institution he is running. He has the work well organized and the children have every opportunity of being fitted for the live in which they will be engaged. All work done by the children both outside and in, is done well. The only thing I regret is, that the school should be filled up with children from the three nearby Agencies instead of having children there from B.C. Agencies. In due course I hope this situation will rectify itself, but it was necessary to bring the\nGENERAL (Continued),-\n\nBritish Columbia Indian children in order to bring the school up to capacity.\n\nThis is the first time I have inspected this school, as during the time I was in Regina, I did not inspect anything North of Edmonton.\n\nI trust this report will be of interest to you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, March 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your 403-11A U of the 25th ultimo, reporting on your inspection of the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note you found that excellent work was being carried on in the classroom and also in connection with the farming operations. It is also noted that all the work is well organized and the management of the school exceptionally good. It is further noted that the attendance is well maintained and that the children are in good health and well fed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, which I did on my way back from Fort Chipewyan, when I stopped off in Edmonton for a couple of days. At the time of my visit there were 143 children in residence, 67 boys and 76 girls.\n\nSCHOOL AND OUTBUILDINGS:\n\nThe school building itself is in splendid condition as the staff keep it in good repair. A small amount of money has been authorized by the Department each year for paint and calsonine, &c., and the walls were bright and clean; in fact the whole building looked very well kept.\n\nThe outbuildings were also in good order: Of course there is always a certain amount of depreciation in buildings from year to year: breakages and things going out of order, but everything seemed to be kept in a fairly good state of repair. I noticed that the brick work on the pump-house had given way, but had been temporarily repaired by the school, which answers the purpose. I also noticed that the silo was in\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSchool & Outbuildings, (Continued),\u2014\n\nvery poor condition; Many of the staves have rotted and given way. The silo had been fixed up by putting 2 X 4's vertically on the walls, and then putting steel rods around as hoops to tighten the silo up, and prevent it from leaking. This will keep it in shape for two or three years, at least. The rest of the outbuildings were in a good state of repair, and as far as I could see, everything that needed repairing had been attended to by the School.\n\nI went through the three residences at the school and found these to be in good shape. The furniture in the school was in good order.\n\nThe farm machinery at the school is kept under cover, and everything in this line seemed to be in good repair. The boiler in the school, as well as the laundry machinery, &c., seemed to be in good working order.\n\nFARMING:\u2014\n\nThe school owns approximately 855 acres of land, all fenced, 550 acres of which is under cultivation, including gardens and the school grounds. The Principal informed me that he had leased between 275 and 300 acres of the cultivated land on shares to two neighbouring farmers. The farmers in question are Wm. Davidson and Alfred Latimer, and the arrangements between them and the school are on the usual crop-share basis. The school\nFarming, (Continued),\u2014\n\nAuthorities reserve the right to determine what land is to be farmed and summer-fallowed each year, and the threshing machine belonging to the school is to be used in threshing the crop. Mr. Woodsworth also reserves the right to purchase green feed or any grain he requires for the school from the farmers who are working the land. The reason given me for entering into this agreement with the outside farmers was that all of the older boys had been discharged from the school and they did not have the staff to handle the land in question. The balance of the land under cultivation was handled by the school staff and boys. The farm work at this institution is carried on in a very satisfactory manner and the work on the land is always well performed, as I have seen the summer-fallows several times during the summer.\n\nThe amount of grain received from their farming operations last fall was 1300 bushels of wheat, 5000 bushels of oats and 600 bushels of barley, and 50 tons of green feed; as well as 3000 bushels of potatoes and an abundance of all other garden truck. I went through the root cellar which is an excellent one, and noted that the school had a good supply of potatoes, beets, turnips, carrots, parsnips and onions, from which it will be seen that they maintain a good garden. It might be interesting to you to note that the receipts from their farming operations in the past year amounted to about $3500.00\nLIVE STOCK:\n\nThey have 60 head of cattle, 35 of which are milch cows, and at the time of my visit they were milking 24. The cattle are mostly Holsteins but a few Shorthorn cows are kept as well for the purpose of breeding Beef animals for the use of the school. They have 150 pigs of different ages and size, and approximately 160 have been disposed of during the year. These hogs are of the very finest bacon type, and I noted from the sales slips that most of them had been graded \"select.\" There are 13 head of work horses of a good type. They have also about 100 chickens.\n\nI went over the records as to the amount of milk that came into the school and there is certainly an abundance of milk produced for all the requirements of the children. Considerable butter is also made, which is used by the staff and the children.\n\nTRAINING OF CHILDREN:\n\nThe children at this institution receive an exceptionally good training, as very nearly everything in the way of food, &c., is produced right there. The wheat raised is ground into flour which is used at the school, and the bigger girls bake the bread; No bread is purchased. Then, of course, the girls are taught the usual household work including, sewing, &c. The boys help to look after the barns and stock and receive a certain amount of training in the repair shop both in carpentering and blacksmithing, repairing implements, &c.\nHEALTH:\n\nThe children appeared happy and well. Two of the girls were ill with colds at the time of my visit, but otherwise there seemed to be no sickness at the school.\n\nI visited the children's dining room for the noon-day and evening meals, and from my own observation I would say that the children receive good food, well put up, and are getting all they can eat.\n\nFor recreation during the winter time they have a skating rink and I noticed that both girls and boys had been furnished with skates and boots, and they certainly make good use of them. In the summer time they play baseball, football, &c.\n\nGENERAL:\n\nI was in both classrooms and good work was evidently being carried on. This school maintains the services of two competent teachers.\n\nFrom remarks that have been dropped by officials from Ottawa, who have visited here, I believe that some of them are under the impression that the children are overworked at this institution: The older boys, in years gone by, probably did a lot of work on the farm, but at times they were paid by Mr. Woodsworth for staying on during the holidays and doing the farming, and one of the reasons for him leasing the land he did was to divert any criticism along those lines. On\nGeneral, (Continued),\u2014\n\nthis occasion I enquired into this matter very thoroughly and found that the ice put up at the school was hauled in and packed by outsiders.\n\nI also found that the coal burned at the school was delivered by truck right into the coal shed and basement, and therefore the boys had none of this work to do. As far as I could ascertain neither boys or girls were being overworked.\n\nThe personnel of the staff at an institution of this kind has a great deal to do with the treatment of the children. I have known the Matron, Miss McDonald, for years, in fact ever since I first came into the Department, and anyone who knows her can recognize her sterling qualities: She is efficient in her work and at the same time kind and generous to the children, and she certainly has their interest at heart.\n\nMr. Goodland, the senior Farming Instructor is an excellent type of man; He has been in the employ of the Department for over 30 years and his work is always well performed; I am quite sure that boys working under a man of his type are treated with every consideration.\n\nThe whole staff of the school appeared to me to be very efficient: There are six male members of the staff including the reverend Principal, 2 Farming Instructors, an engineer, a teacher and a boys' superintendent; and 8 female members \u2014 14 in all. I had quite a conversation with the engineer who looks after all the machinery around the school,\u2014 the boilers, &c., and from my personal observation I would say that he is well qualified\nGeneral, (Continued),\u2014\n\nto look after the machinery.\n\nMr. Woodsworth, the reverend Principal, is well known to the Department. He is an excellent business man and runs an up-to-date institution and the school is self-supporting in every respect. In the matter of them having the school land worked on shares, I am of the opinion that this should have been taken up with the Department beforehand, but as I did not know where I stood in the matter, I did not say anything.\n\nI trust this report will be of interest to you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, March 15th, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, reporting on your recent inspection of the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nThe information contained in your report has been carefully noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

J. LeBlanc, the Department is prepared to accept your estimate of the standing of the Grade IX student in the three options elected at the school, viz., Art, Music and Household Economics.\n\nThe Grade IX student will be permitted to write at the Edmonton Indian Residential School under the supervision of one of the teachers on the staff, who is not preparing her in the optional subjects. Kindly advise me as to the name of the presiding examiner selected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. FRED McNALLY\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nEdmonton Indian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nApril 15th 1937.\n\nThe Secretary;\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI am enclosing a letter from the Provincial Department of Education in reference to the coming High School examinations. The point which is somewhat gratifying to me is that the Department has recognised our Household vocational departments as being of a standard to pass educational requirements. That is our sewing room and kitchen have some status. The girls will write examinations on their work, and this will be recognised as having some academic standing.\n\nIn the past the Indian Department has been somewhat mildly critical of me for too much work at the school. Perhaps there is, but if hard grind will bring training and knowledge perhaps it is best. Dr. McGill and Mr. Christianson may appreciate this last note.\n\nI thought the Department might be interested in this item.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nJune 19th, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nFor some years past, children from British Columbia, especially from the Babine Agency, have been placed in the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nAlthough the Department frequently received protests regarding such action, it was considered advisable to give the matter a fair trial. We have now reached the decision that it is undesirable to place any more British Columbia children in the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nThe letter which you recently forwarded in connection with holidays indicates that, for the next school year, there will not be more than seventeen (17) British Columbia children in the Edmonton School. All of these should be discharged as soon as they reach the age limit prescribed by the Indian Act unless there are some very special circumstances. Each of the latter will have to be dealt with on its own merits.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Acting Indian Agent Mallinson, Hazelton, B. C.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nCopy of this letter sent to Acting Indian Agent Mallinson, Hazelton, B. C.\nI may say that I am very unhappy with regard to the lack of progress made by the Indian pupils going to the Residential School near Edmonton. I am told that the B.C. Indians are quite out of touch with various activities there as they are not considered by the Indians on the Alberta side of the Rocky Mountains as of the same stock. If children must be sent to a Residential School, I certainly consider that Alert Bay would be the most suitable. The Indian parents are complaining of the long distance to Edmonton, and the fact that they do not see their children in some cases for years. The whole system of instruction at Edmonton appears to be different to that followed in British Columbia, and I would ask you to support my recommendation if you can see your way to do so.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nJune 1st 1937\n\nThe Secretary;\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn regard to appropriations for this school, for the fiscal year ending March 31st 1938, I would like to be informed so that I might make my plans.\n\nFor many years in the past The Department has made a grant for travel of children to the reserves and back on holidays. I trust this grant will be available this year, especially since it will be necessary to send a number of the B.C. children home on holidays.\n\nThere has also been a grant for advanced education. This has not been very large since all but the most promising pupils have been taken care of in our own class rooms. However a few have in the past attended Alberta College. These have received the grant.\n\nThen there has been a grant for necessary repairs and construction. Early this spring there was an emergency case in the breaking of a water main which cost about $100.00. There have been however a number of other necessary repairs which require to be cared for. Our silo went to pieces last year. The bare material to replace this will cost over $300.00. Labor and other material connected with keeping up the plant is being taken care of out of per capita and school funds, but if possible I would like a grant to take care of this item.\n\nI shall be glad of information as soon as possible.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nRe Transportation\n$300 Granted for 35\n$75 \" \" \" 36\non account of\nlarge Number of\nAdmissions & Discharges\nKispiox B.C.\nApril 26th 1937\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am going to write you this letter to ask you if there is any chance or room in the school there for my grandson Cecil Simpson, Emma's brother. I want to send him there where Emma is at and I'd like to send him after summer work. That's around end of August, please let me know as early as possible if you want to send my grandson because I am well satisfied with Emma learning there. I thank you and Good-bye.\n\nYours Truly,\nMr. Richard Morrison\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nJune 2nd 1937\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have official letters from The Department; one on 17th inst signed by Mr. Hoey No.110-0-10, and the other from Mr. MacInnes of 19th inst. No.110-0-1. Both these letters deal with holidays and attendance of children from the Babine Agency who are now at the Edmonton School.\n\nIn reply to the letter of 19th inst. I may say that I have about come to the conclusion that the time has about come to cease recruiting from the Babine Agency. I am quite aware that the distance is too great for most cases and also that the friction occasioned by protests of parents to this school, the Agency at Hazelton and its reaction on Ottawa is not calculated to once peace of mind. However I would like to add that as far as the purpose of this school is concerned, namely that of educating the child, I think we have maintained our standards. Of the group about to leave, two are in high school, three in Grade VIII, and others in the higher public school grades. We have also done our best along vocational lines. It is nine years since we first brought children from the Babine Agency. Nearly one hundred children have been recruited from that district for this school during the nine years. I trust some good has been done in spite of many natural drawbacks to the venture.\n\nIn my letter of 14th inst. I dealt in somewhat general terms with the holiday situation. Your last letter has somewhat modified\nDetails in regard to numbers and general plans. It might be best to let you have the names of pupils and my recommendations in detail.\n\nI have at present thirty six (36) B.C. children in school. Of this number this morning I sent nine (9) of the older boys home to Hazelton: Viz- Pupil 96-Hubert Brown, 119-Jeffrey Fowler, 127-Roy Harris, 138-Mike Banek, 151-Wm Wilson, 160-Sylvester Moore, 175-Solomon Jack, 153-Peter Brown, and (186-Jeffrey Robinson)\n\nSeven of these boys are 16 years or older. Wm Wilson for some time has had serious neck sores and has been an anxiety to us. I strongly recommend his discharge. Jeffrey Robinson - 15 years - has been a serious problem ever since he came to school, because of his bad conduct. He was brought down two years ago under police escort for bad conduct at Hazelton. I cannot have him longer in the school. The only boy of this group whom I would recommend for return to this school after holidays if he so wishes is Jeffrey Fowler. Jeffrey is 17 years old, is in Grade VII, and wishes to take his Grade VIII. He has been a serious minded boy and has appreciated his work here. When I sent him home this morning, the last thing he said as he left, Can I come back after holidays? I would like the Department to consider this request.\n\nOn June 30th (Wednesday) I am sending the following girls home: 085-Connie Crosby, 0102-Dorothy Johnson, 0110-Cora Lumm, 0143-Edna Stevens, 0157-Alice Gungaut, 0161-Annie McDames. These girls are all over 16 years with the exception of Alice Gungaut who is about 14. She has however given us a great deal of trouble from the health standpoint, and the Doctor strongly advises\nWe do not wish to run the risk here. Every winter it has been a fight with chest trouble.\n\nI have included in this list the name of Annie McDames. Annie as you are aware is taking Grade XII, and the Department has considered allowing her to continue with her Normal School. See your letter (Mr. Hoey) May 1st 1937 No. 504178. The girl has been working hard for two years now, last year did not go home. I considered it wise for her to have a holiday in any case. Of this group of girls this is the only one whom I would recommend that her name be continued on the school roll.\n\nThe following boys are all under the age of sixteen years:-\nJoe Stevens, John Banek, Robt. Green, Clarence Brown, Jim Fowler,\nTommy Danes, Philip Morrison, Matt. Wesley, Arthur Jack, Kelly Morgan, Willis Morgan, Richard Morrison, Philip Crosby. (-13-)\n\nGIRLS-- Hazel Gungaut, Matilda Gungaut, Lavina Dick, Elsie Green,\nElsie Turner, Margaret Johnson, Effie Wilson. (-7-)\n\nPupil No. 090 - Emma Simpson, is now just 16 years old. She is a particularly fine type of girl, is completing her Grade VIII. Her mother has as a rule asked that she remain at school instead of going home to the moral dangers of the village. She herself has never pressed to go home. I have a letter from her grandfather requesting that her young brother be allowed to come to school. I enclose same. I request that this girl's name remain on my roll and that if so desired the brother be allowed to come to school.\n\nAccording to this summary I am asking for the definite discharge of thirteen pupils. The retention of 13 boys plus 7 girls under 16 years, and also the three special cases above named; namely, Jeffrey Fowler, Annie McDames, and Emma Simpson.\nIt will be noted that an analysis of the B.C. children here works out somewhat differently from my first letter which was not intended to be a definite recommendation, particularly in view of your two recent letters which have closed B.C. to further recruiting.\n\nIf the Department insists upon further discharges I would like to make recommendations as there are some whom I would rather see go than others.\n\nIf The Department would allow holidays for the following children with the understanding that they be allowed to return to this school again this fall I would like to have them go for just a holiday. Emma Simpson, Jim Fowler, Tommy Danae, Philip Crosby, and perhaps Willis Morgan. From The Departments letters it is evidently not the intention to immediately close out the entire B.C. group until they reach the age limit.\n\nIn regard to travelling expenses. It cost me $140.40 to send the nine boys to Hazelton yesterday morning. $15.60 each. The six girls next Wed will cost $95.80. The other five mentioned for holidays will cost $46.80.\n\nIf The Department could get a telegram to me by next Tuesday with instructions I could get any who are to go off by bed morning. I would also like to know if the Department approves of the general plan as outlined in this letter. I quite realise that there will be a number of exceptions.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nJune 29th, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letters of the 17th and 23rd instant, in connection with the holidays and attendance of children from the Babine Agency at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. In this connection, I wish to confirm the following night lettergram sent you yesterday:-\n\n\"Reference your letter twenty-third instant Department will pay transportation expenses amounting to two hundred twenty-six dollars and twenty cents for pupils discharged - STOP - Jeffrey Robinson and Annie McDames may return - STOP - Department not prepared to allow expenses for holidays for five pupils mentioned in your letter\"\n\nThe discharge of the following pupils from the Edmonton Residential School is approved:-\n\nNo. 96 - Hubert Brown No. 153 - Peter Brown\n\" 119 - Jeffrey Fowler \" 085 - Connie Crosby\n\" 127 - Roy Harris \" 0102 - Dorothy Johnson\n\" 138 - Mike Banek \" 0110 - Cora Lumm\n\" 151 - Wm.

J. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth\n\nwish to return. Provided they do so, the Department approves of their remaining in the Edmonton Residential School for another year, at the end of which time their cases should again be brought to our attention.\n\nIn the telegram quoted above, the Department authorized the expenses incurred in sending the fifteen (15) children home. In the event of Jeffrey Robinson and Annie McDames returning to the school, you may also submit an account for their return transportation.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is not in a position to allow any expenses for sending home for holidays the other children from the Babine Agency mentioned in your letter.\n\nThe Department approves of Emma Simpson - No. 090 - remaining in the Edmonton School for another year.\n\nIt is noted that thirteen (13) boys and seven (7) girls under sixteen years of age, and also Jeffrey Fowler, Annie McDames and Emma Simpson, all of whom are from British Columbia, will be in the Edmonton School for the academic year 1937-38. At the end of June, next, you should advise the Department regarding the names of the children from British Columbia who, you consider, could be discharged at the end of June, 1938.\n\nIn view of the decision conveyed to you in official letter of the 19th instant, you should inform Richard Morrison of Kispiox that you cannot accept his grandson at the Edmonton School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: J.F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1941\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Sept. 30th 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 Rep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan 16th 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1942.\n\nPrincipal: J.F.

for Quarter:** $62\n\n**Total:** 2225\n\n**Note:** Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1942.\n\nPrincipal: J.P. Woodworth\n\nDated July 3rd 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI declare that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31st, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal J.G.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return, the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 24, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: P. Woodworth\n\nDated July 1st, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10th.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal: J. F. Woodworth\n\nDated Nov. 22nd 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended October 1944.\n\nPrincipal J.F. Woodworth\n\nDated Jan 10 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 463\nReps.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in the quarter of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1915.\n\nPrincipal: J.F. Woodsworth\n\nDated: July 1st, 1915\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, raising it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is obtained by multiplying the \"Average attendance during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return, the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended 30th September 1915.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: 12 October 1915\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in the quarter of pupils shown on the Return, as distinguished by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal: H.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nDated April 24th 1946\n\nPrincipal\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Edmonton School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA, EDMONTON\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Edmonton Alta., this Oct. 17, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, may any be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the EDMONTON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated January 14, 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Winterburn, Alberta, February 5, 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant per quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School Name] School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31st, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nEO Robertson\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Winterburn Alta., this April 14th, 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils on residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the EDMONTON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nEO Robertson\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at EDMONTON INDIAN AGENCY JUL 12 1947 Winterburn - Alta.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 Reg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the name of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n|

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the columns under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils per quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant was allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is obtained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the grant per pupil. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 30th March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of per capita grant. In no case, however, will any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nQUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nand tuition at the UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA, LONDON School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is known.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On the Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1948.\n\nDated Jan. 20, 1949\n\nIndian Agent\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA, Edmonton School for the Quarter ended DEC. 31 1948 Principal\n\nDated JAN. 20 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nE.A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings therefor.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days in quarter\" of the Return for each quarter.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA, EDMONTON School for the Quarter ended Principal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFile No. IJA. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Roll, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant during quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Residential School Quarterly Return\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA, LONDON School for the Quarter ended SEPT. 30TH 1949 Principal\n\nDated OCT 11TH 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nE.E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the columns under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA, EDMONTON School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: April 2, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nE.A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The surfacing is composed of ground slate, carbon black and other ingredients.\n\nThe reverse side of Lithoplate is thoroughly treated with a positive waterproof material.\n\nLithoplate is a perfectly smooth surface and will not show any defects for ten years. It does not warp, bulge or curl. It can be used anywhere and put up by anyone. It is water-proof. It can be washed without injury, but washing is unnecessary. The surface is very hard and will not scratch easily.\n\nIt will not scale, peel, crack, become shiny or reflect the light. All kinds of crayons make clear marks on Lithoplate with slight little dust. The crayon marks are easy, quickly and perfectly erased.\n\nGuaranty\n\nWe expressly guarantee every Lithoplate blackboard for ten years. This Guaranty covers all defects, bulging, curling, breaking, scaling, peeling, smacking, becoming shiny or reflecting. All Lithoplate blackboards are guaranteed.\n\nAvailable\n\nSteel Chairs\nSteel Tables\nChairs and Tables\nPrice of Every\nWHAT LITHOPLATE IS\n\nThe body of LITHOPLATE is composed of pulp board pressed under immense hydraulic pressure into slabs of about one inch thickness. These slabs are baked which are used so extensively and successfully in place of lath and plaster.\n\nAfter being thoroughly dried, four layers of heavy surfaces are glued together. The surface is composed of ground slate, carbonium and six other ingredients.\n\nThe reverse side of LITHOPLATE is thoroughly treated with a non-porous protective material.\n\nLITHOPLATE is a perfect blackboard. It is durable. Every piece will last for many years. It does not warp, bulge or curl. It can be used anywhere and put up by anyone. It is water-proof. It can be washed with a stiff brush but washing is unnecessary. The surface is very hard, pliable and non-porous. It will not scale, peel, crack, become smooth or dull. All it requires is a light crayon mark on LITHOPLATE with slight pressure and little dust. The crayon marks are easily quickly and perfectly erased.\n\nWHERE LITHOPLATE IS USED\n\nLITHOPLATE is used on any kind of a wall, stone, brick, plastered rough boards or bare studding. LITHOPLATE is also used for portable blackboards.\n\nLITHOPLATE is not affected by climatic conditions and is successfully used in all parts of the world.\n\nLITHOPLATE OR SLATE?\n\nThe first cost of LITHOPLATE is much less than that of slate.\n\nThe freight charges on slate are six times greater than on LITHOPLATE. Slate weighs 6 pounds to the square foot and LITHOPLATE but 1 pound.\n\nSlate blackboards are made to order and are rarely shipped promptly. LITHOPLATE blackboards are always in stock and are shipped promptly upon receipt of order.\n\nSlate frequently breaks in transit and installing. LITHOPLATE is not subject to breakage.\n\nCosts on slate is greater than on LITHOPLATE.\n\nTo properly install slate, the services of an expert workman with proper hammers are necessary. This becomes an expense of about $2.00 per square foot or even more.\n\nIf not properly installed, slate blackboards rattle and the joints are uneven as to seriously interfere with successful blackboard work.\n\nLITHOPLATE is perfectly suited by any one who can use a hammer and expend less than 1 cent per square foot.\n\nSlate comes in slabs of about four feet in length, making many joints necessary. LITHOPLATE comes in slabs as long as 12 feet, making few joints necessary.\n\nINSTALLATION OF LITHOPLATE\n\nLITHOPLATE is simply nailed to the wall. Any one who can use a hammer can do a first class job. Full directions every shipment.\n\nGUARANTY\n\nWe unreservedly guarantee every LITHOPLATE blackboard for ten years. This Guaranty covers warping, bulging, curling, breaking, scaling, peeling, cracking, becoming shiny or reflecting the light, providing the blackboards are installed in accordance with the simple directions accompanying each shipment.\n\nSLATE is porous, with the result that crayons are worn away quickly and much dust created; furthermore, the pores become filled with dust and give the blackboard a gray, cloudy appearance and making crayon marks less clear.\n\nLITHOPLATE is not porous, therefore fewer crayons are needed so that it is possible to get better crayon marks and sharp.\n\nSlate is easy to work upon. LITHOPLATE is the reverse.\n\nSlate lasts; but the life of the blackboard is limited to the time the crayon wears out. Slate blackboards soon become rough and becomes rough. LITHOPLATE surface is not porous and does not become rough.\n\nLITHOPLATE AS COMPARED WITH OTHER COMPOSITION BLACKBOARDS\n\nThe real difference in these blackboards is in the surface. The surface of LITHOPLATE is made of four layers of heavy surface applied with a trowel. The surfacer is composed of ground slate and carbonium to make a hard, smooth, non-porous, solid surface to provide for every good feature required in a blackboard.\n\nGround slate and carbonium make a surface, which, by the natural order of things, is dull clear through and will not shine, no matter how much it is polished.\n\nThis cannot be said of other blackboards. The use of the trowel makes possible the applying of the heavy board, hard dull surfacer which provides a blackboard smoother and more durable than can be obtained by brush or any other method.\n\nHOW YOU CAN PROVE IT\n\nRub the surfaces of a piece of LITHOPLATE and any other composition blackboard together for a minute or two. You will soon show that the LITHOPLATE surface is duller than that of the other blackboards.\n\nAnother test: Rub through the surface of the two blackboards with a clean knife. You will find that you would erase ink marks from a piece of paper. Then wipe off the surface with water or a damp cloth.\n\nYou will see that the LITHOPLATE surface does not shine, while that of the other boards will be so slick and shiny that its use as a blackboard will be materially injured.\n\nSELECT YOUR SIZE\n\nThe stock lengths of LITHOPLATE are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 feet. The stock widths of LITHOPLATE are 2\u00bd and 4 feet.\n\nSometimes No. 6 Moulding is used in place of No. 2 Moulding, however it is only necessary in very damp places to keep moisture from injuring blackboard. For No. 2 Moulding we recommend No. 6 Moulding for use with LITHOPLATE.\n\nWESTERN SEATING COMPANY\n222 HARGRAVE ST.\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\nMr. Duncan C.

Another reason for getting through with a matter like this as soon as possible is the fact that at harvest time labor is likely to be rather scarce at prevailing prices.\n\nBoth the contractors and the inspector have inquired of me in regard to the plans of the Department in putting in these systems but of course I have not been able to give any definite answer. I would be glad to know the plans of the Department in this connection. Mr. Claydon has suggested that the work might be done by them on the basis of cost plus a certain commission. I think it would be better to have this work done by these contractors rather than have another set of contractors on the job.\n\nYours Truly;\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth.\nPrincipal.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Edmonton Indian Industrial School, Mr. J.F. Woodsworth, Principal of the School, has asked me to communicate with you with reference to the putting in of the main sewer to the building as soon as possible. His reasons are, that labor is plentiful at present, there being a great many idle men; and if this work is left until August the labor will be taken up in the harvest. I believe his suggestion is a good one, and it would insure the completion of the work before cold weather.\n\nWork on the building is progressing very well. I will send in my first report in a day or so.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\n\nCM/DM\nTELEGRAM\n\nMedicine Hat, Alta., June 22/23.\n\nE.J.

Gershaw, of Medicine Hat regarding the brick for the proposed new Edmonton School, I would refer you to my memorandum of the 12th inst., with reference to this brick.\n\nThe specifications called for a brick of similar quality to that manufactured by the Redcliffe Company. The contractors submitted samples of the Acme Brick referred to in my memorandum, and as this brick is manufactured in Edmonton, I sent a telegram to the Claydon Co. on the 16th inst., advising them that the Acme tapestry brick will be satisfactory for this building.\n\nIn the letter accompanying the samples, the contractors stated that the price of the Acme brick was the same as Redcliffe brick, and that they were willing to use either brick but preferred to use the Acme brick in order to give as much business as possible to local concerns.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMr. Duncan C.

D. McLennan,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Stairs for Indian School.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith two prints of our drawing No. 1 showing scale plan, erection elevation and large scale details of two main stairs for the Indian School, Edmonton, for Architects record and approval.\n\nWe wish to call attention to certain minor changes which we have made in the details of these stairs. We have shown panelled cast iron post in place of panelled steel posts. We have the pattern from which this post is made, and it will make a very much better looking job.\n\nWe have shown the steel risers of 14 gauge in place of 10 gauge and the stringers of 10 gauge in place of 12 gauge plate as called for on general drawings. 14 gauge plate bent to the section we show is what we usually use for risers up to 4'-0\" and is plenty stiff enough but we are very much afraid that 12 gauge for stringers is not enough, not only on account of the stiffness of the material itself but on account of material being so thin that it's hard to rivet to it satisfactorily. The amount of material used in our construction is approximately the same as that shown on general drawings but we believe will make a much more rigid and satisfactory job than the stairs on the general drawing. However, this is altogether immaterial to us and we are perfectly willing to make it as shown.\n\nThe Architect's drawings show a figure of 8'-0\" for the width of the stair well. We have shown this as 8'-0\" between rough walls and if it should be between finished plaster walls we would like this correction made.\nOttawa, July 7th, 1923.\n\nSirs,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, also two blue prints showing detail drawing of the main stairs of the New Edmonton School, and I approve of your drawings, with the changes as mentioned in your letter.\n\nThe measurement for width of stair walls of 8'-0\", would be quite all right, if taken between rough walls, but the Clayton people's attention should be drawn to this.\n\nWith reference to the ceiling heights, these should be built as shown on the plan as no change has been authorized.\n\nI am returning one blue print herewith, approved.\n\nI would also ask you to please send a blue print copy to Mr. Chas. May, 10025, 113th St., Edmonton, Inspector of Construction, for his information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. Guernsey Orr,\nArchitect, Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Manitoba Bridge & Iron Works Ltd.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nIndian Industrial School,\nEdmonton Alta.\nJuly 5th 1923.\n\nThe Secretary:\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn connection with the construction of the new school there is an item to which I would like to draw your attention. In the plans the Department has provided a coal shed at the west side of the building. In discussing this matter with the inspector and the contractors it would appear that this provision for coal will be somewhat inadequate. The bin at best will hold only about a car of coal and this with the amount of room to be heated will during the winter keep us hauling more than should be for cold weather. It would allow of very little reserve. Then I do not think the frame superstructure will correspond with the rest of the building. I would suggest that the space be at least doubled, that there be no superstructure, but that the bin be entirely below the grade, being covered with a concrete slab. This will enable us to drive right over the bin and empty the wagons into proper holes below.\n\nThe contractors have kindly delayed the pouring of the concrete of the bin as at present shown, until this matter has been considered by the Department, I would therefore ask that you reply as soon as possible.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. F. Woodworth.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 11, 1923.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI am returning you herewith your copy of the contract for the erection of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, duly signed by the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(J.

He would like it extended from 8 to 10 feet westward and 9 feet southward. That would bring the south wall over in line with the cross partition of the boiler room. He also desires that the roof of the coal bin be covered with reinforced concrete. It would be necessary in doing so to put in two reinforced beams, one running each way, with an iron column under the centre. There would also have to be at least two coal chutes for unloading. The top of the roof could be carried 1 foot above grade line, leaving 8 feet in the clear for ceiling.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nChas May\nInspector of Construction.\n\nGM/DM\nDIARY JULY 1 - 15, 1923\n\nConstruction of Edmonton Indian Industrial School\n\nSun.

Every cellar forming a part of any house to which these regulations apply shall have a catch basin trap to receive the surface water, including the water from waste drains, from paved surfaces, water tanks or cisterns, gutters, or other pipes collecting or carrying surface water. Where practicable the catch basin traps shall be located near the surface water. Where practicable the catch basin traps shall be located near the top of the main horizontal soil pipe, and shall be at least three feet distant from the said pipe.\n\n326. The arrangement of soil stacks, waste and vent pipes shall be direct as possible. All changes in direction of horizontal pipes shall be made with \"Y\" branches and one-sixteenth, one-eighth or one-sixth bends.\n\n327. The size of the main horizontal soil pipe shall be determined by the floor area of the house and paved surfaces to be drained thereby, according to the following table, viz.:\n\n| Diameter of pipe | Area to be drained |\n|------------------|-------------------|\n| 1 inch...........| 3,106 square feet. |\n| 2 inches.........| 4,873 square feet. |\n| 3 inches.........| 12,973 square feet. |\n| 4 inches.........| 24,130 square feet. |\n\nproviding that the horizontal stack may be decreased in diameter after passing a rupture water leader or surface inlet proportional to the decrease in area drained and based on the rate of flow (not to exceed 3.150 ft. per second in the main horizontal soil pipe, but in no case shall the main horizontal soil pipe be less than four inches in diameter).\n\n328. No inverted joints shall be used in any drainage fixture. No connection to any soil waste or soil pipe shall be made by boring or tapping into pipe by a saddle.\n\n329. In every house where fixtures are connected directly with the plumbing system, there shall be a main vertical soil and ventilating pipe and soil stack which shall not be less than four inches in diameter and shall extend from the main horizontal soil pipe to a point above the roof of such house.\n\n330.

The regulations mentioned call for integral stall type urinals in all public and school buildings, as you will see by clause No. 587 of the enclosed leaflet.\n\nTo install urinals of this type in place of those specified will make additional cost as follows:\n\nOne 3 stall by 18\", complete with porcelain automatic tank, nickel plated supply and spreader pipes .......... $192.50.\n\nOne 3 stall by 24\", as above,......................... 269.00.\n\nStalls quoted above to be similar to plate C-1889, Jas. Robertson Co's catalogue \"G\".\n\nOn Page 69 of the specification, the batteries of basins called for are specified to have continuous waste pipe and one trap for the twelve basins. Clause 587 of the Provincial regulations calls for separate trap to each basin, and there will therefore be required 22 additional traps for the basins and two for wash tubs. This will incur an additional cost of $132.00.\nWill you kindly let us have your instructions on these points at your early convenience, and oblige,\n\nYours truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n(sgd) E.

Awaiting your reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nAugust Ninth\nNineteen-Twenty-three\n\nR. Guerney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE INDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL NEAR EDMONTON.\n\nWhen in Ottawa during May, we discussed the possibility of our deposit cheque of ten per cent being released to us when the job was well on the way. We now make formal request that this be done, if possible.\n\nThere are a few facts about the work, which should be considered in our favor. In connection with this matter, you will note from the Trade Summary sent you sometime ago, that the work done by ourselves, namely carpentry and general masonry, was less than half the building and in this connection, kindly note that we have made a mistake of adding the plastering into carpentry and did not show it separately. Plastering is worth $4,650.00 and should have been listed separately, but in the first place, we figured this work ourselves and it was not grouped separately, so that the figure for carpentry given you in the Trade Summary, should have read; Carpentry - $16,938.00, Plastering - $4,650.00.\n\nThis correction will make about $62,000.00 of our own work and it seems to us, that holding a ten per cent deposit cheque on the whole of the work, in addition to the ten per cent retained, will give the Government a final cash security as the work approaches completion, of nearly $27,000.00 or actually $62,000.00 worth of our work.\n\nWe do not wish to infer from the above that we are not fully responsible for our sub-contractors work, but as may be expected, we are making ourselves secure with respect to them, so that we only regard the deposit as affecting our own work.\n\nWe have no objection to putting up a deposit cheque as a test, in securing work. It is probably necessary and a wise precaution, but the holding of this amount of money in addition\nto the percentage retained, places a burden on the General Contractor, which in our opinion is far beyond the needs of the case and causes a tribute to be paid to money powers, and is no test or guarantee of contract or technical ability required in carrying out the work.\n\nThe retaining of this percentage by the Government is not hampering us in any way with respect to our financial obligations toward the work, but it is a disadvantage now we are looking for other contracts. It appears to us that $14,000.00 of our money is being taken unnecessarily from our bank account, which might be much more profitably employed as deposits for new contracts.\n\nHitherto, we have not met with a contract in any Provincial, Railway, or public work that has required such a heavy percentage of deposit.\n\nThe Province of Manitoba takes a five per cent deposit only, which as the work nears completion is merged into the percentage retained and is thus released to the Contractor, and similar arrangements are common by other bodies in the West.\n\nWe think that we have furnished ample security for the work in taking $10,000.00 worth of plant and equipment to it. We are paying all of our bills promptly, and can assure you that the work is in absolutely safe keeping and being well looked after. May we therefore, ask that the deposit be either returned to us, or if this is not possible, payment may be made to us on the progress statement, on the hundred percent basis instead of ninety percent which has been paid to-date.\n\nThere is another angle at which this question of security deposit can be appraised and this is how this kind of thing affects the trade of the country as a whole. The Government no doubt wish its citizens to do as much as they can in the trade of the country, on as little capital as possible, which goes for much economical development. The further we can make a dollar go, either in bank strength or purchasing power, makes us correspondingly independent of outside borrowed capital, which as we all agree, is one of Canada's disadvantages at the present time. I take more than a passing interest in matters of this kind and trust that this further comparison may not be regarded as out of place.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.

He has replied, enclosing an offer from the Claydon Company.

Does this mean the one main building or all the buildings where the light will be used. I would remind the Department that besides the main school building there are a number of other buildings on the place which should be supplied. There is at present the principal's residence, the farmer's residence, the horse barn, the pump-house, the utility building. In the future there will be the dairy barn beside other buildings. I would suggest that in determining capacity of lighting plant all requirements be taken into consideration.\n\nOn June 10th I wrote the Department regarding the sewer and water works systems particularly in connection with the digging outside the building. I have not yet heard from the Department in regard to this matter, and I think it should be attended to at once.\n\nAnother matter which I have discussed with the inspector and contractor and which they think should receive consideration. In the children's recreation rooms some provision should be made for a gymnasium, and this before the ceiling is closed in. At present there are the \"I\" beams, which afford splendid opportunity to which to attach clamps to which can be attached rings, bars, or other gymnasium apparatus. These clamps could be made at a small expenditure and would save later difficulty in trying to find suitable\nThe building is now going along rapidly and the contractors expect to have it finished by Xmas. Has the Department yet made any provision for furnishing the building? I would suggest that steps be taken to find out the necessary equipment and secure it. I would like to be into the building as soon as possible and to avoid all unnecessary delay.\n\nI have discussed all these matters with Mr. May and the contractors and they think they should receive consideration.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.

Also Blue Print which explain themselves. It certainly seems a lot of money for the disposal of the rain water off the roof. We are going to have a beautiful Building and it would seem too bad to turn the water loose on the ground, which in time might damage the foundations.\n\nThe Superintendent, Mr Woodsworth would like to have a cistern for rain water, either under the laundry floor or just outside the Building next the laundry.\n\nClaydon Co, gave me figures on the cost of same. Size 14 feet in diameter, 8 feet deep built of concrete reinforced, with a concrete slab cover also reinforced.\n\nIt might be all right to have a cistern if they did not have a good well of water. It is soft and I understand from inquiries that it is very good for washing clothes.\n\nThe Farm Superintendent also tells me that it is good for steam boilers and works all right in threshing engines, they are high pressure.\nEDMONTON ALTA, AUG 20TH, 23.\n\nTHE SECRETARY DEPT.

E. Featherston,\n\nWith reference to the attached letter from Mr. D. W. Warner, M. P., enclosing a communication from the representative of the Lister Company of Edmonton, I would say, with reference to the lighting plant as manufactured by the Lister Company, that we have recently been making inquiries in order to ascertain if it were possible to procure an electric lighting plant for our new Indian Residential Schools which would be automatic in operation.\n\nThe Lister people manufacture a lighting plant which is automatic, and from inquiries made, it has proven very satisfactory. With their plant, it will be possible to light the buildings direct from the generator without using the storage batteries. When a small number or lights are burning, the current is drawn from the storage batteries, but over a set number, the machine automatically switches directly on the generator, and I am convinced that this system will be a great saving on the life of the storage batteries which, as you know, are very expensive to install.\n\nIt is our intention to install one of these plants in the Edmonton School also, for the lighting of the new Blackfoot Hospital and the agency buildings.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, September 11th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI am sending you, under separate cover, a blueprint of a sewage disposal plan which has been submitted by you for the Indian Industrial School at Edmonton.\n\nBefore taking a definite decision regarding this work, I would request that you obtain a price from the Layton Company Limited, Contractors, of the main building, for the full execution of a sewage disposal system, as per accompanying plans, including the laying of a separate pipe in the same trench as that of the sewer pipe for rain water. The offer should state the time that will be required for the performance of the work, and it should be understood that that this additional work would be subject to the general conditions of the specification and contract for the main building.\n\nWhen submitting the contractor's tender, kindly advise me whether you consider his estimate a fair and reasonable one, together with any suggestion you might wish to add.\n\nI may say for your information, in case the department should find the amount quoted to be too high, it will then be necessary to invite public tenders in the regular way. You may therefore impress upon this fact when submitting this matter for the contractor's consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nChris.

The whole of it needs renovating and decorating inside. I recommended that all the upstairs be finished with kalsomine with the exception of the bath-room which should have a four foot width of Sanitas on the walls above the base-board.

I have taken a great deal of pains in the preparation of the plan for the septic tank; it is practically the same design as the one you forwarded me that was drawn by Mr. R.B. Owens, Provincial Sanitary Engineer. I called upon Mr. Owens, and he was of great assistance to me. You will note that we have cut off the deep portion, the use of hand valves, and the bucket cleaning, humus chamber, which leaves the plant entirely automatic in operation. The trench or sewer, as you will note on the plan drawn by myself, is carried in a straight line from the building to the septic tank.\n\nThe distance of trench excavation from building to septic tank, and from tank to outlet of natural ravine is 2,400 feet.\n\nLength of 8\" glazed tile pipe, with cement joints, to carry sewage from building to tank - 1,750 feet.\n\nLength of 6\" glazed tile pipe with cement joints, to carry rain and laundry water from building and to discharge affluent from outlet of tank house which connects to rain water drain below tank house - 2,250 feet.\n\nThey have figured on 5 man holes of brick and cement mortar with cast iron covers and frames, placed at stations Nos. 2, 5, 8, 11 and 14. The pipe is to be laid in accordance with levels, etc., indicated on the\nblue-print prepared by myself. The roof of the septic tank is to be the same as that shown on the blue-print of July 1921. The contractors have agreed to cover the building with asbestos slate shingles.\n\nI have checked all figures and think that the tender submitted by the Claydon Co. is reasonable, and would recommend the acceptance of same.\n\nClaydon Co. agrees to have the plant erected and ready for operation in thirty days after receiving acceptance of their tender.\n\nLabor is very scarce and wages high, as the farmers and building trades are employing so many men.\n\nI will forward my diary by tomorrow's mail, and will also return to you the blue-print as it may possibly be a guide to you in your decision.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nGM/DM\n\nEncl.\nOctober 5th, 1923.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe furniture and equipment for the new School at Edmonton, I would suggest that the following be constructed by the Contractors who will erect the building:\n\nCupboards - in the following apartments - Dining-room; Kitchen; Storerooms; Sewing-Room; Laundry; Dairy; Clothes Room; Pantry.\n\nHeavy Tables - in the following apartments:\nChildren's Diningroom; Kitchen; Sewing-room; Laundry; Dairy; Play Room; Pantry.\n\nHeavy Benches - Children's Diningroom;\nSeats to be arranged on iron brackets on the walls in the Pupils' Wash Rooms and Play Rooms.\n\nI have not mentioned the number nor the size.

Slough has sufficient capacity to take care of overflow and rain water. Revised tender from Claydon Co. is six thousand, eight hundred and sixty-five dollars.\"\n\nThe slough mentioned in wire is more of a pot hole than a slough. It is quite dry and will absorb all water that will flow into it. It will no doubt appear to you that the reduction in cost is very small, but that portion of the drain that is cut off, is much shallower than the remaining portion, and would not cost so much for digging. Mr. Woodsworth is quite agreeable to the location.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\n\nCM/DM\nOctober Sixteenth,\nNineteen Twenty Three.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRE - INDIAN SCHOOL, NEAR EDMONTON.\n\nOwing to an error, or for some reason that has not been explained to us, a shortage has taken place in payment of a progress statement with respect to our contract at the above mentioned school, and as we understand that Mr. Orr is leaving for a trip west and most likely by the time you receive this letter, will be away from the city, we are asking your kind assistance in straightening out matters.\n\nYesterday we received a payment of $8744.00, which we believe is a payment on account of progress statement No. 7, of Sept. 17th. Our statement as certified to by Mr. May, the Inspector, showed the amount of $7061.00, so that payment of only $8744.00 leaves a shortage of $3317.00. As far as we understand it, the account being in perfectly good order, we are at a loss to account for the sum paid being less than shown on the statement, as previous accounts have all been paid in full.\n\nWe notice that the amount shown on our progress statement No. 7, for percentage retained by the Department, pending completion of the contract is $8744.00, and the writer is wondering if a mistake has been made in regarding this as the amount due and the figure 8 in the thousand column, taken for a 3, and payment made accordingly. We cannot account for the amount of the payment made to us in any other way. Will you kindly look into the matter for us and have the error rectified and payment of the difference made as quickly as possible?\n\nMay we also have your co-operation in the prompt payment of our progress statement No. 6 which was sent from Edmonton under date of October 1st and also of our progress statement No. 9, which will be forwarded this week.\n\nThe reason we ask this is, that we are tendering on the proposed school on the Blood Indian Reserve, Alberta and\nwill need all the funds we can collect in order to make the necessary deposit with our tender. This tender as you probably are aware closes on the 31st inst. We desire to mail our deposit cheque on the 27th inst., and if you would kindly arrange that funds are passed quickly to us it would be very much appreciated.\n\nWill you also kindly acknowledge receipt of this letter?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nE.

I would draw your attention to the fact that in completing arrangements for these utilities provision should be made to have the principal's house and the farmer's house also connected. In the case of the light I might point out that the principal's house and the horse barn are both wired for the light, but the farmer's house, the utility building and the pump house are not yet wired. I would request permission to call for tenders for the wiring of these buildings and would also ask you to include the connecting of these five buildings in the contract for installation.\n\nIn the case of the water works and sewer these buildings should also be connected with the mains. I may say that the present arrangements in the house is very unsatisfactory involving a great deal of work which should not be prolonged more than is necessary.\n\nIn the case of the farmer's house there should be storm windows. At present there are only one or two. Kindly give me permission to secure competitive prices and have these supplied. I feel that these things should be looked after while we are on this construction program so that it will not be necessary to come back at some future date. All these requests are necessary and should be attended to as soon as possible. Yours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOctober Fifteenth,\nNineteen Twenty Three.\n\nChas.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince writing you on the 16th inst., we have had the pleasure of a call from Mr. Orr, who very kindly took up the matter of our payments, with the result, that a payment of $7061.00 on certificate No. 7, has been wired to the Dominion Bank to our credit.\n\nFrom the above, we judge that the previous payment of $3744.00 was in respect to progress statement No. 8, although it does not agree with the amount of our statement.\n\nIf you will check up figures on statement No. 8, you will find that the sum of $91,608.00 shown as total of work done, is incorrect. It should be $92,258.00\n\nThe correct working out of the latter part of our statement would then be as follows:\n\nTotal amount of work done..................$92,258.00\nBy 10% Retained.............$ 9,225.00\nBy Previous Certificates 76,704.00\nBalance Due..............$ 4,329.00\n\nAs the balance due works out the same as the amount of our statement, you will see that there has been an error somewhere in copying figures, which our representative at Edmonton informs us was the case.\n\nThe payment of $3744.00 referred to as being on account of this statement would leave a shortage of $565.00, which we anticipate you will add to the next statement.\nWe have received from Edmonton today, copy of progress statement number nine showing payment due of $16,448.00, which if augmented by the $565.00, will give us $17,033.00.\n\nIt is the payment of this certificate that we are hoping to have by the 27th inst., and we trust your kind assistance will result in its reaching Winnipeg as requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED;\n\n[Signature]\n\nEC/A.\nONE SEPTEMBER SEVENTEENTH WE WROTE REQUESTING OPPORTUNITY TO TENDER ON ELECTRIC PLANT FOR INDIAN SCHOOL AT STALBERT STOP TO DATE WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED REPLY AND UNDERSTAND SCHOOL WAITING FOR LIGHT PLEASE WIRE SPECIFICATIONS AT OUR EXPENSE SO WE CAN SUBMIT TENDER CAN MAKE IMMEDIATE INSTALLATION ANY SIZE\n\nR O MORRISON DICKINS CO\n\nUSE OUR DIRECT ALL-CANADA-SERVICE TO VANCOUVER, VICTORIA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA POINTS\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa 27 Oct 13\n\nMr. Chene'\n\nIf it necessary to advise the suspect will you please do so\n\nJPP\nMC EDMONTON ALTA 29 OCT 1923\n\nDR D C SCOTT\n\nDEPUTY SUPT GEN DEPT INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA\n\nHAVE SEEN INSPECTOR CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL EDMONTON HE INFORMS ME PROPOSED SEPTIC TANK AND DRAIN APPROVED BY MR ORR ON HIS RECENT INSPECTION FROST SETTING IN WOULD ADVISE HAVING CONSTRUCTION PROCEED AT ONCE INSPECTOR THINKS CONTRACT PRICES REASONABLE\n\nCHAS STEWART\n\n4A\nOTTAWA, October 30, 1923\n\nChas.

I am not very positive about this, however. In carrying out this work it would be necessary for us to erect poles and stretch wire from the school building to the separate out-buildings. Would you kindly let me know by return mail if it will be proper for me to proceed with the said work?\n\nMr. Woodsworth is complaining that the cesspool for his residence has filled up, and he would like an additional hole dug to carry them through the winter.

They found it impossible to secure labor to do the digging, but they secured the services of a machine ditcher, whom they are to pay at the rate of 90\u00a2 per lineal foot.

He refers to a bonus which he was to have received, and also asks whether he should not receive expense money for board and also for the car which he has to use going to and from his work.\n\nKindly let me have a memorandum in this connection, with particulars of the agreement made with Mr. Hey.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nMemorandum.\u2014 July 11, 1923.\n\nMr. Featherston,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 10th instant, regarding the case of Mr. Charles May, now employed as Inspector of the Work during the construction of the Edmonton school, I beg to say that when we were about to advertise this position we requested the Civil Service Commission by requisition to advertise it at $6.00 a day; in issuing the poster, they made the remuneration $6.00 a day plus bonus, but we do not pay bonuses to such temporary employees as Inspectors of Construction.\n\nMr. May wrote us about this a short time ago, and we replied to his letter, explaining the situation, therefore, it will not be possible from him to be paid a bonus.\n\nIt is customary for us to pay reasonable travelling expenses to Inspectors of Construction, and we propose to write Mr. May, with reference to transportation, and shall endeavour to make a reasonable arrangement with him. We are also asking him what expense he will be put to in connection with board.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJuly 11, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have an inquiry, with reference to your salary as Inspector of the Work during the construction of the Edmonton school. First, as to whether a bonus could be paid, and, secondly, whether expense money for board and/or your car when going to and from the work could be allowed you. In this connection I beg to say that, as I wrote you on the 19th ultimo, no bonus can be allowed you in addition to your remuneration, as this is not paid to Inspectors of Construction. Through a clerical error it was included by the Civil Service Commission in the poster advertising the position.\n\nWe would be willing to pay you reasonable expenses, however, and would ask that you let me know whether you own your own car, and, if so, what you would consider a fair allowance for the use of this in going to and from the work, also what expense you are put to in connection with board. On receipt of your reply, I will give the matter further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCharles May, Esq.,\n10025 - 113th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION\n\nVOUCHER\n\nName: Chas.

This engine was put in over a year ago as a makeshift, it being the only method we had of pumping water. It is an old Fairbanks-Morse skid engine over eleven years old which I brought from Red Deer. It has been used for all sorts of farm uses. It is now thoroughly worn out and unsuited for the task of pumping water. It will be necessary to have an engine which will stand up to the work of giving sufficient pressure to the water supply in the main building. I think Mr. Orr understands the entire situation. Mr. May confirms the opinion expressed in this letter, and thinks that we might give this engine a chance. The price is about half of regular price, this being an engine which has had a few days running and if guaranteed, I shall be glad of an early reply.\n\nYours Truly;\n\nJ. F.

Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr: Re Edmonton Indian Industrial School\n\nYours of December 27th received, re Leister engine for pumping plant.\n\nI have just called the Leister representative on the telephone, and he states that he will be pleased to have any expert examine the engine. It may be set up in place, and if found not satisfactory they would take it back. The representative said he would give a guarantee to this effect. In my opinion it is advisable to purchase an engine for this work. The old engine is knocking, and in very poor condition; it should be taken down and put in proper shape. The best pressure we can get from it at the present time in pumping water to the pneumatic tank is 50 pounds, which is not sufficient to properly flush closets on the top floor. I would strongly recommend the purchase of this 9 horse-power Leister engine, which I believe has been used very little. However, I will see that a competent man examines the engine before it is set in position, and if not satisfactory will notify you personally.\n\nWith kind regards, and wishing you a happy and prosperous New Year, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\n\nCM/DM\nDear Mr. May:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo with reference to the purchasing of a second hand Lister engine for the pumping plant at the Edmonton School, and in reply I beg to say that you are authorized to purchase and have this engine installed providing the same is guaranteed by the Lister Company, and you are well satisfied that the price they are asking is fair and reasonable. It would be well to have the engine in operation for some time before the account is presented to the Department, also I note that you are having the engine examined by a man competent to judge whether the engine is in good working condition.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

Guernsey Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will remember that during the progress of the Edmonton School we brought up the question of sales tax, but finally decided to leave it until the work was complete. The standing of this matter is as follows:\n\nWhen the sales tax was first imposed, it was generally understood that it was not collectible on Government work or purchases and as far as we were able to find out, the collection of it was not insisted on by the tax department.\n\nA number of our supply men and subcontractors quoted us without adding sales tax under the impression that it was not imposed, with the result, that when we came to purchase the material and close out contracts, we had to allow tax. In putting through the work however, we have been successful in having taxes borne by more than half the work, but we enclose herewith an account showing balance allowed and paid by us.\n\nThere is one exception to the above and that is the Standard Plumbing and Heating Co. They are claiming $400.00 for sales tax which they distinctly understood would not be imposed, but we have not yet paid it to them.\n\nDuring the progress of this work we made efforts to get relieved of this tax by appealing to the collector of taxes in Winnipeg, but the ruling now is, that while in some cases collection has not been insisted on owing to ambiguity, there have been no exceptions made since 1922 and since that time, the sales tax has been collected on all transactions excepting on goods supplied to and paid for by the Government.\nOttawa, Jan. 29, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Claydon:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 24th instant with reference to the Sales Tax on materials supplied on your Edmonton contract, I beg to say that I have taken this matter up, as outlined in your letter, with the Chief Accountant of the Department, and he has advised me that you should obtain from the tax collector a receipt for the taxes paid, and also have this certified to by Mr. May to the effect that the materials were used on the Edmonton School.\n\nWhen this information has been received the matter can be given further consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Indian Affairs.\nFebruary 6th, 1924.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada,\n\nDear Sirs:-\n\nWe are sorry to inform you that the plant which we installed for your department at the Indian School at Edmonton met with a serious accident in the latter part of December. This trouble has been put right and we have withheld writing you until we got full particulars and facts concerning same.\n\nThe broken parts have been brought in namely; cylinder, connecting rod, piston and a few other small parts and show without a doubt that the trouble was caused through insufficient lubrication and this was due, there is no doubt in our mind to gross carelessness on the part of the attendant.\n\nThe cylinder and piston show distinct signs of scoring and shredding due to lack of oil and when this condition existed, the connecting rod below it would naturally suffer more. As a consequence the hobbitt bearing was burned out, breaking the connecting rod and driving the piston through the head of the cylinder.\n\nAs soon as we were advised we supplied new parts and immediately put the plant in condition again as you were aware. The Government Superintendent on the construction job was entirely satisfied at the way we left the plant operating previous to this and gave us a release and we are satisfied that Mr. May would not have given this if there had been any apparent trouble visible.\n\nWe have asked the contractors, Claydon Bros., to look at these parts and there contention was the same as ours, carelessness in looking after the plant.\n\nYou have no doubt, before this received full detailed report from Edmonton in this connection but as stated before we have said nothing until the broken parts were returned to us for examination which is the only thing that anything can be based on as to what caused the accident.\n\nWe would appreciate hearing from you in reference to this in case you have different views in the matter as we have the parts here for examination by anyone who cares to see them and feel satisfied that anyone can be convinced that the trouble was caused as outlined above.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A. LISTER & COMPANY LTD.\n\nPer.\nOttawa, Feb. 12, 1934.\n\nSir:-\n\nThe Department has been advised by the R.A. Lister Co. that a serious accident happened to the lighting plant at the Edmonton school, and that the break in the engine was due to carelessness in the operating of the plant.\n\nI would ask you to please let me have a full report covering the accident to the lighting plant. If the engineer recently appointed to look after this installation is not competent to properly operate the machine, it will be necessary for the Department to take up with the Reverend Principal the appointing of a man qualified to operate this plant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

He states that when he returned, after being away about twenty minutes, the engine had stopped. The bearing on one of the pistons of the crank shaft had broken loose, and had driven the cylinder through the head of the engine. I arrived shortly after the accident, and asked the man how it happened. He told me that he had examined the crank shaft and piston a short time before the accident, and that the engine was cool and apparently running all right. He said that he had taken a crow bar and tested the bearings to see that they did not have too much play.\n\nWhen the Lister people were setting up the plant, the engineer stated that he knew very little about gasoline engines, but they instructed him in every possible way so that he would be able to run it. This man is very thoroughly conversant with the running of the boilers and heating plant of the building, and is doing very good work. He feels very badly about the accident, and since then he seems to be getting along very well with the electric lighting plant. I believe he is now well acquainted with the operation of the engine, and by my opinion will get along all right. I would have written you about this matter sooner, but I was waiting to see how he got along. The Lister representative in Edmonton, who repaired the engine\nat the time, had no complaints to make when I asked him if he thought it was the fault of the engineer.\n\nI believe that it would be a mistake to change engineers at the present time. I am quite satisfied that this man now understands the engine and will be quite satisfactory. On the other hand, if another man were engaged, it would take some time before he would be thoroughly acquainted with the plant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nCM/DM\nit is 4 inches in diameter, and that the water rises to within 75 feet of the surface.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nCM/DM\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\n10025 - 113th St., Edmonton, Alta.,\nFebruary 29, 1924.\n\nMr. R. Guernsey Orr,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir: Re Edmonton Indian Industrial School\n\nReferring to your letter to me #110-0-5, dated January 10th, re purchase of second-half Lister Engine for pumping plant at the Edmonton school, I beg to say that I have not purchased the engine, and the more I see of this plant in operation the less I think of it. When the school is opened it would require practically the full time of two men to operate the plant. The maximum pressure of this engine is 50 pounds, and that lasts only a very short time and requires pumping at frequent intervals. When Mr. Claydon completed the contract and was leaving for home, I asked him if he would be good enough to get prices and particulars of a pumping equipment which would act automatically. I have just received a communication from him in which he sends me prices and information on this equipment from the Milwaukee Air Power Pump Co., Milwaukee, Wis. He also states in his letter that his brother, Mr. E. Claydon, has left for Ottawa, and is in a position to take this matter up with you and explain it more thoroughly than I could do in a letter.\n\nI trust that this will be satisfactory to you, and if there is any further information that I could give you from here, I would be very pleased to do so.\n\nWhile out at the School today, I asked Mr. Woodsworth the size of the pipe in the well. He tells me\nENGINE IN PUMP HOUSE HAS GIVEN OUT WILL HAVE TO HAVE TEMPORARY POWER WILL I PUT IN A USED LISTER ENGINE\n\nCHILDREN: ARE THERE SCHOOL RUNNING: ANSWER\n\nC MAY INSPECTOR\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nOttawa, March 12, 1924.\n\nChas.

May,\n1025 - 113th Street, City.\n\nReferring to our conversation today regarding the Brantford Oil Engine, we have pleasure in quoting you as follows:\n\n1 - 9 H.P. Brantford Diesel Type Oil Engine, complete with forced lubricator, fuel tank in base and necessary pulley.\nPrice erected on your foundations at Indian School North of Edmonton Dunvegan Yards $580.00.\n\nThis price also includes the services of our man being on the ground to start the engine and give your operator any necessary instructions.\n\nThe Brantford Oil Engine has no carburetor or electric ignition of any kind, and as 80% of the trouble with the carburetor type of engine is either in the carburetor or the ignition, all this trouble is eliminated in this engine.\n\nRegarding fuel economy, we will guarantee that this engine will use only 5/8 the amount of kerosene or other cheap fuel that the gasoline engine takes. In other words, our engine would only take .6 of a pound of fuel per B. H. P. Hour. We also guarantee that this engine will deliver its full horse-power load on the pulley, and we will replace any breakages that may occur during the first year due to any flaws or poor mechanical construction, fair wear and tear excepted.\n\nWe now have a great number of these engines in use in Western Canada, and most of the country grain elevators are now using them, including such people as the Gillespie Grain Company, Alberta Pacific Grain Company, United Grain Growers, Pioneer Grain Company, Maple Leaf Milling Company, etc. We also have engines in use by such people as the Provincial Government of Alberta, R. C. M. Police, C. P. Railway, etc., and in many cases the engine is saving sufficient fuel in one year to pay for itself.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEMPIRE ENGINEERING & SUPPLY CO. LTD.\n\nPER.

Lister & Co., Ltd., Gorman's, Ltd., Wm. D. Graham, and the Empire Engineering and Supply Co., Ltd. Out of the four I chose the Lister 7 H.P. engine at a cost of $440.00, for which I enclose invoice in duplicate.\n\nThe price of $580.00 is quoted by the Empire Engineering and Supply Co., Ltd., for a 9 H.P. engine - the only one they had in stock. Gorman's Ltd, quote a price of $346.00 on a 6 H.P. Nova Vertical Kerosene Heavy Duty Engine, which was the only engine they had in stock. I did not consider 6 H.P. a strong enough engine to run the pump, and it would have taken them some time to get in one of higher power. Wm. D. Graham quotes on a 10 H.P. Fairbanks Morse Z engine at $560.00, which I did not care to consider.\n\nThe Lister engine is a splendid machine, and is guaranteed by the Company. They claim they will be ready, if anything gives way, to replace the part and put it in good running order. The engine has been in use for quite a number of days, and is working beautifully.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nOttawa, April 1st., 1924.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI return herewith the account of Messrs.

They have been forwarded to Mr. May for examination and approval and as you will see have been returned O.K'd by him.\n\nThere is one item which as we told you before, has not yet been paid by us. We refer to the contract with the Standard Heating & Plumbing Co. and in this connection we enclose our contract with this firm showing how clearly the arrangement was made that sales tax should accrue to them. They at first refused to sign this contract on the ground that there was no definite promise by us to assume the tax, but after us reminding them that we had the matter up with you and expected to get some consideration, they signed as we wished and the matter has been standing in abeyance since that time. They are of course, fully paid up on their contract. This is the one outstanding item between us.\n\nThe only other sub-contract on which we had a definite undertaking on sales tax, was the Gillis quarries, Ltd. and to show you how that has been arranged, we enclose their own statement to us regarding it.\n\nWe trust you will find all in order and duly pass for payment in the current fiscal year, as arranged.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPresident.\nOttawa, April 9, 1924.\n\nSir:-\n\nReplying to your letter of the 28th ultimo with further reference to the sales tax paid in connection with your contract for the Edmonton School, addressed to the Architect, I beg to say that before payment can be made it will be necessary to obtain a receipt from the tax collector to the effect that all of the monies which you state have been paid, and as shown on your account, have been received by him. Also it will be necessary to pay the Standard Heating & Plumbing Company's account of $400.00 and obtain a receipt from them.\n\nIf you will refer to letter of Jan. 25th, you will note that you were advised that it would be necessary to obtain a receipt from the tax collector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

I should have at least another 100.\n\nAlso 100 official envelopes addressed to the Department.\n\nWe are badly in need of some kind of platforms and walks about the doors. The mud around the school makes it very difficult to keep things clean. I would also like a few sacks of cement to make a floor in one of the out buildings which we are fixing up as a dairy. I would ask the Department for 100 sacks of cement to do the immediate work necessary. We have enough sand and gravel left over from the construction to do considerable work and we will use our own labor. The cement is all we require at present.\n\nYours Truly;\n\n[Signature]\nJ. F. Woodworth\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 12, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with reference to cement which is required for sidewalks around the main building at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. In reply I have to authorize you to purchase one hundred bags, after securing competitive prices. When you are submitting the account, in duplicate, in favour of the firm given the business, it should be properly certified by yourself and supported by a statement showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nYour requisition for application forms and envelopes is receiving attention. In future, please confine each letter to a single subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nI draw this to your attention, because there seems to be no check. Inexperienced people go ahead and make recommendations and are permitted to go on with the work. It is clearly demonstrated here what money has been wasted.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have just returned from the Province of Alberta where I have been for nearly three weeks. I visited the Blood, Peigan, Sarcee, Blackfoot, Hobbema and Edmonton agencies and eight Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nI next visited the new Edmonton School. There were about sixty children in attendance when I was there. The Institution had only been open two weeks. There is going to be some difficulty in getting this school up to the required attendance, although I do not think we would have much difficulty in getting one hundred children.\n\nThe main building is a beautiful structure, well finished; but unfortunately the water system is at present an absolute failure, and from what I can gather the installation was carried out in accordance with the plans and specifications. The supply is utterly inadequate, and only about half the system can be worked at a time. I believe the system is unsuitable. My reason for saying this is that this pressure system has been discarded by the Alberta Government in all their public institutions. The gravity system is used in penitentiaries, gaols, hospitals, etc. I am told the Engineer has had to pump as often as eleven times a day to keep pressure, and if he only pumped two or three times a day, he would not begin to keep water even for domestic purposes. I have had the opinions of experts on this, and they tell me the plant will not supply one-half of the water required at the institution. These opinions are backed up by the plumbing Engineer, the resident man, who is now operating the machine and the principal of the Institution.\n\nThe stable at this Institution is the most elaborate in the Province of Alberta. It cost about three times as much as a stable providing the same accommodation should cost. I have heard a great deal about this stable all over the province. It is well advertised. The General Utility building is altogether too elaborate, and the same accommodation could have been provided for half the amount. I believe $60,000 was expended, and all we have for this is a horse stable and a General Utility building and two residences. At the outside value these would be about $5000 or $6000 each.\n\nI understand that fencing of a section and a half of land has been completed. Whether this was entirely necessary I am not prepared to say. I do know, however, that the fence could have been put up for one-half the money. I should say there was a useless expense here of $1500.00.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring my recent visit at Edmonton I was impressed with the necessity of something being done for the boys and girls in the way of outdoor sports. I would request that the Department send the following:\n\n- Half Doz. Footballs, Bladders & Covers.\n- Two Basket Balls.\n- Half Dozen Volley Balls.\n- Base-ball outfit for boys and one for girls.\n- Swings for both boys and girls.\n\nIn this connection there ought to be put up at once a high wire fence surrounding a yard for the girls to play in. This could be done by running the fence north from the rear end of the main building about 100 yards and then east around a little poplar grove about 200 yards, then south, joining the fence along the roadside. About 600 yards would be necessary, and should be of the strongest and about the highest in strands made. If the Department furnish the material for the swings the staff could put them up and also build the fence.\n\nTrusting this will receive favorable consideration, I am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\nApril 24th 1924.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWhen Rev. T. Ferrier was here recently we took up the matter of a fence for the girls yard. This is very necessary, as at present there are no bounds whatever and supervision is made extremely difficult. There is a small clump of trees on the girls side of the building and I think it a good idea if this would be included in the yard. It will take approximately 80 rods of fencing to give us the yard we wish. This fence should be six feet high of page wire to give the best satisfaction. I do not wish a high board fence. It is too much like a prison, and yet the problem of supervision of the girls requires a good fence. Mr. Ferrier authorized me to get this fence when he was here. I would like the Department to sanction this expenditure.\n\nYours Truly;\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. G. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 30th, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, regarding the fencing of a playground for the girls at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase of the wire fencing required, not exceeding an expenditure of approximately $110. You should obtain competitive prices, and purchase the wire from the firm quoting the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, in favour of the merchant from whom the purchase is made should be forwarded, together with an abstract showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nThe posts required and the labour in putting up the fence should be supplied by the school without expense to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Woodsworth,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, April 29, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier:\n\nWith reference to the placing of the bread mixer at the Edmonton School, I beg to advise you that the Department approves of placing this bread mixer in the room marked Store Room, which is adjacent to the bakery, and also of placing a gasoline engine to operate this bread mixer in the room marked Dairy Room.\n\nYou may also have eight feet of partition removed between the store room and the bakery, the ceiling joists to be supported, when the wall is taken down, by a 6 x 10 wood beam.\n\nI understand that the gasoline engine, which it is proposed to use is already at the school. The Department approves of these changes being made, providing all the necessary work will be performed by the school staff.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. Holman\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nPrin. Brandon Indian School,\nBrandon, Man.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.,\nApril 1st, 1924\n\nMr. W.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner;\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to report regarding the laundry department of this institution;\n\nSince opening the school some three weeks ago we have not been able to use the laundry as at present furnished. This is for the following reasons. First, we have not sufficient water in reserve to supply the demands which would be made by the machinery installed. As it is with the toilets shut off we are barely able to keep up the pressure for ordinary household needs. Secondly, the laundry is not a safe place for the girls to work. The amount of belting on line shafts and the elaborate machinery makes it too great a risk without further safeguards. Thirdly, in order to properly handle the department we will require an experienced laundryman or woman at a salary which this institute cannot afford to pay out of its per capita grant. At present we are sending our laundry to town as the easiest solution of the problem.\n\nWhile we appreciate the spirit and purpose of the Department in giving us such an up-to-date equipment in the laundry, still I believe that a much simpler plant would have been better. We could well do without several of the more expensive units and thus have our laundry more fitted to the needs and limitations of our school life. I might add also that from the standpoint of instruction and education it would be more practical for the Indian girl or boy.\n\nI submit the above as my experience and recommendation in regard to the laundry.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., April 7th, 1924\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter I have received from Mr. J. F. Woodsworth, Principal of the Edmonton Industrial School, with reference to the laundry which was recently installed at that school. I am enclosing this letter, so that you will get Mr. Woodsworth's views first-hand.\n\nI do not know what this plant cost, but Mr. May, in a letter to me on the subject, says it cost in the neighborhood of $500.00; but I am not in a position to say. I have no doubt that the plant is too elaborate altogether, and we will not get the results, so far as training of pupils is concerned, that we should. Two small electric washing machines, and a couple of hand-power machines with wringers, at a total cost of about $400.00, would meet the situation just as well; that is, as far as the actual washing is concerned; the drier I have no doubt is necessary. I know that these machines work at other places, and could have been installed here.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nApril 11, 1924.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThe attached letter from Mr. Commissioner Graham gives rise to certain general questions, relative to the laundry and its equipment at Indian residential schools. The activity in the laundry serves a dual purpose - the washing for the institution is done and the older girls receive instruction.\n\nIn a modern institution of 100 pupils and staff, a sufficient number of labour-saving machines should be installed to permit the washing and sterilizing of the clothes to be done with enough despatch to eliminate the irksomeness attendant upon too many days' labour per week. I believe that power machines for washing, extracting and drying are desirable in the larger institutions. The washer should be fitted with steam connections, so that the clothes may be sterilized. A small steam boiler also is therefore required. This equipment is used for the regular bi-weekly washing of bed clothing, under clothing, shirts, dresses, aprons, etc.\n\nThe officer in charge of the laundry regularly gives the girls instruction in the steps to be taken with an ordinary domestic washing. An assortment of articles to be washed is run through by hand for instructional purposes. Further, the girls will receive other experience as in an institution there are certain articles that can best be done by hand and frequently there is clothing to be boiled and washed at short notice. There is plenty of opportunity for instructing the laundry girls in ironing as this is all done by hand.\n\nFor the work that is being undertaken by hand the laundry should be equipped with a receptacle for boiling small quantities of clothes, flat irons, a box stove for heating them, stationary tubs and two or three hand wringers. Large wooden receptacles for soiled clothes and tables for ironing and setting complete the equipment.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nMr. Woodsworth, Principal of the Edmonton Residential School, informs me that there is no slope whatever to allow the water in the washrooms to drain to the sewer. He says in some parts of the floor the water has to be swept up-hill, as there seems to be a ridge across the centre of the room. He says very little can be done to remedy this without considerable expense. He suggests that with very little expense sewer connection could be made with the boiler room. There are no proper drains in this room, and they have difficulty in washing off the floor; and with two traps and some connections, this very desirable improvement could be effected.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 7, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nA letter has been received from Mr. Graham, in which he states that he has received a letter from you advising that water lies on the floors of the wash rooms, and that this could be remedied by building a drain to connect with the boiler room.\n\nWill you please advise me of the exact rooms where you are experiencing this difficulty, and also inform me how you propose to connect up with the drain in the boiler room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I presume you have this information, and I would be glad if you would pass it on to me.\n\nMight I ask also if the school authorities have been given to understand that this amount has been set aside for building at this point; if so, there is no doubt they will expect the full amount to be spent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner\n\nD.

The Church authorities have requested the Department to build a cow barn, a piggery, an implement shed and a chicken house. As I informed you in my general letter of April 16th, last, careful consideration should be given before further expenditure is undertaken at this school. Please make a recommendation as to what buildings you would advise proceeding with at this time and estimate the cost. $10,000 is available for these purposes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I may say that in the wash rooms there is unfortunately no slope to the drains and in fact across the center of the room there is a ridge which makes washing the rooms rather difficult. However as the floors are of terrazzo it will be impossible to remedy this without breaking up the floor which would be inadvisable, therefore I have no recommendation to make.\n\nIn the matter of the boiler room drainage, this is another matter and since the visit of Mr. Paulin of Regina this has been remedied.\n\nYours Truly;\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nC. REGINA, SASK., June 16, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOn the 16th April you sent me a list of the amounts provided in the Estimates for buildings in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and instructed me to proceed with the construction of same.\n\nIn looking over this list I find that the details of what is actually to be built are not given. Edmonton School was one in point.\n\nOn the 23rd of May I wrote you regarding the requirements, and how the $10,000.00 was to be spent. It was necessary to have this information and I naturally thought you had it in Ottawa when you placed this figure in the Estimates. Evidently this information is not in the possession of the Department. You ask me now, after giving me authority to put up these buildings, to make a recommendation as to which of them should be proceeded with at this time. Am I to go all the way up there to get this information, make a report, then wait for an answer from the Department, and then go ahead with the arrangements for the building, purchasing material etc. We will get started some time before the end of August if this is the way we are going to do business. Had the erection of these buildings been placed in the estimates on the recommendation of your officers in the field we would not be up against this most unsatisfactory state of affairs, and I can assure you that position occupied by me is most undesirable. The work can be done and thousands of dollars saved if it is handled in the way it should be handled.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent Gen.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJune 23rd, 1924\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in reference to the proposed erection of out-buildings in connection with the Edmonton Industrial School. In view of the circumstances I have decided for the present not to proceed with this work, and you may cancel any instructions which you have received in reference thereto.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\nJune 21st 1924.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIt will be necessary this summer to do some painting and freshening up. During the holidays some of the rooms in the school will have to be calcimined, there is also considerable painting to do around the residences which was left incomplete. I hardly know how much it will take, but we will be careful and do all the work ourselves. I would request permission to do the necessary work around the various buildings.\n\nYours Truly;\n\nJ.T. Woodsworth.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 27, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, requesting permission to undertake some painting and calaminining in the rooms of the Edmonton Indian Residential School and around the residence. In reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to authorize the expense required in having any work of this nature carried out. It is thought that this work can very well stand over for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAust. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File":
