Day School\n\nTeachers' Salary Payments\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, July 9, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI beg to inform you that Margaret Regis, teacher of Primary Class, in Kateri School, will probably have to give up teaching for at least one year. Her health is very poor.\n\nShould she not be prepared to resume her duties next September, would the Department authorize me to hire Violet Snow to replace her? Violet obtained her Superior Diploma from Montreal University three years ago.\n\nAnnie Snow, Violet's sister, teacher of Primary Class in Eastern School for six years, also has her Superior Diploma and receives but $650 per year, whereas Miss Regis' salary is $750. Miss Snow often expressed the wish to get as much as Miss Regis, $750. I submit her request to your consideration.\n\nPlease accept kind regards from\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 12, 1934.\n\nReverend and Dear Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to a proposed change in the teaching staff of the Caughnawaga R. C. schools.\n\nAs I personally informed you, any change in staff at an Indian day school must now be submitted to the Superintendent General for his approval. I would, therefore, appreciate your advising me as soon as you are certain whether or not Miss Regis intends to give up duties this year. Your letter does not state definitely if she has decided to quit. On receipt of this information, I will submit the matter to the Minister's office, and I do not anticipate there will be any difficulty in having Miss Violet Snow appointed to succeed her.\n\nOwing to present regulations, I regret that it is not possible to make any change in salaries. Consequently, Miss Annie Snow's salary cannot be increased to $750 a year. For the past two years, very definite instructions have been given that no teacher's salary can be increased. It might be possible, in the event of Miss Violet Snow being appointed, to start her at $650 and pay Miss Annie Snow $750. This would not make any change in the total salaries at the Caughnawaga schools, and, at the same time as Miss Violet Snow is only commencing, she is possibly not entitled to start at the higher salary rate.\n\nAs mentioned above, you should let me know definitely your wishes in the matter at as early a date as possible, in order that we may follow the procedure which we are required to do.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Sister Mary Francis,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1934.\n\nReverend and Dear Sister,\n\nI trust that you and Sister Mary Francis reached home safely and was very much pleased to have the opportunity of meeting you.\n\nYou will remember that I mentioned to you that, owing to recent regulations, we are endeavouring to regularize the positions held by Mr. Albany Robert, Mr. Joseph Gatien and Mrs. Joseph Gatien.\n\nWe have already received cards from the above, but it is necessary for us to have application forms. I enclose three copies in English and three copies in French.\n\nPlease arrange to have them complete the form, giving the information requested and return same to the Department as soon as you can conveniently do so. It is not necessary to fill in one form in French and one form in English. Only one form for each is necessary but the two different kinds are sent so that they can reply either in French or in English.\n\nYou will note that I have marked the first three questions on each form \"do not answer\". We will complete the information required in regard to these three questions.\n\nYou will, also, note on page 6 that, when either one of them signs, it is necessary to have a statutory declaration taken before a Notary Public or Justice of the Peace. In this connection, I may say that it will be sufficient to have Mr. Letourneau sign each of the three forms.\n\nYou understand that it is not a case of written examinations but these forms are required as a matter of record and you should so explain to each of the three concerned. I realize that these forms are not exactly applicable to the positions they hold, but the same question is asked of all applicants and the same form used. Any questions that do not apply to their particular position need not be answered. I am sorry to give you this trouble but I feel that you can explain the form to them fully and assist them in completing same.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Sister Cleophas,\nR. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Allen,\n\nThe following changes in teachers at Caughnawaga R.C.

If I am correct this simply means General Treasurer but does not say Treasurer of what organization.\n\nMy own suggestion would be to have them registered in the official name of your Order. By so doing there will be no difficulty in establishing ownership whenever the certificates are due for payment. If you wish to follow my suggestion it would be appreciated if you would let me know immediately the name under which your Order holds its charter. Possibly this is Sisters of St. Anne but I thought it preferable to obtain this information from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Sister Jean de Dieu,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga R.C.

We certainly appreciate it and we are still hoping that something will be done to the porch. Are we expecting too much?\n\nMay we ask you to authorize us to spend $100.00 for sewing materials for the use of the pupils for the school year 1942-1943?\n\nWe have heard nothing about the stocking business since your last letter telling us that someone would get in touch with us. Is the project to be abandoned? We are awaiting further news before purchasing the twisting head for the Spinning Wheel.\n\nSeveral times we have taken up the matter of having a mimeograph for the R.C.I.S., and every time we were assured that something would be done about it. We are not asking for a new one but we certainly could put a duplicating machine to good use. For example, many hours have been spent in searching records in order to make up a History of Caughnawaga. We had planned to mimeograph these notes and place them in the pupils' hands. Many other projects could be handled in the same way. Could you lend a helping hand in obtaining one for us?\n\nWe thank you for your kind attention to all these matters and we beg to remain\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R.

A few weeks ago I discussed with the Surveys & Engineering Branch the desirability of undertaking certain repairs to the porch. I regret to state, however, that in view of existing conditions there is not even a remote possibility that these repairs can be undertaken at this date. This applies also to the mimeograph unit referred to in the second last paragraph of your letter. Few people, other than the officials at Ottawa, realize the difficulty we are experiencing these days in securing certain supplies. I have in mind particularly typewriters, furnaces for Indian day schools and repairs for such furnaces. As a matter of fact all of us must realize that this nation is fighting for its existence and that the days ahead will demand the exercise of a great deal of self-sacrifice and the exercise of a great deal of patience on the part of all of us. We are constantly reminded, however, that at the end of the war there are likely to be huge surpluses of supplies that will be, at that date, available for our schools. In the meantime it would appear that we can do nothing, other than to make the best possible use of the limited supplies at our disposal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSister M. Jean de Dieu,\nPrincipal,\nR.C.

At the same time, be sure, that I do realize war conditions and that our appeals to the Department will be only the absolute necessary ones till brighter days come.\n\nWe do wish to do our share in cooperating with the Department and I fully understand your own difficult problems.\n\nWith deepest gratitude to you for your interest in our welfare, I am\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Doucet:\n\nOur classes have begun since September 17 and all our pupils seem very well disposed and ready for hard work.\n\nHowever, since we have not as yet received the School Arithmetics called for in our requisition, we are somewhat handicapped. Could you obtain 48 copies of Canadian Problem and Practice Arithmetic, Book III (New Edition). If at all possible, we would appreciate receiving the Work Book in Arithmetic (No. 7) to accompany this textbook, (Dunn & Company, publishers)\n\nWe are also short of one dozen Work Books in English Usage and Composition for Grade 7 as prepared by T. W. Woodhead (New Edition) (J. M. Dent & Sons Ltd., publishers)\n\nWe again called for an old mimeograph but we understand that these machines are very much needed by the Department. Since we cannot expect any help from that source, could you furnish us again with twelve Repeater Gelatine Pads. Those we received last year are all gone. These came from the L. A. Reeves Ink Co., Toronto. We will be perfectly satisfied with these pads as since reception of Mr. Hoey's letter, we understand still more how difficult it is to obtain things in these war days.

We are attaching a copy of these articles called for on our requisition for the scholastic year 1945-1946.\n\nFurthermore, we have had a long conference with Mr. Wescott, the Inspector, regarding a programme to be followed by our Ninth Year. This year, we have twelve boys and five girls in this class and if you approve, we would attempt the following programme with them:\n\n1. Religion - Scripture - Liturgy (all books on hand)\n\n2. English Grammar and Composition:\n   \"An English Highway\" -- Moon & McKay\n   (Published by Longman's, Green & Co.)\n\n3. English Literature: \"Loyola Book of Verse\"\n   (Published by the Loyola University Press)\n\n4. High School Algebra -- Crawford\n   (Published by Macmillan Co., Toronto)\n\n5. French (At the Indians' special request)\n   (See letter attached)\n\nCommercial Geography, History, Science, etc. will be taken care of by mimeograph copies for this year.\nMr. Wescott and we also believe that this programme will be an immediate preparation for our boys going to Loyola in preparation for their technical course later on. Our girls also would thereby be saving one year of high school while training as teachers.\n\nYou may be interested to know that one of our war veterans, eighteen years old and wounded overseas, came to beg us to accept him in school. He says he is willing to follow the pupils everywhere as long as he gets the knowledge he refused when he was younger.\n\nOur registration so far is 352 pupils, more than fifty above last year's. Our \"store\" classroom is coming along well. The pupils' desks and the blackboard came in last Saturday. We thank you for all these supplies. Will you kindly tell us if we may count on the additional textbooks mentioned in this letter?\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\nMr. Wescott and we also believe that this programme will be an immediate preparation for our boys going to Loyola in preparation for their technical course later on.

However, there are several items which we do not find in the list of Textbooks approved for English Catholic Schools for 1947-48, and these are not being ordered. These are as follows:\n\nHistory of Canada Elem. (CSV)\nLessons in English Elem. (BCS)\nReading Development for Grade VI\nReading Tests for above\nPlay Workbooks for Juniors\n\" \" for Older Children\nDirected Language Practice Workbook\nCanadian Practice and Testing Workbooks\nNew Progress Arithmetic Workbooks\nGeography Workbooks\nHistory Workbooks.\n\nThe school Bulletin for September will contain a list of workbooks in Language which will be available shortly.\n\nWith reference to your request for pictures for class study, it is noted that you list a catalogue number but neglect to state the name of the company who supplies these pictures.\n\nWe also note that you have requested a set of the Book of Knowledge, although two sets have just recently been sent to you.\nIn your requisition of June 17th you ask for large quantities of library books which we are making available to our schools. I would refer you to the June issue of the Bulletin, Item No. 60, in which we clearly lay down the scale of issue for these books. From the quantities ordered, it would seem evident that the Sisters who prepared this requisition have not read this item very carefully. As we are endeavouring to supply not only our large schools, but also our smaller schools with library books, you will realize that it would be impossible to provide the quantities which you have requested.\n\nBefore we can order a Gestetner Duplicating Machine for your school, I would ask you to let me know what type of hectograph or duplicating machine, if any, you are at present using at the Caughnawaga School.\n\nThe Rhythm Band outfit is not being allowed.\n\nA decision has not yet been reached regarding the Catechisms to be used in future in Roman Catholic schools throughout Canada, and we are, therefore, not supplying the catechisms which you request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

We accept your decision in the matter but feel sorry about the \"Canadian Practice and Testing Workbooks\". May we call your attention to the fact that these workbooks form part of the textbook \"Canadian Problem and Practice by Smith, etc.\" which is actually the Arithmetic textbook approved for English Catholic Schools? Would it be possible also to receive a dozen or so of the Geography and History workbooks for the use of the teachers in the classroom?\n\nWith reference to our request for pictures for class study, we stated the name of the company from which these may be had on page eight of our requisition. It is \"Moyer's School Supplies.\"\n\nWe made out our requisition in April; then we were not aware that we were to receive two lovely sets of \"The Book of Knowledge\" in the following month. The pupils and teachers love them.\n\nNow I must offer my apologies for the \"large quantities\" of library books published in the June bulletin and I am the one who made the blunder and not our teachers here. I am enclosing a new list for these books and trust your customary kindness will find a way to obtain these attractive books for our classes.\n\nWe have no hectograph or duplicating machine of any kind in our schools. We use the simple repeater pads or \"Ditto Duplicating Film\" sent us by you with our school supplies. We should find it very useful to get a Gestetner Duplicating Machine for the schools.\nI wish to express our sincere thanks, once more, for giving authorization for the painting of our house. We have just heard that Mr. Lamotot's prices for the paint have been accepted so we hope the work will soon begin. It is no luxury, I assure you, Mr. Phelan.\n\nI have just given Reverend Father Lalonde the names of the pupils who wish to obtain a grant to continue their education in some college or convent in Sept. The parents and teachers will be very grateful to you for what you will kindly do to allow our pupils to continue their education.\n\nWith renewed thanks, we remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\nSILENT READERS FOR SOCIAL STUDIES.\n\n12 Helpers All - Book 1.\n12 In The City, On The Farm and Along the Road Book 2.\n12 In Other Lands - Book Three.\n12 Then and Now - Book Four.\n12 New Horizons - Book Five.\n12 To The New World - Book Six.\n12 From Sea to Sea - Book Seven.\n12 Mother of Freemen - Book Eight.\n\nThe Story of our Prairie Provinces.\nThe Story of our Canadian Northland.\nStory Workbook in Canadian History.\nThree Little Indians.\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate: August 18, 1947\n\nFor: Cuglaway R.C.

We have already mentioned this point in our letter of Sept. 8th, stating the urgent need we had of pencils, rulers, etc. We also asked authorization to order Latin and French books. May we hope to receive these articles and books soon? There are also cleaning articles for our residence and for the schools which we are also hoping you will grant authorization to Mr. Lanctot of St. Isidore to purchase for us as in former years.\n\nDear Sir, we are taking the liberty of enclosing a list of books which we would very much need for our classes. Most of these books were also requisitioned in April. We are sending you, too, a copy of the much needed articles mentioned above.\n\nOwing to our small classrooms in our two schools, our physical culture teacher suggests to combine two or three groups together and give her lessons in the Parish Hall. We often use this Parish Hall for school purposes. Do you think, Sir, that a rent could be paid by the Department to Father Lalonde?\n\nOur Domestic Science Teacher finds it very hard to buy all the material she needs for her sewing class with One Hundred and Thirty Dollars. She asks whether this allowance could be increased.\nI believe that during one of the last visits of the Delegation of Caughnawaga to the Members of the Department that it was asked that the grounds of our old Senior School be levelled. May I be allowed to stress the need of this when we wish our pupils to meet together for field days and for sports matches of all kinds. We are trying to put into effect the House System for games and school activities as suggested in the splendid Indian Bulletins which we receive. We have already expressed our praise for these bulletins in the past school year. We still find them enlightening, valuable and interesting.\n\nSpeaking of our Senior School, at this time last year we were most certain that our new school would be well on its way during this Fall of 1947. May we still cherish the hope of seeing its walls rise very soon?\n\nWe derived much benefit from the conferences given in Montreal on the 16th and 19th of Sept. and which you kindly allowed us to attend.

C. Indian Day School, I wish to advise you that we have requested the Government Stationery Office to order the pictures, text-books, etc., shown on the attached list.\n\nYou will note that we have ordered only three copies \"Europe Before Modern Times\", as fourteen copies were requested by you in June, last, and these were ordered at that time. If they have not been received by you, please let me know.\n\nWe have not ordered Junior Science, Book 2, as we do not find it listed in the pamphlet entitled \"Textbooks approved for English Catholic Schools (1947-48)\".\n\nThe McLean Writing Books have not been ordered, as we have already ordered 80 Bailey Writing Books, Part I, and 200 copies Bailey Writing Books, Part II, and ten Teachers' Manuals. These Writing Books were ordered by you in June, last.\n\nAn order has been placed with the Sport Shop, 98 Bank St., Ottawa, for the playground balls, bats, footballs and basketball requested by you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Sister M. Albertus,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nTeachers' Residence,\nNov. 19, 1947.\n\nMr. Bernard Henry,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are deeply grateful for the kind attention given our supplementary requisition.\n\nYes, we did notice you have ordered only three copies of \"Europe Before Modern Times\" but though we made a request of fourteen of these in our requisition of last April, we have not received them. During Mr. Doucet's last visit to us, we spoke to him about this, also about the \"Junior Science\", Book II, listed in the program of books for the Catholic High Schools of Que. May we hope that you will have these fourteen \"Europe etc.\" and 36 \"Junior Science, Part II\" ordered soon from the Montreal Book Room?\n\nWe thank you very much for the copy of the list of pictures to be ordered from Moyer's and the other books from the Montreal Book Room. We have begun to receive a few from the latter place and I assure you that our teachers and pupils are very happy.\n\nWe are still anxiously awaiting for the 80 Bailey Writing Books, Part I, and the 200 copies of Part II. Our pupils of the lower grades are in need of them.\n\nThe basketball, bats, etc., have been received and every one is much pleased with them. We shall take much care of these sports objects.\n\nDear Sir, has any decision been taken about the rent to be paid for the use of the Parish Hall and about an increase\nof the yearly allowance given to our Domestic Science teacher? I have already mentioned these two points in my letter of Oct. 14th.\n\nWith renewed thanks for your kindness, we remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n**Date:** June 15, 1947\n\n**For:** Kateri and Eastern Schools\n\n**Caughnawaga Agency**\n\n**NOTE:**\nTo avoid delay, teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\n\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\n\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well known firm should be given for each article required.\n\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of this requisition and no entry should be made under heading \u201cNumber Authorized\u201d.\n\n| ARTICLES                                      | NUMBER ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | NUMBER REQUIRED | NUMBER AUTHORIZED | REMARKS |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|\n| No. 22 Essentials of Wood Working              |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 27 Things to Make and How to Make Them    |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 40 Everyday Biology                       |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 41 Understanding the Universe             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 42 General Science                        |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 43 Quebec, Historical Summary             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 44 The Discovery of Canada                |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 45 Canada from the Earliest Times to the Present |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 50 Let the People Know                    |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 51 A Time for Greatness                   |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 58 Manual of Canadian Business Law        |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 62 Pupils' Empire Atlas                   |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 63 Historical Atlas of Canada             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 64 Explorers, Soldiers and Statesmen      |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 65 Canada                                 |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 70 Let the People Know                    |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 71 Building the Canadian Nation           |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 72 The Discovery of Canada                |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 73 Social Security for Canada             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| No. 74 Nazis in the Woodpile                  |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n\nN.B.\u2014Explicit information regarding address must be furnished.\n\n**Name:** Sisters of St. Ann\n\n**School:** Eastern Kateri Schools\n\n**Post Office (nearest):** Caughnawaga\n\n**Express Office (nearest):** Adirondack Station\n\n**Province:** P.Q.\n\n**I HEREBY CERTIFY** that I have examined this requisition, and that the articles asked for by the teacher are necessary and are such as are in use in the Provincial Schools.\n\n---\n\n**Indian Affairs.** (RG 10, Volume 6077, file 305-4, part 1)\n\n**PUBLIC ARCHIVES**\n\n**ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES**\n\n**CANADA**\n\n---\n\n**FORM No. IA. 413**\n\n**R. 5044**\n\n---\n\n**Indian Agent:**\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate: June 15, 1947\n\nFor: Kateri and Eastern School -

If you should care to buy some of them, it would help us out very much and would at the same time help to cover some of the expenses for the opening of the Normal School.\n\nThe books are not new and most of those listed $0.10 are very old. If you wish to buy any kindly check them and return the lists as soon as possible. I shall forward your order as quickly as possible.\n\nThank you for whatever help you may be able to give us.\n\nSincerely yours in Christ\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We would like very much to take care of this order, but we find that map cases presently available are not built strongly enough to withstand the rigours of school use. We would suggest that you purchase our maps in our S.R.B.D. mounting, that is, with spring rollers and dust-proof protectors and if necessary have these mounted in banks of four or eight as desired.\n\nThese maps in the titles shown by you can be supplied in our large series at $17.00 (seventeen dollars), per map. We are sending you under separate cover a copy of our Catalogue No. 65, which shows these maps on page 229, with the exception of the map of the United States.\n\nThis latter map can be secured and supplied in a similar scale. I hope this is the information you require, and we will look forward to hearing from you at an early date.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nMOYER SCHOOL SUPPLIES LIMITED.\n\nJ.I.

That explains the difference in the number. (This refers only to a few of the approved books.)\n\nThe greater part of the first requisition has been delivered...a blessing which we have not enjoyed for years. No doubt the remainder will reach us before the opening of school\u2014especially the readers for the Primary Grades.\n\nSince our letter of August 5 addressed to Col. Neary has not yet been acknowledged, we presume he is busy on the road.... Consequently, you have not received the well-deserved 'Honorable Mention' we requested him to pass on to you.

Entire building constructed of Ideal Blocks.\n\nIDEAL CONCRETE MACHINERY CO., (Ltd.) London, Ontario.\nYou'll View With Pride\nThe Blocks You Make\nAs They Come From The\nIDEAL CONCRETE MACHINE\nAnd Glow With\nSatisfaction\nWhen You View\nThem In The\nFinished House!\n\nBest Blocks mean Good Prices and Largest Profits.\n\nA True Test\nOf Any Article\nIs Not What\nIt Is, But\nWhat It\nDOES.\nConcrete Machinery Is No\nException To\nThat Rule.\n\nBuilt at Maywood, Ill., with an IDEAL Machine.\nThe IDEAL Machine Is Sold Strictly On Its Merits.\n\nThe Ideal Machine is not a cheap machine. Where price is the chief consideration, we know that the purchaser will be better satisfied with machines that are sold on price.\n\nBut, we want to talk to the man who looks ahead, one year, two years, yes, ten years ahead. We want to talk to the man who thinks about his profit, about his work giving satisfaction, about his reputation, about his plant giving the maximum amount of work with a minimum amount of labor and expense. That man, we know, will think of all these things and the little difference of first cost will sink into insignificance.\n\nThe Ideal Machine is made and sold solely on its reputation for efficiency.\n\nA personal talk and a close inspection of the Ideal Machine is better than anything we can put into print to convince. Actually working with the Ideal Machine will do more than even looking at it to convince you. A review of your work, five years hence, will prove to you that the half wasn't told you of the efficiency and quality of the work of the Ideal Machine.\n\nYou Eliminate Cheap Competition If You Use an IDEAL Machine.\n\nEvery one has cheap competition. It's in the cement block manufacturing business the same as it is in the cement machinery manufacturing business, or any other line of business.\n\nWith the Ideal Machine there is a character and individuality about each block. You'll easily see it in each design. You'll see the true sharp lines that exactly represent the chipped out stone effect. You'll see it and your customer will see it and there'll be the conviction that as there is a difference in the price of blocks, there is also a big difference in the blocks themselves.\n\nBelow are shown illustrations of two other houses built of Ideal Blocks, by Western Cement Construction Co. It will be noted that Rock Face Blocks are a negligible quantity in the construction work of this firm. They also send photos of six other houses of Ideal Blocks.\n\nSize 24 by 39'. Blocks used, 2,400. Five Rooms. Mason Work Cost $600.\n\nSize 25 by 32'. Porch all Concrete. Seven Rooms. Mason Work Cost $1260.\nSeven Blocks More With The Same Material.\n\nTwo men will make 275 IDEAL 8x8x16\u201d Concrete Blocks in a day of Ten Hours, mixing all the concrete by hand. One Barrel of Cement and twenty cubic feet of sand and gravel will make fifty of these blocks. This is seven more than can be made with the same amount of material on any other machine. This is due to the economical and perfect construction of the IDEAL Block. In a day\u2019s run, therefore, the net gain will be 37\u00bd blocks, or 225 blocks in a week. This gain will pay the operating expenses.\n\nBy the installation of an IDEAL Automatic Tamper the output is increased to from 500 to 600 Blocks, made more dense and every block tamped alike.\n\nIt's Not What We Say, But What Others Say About The IDEAL Machine.\n\nTHE ARTALITH CONCRETE WORKS, PLAINFIELD, N. J., in a letter to us said:\n\n\"After examining nearly all the block machines on the market I induced the Company for which I was manager to purchase two of your machines. After using these machines for nearly a year and a half I started into business for myself. If I had not been sure that I could make anything in the block line and meet competition as to quality, I should not have bought the two IDEAL machines for myself. A New York engineer, after watching the operation of the IDEAL machine for some time, the machine being changed from one style of block to another, made this remark when leaving the plant: 'In the manufacture of that machine, brains were used as well as cast iron.' There seems to be nothing impossible in the block line with the IDEAL.\"\n\nWe haven\u2019t the space here to quote from the hundreds of letters we have from customers in the United States, Canada, Mexico and foreign countries throughout the world.\n\nAsk for our booklet. \"What Others Say About Us.\" You\u2019ll find ideas and get a clearer conception of our machine than anything we say. There are 214 letters in this book praising the IDEAL Machine and most of them were received in a period of six or seven months.\n\nEvery User of an IDEAL Machine is an Enthusiast. He sees a Daily Demonstration of Its Simplicity, Adaptability, Durability and Reliability.\n\nData Regarding Bungalow Shown On First Page.\n\nSize of house, 45 by 50\u2019. Cement Work, including walks outside, Stucco Plaster, etc., $7,750.00. The bungalow has Reception Hall, Living Room, Dining Room, Kitchen, three Bedrooms, and Bath Room on the first floor, and Billiard Room, Maid\u2019s Room and Bath Room on the second floor. The first five courses in the ground are of rough blocks, plastered outside with cement mortar, inside faced smooth. Then white-faced panel, 8x8x16\u201d blocks are used up to the window sills. Rough blocks are used from there up to the eaves, and are plastered two coats. Roof is of asbestos shingles.\n\nAddress of building, 212 W. Second Ave., Maywood, Ill.\n\nAll trimmings, columns, flower boxes and lintels are of cast stone. The lintels are reinforced, the house is elaborately trimmed with quartered-sawn oak and curly birch. The Western Cement Construction Company, Chicago, Ill., have erected 25 houses this year, and are building seven at present, all of IDEAL Blocks.\nPatent Decisions.\n\nOur Patent on Hollow Block Machine covers all types of Face-Down Block Machines having horizontally movable cores, in which the Block is rolled out to discharging position on a portion of the mold which is formed of hinged sections.\n\nDec. 20, 1909, The United States Court for the District of Western Michigan sustained our Patent Rights.\nNov. 21, 1906, The High Court of Justice of London, Canada, sustained our Patent Rights.\nOct. 4, 1909, the United States Court for the District of Indiana sustained our Patent Rights.\n\nPatents are granted for designs, changes and improved features by the patent office, many of which cannot be used without infringement of the basic principles. This will explain why some manufacturers think they do not infringe our Patent Rights.\n\nNo decision of the Patent Office or the Courts failed to sustain and protect our Patent on the IDEAL Type of the Hollow Concrete Block Machine.\n\nWhat Does an IDEAL Block Machine Outfit Represent?\n\nThe regular outfit includes equipment for making Plain Blocks, also Panel \u00bc\" Bevel, \u00bc\" Margin Blocks in full size, also half and quarter Blocks, Pier Blocks, Return Corner Blocks, Joint Blocks, Gable Angle Blocks, in fact, everything necessary for ordinary building construction.\n\nWhat Does the IDEAL Line Represent?\n\nThe line represents all kinds of Block and Brick Machines of various sizes, and in addition the most complete line of Accessories and Attachments in the world. It also represents Automatic Tamper, Mixers, Sill and Lintel Machines, Sill and Cap Molds, Step Molds, Sidewalk Molds, Fence Post Molds, Sewer Pipe and Drain Tile Molds, and a complete and artistic line of Ornamental Molds. IDEAL Machines represent the highest standard of efficiency for the production of Concrete Work. Our Company dispenses the most complete and reliable information pertaining to the industry.\n\nCost of Brick in The Wall:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1,000 Common Brick will cost              | $7.50  |\n| Mason Work at $5.00 per Day will cost     | 3.33   |\n| Helper at $2.50 per Day will cost         | 1.67   |\n| Mortar for 1,000 Brick will cost          | 1.50   |\n| Total Cost, laid in the Wall             | $14.00 |\n\nCost of Concrete Blocks in The Wall:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1 Barrel Best Portland Cement             | $1.35  |\n| 20 Cu.

Besides some things will appear in one light to one and in an entirely different light to another.\n\nWe want you to know the IDEAL Machine as it is and not as a person imagines it is. You want to know the IDEAL Machine as it actually is, too. If there are any points that are particularly valuable to a cement block manufacturer you want to know them.\n\nThat's why we say write us\u2014write us frankly and tell us just what you think and feel about the Ideal Machine.

REINFORCEMENT\nFOR BRICKWORK\nFOR THE\nFACTORY OR THE\nDWELLING HOUSE\n\nTHE DAMP-PROOF HOUSE\nTHE FIREPROOF HOUSE\n\nTHE HOUSE THAT WILL GO THROUGH FIRE and WATER\nREINFORCED BRICKWORK\n\nA short description of H. B. Reinforcement for Brickwork and some of the uses to which it can be adapted\n\nBrown's Patent (A.D. 1906) Brick Reinforcement\n\nSOLE LICENSEES FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF\nH. B. REINFORCEMENT\n\nRD. JOHNSON, CLAPHAM & MORRIS, Ltd.\n24 and 26 LEVER STREET,\nMANCHESTER, Eng.\n\nDISTRIBUTING AGENT FOR CANADA\nFRANCIS HANKIN,\n230 AND 231 CORISTINE BUILDING,\nMONTREAL, P.Q.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt is admitted that the united strength of Steel and Concrete, when correctly proportioned, exceeds many times the sum of their individual strength.\n\nKeeping this in mind, it stands to reason that steel, inserted in the cement mortar joint of brick work, will have the effect of strengthening the joint to a very great degree.\n\nIn seeking a suitable form for this steel it was decided to use it as a wire mesh of 14 G. wire with a \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) mesh, as this permeates the cement thoroughly and most nearly approaches the ideal reinforcement.\n\nTESTS\n\nIn order to test the effectiveness of this theory the following wall was built. An eight inch cavity wall was erected consisting of one wall 4\" thick, a cavity of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\" and a brick-on-edge or 2\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\" wall. This wall was supported on two piers ten feet apart, and it had a projecting part or cantilever five feet long.\n\nThere were no ties of any description between the walls, but the reinforcement was inserted in each mortar joint and carried the full length of the wall through the piers.\n\nThe illustration shows the load on the wall; 17,111 lbs. on the span and 4,088 lbs. on the cantilever.\n\nThe loads were distributed, but care was taken to keep them inside the line of the piers. With this load there was no sign of fracture or weakness, and after waiting for a time it was decided to knock the test down by using a batten as a ram.\n\nThis was accomplished after considerable effort by two men.\n\nThis test was carried out in a Montreal Builder's yard in November and December of 1908.\n\nA further test was made to destruction to find the lateral resistance of a half brick wall. A piece of wall half a brick thick, measuring 3 ft. long and 2 ft. wide was built in 3-1\ncement mortar, and reinforced every course in a similar manner to the previous test. After standing for ten days it was laid on its side and supported at both ends having a bearing of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nIt was then loaded with bricks and failed under a load of 4,144 lbs.\n\nThe illustration shows a photo of the above mentioned piece of wall after failure. It will be noted that the bricks failed before the mortar joint. Compare this with a wall without reinforcement placed in the same position. It would hardly support itself.\n\nPOINTS REGARDING THE USE OF REINFORCEMENT IN BRICK WORK\n\nThe hollow or cavity brick wall is probably the best type of insulation known in building construction.\n\nA hollow brick wall secures the building against heat, cold, and damp, and when used for partitions is sound-proof, and fireproof.\n\nThe ordinary brick cavity wall is expensive, but when built on the H. B. System can be built cheaply, because reinforced brick walls by reason of their great strength in resisting tensile and lateral stresses, do not require to be of the same thickness as ordinary walls, whose strength is only in proportion to their weight.\n\nThin brick walls are only as strong as their foundation for weight-carrying purposes. Should the foundation settle, cracks will appear throughout the building.\n\nBy using H. B. Reinforcement, Architects and Engineers will insure their building against settlement, cracks, and bulging, add 50 per cent. to its life, reduce the cost of maintenance and repairs, and render the building monolithic and fireproof.\n\nIn a recent copy of a magazine devoted to the uses of cement, a series of tests of the best fire-resisting materials is recorded. After describing the various mixtures used in the tests and their fire-resisting properties, the engineer under whose supervision the tests were held, came to the conclusion that \"Brick Panel probably withstood the tests better than the other materials.\"\n\nThese tests were held under the supervision of Mr. Richard L. Humphrey, of the Structural Materials Laboratories of the U. S. Geological Survey, St. Louis.\n\nPARTITIONS\n\nFor partition work this reinforcement is specially suitable. Partitions so constructed are cheaper than any form of partition on the market. They impose no load on the floors, are self-supporting between the points of support, will support a load of 200 lbs. for every course of reinforcement, have a lateral resistance of over 200 lbs. per foot superficial, and in addition are fire and vermin proof.\n\nA very light and useful partition can be obtained by building the brick-on-edge, and a brick-on-edge partition reinforced with H. B. is stronger than an ordinary 9\" wall.\n\nUSED AS A BONDING FIN\n\nWhen used as a bonding fin between concrete work and brick, this material is extremely useful.\n\nThe general way of using it for this purpose is to insert a double piece in the concrete, and leave two loose ends to be built into the brick.\nIn some cases this process may be reversed and the brick built up first and used as a retaining wall for the concrete. The loose ends of the reinforcement bind themselves into the concrete, thus saving the cost of wooden forms.\n\n**PROPERTIES CLAIMED FOR H. B.**\n\nThe following properties are claimed for H. B. reinforcement.\n\n1. It gives a fire-proof, damp-proof, and sound-proof wall when used for cavity walls.\n2. It has a strength in proportion to its height.\n3. H. B. Walls only require a foundation at points.\n4. Any brick will do, and any bricklayer can lay it.\n5. It may be used over door and window openings instead of steel beams or brick arches.\n6. In many cases a saving of 30 to 50 per cent. can be effected by its use.\n7. In all cases it will add strength to brick walls.\n\n**SPECIFICATIONS**\n\nIn specifying this material, state clearly that H. B WIRE MESH REINFORCEMENT will be inserted in every course (or as often as required) and that it is supplied by Francis Hankin, 231 Coristine Building, Montreal.\n\n**GENERAL**\n\nIn a pamphlet of this nature it is possible only to give a very short description of the various properties of the material and the uses to which it is adapted. Reinforced Brickwork can never be surpassed.\n\nBrick has stood the test of ages, while concrete has stood the test of months only.\n\nThe foregoing all tends to convince one that reinforced brick walls possess all the advantages of reinforced concrete, in addition to which they are dry instead of damp, fire-proof instead of fire resisting, cost half as much and are not unsightly, while atmospheric disintegration is practically unknown.\n| DATE | GENRE D'ANNONCES | Lignes | Prix | Quotidien | Hebdomadaire | TOTAL |\n|------|------------------|--------|------|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| mai 16 | Annonces du mois | 45     |      |           |              |       |\n| 19   | Son maison decole | 25     |      |           |              |       |\n| 21   |                   | 45     |      |           |              |       |\n|      |                   | 135    | 18  |           |              |       |\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is used the integral way, which is the only successful way. In its manufacture all standard requirements are satisfied, and its action is very beneficial.\n\n\"Laradas\" when once combined with the limes in the cement forms a mass insoluble even to acids. Better results in joining the different workings are obtained and expansion is limited by its use.\n\nNo efflorescence or disintegration is possible, and should troubles arise in the future necessitating repairs, such are easily cured.\n\nWrite to us your problem on hand and we will answer your fullest inquiries.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

Reinforcement.\n\nMost people like to do something better and cheaper than they have done before and by using H.B. judiciously, you also may do it.\n\nFor instance, a 4\" brick partition can be built by its use which is five times as strong as any ordinary 8\" brick partition as far as lateral stress is concerned and will support a load over a ten foot span of 200 lbs. for every course of reinforcement used.\n\nThat looks like a saving of 50% of brickwork.

(RG 10, Volume 6077, file 305-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 12th inst., No.154172-5A, relative to the expenses, amounting to $10.50, in the sale of the old girls' school-house at Caughnawaga, allow me to inform you that it was announced at the time of the sale, in English, French and Indian, that the expenses of the sale, amounting to $10.50, would be payable by the purchaser in addition to the price of the sale.\n\nThere were at the place of the sale some white men residing outside of the reserve who desired to purchase the building, and I thought it right to send the Department the net amount of the sale; but I see that I went too far outside of my powers, and as I was new in the position, Mr. Blain, it seems to me, ought to have informed me; but, far from that, it was he who strongly advised me to make out this list of expenses, saying that he was acting in his capacity as notary public, and that he would charge $4.00 for the deed.\n\nI went to Caughnawaga on a Sunday, authorized by letter from the Department dated May 31, No.154172-5, to announce the sale at the church-door. It was for this trip that I charged $1.50 as also for the promissory notes of $1.00.\n\nI acted in good faith in this matter and followed the advice of Mr. Blain, my superior.\n\nIf after these explanations you think that the Department ought to get this money, I will collect from those who received it for their work and will send the amount to the Department.\n\nI doubt very much that Michel Montour told you\nthat it was understood that the expenses of the sale were to be paid in addition to the purchase price as announced; and this same Michel Montour since his return from Ottawa has been going all over the village of Caughnawaga announcing to the Iroquois that the assistant agent had obtained money under false pretences, besides that this had been told him by officers of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\nI thought that I ought to have been permitted as assistant agent and new in my position to give explanations to my superiors in the Department in order to clear myself and to correct my error, if possible, before a charge should be made against me to the Indians.\n\nYours, &c.,\n\nLorenzo Letourneau\nAsst.

Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs requested by the Department I have consulted with Reverend Mr. Granger as to supply of water for Girl's School. I do not believe that the expenses of bringing water from his tank is absolutely necessary. I have decided upon another plan after studying the question on the ground, which will amount only to a few dollars instead of paying for excavation in stone, etc.\n\nI will call at the Department and explain this matter for your consideration.\n\nI beg to inform the Department that I have started the excavation for a well at the Protestant School. Rev. Mr. Matthews made me notice that there was no drain along the road in front of the School and that in the spring water will probably damage the verandah and cellar windows. I think that it is absolutely necessary to have a trench dugged along the road some 200 ft. long which will prevent the surface water of said road from damaging the School building and entrances, and keep its access in good condition.\n\nThe amount necessary for this work would be $30.00.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYours truly, etc.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This cheque was in connection with work on the Roman Catholic School.\n\nIt is thought that your misunderstanding in this may have arisen in connection with official letter of the 11th January (152218-5), when a cheque for $120.00 was sent you for work on the Protestant School. You were then told that $200.00 was being withheld from you until certain work was finished. That letter had references only to the Protestant school.\n\nThe total advance to you including the cheque for $1000.00 amounts to $14270.20. Your contract amounts to $14322.00 which leaves the balance due you $342.80 exclusive of charges for extras.\n\nYour account for $135.40 for extras is being referred to Mr. Letourneau for consideration.

The price quoted for the desk and chair is $10.95, as per your price list of March 15th, last. These desks are required for continuation school which it is proposed to open on the Taughnawaga Reserve on or about the first of September, next, and I shall be pleased if you will arrange to have them shipped in time to be placed in position in the class-room before that date.

Schools will open September 1, 1920, with more barracks, more part time schools and less adequate equipment for the proper housing of school children than ever in the history of the country. Unless provision is made now, there will come to school boards an unparalleled rebuke from the public for the lack of foresight in providing the mere essentials of proper housing and equipment.\nAugust 5th, 1920\n\nL.

If you will refer to page 4 you will find the Frictionside Adjustable Desk and Chair which today is worth $14.65. Delivery of this line cannot be made for three months.\n\nWe offer as a second alternative the Ball Bearing Adjustable Box Desk with lifting lid illustrated at the bottom of page 3. This in adult size is worth $12.80. It seems likely that we will be able to make delivery of this line of desks about September 15th.\n\nIf it is imperative that you should have the desks shipped in time for the opening of school on September 1st, the only thing we can undertake to deliver for comparatively early shipment is the Ball Bearing Automatic Single Desks, shown at the top of page 2. This line in adult size is worth $9.35 each but it is not adjustable and has an open box with a fixed lid.\n\nWe can ship the Teacher's Chair No.744 at once from stock if desired.\n\nOwing to the conditions outlined we cannot very well enter your order until we have some further information as to your wishes in view of the difficulty of shipment. Please advise us by return mail.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE GEO. M. HENDRY CO.

Both the George M. Hendry Co., and the E. N. Moyer Co., furnished prices. The order was first placed with the Hendry Co. for 'Challenge' Adjustable Desks at $10.95 each, but they informed us that, while this line of desks appeared in their catalogue, they were unable to give delivery at the time required, namely, September 1st, when the school opened. As it was necessary to obtain desks for that date, the order was then transferred to the E. N. Moyer Co., Limited, for Harvard Adjustable Desks at $13.75 each. Owing to the demand for school desks they were the only firm that could guarantee delivery at the time required and the order was placed with them. I may say that in the new price list now submitted by the E. N. Moyer Co. the price for the type of desk supplied is $15.80.\n\nAs it was absolutely necessary to have these desks in time to open the school on the first of September and the Hendry Co. would not guarantee the time of delivery, the order was placed with the E. N. Moyer Co., who furnished the desks at the time required at a slightly higher price, but considerably less than the price now asked for the same desk. The quotation of the Globe Furniture Co., Limited, Waterloo, for the same type of desks as ordered was $14.10.\n\nTaking into consideration the urgent need for these desks, I consider that, in placing the order with the E. N. Moyer Co., the very best price was obtained under the circumstances.\nREPORT NO.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\n\nFile No. ..........

H. Pugnet,\n\nI am in receipt of your submission of October 5th., File 5-7-5, relative to the purchase of desks and chairs for Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nFor your guidance would you permit me to point out the following procedure in purchasing of supplies in future.\n\n(1) When purchases are being made, a specification of your requirements, together with your call, and the names of firms you propose to ask should be submitted to this Commission before being sent out. This is to ensure that you will purchase from the best source of supply.\n\n(2) After the tenders have been received by you they are scheduled by a representative of your department and a representative from this Commission.\n\n(3) The file is then submitted to this Commission, with your recommendation, for authority to make purchase.\n\nIn connection with this purchase you will note that the E. N. Noyes Co., purchased from the manufacturer the W. F. Villas Co., Ltd., Cowansville, Que. This purchase runs into considerable money, and had it been purchased by calling tenders, it is altogether probable that your requirements could have been purchased (for less money than your now paying) from this manufacturer, knowing that he was quoting against other manufacturers.\n\nfor the Secretary.\n\nN.B. This might have been supplied from surplus stores.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In connection with this matter I beg to refer you to official letter of August 19th, last, advising you of the order being placed with this firm for the above typewriter desks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Schools, Caughnawaga, Que.,\ndated October 28, 1920. Original on 5-7-4.\n\nI would further call your attention to the fact\nthat only one half the number of braces necessary for the\ndesks in the Commercial Class were received. I wrote the\nMoyer Co. about it as well as to the factory at Cowansville\nbut have received no explanation.\nOttawa, November 3, 1920.\n\nMadam,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 25th ultimo in which you state that only half the number of braces necessary for the desks in the Continuation School were received I have to request that you will be good enough to state definitely the number of parts of the desks which are missing. When this information is received the matter will be taken up with the E. N. Moyer Co., from whom the desks were purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga (R.C.) Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your inquiry about the desks, I should say that braces for 12 desks are missing.\n\nI must also state that the grade of iron used in manufacturing these desks was very poor. The bolts, shafts, and the base holding the chair is of such inferior quality that two chairs are already unseverable. The pair fell right off while the pupil was sitting quickly at the desk.\n\nWe have had some trouble with the Remington typewriter. In the first place...\nIt was shipped to Montreal and held there until the office people found out to whom it belonged. When I learned it was at the Montreal Remington office, I asked the Manager to make the keyboard blank and send it to Caughnawaga. He did this, but when we opened the box we found no accessories whatever such as cover, oil can, book instruction book etc. I wrote to the Manager and asked if these articles had been removed in the Montreal office by mistake. He told me that there was nothing in the box when they opened it, but promised to take up the matter with the Ottawa office.\n\nIt is customary for typewriter concerns to guarantee their machines for one year and attend to all repairs.\nfree of charge during that interval. I should suggest that the Department notify the different Concerns from whom they have purchased type-writers in Ottawa to instruct their Montreal Agencies to look after the type-writers in use here until October 1921.\n\nI have used the Underwood machine only and am not at all familiar with the Remington so it would do me a great favor if a man was sent here to examine the machine and give instructions for its use.\n\nThanking you kindly,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours cordially,\n\nSister M. Gabriel\nPrincipal\n\nMrs. A. Williams\nDepartment of Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, November 6, 1920.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nRegarding the order placed with you for twenty-four Harvard Adjustable Desks, with lifting lids and chairs, for the use of the Continuation School on the Caughnawaga Reserve, as per official letter of August 15th, last, I now beg to state that the Principal of this school informs the Department that, when the desks arrived, braces for twelve of the desks were missing. She states that she has already corresponded with you regarding this matter, as well as the factory at Cowansville, but has received no reply.\n\nI should be glad if you would have these missing parts forwarded as soon as possible, and they should be sent to the address of Mr. J. M. Brosseau, Indian Agent, Adirondack Junction, Que. Should you require any further information please write Sister M. Gabriel, Principal, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nThe Principal also states that the grade of iron used in manufacturing these desks is very poor. The bolts snap and the piece holding the chair is of such inferior quality that two of the chairs are already unserviceable. She states that the pieces fell right off while the pupil was sitting quietly at the desk.\n\nIt is considered that any repairs or extra parts needed should be supplied by you without further expense to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe E. N. Moyer Co., Limited,\n100 Front St., Toronto, Ont.\nOttawa, November 6, 1920.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, and in reply, regarding the parts of the desks that are missing, I beg to say that the E. N. Moyer Co., Limited, Toronto, from whom these desks were ordered have been requested to forward, addressed to Mr. Agent Brosseau, the twelve braces for the desks which are missing.\n\nThey have also been informed of the poor material used in the manufacture of these desks and have been asked to make good any parts broken. This firm was asked to correspond with you in the matter and you can furnish them with full particulars.\n\nWith reference to the Remington Typewriter, I beg to say that The Federal Typewriter Co., from whom this machine was ordered, states that they have forwarded the necessary tools for this machine, as well as the cover, and it is hoped that they will reach you in due time.\n\nThe question of having a representative from each of the various companies handling the machines forwarded to you, visit the school and instruct you in the use of the machines is being taken up with the companies here and the Department will endeavour to have a man sent who will give you the necessary instructions in the management of these machines.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister M. Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga (R.C.) Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nNovember 18th 1920.\n\nMr. A. S. Williams,\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of November 6th has not been answered earlier owing to the writer's absence from the city, but the braces which arrived short are ordered from the factory. These were lost in transit as our check clearly shows that they were shipped. We cannot understand what your Principal is driving at when she states that they are made of a poor grade of iron, because if her desks fall to pieces as easily as she states, it seems reasonable that we should have other complaints, and this is the only one we have.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSECRETARY.\nE.

N. Moyer Co., Limited, Toronto, in which they state that the twelve braces for the desks in the Continuation School have been ordered from the factory and will be sent cars of Mr. Agent Brosseau. It is hoped that they will arrive in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister M. Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga (R.C.) Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI am sending to your address one small box containing a broken bolt from the desks in the Centennial school, requesting that you be good enough to order from the Mayer Co. 6 of these.\n\nI am sorry to say that when the workmen came to put the braces on the desks yesterday he told me there were only braces for six desks, now there are still 12 braces missing in braces for 6 desks.\n\nTwo of the castings on the adjustable chairs are broken. Kindly ask them to send the two pieces fastened to floor, the cup-like tubes which hold the chair in place.\nI must again ask if you would be good enough to get in touch with the Stationery Department. We have not a scrap of paper left for we had to use every particle in the house, foolscap, scratch pads etc. We have only typewriter paper left. They have our last requisition asking for paper and pencils.\n\nWe have no coal either, but Mr. Brossard told me he would inform the Fuel Controller today and insist the coal be sent to the school for the opening on Jan 10th.\n\nWishing you a happy New Year\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\nSuperior\n\nMr. J.D. Sutherland\nOttawa\nOttawa, January 3, 1929.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, addressed to Mr. Sutherland of this Department, and in reply I beg to inform you that the box containing a broken bolt from the desks in the Continuation School, which you state you are forwarding, has not yet been received. It will not be possible to order new ones from The E. N. Moyer Co. until the sample of the bolts required is received. As soon as this arrives the question of ordering six new bolts, as well as twelve braces for the six desks and the replacing of the two castings on the adjustable chairs will be taken up with the E. N. Moyer Co.\n\nIt is regretted that there has been delay in forwarding the scribblers asked for, but the Stationery Department has found it difficult, owing to the scarcity of paper, to have its orders filled. They now state that they expect to send these scribblers to you very shortly. A further supply of lead pencils is also being ordered to be sent you.\n\nIt is hoped that a further supply of coal has been secured by Mr. Cuzette and that it has been delivered to the schools before this. The Department was informed by him a few days ago that he had a carload of coal on the way.\n\nThe Department is very pleased to note the large and regular attendance of the children during the past quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga (R.C.) Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa, January 7, 1921.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nIn further reference to the order placed with you for 24 Harvard Adjustable Desks for the use of the Continuation School on the Caughnawaga Reserve I beg to say that a communication has been received from the Principal regarding a number of broken parts on these desks. She has forwarded one of these broken parts, which is being sent you in a separate parcel, and has requested that six of these parts be forwarded to her to replace a like number that were broken.\n\nRegarding the braces which were missing the Principal states that only braces for six desks had arrived and that there are still twelve braces missing, that is for six desks.\n\nShe also states that two of the castings on the adjustable chairs were broken and she explains that these are the two pieces fastened to the floor, the cup like tube which holds the chair in place.\n\nI have therefore, to request that you will have these broken parts and the remainder of the braces forwarded as soon as possible to Mr. J. M. Brosseau, Indian Agent, Adirondack Junction, Que. The complaints of the Principal of this school regarding the broken parts of the desks are the first that have been received in connection with the desks supplied by your firm. Any repairs or extra parts needed should be supplied by you without expense to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

They now enclose a copy from their illustrated catalogue and request that the necessary parts required be marked on the illustration, so that there will be no mistake, and the number of new parts required should be stated.\n\nI enclose their illustration of the desks and have to request that you will be good enough to indicate therein the part required and state the number and you might return this illustration with the number of parts required direct to The E.

Boys & Girls\n- 4 typewriters\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI enclose, herewith, a list of desks and furnishings needed for the new class in Boys' School, being held in the lower flat of the Delorme Residence.\n\nBy way of explanation I would say that I intend taking the 22 double desks now used in the Primary Girls school to this new room, and replace them there with single desks. My reason for doing this is two-fold; the girls are more careful than boys and convenience in handling single desks is much greater than in moving double desks every time we need the Assembly Hall.\n\nThe Department shipped 24 single desks No. 6 in March to Girls School, but there were neither backs nor fronts to these, so much space was lost. I have figured out that with 11 complete new desks, and backs and fronts as indicated, I will have a seating capacity of 42 pupils in this class room.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6077, file 305-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nFurther more in 3rd Class of Girls School 6 fronts and 6 backs would give us 12 more places in the school; it is for this reason I have ordered them in place of complete desks.\n\nI would request that this year we be allowed to purchase two good clocks, one for the lower hall of each school near the main entrance. These would serve to regulate the clocks in the class rooms, which just now keep all kinds of time. All bells would be rung according to the clock, and eliminate the conflicts of tardiness; for often two pupils coming in at the same time are marked one \"early\" and the other \"on time,\" because one clock was fast and the other slow.\n\nI would also request that a good large gong be placed in each of the large schools. The little hand bells are not heard at any distance away, and I feel sure punctuality would be greatly increased by such a reminder.\n\nI did not order a desk or chair for the teacher in this new school, because I retained 2 desks and 3 chairs from the Soldier's Civil Re-establishment, as well as a quantity of blackboard material.\n\nMr. Vail went to Montreal twice in the\ninterests of the schools, but he could get very little from the Soldier's Civil Re Establishment as all was ordered shipped to the Marine Department; he selected a few tools, however which will be of use.\n\nWith further reference to the type writers I would gladly accept four Underwood if possible, but providing they are in good condition & do not mind the make. The Underwood seems the slowest, near and dear much better than any other machine.\n\nMy idea is to turn the upper flat of the Alzheimer Residence into a type writing room. We will dispense with the chairs and tables and use tables etc secured from the Soldier's Civil Re Establishment.\n\nI hope you will be able to send the order for the desks early enough that we may have them installed for the opening of school in September.\n\nYours very cordially,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAttention of Mr. L.D. McLean\nOTTAWA, June 11th, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing a list of the desks and furnishings required to provide extra classroom accommodation for the boys' school on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nIt is noted that you will arrange for the transposition of the double desks now in use in the primary class of the girls' school to the new classroom, and with the addition of the desks now asked for and the front and rear seats, you will be able to provide seating accommodation to meet all requirements. Before we place an order for the front and rear seats required by you, you will be good enough to state whether the sizes will match the desks that were recently supplied and which were ordered from the W. F. Vilas Co., Ogdensburg, P.Q., as it will be necessary to obtain front and rear seats to match the desks for which they are intended. A slightly lower price can be obtained from this firm, and if the fronts and rears manufactured by them will match the various types of desk in use, an order will be placed with them for the number requisitioned by you.\n\nIt is noted that you also require one right and one left casting for a #6 desk. Kindly state if these castings are required for a desk manufactured by the above firm, and if not, for which make of desk these castings are required.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of eight window curtains, one clock, one thermometer, one waste paper basket, one water pail, one wash basin, one soap dish, drinking cups, roller towel fixtures and one pencil sharpener.\n\nYou may also arrange for the purchase of two stoves of a size and type suitable to heat the building, and also for the necessary stove pipes, and when these are received, you should arrange to have them set up. You may also purchase two coal scuttles, two shovels, one axe, two brooms, two dust pans, and one stove brush.\n\nYou may also purchase two clocks, one each to be placed in the lower halls of the boy's and girls' schools. While care should be taken to see that good clocks are purchased, they should be as reasonably priced as possible.\n\n- Before -\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal, Caughnawaga (R.C.) Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nBefore making the purchase of the above supplies you will be good enough to obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers, and in each case purchase from the dealer quoting the lowest price. You should obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, from the dealers from whom you make the purchase, and hand them to Mr. Agent Brossard, who will certify the same, and forward to the Department in order that payment can be made. You should attach to the accounts a memorandum giving the names of the firms asked to quote, and the prices quoted by each.\n\nThe Department will leave the purchase of the above articles in your hands, to make the best arrangements you can, and to secure the lowest possible prices for the most serviceable articles.\n\nRegarding your request that a large gong be obtained for each school, I will be pleased if you will obtain a price for these gongs, and the cost of installing same, and inform the Department, when your request will receive consideration.\n\nThe Department will place an order with the Government Stationery Office for four Underwood typewriters to be sent to your address. These machines have been taken over from the Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, and have been put in good repair and are practically as good as new. The type of the standard keyboard type, and a set of Munson's rubber keys for each machine will also be sent. Before placing the order, however, I would like you to state whether you require the keyboards of these machines to contain English or French characters.\n\nAs soon as the information asked for regarding the typewriters and the front and rear desks is received, an order will be placed for both at once. I will be pleased if you will let us have this information as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAs t. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal, Caughnawaga (R.C.) Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your inquiry regarding desks I would say that the backs and fronts will match those recently ordered from the W.T. Villar Co., Comancheville. The six fronts and backs No. 5 single desks to complete the 3rd Class Girls School may also be purchased from the W.T. Villar Co. Those we have are not the same make, but the difference is so slight that it will not matter. The R & L Caltinge are for one single desk No. 6. It is to replace those broken in the last shipment from Comancheville.\n\nI will be pleased to have the French accents on the typewriters, if possible, as it will be very helpful. My intention is to have the children become familiar with both languages. It is a necessity here.\n\nI would request that I may be allowed to have a repair man come from Montreal during the summer to\nlook over our typ machines, and put them in good working order for the new school year.\n\nI really do not care to have the Munsen rubber caps on our machines, but if the key boards could be made blank instead I would prefer it. We teach the touch method, and with a visible keyboard it is much harder than with a blank one. Any ordinary repair man will make a key board blank in a very short time.\n\nEight of our pupils, five boys and three girls, will receive their Diploma for Typewriting. Some have attained a speed of 47 net words a minute on a blank machine. Seven of them write with ease 100 words a minute in Short-hand. They will undergo their final test tomorrow and receive their Diplomas, if their work is accepted by the Montreal Institute.\n\nMy Agent Brossard very kindly donated a gold medal for the best pupil in Arithmetic. To determine this I requested Mr. Brossard to give an examination himself, which he accordingly did. Eighteen pupils took the test and four obtained 100%.\nI then submitted these four to another test and one boy came out with 95%. The children showed great interest in their work, and were very enthusiastic.\n\nI purchased prizes to the amount of $60.00 as per allowance, and will forward accounts in a few days.\n\nI shall attend to the other matters and obtain competitive prices for clocks, lamps etc., as soon as the schools are closed. But now the final examinations promotions etc. take up every moment of my time.\n\nThinking you may kindly,\n\n& am. dear Sir,\n\nYours very cordially,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal\n\nMr. L. D.

Paget,\nPurchasing Agent.\nOn July 4th I was authorized to perform certain work at the Government school buildings on the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve, and I at once applied to the Accounts Branch which immediately took the matter up with the Purchasing Commission for obtaining the materials required, the estimated cost of which is about $100.00.\n\nThe work was urgently needed and had to be done during the school holidays. These materials have not yet been received, and a good amount of time has thus been lost owing to the fact that the men did not have the necessary materials on hand. I wish, therefore, to inform the Department that if this proceeding is to be followed every time small quantities of materials are required, I shall not be held responsible for the delay in the performance of the work and also the cost of same. Unless I am given more latitude in the execution of my work outside of the office I regret to say that it is almost impossible for me to transact business to the best advantage of the Department. If thoroughly examined the above case will prove that there is no practical economy in delaying the purchase of a small quantity of materials, especially the kind generally required in our works.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nINDIAN TRUST FUND\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nTo Omer Barbeau\n\nDATE: 1921 Caughnawaga Reserve\n\nAMOUNT\n\nAuthorized by Dept. letter No _______ dated _______\n\nTo 34\u00bd his work\nto Delorme's house\nin May last at 60\u00a2\n\n$2070\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed\nand the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item\nof the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent:\n\nIndian Affairs.

Brosseau\nIndian Agent\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.\nActing Ass't Deputy Secretary\nOttawa\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI take the liberty of asking you to kindly inquire if there are any other typewriters available from the D.A.C.R. or at the Stationery Department in Ottawa. I would be grateful indeed for two more machines. Underwood's preferred. There are twenty-four pupils in regular attendance and the practice has to be broken up into three parts while if we had two more machines it could be divided into two parts only. This would facilitate the work greatly. I know you will do what lies in your power to help us out.\n\nI am submitting for your approval a monthly report card which I would like to have printed for distribution in the six higher classes of the School. The supply we have is exhausted, and I have changed the form somewhat to meet the conditions of the schools today. I would request you to authorize me to have the work done and I will see to it that the very lowest price will be obtained.\n\nI would furthermore ask to be allowed to have the French characters placed on three or four of our typewriters. As it is there is not one machine with the accents used in writing French and I think it quite necessary that the children should be trained to write French as readily as English.\n\nI am pleased to tell you that the children are doing wonderfully well in school. They are showing the greatest interest in their work and the attendance is all that possibly can be desired.\n\nThanking you for your past kindness\n\nI am, dear Sir,\nYours very cordially,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. J.D. Sutherland,\nSchools' Branch,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, October 12th, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, addressed to Mr. Sutherland of this Department, requesting that two more typewriters be supplied for the use of the continuation school on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that an order is being placed with the Government Stationery Office to ship to your address, Adirondack Junction, P.Q., 2 Underwood typewriters from the supply on hand which was taken over from the D.S.C.R. The French characters have been ordered to be supplied with these typewriters.\n\nYou may arrange to have the French characters placed on a number of the typewriters which you have at present on hand. You should obtain these from some dealer in Montreal, and account, in duplicate, should be obtained covering the cost, which you should hand to Mr. Agent Brossard to certify and send to the Department for payment.\n\nRegarding the monthly report cards required for distribution to the pupils in the six higher classes of the Caughnawaga Schools, I beg to say that you may arrange to have a number of these cards printed. The sample which you forwarded in your letter is being returned herewith. Accounts should be obtained covering the cost of the printing of these cards and they should be handed to Mr. Agent Brossard in the usual manner.\n\nThe Department is very pleased to note that there is such a large and regular attendance of Indian children at the schools under your charge, and that the work is progressing satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Adirondack Junction, making a total amount of $54.00.\n\nIf these are the materials for which payment is being claimed, I would refer you to your letter of July 13th, 1921, signed by Mr. J. P.

We already have them in the two primary Grades, but we have such a hard time keeping the children supplied with proper that I think it would be quite a saving to have them use slates in the lower classes especially.\n\nI would also ask if an allowance of $40.00 will be made for sewing material in the Girls' School, and if the same amount $30.00 plus $5.00 for new school will be continued for the washing and scrubbing of towels.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nAttention of Mr. A.F.

If the cost of these slates will exceed $10.00 you should obtain competitive prices before you make the purchase. You should obtain accounts in duplicate and hand them to Mr. Agent Brossard to certify the same and forward them to the Department.\n\nThe allowance of $40.00 for the purchase of sewing material for the girls' school will be continued. Properly itemized accounts should be forwarded covering the expenditure for this purpose, which should not exceed the above amount.\n\nThe sum of $35.00 will be continued to cover the cost of washing and scrubbing of towels.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It was not practicable to ask for tenders in these kinds of purchases.\n\nAs to the family Benedict mentioned in your letter of mine of January last, I beg to say that there are 3 children of school age: One boy 12 years, a girl 11, and another boy 8. They have absolutely no clothing and need to be fitted up completely. They have no shoes or other clothing and have been kept in the house all winter. The boy, aged 12 attended school a few weeks in June and September. He is absolutely illiterate, can hardly pick a few simple words. The girl, 11, went to school a few weeks in June.\nSir,\n\nand knows nothing. The other boy never attended school.\n\nThe boys should need overcoats, caps, mitts, shoes, rubber stockings, underwear and a suit of clothes or pants and sweaters. The girl would need cloak, dress, underwear, shoes, stockings, mitts, rubber cap, etc. I should judge that it will not be possible to clothe these children for less than $25.00 each; and I really do not know if I could get them fitted off for that amount. I will wait for your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.B. Rossman\nIndian Agent\n\nRussell T.

Mr. Viau tells me that he can locate the place where the pipe is broken by unearthing it at the corner near the church, and that he could repair it himself. I prefer to consult you before authorizing such expenditure.\n\nI consider that it is absolutely necessary that this pipe should be laid deeper so as to avoid the danger of frost, and this work should be done before the macadamized road is finished in front of the church. I am told that this pipe is only one (1\") inch in diameter, and it would be preferable to have a larger pipe.\n\nNow that the ground around the school is nearly dry, the outside closets might be utilized, and if it is your intention to lower the pipe in the ground, we will not follow Mr. Viau's idea.\n\nI shall await your instructions before undertaking any repairs.\n\nYours, etc.\n\nJ.

In reply I have to request that you will ask Mr. Viau the caretaker, to try and locate the defect in the pipe, and to put it in serviceable condition for the present.\n\nIt should be understood that this work is to be done without any charges, as it is part of Mr. Viau's duties, to look after the plumbing and heating in all government buildings in Caughnawaga.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

Now that the weather is fine, the water drained off, our girls may use the toilets outside. I have had these inside toilets well cleaned and barred up until such time as repairs are made to the pipe which froze and subsequently burst. We cannot now have water until the pipes are dug up and repaired. A letter to the Department stating this fact was forwarded by Mr. Agent Brosseau quite recently.\n\nThanking you for your kindness,\n\nI am dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. D.D.

I referred them, for he always brought an interpreter, to the Indian Department stating that as soon as the order would come to me to give up the clock should do so.\n\nIn the meantime he wrote to some certain Mr. Chandler and bought me the letter which stated\nthat the said clock was claimed by himself and his wife. I thereupon asked him to allow me to send the letter to the Department and obtain authority to transfer the clock to him. He would not agree to this, and after saying many unpleasant things about the Department and the Government at large he demanded me to give the clock up stating that it was not the business of the Government etc. I refused to surrender the clock until I received orders, so he threatened to have me to court etc. You understand that I am not in fact alarmed by his threat, but I wish you to kindly write me an order to either give or keep the clock together with authority to purchase another to replace it, for it is one of the best.\nShould we have, should you decide to hand him over the clock. There is absolutely no use in trying to reason with some of these people they will not understand.\n\nTrusting that you may settle this little difficulty at once as possible.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\n\nMr. A.

From 1915 to 1921, the Department allowed $20.00 for each school. Last year I asked for $10.00 extra for The Continuation Class which was granted.\n\nIn view of the fact that the number of children attending school has so increased, that the price of books has not in any way lowered, it is very difficult to give rewards to the pupils as the amount allowed is insufficient. On the supposition that the Department would still allow $40.00, there should only be an average of 12 cts for each child. It is next to impossible to get a book for less than 75 cts or $1.00, and unless I go bargain hunting for a month ahead, I cannot make ends meet. I would therefore ask for further allowance leaving it to your good judgment as to how much more than $50.00 the Department could give for this purpose.\n\nThe children have put in a good year's work, I would like them to leave school happy and satisfied for nothing so influences children for renewed efforts as contentment. All of us want adequate reward for our efforts and surely children are no exception to this rule.\n\nI will await your reply before proceeding any further with the preparations for the end of the school year.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Mr. Russell T. Perrier.\nOTTAWA, May 20th, 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the grant that will be allowed for the purchase of prizes for distribution to the pupils of the schools under your charge on the Caughnawaga Reserve before they close for the coming summer holidays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say in view of the excellent work that is being carried on by yourself and the teachers, we have decided to allow the sum of $100 for the purchase of prizes, etc. We will have a large number of demands for the same purpose from our other schools and, as our funds are limited, it will not be possible to make a larger increase in the grant allowed your schools than the above stated amount, viz: $100.\n\nIn making the purchase of these prizes, it will be necessary for you to obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, from the merchants from whom the goods are purchased. These accounts you should hand to Mr. Agent Brossard, who is being informed of the amount allowed, and he will then certify these accounts and forward to the Department in order that payment can be made.\n\nI sincerely hope that the grant we are allowing, which is double that of last year, will solve for you the problem of obtaining suitable gifts or prizes for all the pupils deserving the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nSister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal, Indian Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOTTAWA, May 20th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that we are authorizing Sister Mary Gabriel, Supervising Principal of the schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve, to expend an amount not to exceed $100 in the purchase of suitable articles to be distributed as prizes to the pupils before the schools close for the coming summer holidays.\n\nThe Sister Superior has been requested to obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, from the merchant from whom she makes these purchases, and to hand these accounts to you, which you will be good enough to attach to proper voucher forms and certify the accounts and forward to the Department in order that payment can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. M. Brosseau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of May 20th, No.5-1-5 by which you increase the allowance for the prizes in the Schools, and for which I wish to thank you most sincerely. Your generosity far exceeded my expectations, for I did not for a moment think I would possibly get above $75.00 and I was figuring on this amount. I will now be able to give recognition to all of the deserving pupils, and I wish to repeat how very happy we were all to learn that we could dispose of a whole $100.00 in behalf of our dear children.\n\nI wish to thank you for your appreciation of our mark system, which has indeed been very helpful to us in securing attendance, application and attention.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T.

A carpenter could do this in a few days I should judge.\n\nSome of the black boards especially in two rooms of Girls' School, one room in Boys' school and the old Methodist school need either to be repaired or renewed. A painter here assured me that with Sherwin Williams Black Board paint he could fix those up and make them last a few years longer.\n\nThe two cedar posts holding the gates of the school (formerly Methodist) are falling to pieces and need to be renewed.\n\n5th.- The two Artesian wells, one in this last named school and the other in the Boys' school need to be cleaned. The water is absolutely filthy and unfit for use.\n\n6th.- Some system of ventilation will have to be devised to eliminate the odor from the toilets in the Girls' School. An air pipe should be placed over the cess pool and another to draw out the impure air. The infection is absolutely harmful to the health of the teachers and pupils.\n\n7th.- The services of a carpenter would be needed for a few days to repair locks, bolts and so many odds and ends that get out of work during a year.\n\nThese are the most pressing needs and I would kindly request that they be given attention early that the schools may be all in good working order for September 5th.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nAttention of Schools' Branch,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Que., August 26, 1922.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nAs the schools are about to open in a few days the following articles will be needed for cleaning and keeping the classrooms in order:\n\n3 bbls dustbane 250 lbs each\n3 gallons of Cedar Oil\n3 boxes Soap for use in schools\n20 packages Pearline for washing floors\n1 dozen boxes Gillets Lye for sinks and toilets\n4 Hair Brushes for Janitor's use\n4 Dusters -- sanitary\n1 box Toilet Paper\n1 gallon Desinfectant for toilets.\n\nI would further request that the Janitors of each school be provided with a gasoline lantern for sweeping. School finishing at 4 p.m. especially during the short days gives little time for sweeping and the excuse offered is that there is no light. I understand it is quite impossible to sweep in the dark and after discussing the question with the Agent we considered it a necessity, as we have had any amount of trouble about the sweeping and dusting of the classrooms. The price of a gasoline lantern with a powerful light is in the neighborhood of $12.00. If you consider this purchase feasible, I will await your decision with anxiety.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Mr. L.D. McLean.\nOttawa, August 31, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, in which you request authorization to purchase the supplies mentioned by you, to be used in cleaning and keeping the classrooms in order at the Caughnawaga Schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may purchase the following supplies for this purpose, viz.:\n\n- 2 bbls. dustbane,\n- 3 gallons cedar oil,\n- 3 boxes soap for use in schools,\n- 20 packages pearline,\n- 12 boxes Gillet's Lye,\n- 4 hair brushes,\n- 4 dusters sanitary,\n- 1 box toilet paper,\n- 1 gallon disinfectant.\n\nIf you are satisfied that there would be no danger from fire, in the using of gasoline lanterns by the janitors, you may purchase the two required for the purpose of providing light for cleaning the classrooms after dark.\n\nIt is noted that you request 3 bbls. dustbane, but it is considered that 2 should be sufficient for a considerable time.\n\nIt will be necessary, before making any of the above purchases, to obtain competitive prices, and in each case the articles should be procured from the firm quoting the lowest price. You will kindly secure accounts, in duplicate, from the merchants who supply the goods. These accounts should be handed to Mr. Agent Brossard, who will attach them to proper voucher forms and forward them to the Department for payment.\n\nThe gasoline lanterns, if purchased, should not exceed in cost the amount mentioned by you, viz.: $12.00 each.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Delorme\nOttawa, Oct. 19, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, requesting that your share of the rent due for the Delorimier house, which is rented for school purposes on the Caughnawaga Reserve, be sent you.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Auditor General drew our attention to the overpayment in the rental of this house for the months of June, July and August, 1921. As you are aware, the rental paid is at the rate of $150 per annum, and your share is $6.25 per month. During the above months, a cheque was issued to you for $37.50, and the same amount was paid John O. Delorimier. There was thus an overpayment for these three months, to each, of $18.75.\n\nWe have been instructed to deduct this amount from the next rental due. There will, therefore, be no further payment due you until the month beginning December first, next, as it will take the rent due for the months of September, October and November to make up the overpayment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Walker Hardware Co., Limited, for galvanized netting and staples. Seemingly this account was sent here in error. If it is for supplies delivered to you on behalf of Indian purposes and if it is correct, you should attach it to voucher forms, certify thereto and forward to the Department in due course for payment.

Indian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nTeachers' Residence\nCaughnawaga, Que., 11/16/22.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nWould you kindly advise me if the Department will allow this year a sum in the sum of $35.00 for the purchase of sewing material for the Girls' School? This amount would not be sufficient in view of the fact that we have about one hundred (100) girls who follow this Course, but we have been utilizing much of the material sent by the Department of the Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment, yet the goods sent cannot be all turned to account. We mostly need new \u2014 needles, thimbles, scissors and other such things which are so easily lost, broken or otherwise destroyed. I would, furthermore, ask if the sum previously allowed for the washing of towels, etc., in the School will be continued. This is usually Thirty-five ($35.00) Dollars.\n\nWe would request the authority to purchase about five (5) yards of oil cloth for the dining room. We will use it as runners to protect the heavy and more valuable under linoleum in places most exposed to wear.\n\nPreparatory to the Holidays, we will need to refreshen the varnish on the floors and hallways, and I would, therefore, ask to be allowed to purchase two (2) gallons of floor varnish and wax.\n\nTrusting that these requests will meet with your kind approval,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Mr. L.D. McLean.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nWould you be good enough to look over your files and see if a bill for $39.13 from Mr. Coursol for work in putting up the air shaft at the Girls' School was received by you.\n\nI remember distinctly sending the bill but I cannot recall if I sent it to you directly or through Mr. Agent Brossard. However the bill has not been paid and Mr. Coursol is a bit annoyed over the delay.\n\nYou recall my request to have the screens in the rear of the house removed for the winter and replaced by glass. The work has been done and should the bill for the glass reach the Department, you will understand the need.\n\nOur new Caretaker is doing very well. It has been a great boon for the Sisters to have such a good trustworthy man, and I am learning to appreciate him more and more every day. He can do all the odd jobs around, and at those times his wife and children do the sweeping for him. It saves running around for a carpenter or a plumber every little while.\n\nI would request you to answer my question with regard to Mr. Coursol as he is most anxious to know when he will get his money.\n\nThanking you for past kindness,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Mr. Chene.\nOttawa 25th November, 1922.\n\nHague,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 18th instant, I beg to say that Mr. Courcel's account of $39.13 therein referred to in connection with the Girls' School, Caughnawaga Reserve was paid on the 29 September by cheque No 1066. The said cheque covered also an account of $1.50 received from Mr. Courcel.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRevd Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nGirls' School,\nCaughnawaga Reserve,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nImmediately upon receipt of your letter No. 6-4-5 relative to the account due Mr. Courcel amounting to $38.13 and which you claim was paid on September 29th 1922 I communicated with Mr. Courcel over the telephone and he assures me that he never received the check of which you speak. He says he received $25.50 sometime in September for an ash pan and a few incidentals. Would you be good enough to let me know who endorsed check No. 1966, as these vouchers must have been returned from the Bank of Montreal. Mr. Courcel will then be in a position to know if there was any fraud committed by his employees.\n\nI would furthermore call your attention to an item of $31.95 freight which I paid on the first car load of coal sent by the Weaver Coal Co., October 24th. I sent the bill through the Agent with receipt attached, about one month ago. Mr. Brown assured me that the Weaver Coal Co. refunded this amount to the Department through him, but the bill has never been paid to me. I would be grateful if you looked up this matter.\n\nI would also be thankful for an explanation regarding the payment of the September Quarter Bonus to teachers. There is $180.00 due and as I counted upon receiving this amount I paid up all my bills to date thinking this money would tide me over December. Had I foreseen such a delay, I would have left some bills standing and kept enough ready cash for every day use. A word of explanation on this subject will also be appreciated.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. H.D. McLean,\nAsst-Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa December 2nd 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to enquiries in your letter of the 29th instant, I beg to inform you that official cheque No 1922 was sent to Mr Coursol in payment of his account of $39.15, for which amount the cheque was drawn. It went forward on the 29th September. The cheque has been returned through the bank, and it bears the endorsement of \"D. Coursol\", and also \"J.A. Coursol\". This cheque was cashed by the Bank of Montreal at Lachine.\n\nOn the 28th September the Department sent forward also cheque No 1983 for $1.50 in Mr Coursol's favour, in payment of his account dated the 31st August.\n\nA cheque for $31.85 is being sent to you in payment of the account which you mentioned for freight charges prepaid on coal.\n\nThe bonus for the month of September and also for December quarter will be paid at the end of December, after the receipt by the Department of your returns.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRevd Sister Mary Gabriel,\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nOttawa, December 13th, 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, in reply I beg to say that the account of Charles F. Dawson, Ltd., amounting to $10.50 has been paid.\n\nWe regret that your letter of November 18th last was overlooked. In reply thereto, I beg to say that you may expend an amount not to exceed $35.00 in the purchase of sewing materials for the girls' School on the Caughnawaga Reserve. You may also purchase the oilcloth for the dining-room, approximately 5 yards, and also 2 gallons of floor varnish and floor wax.\n\nThe Department will also authorize an expenditure of $35.00 for the purpose of having school towels etc., washed. You should obtain the accounts in duplicate for any expenditure incurred by you for the above purposes and, you should hand the same to Mr. Agent Letournau.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

The rent due for these four months amounts to $50. There was, however, an overpayment made during the months of June, July and August, 1921, to the amount of $37.50. This amount is being deducted in equal proportions from the share of the rental due both John O. and Annie K. Delormier, which leaves a balance due them of $6.25 each and cheques for this amount have been sent.

It is supposed that the main pipe is frozen some place underground and outside of the building.\n\nAs there was absolute necessity that this question be attended at once, I have hired the services of an Indian named White, whom is recommended by Rev. Sister Superior. I am informed that the exit, or common sewer has been laid over and in contact with this main water pipe. I have ordered White to arrange for a supply of boiled water into the school basement and to let it out, if possible, in order to thaw out the main laid underneath. The drain is clear and I believe that if this is properly worked out by White, we will succeed. However, in case that the pipe cannot be cleared this way, I beg to ask your authorization to retain the White's services at the rate of $15.00 per month, as suggested by Rev. Sister Superior, until your Department have ordered an expert to come to Caughnawaga and examine the trouble in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs.

When the thaw began we noticed that water crept into the basement of the school, at first in small quantities, but on Friday, April 7th, the water rose to about one inch. All this week we have been fighting to keep the water down, but in spite of all efforts it rose to eight or ten inches. The evil effects of such a damp cellar on the teachers and pupils has worried me greatly, so today I took it upon myself to remedy conditions. I employed two men with a pump to clear the basement of water and another to dig a drain to the river.\n\nTwo factors combine to bring about this unusual condition:\n\nFirstly - The road in front of the school was macadamized, made higher and no outlet left for the water to take its course; secondly - The depression between the school and the Council House which previously held the water was filled in and as a result the water comes into the cellar. The unusual cold winter may also have had its effect, but the results are altogether unpleasant.\n\nTo add to the inconvenience the cess-pool has either frozen or overflowed and the toilets in the school cannot be used.\n\nMr. Agent Letourneau visited the school today and approved of my action upon which he will make his report to the Department. The foundations of the school have been undermined somewhat, and well needed repairs will have to be made to prevent the repetition of this inconvenience.\n\nI consider that the people building the road should be compelled to put in some system of drainage to allow the water to flow towards the river.\n\nTrusting that the Departmental Engineer may soon come to Caughnawaga to settle these difficulties,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Mr. R.R. McLean,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Agent Letourneau asked me for information regarding the condition of the toilets at the Continuation School about which the Inspector reported unfavorably, and by way of explanation and information I would say the following:\n\nThe Continuation Class Boys use the same toilets as the other Boys. These were built some years ago and might accommodate a class of twenty or thirty pupils. We have over two hundred boys using these toilets and it would require the services of a man every day just to keep them in order. It is impossible for the janitor who has six furnaces to heat, and seven classes to sweep besides shoveling and attending to pumps, radiators, etc. The caretaker, George Latour, is the most painstaking diligent man I ever met. Up at 5 o'clock every morning and never in bed until after 10 o'clock when he goes the rounds of the six furnaces. He sifts the ashes using the clinders, splits the wood and looks after the general welfare of the teachers. His task is a heavy one and were it not for his wife, who does the sweeping, he would never get through.\n\nIt is useless to repair these toilets, what is needed is toilets in the basement of the school that may be flushed, and in sufficient number to meet present conditions. It is impossible to run the schools here now on the plan that the Department outlined in 1910 or 1911, as conditions have absolutely changed. In connection with the Continuation Class, we put up a small toilet on the Belcourt property which is used only by the Girls. The key is kept in the classroom and it is always locked. Boys have no access there.\n\nThe Inspector must have also reported on the crowded conditions of the schools. It is next to impossible to lodge the children in the present quarters. The idea of not receiving any children under seven cannot be carried out, as the Mothers lament and wail if we refuse to accept the children. They tell me the children go to the river and they are in continual dread of the children old enough to run around, are not in school. We use all the eloquence we can to keep the children out, but the final plea is that we are accommodating and unless we yield to their entreaties the whole neighborhood is in an uproar. There is a great deal to be gained by giving all a fair chance, but we lack space, and that we cannot supply unless the Department enlarges the schools to meet conditions at present.\n\nTrusting you will understand that these is no fault of the Janitor if conditions such as reported by Mr. Gilman exist.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6077, file 305-5, part 2)\nOttawa, April 19, 1923.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the toilets at the Continuation School and the need of more accommodation in the basement of the Boys' School. I have also to acknowledge your letter of the 13th instant, regarding the water in the basement at the Girls' School and the need of better drainage facilities from the school grounds.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Chene, of this Department, will visit Caughnawaga during the next week and will make enquiry into the various matters needing attention in connection with the schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Payment of rent was allowed for the months of September, October, November and December. It amounted to $50.00 but, as there was an overpayment to the amount of $37.50 made for the months of June, July, and August 1921, the said overpayment was deducted from the $50.00 found to be due. This deduction was made in equal proportions from the rents due John O. Delorimier and Annie K. Delorimier, which left a balance payable to each of these persons of $6.25. Consequently the Department sent forward cheque No. 3455 for $6.25 on behalf of Annie K. Delorimier, and cheque No. 3456 for $6.25 on behalf of John O. Delorimier for whom the Bank of Hochelaga holds a power of attorney.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Manager,\nBank of Hochelaga,\nChateauguay, Que.\nOttawa, April 23, 1923,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to request that you will make a complete inspection of the sewage disposal and drainage systems of the girls' school at Caughnawaga. Also, ascertain what arrangements could be made in order to provide a sanitary sewerage system for the boys' and Continuation schools on the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve.\n\nYou may also interview the Principal of the schools with reference to other improvements which are required in connection with the drainage of the various school grounds on this reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(J. D. MCLEAN)\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. D. Chene, Esq., C. E.,\nDepartmental Engineer,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa - Ont.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th instant, in connection with the caretaking of the out houses of the Continuation School in the Village of Caughnawaga, I beg to say that in fact these out houses have been in a very poor condition during this winter season; it is admitted that it is part of the duties of the caretaker to attend to work of this nature, however, I may say that it would have took his whole time to regulate the marching in and out of these houses, first, owing to the smallness of the out houses, second, because of the large number of boys in attendance to school, also because of the severity of the weather. The conditions now are not the same as they were ten or twelve years ago when the school was built, the average attendance at that time was of about 75, while now the average is of 200 boys. I therefore beg to recommend that means be taken in order that the toilets be built into the Boys' school cellar, the same as they are at the Girls' school. Facilities of drainage could be found easier I presume than that of the Girls' School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, May 2, 1923.\n\nNOTE\n\nPlease refer to file 5-2-5- for copies of my reports with reference to the proposed improvements to the sewage and drainage systems for the boys' school on Caughnawaga Indian Reserve.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\n| DATE | Description                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1923 | Authorized by Dept. letter No. 54-2 dated March 7th/23                       |        |\n| April 14 | To haul water from the St. Lawrence river to the Girls' School, during 1/2 month, at $15.00 per month | $7.50  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

These closets and urinals would be automatically flushed with water about four times a day. The water would be pumped from the present well by a small gasoline engine to a new tank which would be installed on the ground floor of the school without any inconvenience. The sewage from the building would be treated in a small concrete septic tank in the school yard, and then discharged into a creek located in the common of the reserve, at a distance of about 270 feet from the school building.\nThis system would also be used for the drainage of the basement of the school which is not provided with any kind of drainage system.\n\nThe cost of the above mentioned work would be as follows:\n\nClosets .................................. $450.00\nUrinals ................................... 200.00\nWater Tank ............................... 150.00\nPiping and fittings ...................... 40.00\nEngine .................................... 125.00\nLabour .................................... 175.00\n\nSewage Disposal System:\n\nSeptic Tank ............................. 780.00\nSewer pipe and excavation from building to outlet ........... 450.00\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\n| DATE | CAUGHNAWAGA RESERVE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------------------|--------|\n| 1923 | Authorized by Dept. letter No. dated | $33.25 |\n\nMay 3\n\nTo different use of a horse & sleigh from the 1st of January to 1st of May 1923.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lafleur and Sons submitted a certified cheque for $1400.00. Messrs. Lafleur and Sons tender for the two schools is $925.00 lower than that of Dubuc, who furnished no security. Lafleur and Sons erected two buildings on the Caughnawaga reserve last summer in a satisfactory manner and as they are experienced and reliable contractors I would recommend that their tender for both buildings be accepted.\n\nChief Accountant.\n\nSince writing the above memorandum another tender has been received - too late for consideration, and without the required security deposit.

I would like you when in Caughnawaga to visit these two men and see samples of the coal that they are handling. The Department is still of the opinion that it would be well to divide the order provided that they agree on a satisfactory price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Each of the class-rooms in these two schools has accommodation for 48 children.\n\nI asked Mr. Ohene to look into this matter of overcrowding and he informed me that on the day he called at the Girls' School there were 90 children in the Junior room and 45 in the Senior room. In the Junior room the children were obliged to sit three at a desk which should accommodate two. The same state of affairs existed in the Boys' School, where there were 85 children in the Junior room and 50 in the Senior.\n\nThere is ample accommodation in both these buildings for an extra class-room. As there are many more children who should attend these schools I think it would be only right to utilize the space and engage a teacher for each.\neach school temporarily until other permanent arrangements could be made.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are over 150 children in attendance at each of these schools and the junior classes are held above the ground floor. There is a main staircase running through the center of the building in each school and, should a fire occur, it would be a very difficult matter to get the children from the upper story safely out of the building.\n\nIt seems to me that as a safeguard fire escapes should be provided.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

These are to be placed in the rear elevation of the building and the estimated cost of the work is $455.00 for each school.\n\nOwing to the constant increase of the price of steel, and the time required for the construction of this type of fire-escape, I would recommend that the work be started as soon as possible.\n\nPrices for this work could be obtained from firms in Montreal and Ottawa if desired. Specifications will be prepared immediately if this should meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has completed its work by the installation of a magnificent aqueduct system.\n\nThe inspector Mr. Gilman who has just completed his autumn visit through the schools of the reserve has declared himself satisfied of everything he has seen and heard and warmly congratulated the mistresses and the pupils. We know that the education of the Indians is in the hands of the Federal Government.\n\nThe Federal treasury spends annually $17,000.00 for educational purposes at Caughnawaga.\n\nThe schools contain actually over 300 children. There are also more than 60 children at the industrial school of Spanish River, Ont.

It should have shown quotation of prices obtained from other firms, as well as the price quoted by the firm named, before the order for the goods was given. No doubt you can supply the same from the list herewith returned.\n\nAs the provisions of the Purchasing Commission must be strictly observed it is regretted that it is necessary to withhold payment of the above mentioned account until you send in a memorandum furnishing the necessary information. A cheque will issue promptly when you have taken such action. You should be fully aware of the course to be followed, and it is hoped that in future you will endeavour to take action which will obviate delay in payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. M.

D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI take the liberty of addressing you today to ask for authorization to purchase seventy-five or one hundred yards of roller towelling for the schools. Those in use have given almost five years of service, and many of them are completely worn out. Since the installation of a water system in the Boys' and Girls' Schools we are using double the number of roller towels, for it is so much easier to keep the children's hands clean when soap and water are available at any time. We also have to supply the Continuation School. Prices vary from cotton towelling at 24 cents a yard to linen towelling at 45 cents. I would suggest the latter as being more durable.\n\nI would also request that the Department allow me to have bound in convenient forms for the Teachers' use the Educational Magazines, Periodicals, Reviews, and Teachers' Helps which we have been collecting for the past five years. It would be a very aid to the teachers to have matter of this kind classified and available. There are now twelve teachers including Principal and Assistants engaged in teaching in the Caughnawaga Schools, and we really do what lies in our power to help them improve their methods of teaching. I have collected and classified 34 volumes which I can have bound for about $1.10 per volume. I would allow 17 for each school.\n\nI would furthermore request that I be authorized to purchase from Mrs. Patton a few articles of furniture which she is willing to dispose of at great sacrifice, and which will be needed in our new Residence. The Jacobs family whose house we now occupy left here many articles of furniture because they had no place to store them away. We have been using 3 cupboards, 1 side-board, four tables and over a dozen chairs besides many other articles most necessary in a house-hold. Mrs. Patton will leave nothing unless we pay for it. She has a very fine desk and chair which will be needed in the Principals School Office at the Residence, she offers both for $40.00. I have a smaller desk which I would thus be able to use in my private office.\n\nTrusting that you will be able to grant my requests,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6077, file 305-5, part 3)\nOttawa, November 25, 1920.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant requesting permission to purchase a supply of roller towelling for the use of the schools under your charge on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the purchase by you of seventy-five yards of roller towelling and, while of a serviceable material, it should be purchased as cheaply as possible. It will be necessary to obtain competitive prices before making the purchase.\n\nYou may also arrange to have bound in convenient form for the teachers' use the educational magazines, periodicals, teachers' helps, etc., to the extent of thirty-four volumes and the cost of the binding should not exceed the estimate furnished by you, namely, $1.10 per volume.\n\nYou should obtain proper accounts for the purchase of the towelling and the cost of the binding and hand them to Mr. Agent Brosseau, who is being informed of the authority granted you, and he will certify the accounts and forward them to the Department, in order that payment can be made.\n\nWith reference to your request for authority to purchase a few articles of furniture from Mrs. Patton for the use of the teacher's residence I beg to say that you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga (R.C.) Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa, November 25, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Rev. Sister Mary Gabriel, Caughnawaga, has been authorized to purchase seventy-five yards of towelling for the use of the schools under her charge and she has also been authorized to have thirty-four volumes of educational magazines, periodicals, etc., bound for the convenience of the teachers. She is being requested to obtain proper accounts for the above and hand them to you, which you will be good enough to certify and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Brosseau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nMy dear Mr. Brosseau,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter requesting that I submit quotations from the three different firms from which we obtained prices for the goods listed in Almy's bill. In reply I would say that these quotations were given to me orally at the time. I noted the prices given and sent them to the Department. I have a letter from Mr. McLean No.5-4-5 allowing the purchase of two hundred chairs from St. Jean Co. for $216.00, after he had received the quotations. The same day Almys offered the same chairs for $200.00, so I purchased them there to save the $16.00. On this same letter Mr. McLean specified that the accounts should be accompanied by a memorandum showing the names of the firms from whom quotations were asked, and the prices quoted by them. This I accordingly did, but I certainly did not know that I had to keep the tenders; moreover I did not ask for them in writing. It is really too bad that you should have been put to such an inconvenience, but you may be assured that I shall be wiser another time.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J. M. Brosseau,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant P.Q.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th instant with regard to the voucher No. 27484 in favour of Elmoire B\u00e9gin, I beg to point out that this purchase was not made by me but by Rev.

Brosseau\nJ.A.\nNov. 26/20.\n\nRESOLUTION NO. 98\n\nWhereas at a public meeting it was suggested that the Council for the Band should pass a resolution suggesting that the children should attend nearest school in the vicinity, irrespective of sex, and,\n\nWhereas owing to the present conditions, children of the reserve, of tender ages, in attending school are obliged to pass school houses on the way, in all sorts of weather and hardship, and\n\nWhereas it could be easily arranged that children of both sexes could attend the school nearest their abode, therefore,\n\nIT IS HEREBY RESOLVED that the present system be altered to accommodate the children of either sex to attend the school nearest to which they reside.\n\nAdopted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Council has nothing to do with this matter. However, if Rev. father has no objection to the above resolution, I will draw back mine.\n\nJ.M.B.,\nJ.A.\nTranslation.\n\nSt. Constant, November 6th, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nConcerning resolutions Nos. 90 and 91 I pretend that the Council has nothing to do with the management of education.\n\nJ.M. Brosseau,\nIndian Agent.\nSt. Constant, November 30th, 1920.\n\nI wish to draw the attention of the Department on resolution 91 more specially, and I must say that according to my personal recollections and from enquiries made, I came to the conclusion that this resolution is nothing but malicious and comes out of the head of chief P.J. Delisle, and that his colleagues did not understand anything of it. The Sister Superior affirms that in the last three years only one pupil died, that this pupil named McComber died at Lachine of Spanish Grippe.\n\nThis affirmation is corroborated by the Rev. Father Gras.\n\nCouncillor Angus Montour testifies that never to his knowledge has any pupil received any mortal wound at the School and for my part, after having been Agent at Caughnawaga for six years, it is the first time I heard of such case.\n\nThe Sisters have always appeared to me to have an absolute control over the pupils and the latter are most respectful for their teachers. When over 150 young boys playing together we can always expect them to scramble a bit, but I always noticed that those children were under the immediate supervision of one or two sisters.\n\nCouncillor Angus Montour adds that all that the Councillors meant to say in this resolution No. 91, was that the boys school should be directed by a man. After all the progress accomplished since the 1st of January 1915, when the present system was inaugurated, it would be a crime to revert to the old system. My intention is not to cast any reflection on lay teachers as I am an ex-teacher myself; but with young Indians the reverend Sisters are incomparably superior.\n\nYours etc., J.M.

All the month of December we were short of paper and used up every available scrap in the house. I made repeated requests for paper and pencils, so on Monday Jan 15th I sent a messenger to Pacheco to get supplies to start the children. It is quite impossible to keep 300 children in school without paper or pencils.\n\nOn Friday the 14th I received 6 boxes of lead pencils from Ottawa so I hope that the paper will soon be in. We have enough to last until Feb 1st.\n\nThe other rooms are full, as\nall the children returned, and are very well disposed to work.\n\nTrusting that this bill will go through without the formality of competitive prices, for it was quite impossible to do otherwise.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6077, file 305-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to the placing of gongs on the two large schools, I would say that I priced them and inquired about the cost of installation. While discussing the question it was suggested that the gong be rang from the inside by means of an electric button, or in other words that an electric call bell be used. Furthermore an electric alarm bell for fire drill could be placed on the same battery. This appeals to me very strongly, and I am pleased to state that I can have a large ten inch call bell put on the outside of the building, with a small dismissal and a fire bell placed on the inside on a dry battery for $30.00 for each school. This amount covers the cost of material and installation. With this great help I think that tardiness will be a thing of the past.\n\nI also inquired about the cost of a good time-keeper to be used as a Master Clock in each school. The \"Seth Thomas\" is the only dealer here are willing to recommend. A large twelve inch dial Seth Thomas wall clock would cost $18.00. The price is uniform as I have quotations from Henry Birks Co Goodwin's Limited and Murray and O'Shea.\n\nThe clock in the Continuation School was in such poor order that it could not be used, the Teacher was obliged to carry a hand clock to the school from the house every day. Towards the end of the year I had the clock removed to the Residence and we tried to get it into working order and I am pleased to say that we have succeeded. While the caretaker was carrying the clock over he was stopped by Mr. Deer who told him that the clock was not the property of the Department of Indian Affairs but belonged to the Methodist Association. Now that the clock is in good condition I would like you to tell me if we shall keep the clock or return it to the Methodist Organization. I must say that the clock is a very good one and might be worth ten or twelve dollars.\n\nAwaiting an early reply,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Mr. L. D. McLean\nOTTAWA, July 12th, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, submitting an estimate of the cost of placing gongs on the boys' and girls' school buildings at Caughnawaga, and stating that you can have a 10\" call bell installed on the outside of each building, with a small dismissal and fire bell placed on the inside on a dry battery at a cost not exceeding $30.00 for each school. In reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and installation of a gong on each of these buildings. The cost and installation of same should not in each case exceed your estimate of $30.00.\n\nRegarding a clock for each of these schools, I beg to say that you may purchase a \"Seth Thomas\" clock for each of the schools.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain competitive prices for the gongs and clocks, and accounts in duplicate covering the cost of material and labour should be handed to Mr. Agent Brosseau, who should certify the same and send them to the Department for payment. The matter of installing suitable gongs and the purchase of the clocks should be done as cheaply as possible.\n\nRegarding the clock in the Continuation School, I beg to say that you may retain this clock for the present. The Department is of the impression that it supplied this clock to a Methodist School in the first instance, but should a demand be made for the clock at a later date, the question of authorizing the purchase of another one for the Continuation School would receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.

As you are aware the whole of the main pipe between the church and the school building was replaced last year, and lowered to such a depth as to be considered frost proof.\n\nI shall await your report before giving this matter any further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nL. Letourneau Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Fairlie,\n\nAs per instructions of May 16th, I have completed the various repairs and alterations of the Caughnawaga School, more especially to the heating system.\n\nA quantity of materials such as paint, tools, water proofing for the repairing of the roofs, etc., have been stored in the work shop, located in the basement of the teachers' residence. In fact everything that was left unused was turned over to Mr. Latour, the caretaker.\n\nI think it my duty to bring to your attention that when this employee was engaged, it was understood that he would attend to all repairs required at any of the school buildings in the Caughnawaga village, including the water supply and heating systems.\n\nThe new Superior should therefore be advised that in future any repairing work in connection with the above mentioned systems should be carefully looked after by Mr. Latour. It was on account of his knowledge of steam fitting work that his salary as caretaker was considerably raised at the time of his appointment.\n\nThe teachers' residence is provided with all the tools required for this kind of work, and the sisters should be made to understand that proper care of the building and their contents, by Mr. Latour, should be given precedence over all other services at the teachers' residence.\n\nJ.D. CHENEY,\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nOttawa, Sept. 7, 1923.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nIt has been found advisable to clearly indicate the nature of the duties of Mr. Latour, Caretaker of the Indian Schools at Caughnawaga. It should be understood that the primary functions of this employee are the care and repairing of the buildings and mechanical plant. These duties of Mr. Latour have the first claim on his services and should be carried out under the direction of Mr. Indian Agent Letourneau.\n\nThe caretaker is being instructed to assist you and the Sisters whenever possible, but his most important work must not be neglected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMary Rose Alma,\nActing Principal,\nIndian Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nSir:\n\nI have to enclose, for your information, a copy of official communication to the Principal of the Caughnawaga Indian Schools. You should inform Mr. Latour that his first duties are the care and repairing of the buildings and mechanical plant, owned by the Department. He should be courteous and helpful to the Sisters at all times, but his important duties as caretaker must not be interfered with, by a continual running of errands and related services at the teachers' residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

FOR FILE:\n\nI have lately visited Caughnawaga and I am convinced of the advisability of providing, in Caughnawaga, an additional school building with proper playground facilities, at the earliest opportunity. The Boys' and Girls' Schools, the Junior and Continuation Classes are very crowded and a new building should be provided, with at least 6 classrooms. Playground facilities are much needed and must not be overlooked in our plans for development on this reserve.\nOttawa, Sept. 25, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Supervising Principal of the Caughnawaga Indian Schools has requested permission to expend a total of $50 in the purchase of sewing material for the Girls' School.\n\nUnder cover of the 22nd ultimo the Department allowed a grant of $35 in this connection, but, as this amount has been found to be inadequate, an increase of $15 has been made. When the Sister Superior presents to you the accounts in duplicate, covering this material, you should certify them, if found correct, and forward them to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nQue.\nOttawa, Sept. 25, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Superintendent of Indian Education reports that it is extremely advisable to make a small grant to pay the services of any driver, or messenger, whom the Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga Indian Schools finds it necessary to engage in the pursuit of her duties. Considerable driving and messenger services have been performed by Mr. Latour, when he should have been looking after the plant and equipment which belongs to the Department.\n\nThe Sister Superior is permitted to engage the services of a driver or messenger, when necessary, and secure receipts from him for the amounts paid. It would be well to engage the same man as much as possible and have him submit to the Sister Superior an itemized account every few weeks. These receipted accounts will be presented to you by the Sister Superior every three months and you may use them to support vouchers, in duplicate, in her favour, for an amount not exceeding $50 at the end of each quarter.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of this letter, which you may hand to the Sister Superior. She should understand that this privilege should not be abused and that this action has been taken for the express purpose of assisting her with her important duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The roof may be covered either with stained cedar shingles or three ply ready roofing. The floor should be 5\" thick, built of cement and covered with three coats of cement waterproofing, which is already stored at the teachers' residence.\n\nThe boxes underneath the seats are to be lined inside with galvanized iron, no. 24 gauge, and installed on wood rollers in order to facilitate their removing. There should be one box for each compartment. Provision to be made for the installing of a small floor drain, 3\" diameter, in each of the two rooms, with galvanized iron gratings. The floor to be graded in such manner as to have a slant towards these openings. It is desired that the urinal stalls be lined with either aluminum or lead sheeting, to a height of about three feet from the floor, which will have a semi-circular shape of the width shown on plan.\n\nThe drainage outlets at the end of the trough are to be connected together to a 4\" vitrified drain pipe, and continued into a small cess pool, which might be installed in the most suitable place in the rear of this building.\n\nVentilators 10\" square are to be placed on the roof above each of the two rooms.\nThe Department will rely on you to see that this work is performed in the most satisfactory and economical manner by day labour.\n\nIf you have any suggestions to make which would improve the above mentioned description, I shall be glad to have them before you proceed with the work.\n\nIt is desired that competitive prices be obtained in the purchasing of all materials required for this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. LeTourneau Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nOttawa, October 1st, 1923.\n\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo, regarding the portion of the main water pipe of the combined water works system of the girls' school, and mission building, Caughnawaga, which has been exposed to frost.\n\nIn reply, I regret to say that in view of the heavy expenditure which was made last year for the repairing of a portion of this system between the Mission building and the school, the Department is unable to partake in the expenses which will be incurred by the sinking of the intake pipe, which I understand is now in progress, under the supervision of the missionary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. LeTourneau Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indians Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find return of labour done on our water system. Last winter the pipe froze in February and consequently we had to carry water for three months. This fall we lowered the pipe near the water edge where it had frozen. We lowered it about two feet. According to our contract made Oct. 4, 1917 the Government pays the expenses of maintaining the system in working order. I would ask you to make the charges to my name so I have paid the men. With kind regards and many thanks,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nC. Lacombe\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6078, file 305-5, part 3A)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 9th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Rev. O. Lecouture, Parish Priest of Caughnawaga, together with certified pay list, by you, amounting to $150.30, for work performed lately, in the sinking of the intake pipe of the water supply system at the missionary building, Caughnawaga.\n\nIt is noted that this work was performed without authority from the Department, and the first intimation that we had about the necessity of sinking an intake pipe came through your office by a communication dated September 20th. Inspection of the work was made at noon September 27th, when it was noticed that the work was almost completed under the supervision of Moise Lefort.\n\nYou will readily understand that I cannot give this account any consideration, as it is not the custom for the Department to cover expenditure of this kind without the required authorization having been previously obtained. If as is stated in the missionary's letter, the Department is responsible for the cost of maintenance of this water works system, such work should then be performed under its supervision, and in this case there was plenty of time to bring the matter to the Department's attention before proceeding with any of the above mentioned work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.

How was I to know that you make this condition an essential one when it is not stipulated in the contract? I was new here and one of the first things that had to be done, I was told, was the sinking of the intake pipe because it had frozen the previous winter. On reading the contract I saw that the Department was responsible for the cost.\nof the maintenance of the water works system. I thought it the most natural thing in the world to have the work done and then ask you to pay the cost! I never thought that you preferred to send a man from Ottawa to supervise such simple work as the sinking of a pipe.\n\nHowever I see my mistake now. But I hope that you will not charge me $156.30 for the lesson! I am sure the work was well done and as cheaply as possible.\n\nIf you have time to bear the cost of that work just think how long it will take me to pay it with my salary of 27 cents a day!\n\nTrusting to your kindness Mr. F. MacKenzie, I hope that you will overlook this error of mine and accept that account.\n\nYours most obliged servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It would facilitate the supervision, and would help matters especially on cold and stormy days when the pupils have to stand knee-deep in the snow.\n\nI would like to make something similar to a vegetable cellar out of the little shed where we put away our storm windows, so would you allow me to ask the contractor for about four hundred feet of 1\" board. It will cost about fifteen dollars ($15.00) for material, and nothing for labor, Mr. Latour, our caretaker will do the work. We have no place to keep our vegetables and apples for the winter and it is a nuisance and a great deal of trouble to try to get a small quantity of provisions across on the yachts; the owner of the boats will not accept parcels from the dealers, so the consequence is we often lose goods.\n\nThe Girls of the First Class are very eager to learn French and, of course, I encourage them greatly, so please authorize me to purchase four dozen \"Pascalles' French Course\" also six sets of Maxson's self-keyed Fundamental Number Work for the lower classes. The price is sixty cents (.60) per set.\n\nThanking you in advance for the attention I know you will give my requests,\n\nBelieve me, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. F.A.

They are proud and ambitious and those that used the old typewriters did not have budgets that appeared well, therefore they were dissatisfied with their work.

The janitor has had much trouble on account of a frequent overflow of water. Monday morning, the school was so infected that I took it upon myself to send immediately for a plumber. He located the trouble and everything is in good condition now.\n\nThe outside toilets at the Boys' School are nearly completed. If the work had not been stopped and the plan changed the building would be finished.\n\nMr. Chene was expected here this week, I am quite anxious to meet him.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary Rose Alma\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. J.D.

You should also state to whom they were supplied and upon whose request the same were furnished. Payment cannot be made until details in the matter are furnished.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(P.H.

Close supervision should be kept by the staff of the school and very definite instructions given to the pupils regarding the throwing in of any articles or other material which would block the proper flushing of the toilets. If further trouble develops, the Department will have no recourse but to authorize the discontinuance of these inside toilets and the use only of the outside buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Receipts should also be forwarded in each case for the amount paid by the Sister Superior for the washing of the floors.\n\nI may say that the Auditor requires that all items of expenditure be supported by the necessary receipted accounts. Kindly have the Sister Superior obtain the necessary receipts, and you should attach them to the accounts and return them to the Department.\n\nRegarding the voucher for $26.59 for stationery for the use of the Indian schools, I have to request that you will inform the Sister Superior that she should requisition for supplies of this nature and they will be supplied from the Government Stationery Office. The Sister Superior should anticipate her requirements as regards text books, stationery, etc., and prepare a requisition on the form for that purpose and send it to the Department through your office. The account which you forwarded has been paid, but, in future, the Sister Superior should endeavour, insofar as possible, to comply with the Department's requirements and requisition for all stationery, text books, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

St. Ann's School and Delormier School were snowed in; the front door was out of sight, the drift being so high. Many children ploughed through the snow, so I thought it advisable to hire Mr. Bellisle to help our caretaker to shovel the snow around the Schools. On Feb. 21st., he worked all day. The wind blew all that night, so, of course, the same work had to be done the next day. Therefore during the stormy days, Mr. Bellisle worked eighteen hours at thirty-five cents (35cts.) an hour.\n\nHoping that you will approve of my doing so as to keep the Schools open.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary Rose Alma\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. L.

Sister Superior classified the items so as to make things clearer and probably more conformable to your requests. The missing vouchers had slipped out. The voucher for the kitchen utensils was sent to your Department, I believe. It is impossible to get a duplicate because those articles were purchased in the city.\n\nYou will notice that the disbursements for the messenger boy is on the same as that of the driver. No payments has been made yet for the messenger boy because Sister Superior was given to understand by an Official of your Department that it was preferable to send those accounts only every few months.\n\nI beg to state that Sister Superior thought advisable to fix a salary for the messenger boy, for the following reason: last October most reliable boys were working at the Golf Links making a few dollars a day, so it was impossible to get one to run errands for a trifling amount. So Sister Superior promised the boy $2.00 a week all year. It is more economical also because most of the provisions, meat especially is bought\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nin Lachine, and the boys walks across the bridge, it saves the expenses of a driver to bring the Sisters to the station.

Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that on the 11th ultimo I have visited each class of the Boys' and the Girls' School of the Caughnawaga Indian Village. The attendance was very good in spite of the cold weather and the bad roads. I am always surprised at the work accomplished in the schools here. The pupils are neat and have good behavior in general. Many of the more advanced pupils are very refined, it shows the refining influence of the Sisters who are doing excellent work in the Caughnawaga Indian Schools. I saw the semi-annual report of examinations, and Reverend Sister Superior has a right to be proud of the fine success obtained.\n\nThe walls in some of the classes in the Boys' School would need to be repaired.\n\nDelormier School would need to be attended to. There is water constantly in the cellar, therefore, making it a very unhealthy room both for the Teacher and the pupils. The room contained 35 pupils when I visited it, and there is no means of ventilating the room during class because the pupils are seated in the windows. The room is not at all hygienic. Better accommodations should be provided. The size of the room is about 17'x 22'x 7'6\".\n\nThe playground at the Boys' School would need to be filled, and the fence around should be repaired. The playground at the Girls' School would also need to be levelled. I would strongly recommend amusements, such\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nsuch as swings etc., to be placed on the playgrounds of both the Girls' and the Boys' Schools, with a number of trees to beautify the grounds. I would like to see something done this year and every year until the grounds are put into some decent kind of shape. I believe it a shame to leave the surroundings of the schools so bare and crude. In fact, I think that nothing has ever been done since the buildings were erected during the years of 1910 and 1911.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nAsst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nSir,\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the following conditions of the Caughnawaga Indian Day school buildings and surroundings that need to be attended to in a near future:\n\n**BOYS SCHOOL**\n\n1o - Playgrounds are in a bad condition, all holes, and always muddy; 3 or 4 carloads of cinders are necessary to fill in.\n\n2o - Fence must be repaired on one side, the other side is all broken, cannot be repaired, length of grounds 180 feet.\n\n3o - Water in cellar, damaged the cases of books; a few inches of cement and one coating of waterproof is recommended.\n\n4o - Acheck valve for the pump.\n\n5o - I would suggest that a sufficient space to put away the storm windows would be petitioned off in the cellar. The windows are piled one on top of the other without protection, consequently, many panes of glass need to be repaired in the Fall. About 300 sq. feet of 1\" board would be required.\n\n6o - Very little patching to be done on the walls (Re: Dept.File No. 5-2-5 dated April 7, 1924)\n\n7o - Blackboards need a coat of liquid slating. Two need to be replaced. 2 gall. of liquid required. Size ones required are 10 x 3 feet.\n\n8o - A few new curtains, several to be repaired.\n\n9o - 3 benches, about 7 feet long each, recommended for the youngest during the recess.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nGIRLS' SCHOOL.\n\n$70.00 1p - Grounds need to be filled in with about two carloads of cinders.\n\n$6.00 3o - The large gate is broken, fence in pretty good condition.\n\n$6.50 5o - Outside closets need a little repairing and screen approaches.\n\n$89.00 4o - Ceiling in the upper rooms to be plastered; a size of 30 x 15 feet. A few patches in walls.\n\n$5.00 5o - Blackboards need a coat of liquid slating. Two should be renewed, size: 10 x 5 feet each. 2 gall. of liquid required.\n\n$6.00 6o - New curtains, a few to be repaired.\n\n$7.00 7o - There are no closets to put the brooms and articles for cleaning, therefore I find a small closet behind the door of the wardrobes, down stairs, would be very necessary (7 ft. high x 4 ft. x 1 ft. deep), 100 feet of 1f board is required.\n\n$6.00 6o - 2 benches, about 10 feet long each, for the youngsters during the recess, on the playground.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6078, file 305-5, part 3A)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nDelorimier School.\n\nDimension of the class room: 21 x 16 x 7 1/3 feet; 42 pupils.\n\nThere has been about 7 inches of water in the cellar for several weeks. It is too bad that something cannot be done to better such unhealthy conditions.\n\nThe health of the teachers and pupils are being greatly injured by colds and rheumatism. If I judge from a few words Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga Schools said, I think the Reverend Mother of the Order will not allow a Sister to teach there next year.\n\nThe cottage almost opposite the Teacher's Residence is vacant and I believe it would just be suitable for two classes. The house and grounds could be rented for $125 per annum. The grounds are large enough to be used for school and as the land extends right opposite the Boys' School, a piece or section of land could be used for the girls of the Continuation School who have no playground. They spend their recess sitting on the steps, because naturally they are not going to mix in with the boys, so they are deprived of exercise, which is very necessary and most healthy.\n\nIt is hoped that the above mentioned suggestions will be favourably taken into consideration, and that you will be prepared to commence these alterations by the last week of the month of June next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Because of the extra work which the end of the school term entails, I would like to be authorized to make this outlay as soon as convenient.\n\nPermit me also to allude to your generous offer of a gold piece to the pupils of the Second Year Commercial on the occasion of your last visit. As there are four girls only I feel like soliciting a scholarship for one, because unlike the boys, they are handicapped in not being given the advantages of higher education. You are aware that these girls deserve prizes and rewards for their sustained effort and application in school work and I would like both parents and children to be pleased and satisfied at the Closing Exercises.\n\nWe have had an official visitation by the higher authorities of our Order and Reverend Mother Mary Leopoldine, Superior General, whom you met last year, has requested me to ask for an increase of salary for some of our teachers. I know you will think it reasonable because you acknowledge our unstinted labors and painstaking devotedness for our Indian charges, which same is attested by the different Government Inspectors and visitors in their glowing School Reports. Some of the religious teachers, who have crowded classrooms are certainly underpaid while Miss Martin and Miss Regis have a scanty number and receive larger salaries. And may I ask why could not the Sisters of the Girls' School draw the same salary as those in charge of like Standards in the Boys' School?\n\nAsking you to consider kindly my request while thanking you for your great interest in our welfare,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSr. Mary Cecilia\n\nMr. Russell Perrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. Cloud, the proprietor of the house in question and he offers to rent it for $150 per year with land about 65' X 125' in superficies.\n\nThe changes which would be necessary would amount probably to $500, so that I do not believe it would be to any advantage, for the present, to make this change. However, it will be necessary to have some repairs and changes made to the building on the Delormier property to make it hygienic and acceptable during the next school year.\n\nThis matter will be left in abeyance until Mr. Chene comes to Caughnawaga to see Mr. Cloud again, who lives near the boys' school, and decides definitely which of the two houses shall be used as a school and also what repairs will have to be done to one or other of these buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) Lorenzo Letourneau.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nSir,\n\nPour faire suite \u00e0 ma lettre du 3 courant, au sujet de la b\u00e2tisse pour \"Continuation School\" \u00e0 Caughnawaga, il m'avait sembl\u00e9 que vous deviez venir \u00e0 Caughnawaga dans la semaine commen\u00e7ant le 11 courant, tel qu'inform\u00e9 par la Soeur Sup\u00e9rieure des \u00e9coles.\n\nComme il semble aussi d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'enseignement se continuera dans la b\u00e2tisse de la Succession Delormier, il faudra n\u00e9cessairement y faire un peu de modifications pour rendre cette maison acceptable pour la sant\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves ainsi que de l'institutrice. Je serais bien aise de vous rencontrer au plus t\u00f4t \u00e0 Caughnawaga afin de d\u00e9cider quant \u00e0 l'un ou l'autre des sites \u00e0 occuper comme \u00e9cole durant l'ann\u00e9e scolaire prochaine.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des sauvages,\n\nM.

Delormier in connection with the leasing of the property in which he has a joint share with Mrs. Annie K. Delormier. On March 27th, last, Mrs. Delormier was given notice of the Department's intention to lease the property for one year, commencing June first, 1924. She has been paid rental to December 31st, next. Mr. Indian Agent Letourneau, at our request, has written her for a release from paying any further rental. We gave up our use of the property on June 30, last.\n\nIn view of the difficulties in connection with this estate and the unsatisfactory sanitary conditions of the Delormier house (which causes the Department to look for another building for the two classes), I wish to recommend that Mr. Chene make arrangements with Mr. C. W. Cloud, owner of a building opposite the teacher's residence, for one year's rental. He has signified willingness to rent for $150 per annum.\n\nMr. Letourneau estimates the alterations and decorating to the Cloud property at $500, but I believe that the work can be done for less. I also recommend that Mr. Chene receive your authority to undertake the alterations and decorating that are necessary for our purposes.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, August 19, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the plans for accommodating the continuation school and one junior class at the Caughnawaga R.

Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P. Q.\nDear Sir:\n\nIt gives me pleasure to tell you that our schools opened with a large number of pupils. About four hundred (400) have registered. All are in the best of humor and are doing wonderfully well for the time. The children are taken up with their new LaSalle Reader; it is not surprising, it is so clear and well illustrated. They are showing the greatest interest in their work and the attendance is remarkable. What a difference with the spirit of last year!\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the report given in this morning by Mr. Jocks.\n\nOur four graduates are most happy in their new convent home. The higher education given to our boys and girls is a great incentive, and many are desirous of obtaining a college or convent education. I think this is the beginning of a new era in Caughnawaga.\n\nWould you be good enough to let me know if the Department would allow about fifteen dollars more for sewing material for the girls, making it sixty-five dollars ($65.00). Over one hundred girls are taught sewing, and needles, thimbles, scissors are easily lost or destroyed. The girls have no idea of economy, so our sewing classes are beginning by a course of mending, especially stockings; then they will receive lessons in plain sewing which I think is most practical. If my plans are not disturbed we shall have an exhibition of needlework at the end of the scholastic year.\n\nI would furthermore ask if the same amount ($35.00) will be granted this year for the washing of the towels for the schools.\n\nThe repairs of the new school are almost finished and we owe you many thanks for your co-operation in obtaining a more sanitary school.\n\nAssuring you of our appreciation for the interest you take in our Indian charges, I beg to remain, dear Sir,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSr. Mary Ross, A.C.S.\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

I intend to dig a well to have good clear water. It costs $4.00 a foot. I suppose that we would get excellent water at between 50 and 70 feet. If you will pay $300.00, I guarantee the rest of the cost, putting in of the pipes etc. The water is very bad for two or three months in the spring and after heavy rains. Besides, the ground that we put on our intake pipe is washed away every spring; even though we lowered it last year I am afraid it will freeze this year. I am sorry I made that expense, I do not intend to put any more money on that pipe. I hate to ask you to spend some more money, when you just bought us a new engine, but then, it would be too bad if we had to haul water 2 or 3 months next winter and pay for that.\n\nO.

Religious, nevertheless each teacher shall take charge of the sweeping of her classroom, wardrobe and corridor, if she can have what is necessary. Economy is our motto, and you yourself have often had proofs of how much we economize. Assuredly the Department is not aware that the requisition sent in July called for articles needed for twelve classrooms with each a large wardrobe, corridors, stairs, stoops, cement walks besides the Teachers' Residence and the St. Paul's Road School, or they would not have cancelled so many items. We had to get as far as possible to have the schools washed because no mopcloths were allowed and old pieces of cotton cloths had to be used, that with hard water is a bad combination, so poor work was the result.\n\nPlease beg the Department to allow us to buy the articles that were not granted on the letter of July 22nd, namely:\n\n- 3 Sweeping Brushes 18 in. (hair) long handle\n- 1 Wall Brush long handle\n- 2 Stop boards or sinks at Schools\n- 1 Long-handled Mop\n- 4 Brooms (corn)\n- 3 Dust Pans\n- 4 Banister Brushes (hair)\n- 10 Dry Dusters or 20 yds cheap Flannelette for dusting\n- 5 Radiator Brushes\n\nThanking you most sincerely for your co-operation in our Indian charges, I remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. L.

After consideration given to the matter, it has brought on some changes which, I know, you will approve.\n\n1st -- To make use of the desks already in the Girls' School, Fourth Year can wait later for new single desks.\n\n2nd -- The Continuation Class will have over forty pupils next year, fourteen will be in the Second Year and about twenty-seven shall be promoted to First Year. Therefore another room will be required in the new school, that will be five classes instead of four.\n\nI am inclosing a copy of a rough sketch of the three schools I made for myself, thinking it may be of some use to you.\n\nPursuant to our conversation regarding a piece of land adjacent to our lot which you found suitable for our recreation grounds, I have written Mr. Letourneau who is to discuss the cost with Mr. Morris, the proprietor.\n\nThanking you most gratefully for the encouragement you gave us during your short visit, I beg to remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours cordially,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOctober 19, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nI wish to report on my recent visit to the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School. I made a special study of the question of accommodation that is needed for this activity. At present, classes are conducted in four buildings: 1. the Girls' School; 2. the Boys' School; 3. the former Protestant School; 4. the building we are renting. As we hope to release the third mentioned building for a Protestant Day School next year and as the rented building is wholly unsuitable, I gave first attention to the best use of the accommodation in the two brick buildings, the Boys' and the Girls' Schools. Four classes can be accommodated in the Girls' building if the roof is raised. The rooms on the second floor of the Boys' School are not suitable for classroom purposes and can be used for typewriting and domestic science. The classrooms on the first floor are quite suitable. The two old buildings, therefore, look after six classes, but ten classrooms are required, as follows:\n\n| Grade       | Classrooms |\n|-------------|------------|\n| First Grade | 2          |\n| Second Grade| 2          |\n| Third Grade | 2          |\n| Fourth Grade| 1          |\n| Fifth Grade | 1          |\n| Sixth Grade | 1          |\n| Continuation| 1          |\n\nThis means, of course, coeducation practically throughout the whole school. It is true that there are two classrooms for each of the three first grades; but my suggestion to the Sister Superior was that they have boys and girls in each and divide the reserve so that the little children would be studying in the closest buildings.\n\nThe Sister Superior has lately written that she believes a still further classroom is necessary, due to the large increase expected in the continuation group for the academic year 1927-28. I have answered her letter, pointing out that it might be possible to organize the work so that the extra room would not be needed.\n\nIn addition to the ten classrooms, a domestic science room and a typewriting room, the school should have an auditorium. As four classrooms and an auditorium are required in the new building, this suggested to Mr. Chene a two storey building with four classrooms on one floor and an auditorium on the other. A small room might be set off as an office. When it is known exactly what accommodation is really necessary, I shall prepare another memorandum. The September enrolment and average attendance of 322 and 311, respectively, indicates that ten classrooms is the minimum accommodation required.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6078, file 305-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to grants for sewing materials and the washing of towels at the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School. The usual allowance of $65 and $35, respectively, for these purposes is granted for the current academic year.\n\nI have also your letter of the 11th instant, concerning the proposed new school building. I am pleased to note that the fourth year class can make use of the desks at present in the girls' school. Concerning the extra room for the continuation class, I am of the opinion that the typewriting room and one classroom, as originally contemplated, would be sufficient accommodation if the work could be organized so that the typewriting room would be in use at all times. To add a classroom to the new building would mean such added cost that it might be necessary to eliminate certain equipment which would be very desirable. I should be grateful if you would reconsider this question with a view to making the two rooms in the boys' school (one upstairs and one down) serve the purposes of the continuation group. I note that you have a small music room on your rough sketch. To what use would you put such a room?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

As I told you, it will be necessary to have a meeting hall for the pupils in the basement when bad weather will not permit them to go out, also a hall or perhaps the same one could be used by those bringing their lunch; there are about 25 of them.\n\nA toilet room for the ladies and several other rooms for the pupils: boys and girls.\n\nMr. Ferrier was stating that one stall for each pupil would be sufficient. This is impossible, as they are out only 10 minutes; so that for all classes it is necessary to have 4 stalls each otherwise they would have to be out one hour.\n\nAn office for myself, downstairs, near the main entrance, for parents to come and discuss their particular cases, is very much needed.\n\nAt present, I am located in a passage where all the children have to go through, and this is neither convenient nor agreeable.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Oct. 26 | To repairs of writing machines for the use of the Caughnawaga Indian Day schools, as per attached account: | $3.05 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nEXAMINED and found correct.\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Rumors to that effect have circulated in the village and most of the people are rejoicing.\n\nOwing to the change of site of the new building, our plans and suggestions for same cannot be carried out. Necessarily you need a clear conception of the requirements of the school before the sketch is made, so will you please allow me to submit an outline for your approbation. It is understood that it will be co-education throughout the schools.\n\n1st. The Boys' School can accommodate the children of the First, Second and Third Grades, who live at the east end of the village. The extra classroom can be used for a lunch-room and a recreation room for the children on stormy days.\n\n2nd. The Girls' School, if the roof is raised, can be used exclusively for the Continuation School --- Standard 7th & 8th - another class preparatory to the Quebec Academic Diploma -- a typewriting room - and a domestic-science room.\n\n3rd. Six classrooms would be required in the new building for First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Grades -- besides the other rooms already mentioned on your first memorandum.\n\n4th. I would suggest that the lease for the rented house across the road, which ends in August, be discontinued. Even though the new school building would not be finished for September we could organize matters to save expense of renting a house for a short period of time.\n\nWith deepest thanks for your great interest and cooperation in our Indian charges, I am, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSister Mary Rose Almo\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This lease will expire on August 29th, 1927. I enclose herewith a notice to the above effect addressed to James Cross, and I shall be pleased if you will hand same to him.\n\nYou will be good enough, after the end of the present school year, to see that all Government property in this building is removed and stored until required.\n\nYou should arrange, in August, next, to forward a voucher for the amount of the rent due James Cross to the date of the termination of the lease. I may say for your information that rent has been paid in full to February 28th, 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL.

This work was to be performed at an approximate cost of $135.00 has not yet been done.\n\nIn case that the proposed construction of a second story would be carried out by the Department, it would therefore be advisable to have the closing exercises of the schools for the coming summer holidays to take place on or about the 17th of June. These exercises would then take place in a rather private way. The only distribution of prizes that would be required for the graduates would approximately cost $20.00, instead of a sum of $105.00 as the previous year, making a total saving of $85.00.\n\nFurthermore, I am informed that a few of the Reverend Sisters presently teaching at the various schools of Caughnawaga are just preparing their examination for a Higher Grade, which is to take place on the 18th and the 20th of June next.\n\nFor these reasons, I beg to recommend that the closing exercises will take place on the 17th of June.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Superintendent of Education\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

After a full day's search trying to get each graduate a prize, I found that the meagre amount I asked for (\u00a320.0s) was not sufficient. I should be very grateful if you allowed me as much more as possible.\n\nThe news of no prizes given except to the pupils of the Continuation School has caused a little commotion; as with that small additional amount, I could purchase prizes for the pupil of each class who has obtained the highest marks during the scholastic year.\n\nHoping you will find my request reasonable, I am, my dear Sir,\n\nYours very cordially,\n\nSister Mary Rose Anna,\nPrincipal.\n\nMrs. J.D.

Muir Electric Co.,\nMontreal, Que.\nMEMORANDUM: Mr. Scott,\n\nTenders were receivable at noon of the 20th instant, for the construction of the new Central School at Caughnawaga, and the following tenders, made on the regular forms in accordance with the requirements of the advertisement, were submitted. The tenders contained two separate prices, one for the complete erection of the proposed building, and the second one provided for the finishing of the ground floor only, where the class rooms are located, the basement and the first floor to be completed on the outside only, as described in detail in the specification.\n\n| Name of Contractor | Price for Complete building | Alternative Price |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|\n| Bremner Norris & Co., Montreal | $56,594.00 | $50,349.00 |\n| Durand & Durand, Montreal | $56,500.00 | $43,700.00 |\n| Newton Construction Co., Sherbrooke | $52,300.00 | $46,799.00 |\n| LaFlamme & LaFlamme, Shawinigan Falls | $48,600.00 | $43,500.00 |\n| A. LaCroix, St. Lambert | $48,555.00 | $42,635.00 |\n| MacKenzie & Genest, Hull | $44,847.00 | No alternative price |\n\nThe cost of the building was estimated to amount to $42,000.00. Should funds not be available to award a contract to the lowest tenderer, I would suggest that the contractors be requested to submit a new tender for the construction and completion of the first two stories only, with a temporary flat roof. The third story which provides for an assembly hall only could be erected next year or later, and the material forming the temporary roof could be used again in the construction of the permanent gable roof. If you approve of this suggestion special forms of tender could be sent for the purpose and revised prices obtained in the course of six to ten days. This arrangement will, in my opinion, bring the expenditure close to the amount appropriated for this building.\n\nI may add that it should be taken into consideration that the water and sewerage system will be installed this year. The source of supply for the water system will be from an artesian well, and will probably cost in the neighborhood of $400.00, whereas the sewerage system will be quite expensive. It will consist of a vitrified sewer pipe line extending from the building to the St. Lawrence river and the system...\nwill be costly on account of the nature of the ground, which is solid rock. This work can be performed later in the season either by day labour, employing Indians or by contract.\n\nAs already mentioned a building of smaller dimensions than that under consideration will not meet the requirements of the increased attendance at the schools on this reserve.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMR.

Attached to the said voucher were two accounts made out respectively for $44.25 and $45.90. The first was paid as rendered. It contained a charge of $1.50 under date the 5th April. This charge was repeated in the second account, and therefore it was disallowed. There was a mistake also under date the 22nd May in the second account. The said item according to the receipt submitted should have been 80\u00a2 not $1.30. Kindly explain the matter to the Revd. Sister, and in future endeavour to see that accounts are correct before you submit them for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt Constant,\nP.Q.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 12th instant relative to voucher 1144 dated 23rd ultimo and to say that after having carefully reexamined the account submitted by the Rev. Sister Superior I am under the impression that the amount of $125.15 as previously submitted was correct.\n\nI beg to explain that the first account of $44.25 contained an item under date of April 5th, viz \"Trip to St-Isidore Road School - $1.50\". This charge was made for the driver, whom had been paid that sum of $1.50. While into the second account, at the same date of April 5th, a charge of a similar amount was made by the Rev. Sister Superior as \"Visitation St-Isidore Road School\", which amount is her own usual fee granted by the Department in this connection.\n\nThe same thing happen under date of the 22nd May in the second account. The railway express charge shows .80\u00a2, while the account submitted is $1.30 because this difference of .50\u00a2 was to pay the transportation of this article from the railway station to the teachers' residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, July 25th 1927\n\n[Signature]\n\nWill you please advise me if the names of firms from which pieces should be obtained in the furnishing of school uniforms for the ensuing year have been received.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Chief\n\nWe have no list\n\n[Signature]\nJuly 30, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nWill you please advise me of the price which you would charge to undertake the following repairs to the Boys' and Girls' Schools in Caughnawaga, the amount for each item to be given separately.\n\nBoys' School.\n1.

Fortin\nMontreal, Aug 1st 1937\n\nSir,\n\nThe tender I sent you was for $4.50 per foot when my men are boarded and $4.50 when not boarded, for a 6 in. well. It is Miss Dumont who sent for me. The well cost me more than $2.50 per foot to drill, without counting the charge for my machine which has cost me $750.00. I drilled 158 ft. in the rock, it took me 10 days and 12 nights. Did my best, it was interfering with the digging of the cellar.\n\nI came from Rock of Michigan to drill this well and I have to return there. This makes 125 miles return.\n\n(Signed) O. Fortin\n\nMontreal, Aug 1st 1937\n\nYour superintendent did not make me start at the right place. I started to drill and Mr. MacKenzie told me it was not the right place, they had me change place and I had to move away just the same as if the well was completed. I will not send any account at present, I shall wait for your answer. He broke several pieces of my machine while drilling.\n\n(Signed) O. Fortin\nThe work at the new Central School is now progressing rapidly and in view of the depth of the boiler room in the basement the drainage system will have to be given immediate attention. Owing to the nature of the ground, which is solid rock, and the lack of ditches in the neighborhood of the school lot, it will be necessary to construct a sewer line from the building as far as the St. Lawrence River, a distance of about 575 feet. The proposed sewerage system would consist in the laying of six inch vitrified drain pipe with an outlet in a cess pool, built of dry masonry, close to the embankment on the shore of the St. Lawrence River, similar to that already in operation for the hospital and the girls' school. As the excavation will be mostly done in solid rock, the cost of the work will amount to about $3,500.00. I beg, therefore, to recommend that authorization be given to obtain prices from the contractors in order that the completion of the basement will not be delayed owing to the lack of proper drainage.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A shingle of a uniform colour will not produce the desired effect. I shall, however, in future be glad to specify the materials as fabricated by the Asbestos Manufacturing Co., Ltd., as often and whenever possible.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nAugust 25, 1927.\n\nSirs,\n\nReferring to my letter of July 30th advising me of the price to be charged by your firm to carry out a number of repairs to the Boys' and Girls' School at Caughnawaga, I beg to say that you may proceed at once with the following work at the prices mentioned herein.\n\nBoys' School.\n\n1.

Limited,\n\n[Signature]\nrepresentative.\n\nMR/AEG.\nEnc.\ncc-Mr.Supr.\nTOR.\nRe: Convent of Sisters of St. Ann, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUpon the request of the Mother Superior, I called at this institution today and investigated the possibilities of installing a Dry Room in the laundry.\n\nYou undoubtedly know that this laundry is very small and that it has a very low ceiling which are not helping the location of a Dry Room.\n\nAfter measuring, I would recommend that a Four Draw Metal Dry Room be installed and which would take, with the drawers pulled out a floor space of approximately 10' long or, with the drawers closed up 5' long. This, steam heated, would give the Sisters very good results and, as they have no steam, it would also require a small boiler to supply the heat to this dry room which steam boiler I would recommend to be placed near the furnace.\n\nWe beg to quote you f.o.b. our factory, Toronto, Ont., exclusive of Government Sales Tax, 2% for cash thirty days or net sixty days from date of invoice on:\n\nOne-No.1504, 4 Draw \"Scientific\" Clothes Dryer..................$365.00\n\nOne-5 H.P. Full Length Tubular Vertical Boiler, Working Pressure 125 lbs., supplied with Boiler are Grate Bars and Bearers, Smoke Hood, (No Stack), Safety Valve, Steam Gauge, Syphon and Water Gauge, Try Cock, Blow Off Cock, Feed and Check Valves and Tube Scraper.................................$355.00 Extra for Injector for above Boiler...........................................36.00\n\nIn may perhaps prove difficult to place a Vertical Boiler in this Basement, and you may have to resort to an Horizontal type Boiler which would mean more expense and brick work, therefore, our advocating the vertical type boiler even if a small cut has to be made in the floor to set the boiler lower.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nAs per your orders I sent for Mr. Relacom of the Canadian Laundry Co. concerning a Dry Room, in the cellar of the Residence. He found he was against a hard proposition. Nevertheless he studied the question from all points of view and came to the conclusion that a Four Drawer Metal Dry Room could be installed. Under the best conditions, I consider that $750.00 is a very costly investment for such an installment, without being assured of satisfaction.\n\nYour suggestion of having the washing done at a laundry would be much more economical. I have looked into the matter and we can have our washing done in our Lachine Laundry for twenty dollars ($20.00) a month, including transportation on the Lachine side.\n\nHoping this will meet with your approval, I am, dear Sir,\n\nyours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 31st, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th instant, I beg to say that, at the present time, the Department is not prepared to consider an expenditure of $750 in installing a dry room in the cellar of the teachers' residence at Caughnawaga.\n\nYour suggestion of having the washing done at a cost of $20 a month is approved and Mr. Agent Letourneau is being so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSr. Mary Rose Alma,\nPrincipal,\nR.C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa, August 31st, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nOn instructions from the Department, Sister Mary Rose Alma, Principal of the Caughnawaga R.C. School, had a representative of the Canadian Laundry Co. visit the school in connection with installing a dry room in the cellar of the teachers' residence. The price quoted by this company, namely, $750., is considered too high and the Department is not prepared to authorize this expenditure at the present time.\n\nThe Reverend Principal suggests that she be permitted to have the laundry done at Lachine at a cost of $20 a month, including transportation on the Lachine side. She is being informed that this arrangement is approved and you should regularly submit the usual vouchers for this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Have you thought of how you will provide for hot water in this new construction?\n\nWe are manufacturers of one of the greatest novelties on the Canadian Market. It consists in a hot water tank or reservoir heated by electricity, which has for object to actually replace the gas heater and other methods used for providing hot water for domestic and other purposes. A reason why our Electric Thermos Tank is interesting to any person desiring \"home comfort\", is that once the water in the tank has been heated, it keeps hot for 50 HOURS, at a temperature above that required for baths, and this without any additional cost of electricity.\n\nThis will seem rather inconceivable to you; as you know this is one of the greatest domestic necessities, which has not been and cannot be obtained up to this date, with the existant known facilities but which is incorporated in our new system of heating water which we are offering to builders.\n\nWe wish to call your attention to the fact that the only place you can obtain our \"system\", is here at our plant, as it is our intention to eliminate all intermediaries, so that our clients will benefit therefrom.\n\nShould you be interested, as we feel sure, to have us install one of our Electric Thermos Tanks, we would advise you to give your order fifteen days in advance, in order that you may be assured of the prompt delivery, and thus avoid delays. We may say, that we have been upon the market, for only a short time, and that orders are coming in rapidly. It is therefore urgent that you should place your order immediately.\n\nOur prices vary from $35.00 up.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nTHERMO TANK ELECTRIC SYSTEM LTD.\n\nPer Holland J.

A shingle of a uniform colour will not produce the desired effect.

Referring to article I of your letter re-turning the posts, due to the fact that the price quoted for the posts is very low, we can hardly do same for $128.50 including turning.

The shingles to be nailed to the wooden roof with copper storm and galvanized iron nails, two pounds per square at the minimum. The weight per hundred shingles shall be not less than 320 lbs.\"\n\nThe choice of the roofing for this School was left as usual to the discretion of the officer who had charge of the preparation of the plans and specifications. To improve the appearance of the building he considered it advisable to choose a type of asbestos shingle of various colours with a rough edge to imitate slate roofing. Shingles of uniform colour would not give the same results as the Colour-Blend.\n\nWith regard to size\u2014There should be no objection to permitting the use of 8\" x 16\" x \u00bc\" asbestos shingle, instead of the 9\" x 18\" x \u00bc\" which are the dimensions specified for the roofing of the Caughnawaga Central School, providing that the type, texture and appearance of the asbestos shingles as offered by the Asbestos Manufacturing Company Limited are identical with those specified, that is, of different shades and with rough edges to imitate ordinary slate shingles, in order to give this roof the desired appearance as originally planned by the Department.\n\nI cannot, however, recommend any change in the type of asbestos shingle for the roof of the Caughnawaga Central School, owing to its shape and construction.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General\nOttawa, September 9, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Cardin,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 30th ultimo, I beg to say that there will be no objection to permitting the use of 8\" x 16\" x \u00bc\" asbestos shingles, instead of the 9\" x 18\" x \u00bc\", which are the dimensions specified for the roofing of the Caughnawaga Central School, providing that the type, texture and appearance of the asbestos shingles are identical with those specified.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(W.J.F.Pratt)\nPrivate Secretary\n\nHonourable P.J.A.Cardin,\nMinister of Marine and Fisheries,\nOTTAWA.\n(\u2014 Referred\nto Registrar,\nletter of Sept 2/27\nfrom Posti from\nC.S.

This means of conveyance of course is much better than that of by rail as Adirondack Junction is the closest railway point to Caughnawaga and this is only on the C.P.R. The above brick quoted are all manufactured at Laprairie which is only on the C.N.R. and if shipped by rail it would be necessary to ship C.N. & C.P. which would make a very high freight rate.\n\nWe have sent you by express prepaid samples of brick above quoted.\n\nTrusting you will find these satisfactory and that you will see your way clear to using our product, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNATIONAL BRICK COMPANY OF LAPRAIRIE LIMITED\n\nJ.P.

When I last visited the work I found it advisable to authorize the placing of six 3/4\" steel rods in each of the concrete columns at an extra cost of $50.00. I beg to ask your approval of this additional expenditure.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nMr. J. D. Macne,\nChief Engineer, Dept.

I was over to see the contractors today and they informed me that they understood that several submissions had been obtained for this equipment.\n\nWe wish to inform you that up to the time of writing we have not received the official form to make our submission on and we might mention that the Myers Pumps, which we handle, are the best quality of the different makes now on the market.\n\nWe would therefore appreciate the opportunity of tendering on this equipment and trust that you will be good enough to mail us an official form, which we will fill out and submit to you without delay.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHEATING & PLUMBING SPECIALTIES REG'D\n\nMJMcC/F.\nSept. 16, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nAs requested by a communication from your office to the Departmental Engineer, I am sending you herewith a form of quotation for the furnishing and installing of an automatic pneumatic water supply system for the new Central School at Caughnawaga.

The motor is housed in a protected well ventilated frame; double pole automatic control switch; air compressor attachment driven from the cross head of the pump; base acts as an oil reservoir so that all working parts are oiled automatically when the pump is in operation; fresh water feature supplied and the pump is capable of giving you the minimum capacity of 60 gallons per hour. The motor is vertical, ball bearing, coupled flexibly to the worm shaft. The worm runs in roller bearings, the lower bearings taking the entire thrust, no thrust being taken by the bearings of the motor.

I did not provide for these fixtures in the plumbing specification for the reason that the Superior wanted to make a choice of the type which would be most suitable for this building. I had an interview yesterday with the Superior and it was considered that a white porcelain fixture with automatic fan spreader would be satisfactory. This could be purchased from any local plumbing dealer in Montreal at a cost of $100.00 each. The plan provides for the installation of two of these urinals, but the Superior would like to have four. I do not believe that the Department would be justified in granting this additional expenditure, and I would therefore recommend that the order for two urinals be placed with the firm of Crane Limited, who are supplying the contractors with all the other plumbing fixtures. Piping for the installation of additional urinals might be put in now, before the cement floor of the Building is completed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nCaughnawaga Agency.\n\nIndian Agent's Office at\nSt-Constant, Que.,\nSeptember 28th, 1927\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of\nthe 23rd instant, informing that as the result of the\ncompetition held by the Civil Service Commission,\nMr. J.

This course is considered necessary on account of the difficulty in securing the services of a building Inspector, and the present stage of the work does not require any technical knowledge of the contractors' work.\n\nThe nature of your duties will be described to you by the Departmental Engineer, when he next visits the site of the work. They will consist mainly in ascertaining that the different parts of the building are being erected in accordance with the plans and specifications and advising the Department as to the progress of the work when required.

It was thought at that time that with inspections at intervals, the work might be properly looked after and the necessity of advertising the position obviated. Experience, however, proved that Mr. Guerin was not altogether competent and as a result it was decided to ask the Civil Service Commission to make an appointment. They advertised the position and as a result a Mr. Bersailou of Laprairie was appointed. He has advised the Agent that he is unable to accept the appointment. The work is well advanced. The roof will be on the building by the end of this week and I think, in view of the fact that the qualifications of the other applicants were very doubtful, it would be better to arrange to have Mr. Chene make weekly inspections from this time out. Mr. Letourneau is quite willing to visit the work and report progress. This, with a thorough inspection by Mr. Chene, should be quite satisfactory in view of the progress that has been made up to date as indicated above.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMorse Guerin, Esq.,\nR. R. No 1,\nLaprairie,\nP. Q.\nLast July I was advised by Miss Dumont of the Gaughnawaga Hospital that a well boring apparatus was available on the reserve and that an artesian well had just been completed at the hospital at a price of $2.00 per foot for the first hundred feet and $4.00 per foot for the remaining depth plus an allowance of fifty cents per foot for the board of the men. With your approval on June 18th instructions were given to Mr. O. Fortin, the well contractor, by the Inspector of Works to proceed with the boring of the well at the new Central School at Gaughnawaga, on the same terms as those paid to him at the Hospital. The contractor went ahead with the work and submitted an account for a well 150 feet deep, at $4.50 per foot, explaining that the amount paid by Miss Dumont at the rate mentioned above was for the enlarging or reboaring of an old well, and the deepening of it, and that the current price charged by him for the boring of a six inch artesian well in rock was $4.00 per foot for the entire depth plus an allowance of fifty cents per foot for the boarding of his men. Up to date I have refused to certify to his account, which amounts to $711.00 for the reason that the contractor proceeded with the work without the Department's authority as to the change in the terms of payment, namely from $2.00 to $4.00, and he was advised accordingly by letter of the 13th of August last.\n\nThe Department was requested on 15th of Sept. by the law firm of Perron, Taschereau, Vallee, Genest & Perron, of Montreal to reconsider the payment of this account, and I have ascertained that the price asked for by Mr. Fortin is regular and that he would be entitled to the $4.50 per lineal foot for the entire depth of the well, this being the price paid throughout the locality for this kind of work.\n\nBefore going any further with the matter, I would like to know whether his account may be given consideration or if negotiations should be entered into with his lawyers, as mentioned in the accompanying letter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nMEMORANDUM TO: Dr. Scott.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6078, file 305-5, part 4)\nSir,\n\nOct. 5, 1927.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 15th ultimo concerning the payment of an account due by this Department to Mr. O. Fortin, 1876 Rosemont Blvd., Montreal, for the boring of an artesian well at the Central School at Gagn\u00e9smaga, Quebec, I beg to say that this contractor was authorised by Mr. Gu\u00e9rin of St. Constant, who was the Inspector on the above mentioned school, that the Department would consent to entrust him with the boring of this well at the price specified, namely, $2.00 per foot for the first hundred feet, and $4.00 per foot for the remaining depth until water was reached plus an allowance of 50 cents per foot for the board of the men. The Department did not give Mr. Fortin any other instructions than those above mentioned, and I am advised that he proceeded with the work without considering whether we would agree to authorize the work at the price now claimed by him. I may add for your information that the above mentioned facts have been confirmed by the Inspector of Works in a communication just received from the Indian Agent, Mr. Letourneau, copy of which is enclosed herewith.\n\nMr. Fortin was requested on August 15th to submit revised accounts in accordance with the prices agreed upon when the work was authorized, in order that payment might be given immediate consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The errors were corrected, and a cheque covering the amount due went forward, and the matter was explained to the Accountant of the firm by letter of the 27th September.\n\nVoucher No 1194 mentioned by you was paid at $100.25, which was the correct amount. There was an error in the charge of $4.71 made by F.W. Woolworth. The charge should have been $1.55, a difference of $3.16.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget,\nChief Accountant.\n\nL.

MacKenzie & Genest, for the above mentioned work, at a cost of $4,497.00. The reason for the difference in the tendered price and my estimate is due to the fact that it was subsequently found advisable that the outlet of the sewer line be extended 45 feet into the St. Lawrence river, and placed to a depth of six feet underneath the lowest water level. It was also found upon the boring of testing wells that the excavation would have to be made in solid rock throughout.\n\nAs weather conditions are becoming unfavourable for this kind of work, I would recommend that the contractors be requested to undertake it at their tendered price. The Schools Branch have already stated that there are funds available to cover this expenditure.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nNovember 9, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart.\n\nIt is necessary to construct a sewerage system from the new Central School on the Caughnawaga Reserve to the St. Lawrence River. A tender on this work was received from Messrs. MacKenzie & Genest who are the contractors for the building. The amount of their tender is $4,497.00. The drain will be about 620 feet in length and the excavation will have to be made in solid rock throughout. As the season is advancing and the weather becoming unfavourable for this kind of work, I would recommend that the contractors be requested to undertake it. Funds are available to cover this expenditure.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nNovember 9, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nIt is necessary to construct a sewerage system from the new Central School on the Caughnawaga Reserve to the St. Lawrence River.

I have been told by one of the contractors that they will attend with the least possible delay, after its completion, to the inspection from the Quebec Bureau of Electrical Inspectors for the wiring on the above mentioned building.\n\nAs to the accounts from Crane Ltd., I beg to say that the articles have not yet been brought on the school site. When delivered, if the goods are in good order I will certified these accounts, as instructed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKenzie and Genest, contractors, at the boys' and girls' school at Caughnawaga. I understand by the letter of instructions authorizing the above mentioned work that it was to be proceeded with immediately and completed a month ago. I would ask you to arrange in order that the itemized accounts, giving separate prices for each work, will be forwarded with the least possible delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nI beg to inform you that when I last visited the boys' school at Caughnawaga, I noticed that some of the partitions were sinking, and upon investigation I found this to be due to a number of joists having been cut and left without any support. This was done at the time that the caustine chemical closet was installed in the basement of this school for the use of the teachers.\n\nTo remedy this condition I would suggest the erection of a number of additional joists supported on a steel beam on cast iron posts. This would cost about $90.00. I beg to ask your approval of this expenditure, and I may say that the work could be done by the contractors for the new Central School, who are in a position to attend to this kind of work.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Nov. 13 | For disbursements made for the washing of storm windows at the teacher's residence, Girls' School, Boys' School, 155 windows at an average of .16\u00bd\u00a2 each | $35.70 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent:\n\nForm 52.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Letourneau Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nSir,\n\nI have received a letter from the Department about the school and Teachers' residence being entered by persons unknown.\n\nI wish to state that one night about a month ago (while the electricians were still working at the Girls School) I was notified by an Indian that there was a light at the School; this was about two o'clock in the morning so I went immediately to the Girls School and I saw the lights in the Second class. I tried all the doors to see where I could get in to investigate as I did not have time to go to the Teachers to get the key owing to the lateness of the night. I tried the cellar door, all the doors on the ground floor were locked. I went up the fire escape and tried the door there and found the door also locked. I came down the fire escape and I tried the windows on the class that connect with the fire escape there. I found the window unlocked. I went in and looked all over down to the basement and upstairs, there was nothing suspicious or anything out of the way. Only thing I found that I could not turn the switch off to the Second Class lights? I had to take the main switch off before I was able to put the lights off. I blame the switch was the cause of lights being turned on. I was not told nor did I learn of anything being stolen, nor did I see anything out of the way while there myself. As for the Teachers residence this is the first time that I ever heard of or having ever being entered. It is a surprise as the Sister Superior has never mentioned to me.\n\nL. Letourneau\nIndian Agent\nSt Constant, Que.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 18th instant, addressed to the Constable Jocks, Caughnawaga, relative to the supposed breaking in the Village schools and the teachers' residence, and to inform you that after the clear explanations given by the constable, it appears that the entering into the schools at night might have only been imagined. However, I have advise the constable to keep on with careful attention around the schools at night.\n\nI enclose herewith his letter of explanation which seem quite satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n### Department of Indian Affairs\n\nTo MacKenzie & Genest\nContractors,\nGauchanawaga.\n\n---\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Nov. 26 | For having carried out a number of repairs to the Boys' and Girls' schools at Gauchanawaga, in accordance with the Department's instructions re No. 5-1-5, dated August 25, 1937 | |\n| 10 | Reconstruction of fences, etc., in front of boys' school | $138.50 |\n| | plus an extra, Dept. author letter dated Sept. 6, 1937 | $57.00 |\n| 20 | Boys' school - Painting of porches etc. | $60.00 |\n| 30 | \" \" Reconstruction of cement base | $35.00 |\n| 40 | Repairing roof of building, Boys' School | $55.00 |\n| 50 | Adjusting of inside doors | $20.00 |\n| 60 | Repairing Wire gates | $10.00 |\n| 70 | Painting steel fire escapes | $18.00 |\n| 80 | Replacing of the door at the teachers' residence | $30.00 |\n| GIRLS' SCHOOL | | |\n| 10 | Repairing the fence around school lot | $28.00 |\n| 20 | Painting fire escapes | $18.00 |\n| 30 | Painting of all plastering etc. | $110.00 |\n| Boys' School: extra authorized September 6th, 1937 | | |\n| | Repairing of the five steel gates | $564.50 |\n\n**Recommended for Payment**\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n---\n\nAgent.\n\n---\n\nForm 52.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

I consider that it was your duty to take in time the necessary precautions to prevent the admission of water into the above mentioned building, before the advent of rainy and cold weather, such as the closing of the sewer outlet and the artesian well, which you have taken advantage of for your own convenience since its completion. It is unquestionable that you have had ample time since the boring of the well to lay a concrete floor in the basement, entirely waterproof, as provided for by the specifications. Kindly, therefore, undertake at once the necessary work for the drainage of this part of the basement at your own expense, and keep the entire building suitably heated from now until its final completion and acceptance by the Department, as required by the specifications, (Articles 14, 24, & 27 of the General Conditions, also Article 5 under Excavation and Grading.)\n\nI am furthermore advised that the work is progressing very slowly, the roofing not being completed nor the brick veneering which should have been started several weeks ago, when weather conditions were more favourable. It is evident that the building will not be ready for inspection on the date stipulated in your contract, and that the delay will be the cause of serious inconvenience and expense to the Department. I would ask you, for this reason, to give the matter your most serious consideration as to whether the Department can expect the transfer of this building by the end of this year.\nI may say that the Department has arranged for the payment of the coke already furnished at the building, (2 tons) this upon the recommendation of our Engineer, also for the rental of a pumping outfit for a period not longer than six days, if so required, this being granted in order to assist you to remedy the present conditions, and allow the heating system to be put in operation with the least possible delay. It should be understood that no other expenses will be paid for by the Department, and the Inspector of Works and the Departmental Engineer are being advised to this effect.\n\nKindly inform the Department by return mail whether you have made the necessary arrangements for the completion of the drainage system for the building for the date set forth in my letter of instructions authorizing this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMacKenzie & Genest,\nContractor,\nCaughranwage, N.E.\nNov. 29, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter addressed today to Messrs.

MacKenzie & Genest have not at all proceeded with this work since nearly ten days.\n\nI have inspected this work yesterday and no one was at work.

MacKenzie & Genest, with reference to the heating and drainage of the new Central School at Caughnawaga.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that while visiting the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve, yesterday, I have made a thorough inspection of the building under construction and I have noticed that apart of the brick veneering not being quite carried out, the specifications, the outside joints not being filled in few case on the eastern side of the building, because of the incompetency of two bricklayers, I have been informed by the man in charge of this work that more competent workers are to replace them.\n\nThe interior work is proceeded with quite satisfactorily.\n\nThe water level into the basement seems to be at the same height as it was about two weeks ago.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA\nSir:\n\nIn reply to yours of November 29th regarding responsibility for water in Basement of the new Central School Caughnawaga, according to your letter you consider that it was our duty to take necessary precaution to prevent the admission of water into the basement. We would like you kindly to take note that our sewer outlet was close and also the cement floor in the basement as been finish since October 12th and for the Artisan well was not a part of our contract nor was no benefit to us as your letter state we took advantage off as we knew our water from river for our concrete, as for a coping or plugging the artisan well we had no authority to do so. Kindly take note that this water did not come in from the well in the day it start in on a sunday night November the 13th. Kindly take note that we notify your engineer Mr. J.D. O'Brien by telephone November the 15th of the circumstance.\nof the well, as we would not be responsible for delay or damage done from same, and he advised us to open the mouth of drain and proceed to pump it out which after we found was going to cost the Department too much as you would have to keep a pump day and night, and after having pumped it days we find out that the same water was backing through the rock which we notify your engineer of same as we were not responsible in any one way or the other, as the sewer was not constructed from the building.\n\nKindly take note that the furnaces were in and the heating system could have been completed if it was not for this water from the well.\n\nAs it is now your engineer arrange with us to supply coke to keep this water from freezing till such time as this water goes down if we supply temporary furnaces.\n\nKindly take note, as to your letter of the 17th advising us to go ahead with sewer for Central school we advise your engineer Mr. J. D. Blake that this work would take at least six to eight weeks with fair weather at this time of the year we started this work immediately and we have got in so far to date two days on account of rainy weather, as the surrounding of the sewers at the present time has covered with water.\nand so it is solid rock it will take sometime before it finish we expect it will run the middle of January to the 1st of February.\n\nReferring to your same letter re-brick veneering not been started several weeks ago kindly take note to your letter of October the 5th when we were ready to start brick you advise us to lay this bricks with a rope joint which was not in the specifications 3/8\" deep, we reply to same stating it would cost an extra, which we got no reply till November the 1st in which time the Department delayed us twenty-five days. We would like you to let us know how we could start several weeks ago when the Department had not decided what they want it, which things we in the rainy weather when we could off had the brickwork completed.\n\nKindly take note that the roof has been finished for sometime outside of certain portion that cannot be done till after brickwork is finished, as it has to be flash up to brickwork as this is Asbestos shingles and not wooden shingle as if there is any delay in the building being not finish at the date stipulated we considered it is the Department's fault as we were awarded the contract on July the 9th and could not\nIV\n\nproceed with the work on account of the Artesian well till August the 1st which was a loss of 20 days, which we notify your engineer Mr. J.D. Blair and an extra loss of 25 days on the brickwork.\n\nKindly take note that the work is proceeding very favorably at present to our estimate and will be completed under fair weather about the end of the year, but the sewers will not be completed to sometime in January as it only left me according to your letter of November the 17th, about six weeks which would be impossible under present weather conditions.\n\nKindly acknowledge receipt to the letter and oblige.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMcKenzie & Co.\nMemorandum\n\nThe various amounts mentioned in the account of Messrs. MacKenzie and Genest, contractors of Caughnawaga, were agreed upon before the work was started, when an inspection of the school buildings was made by me in company with the agent.\n\nA detailed list of the work to be performed for each amount mentioned in the accompanying statement was first submitted to the contractors, in order to obtain a fixed price, before authorizing any of the work, which was mostly in the form of repairs.

The work, however, is proceeding very slowly. Yesterday, they had three men at work for the drilling of about 25 holes that are already bored to an average depth of four feet into the solid rock, a length of approximately 100 feet from the river side. Needless to say the this kind of work is proceeded with very slowly.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 1st instant to the Contractors, I beg to inform you that the circular opening, referred to therein, has not yet been made by them.\n\nThe brick laying on the outside walls is also proceeded with very slowly on account of the severe temperature. I have noticed that the joints are not always properly made in accordance with the specifications. This is also probably due to the severe temperature during last week.\n\nThe second coat of the plastering into the concert hall is now completed.\n\nThere is about 12 inches deep of water yet into the boiler room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nAn Indian by the name of Angus Phillips of Caughnawaga has applied to this Department for payment of $7.20 for wages due him for the carting of gravel to level the roadway along the water pipe line leading to the girls' school, from the Mission building, at the time that the water pipe was thawed out some three years ago. He claims to have worked two days, under the supervision of Peter Viano, who omitted his name from the pay list. In view of the explanation given by him I would ask you to interview him personally, and prepare the necessary vouchers covering this amount, and forward same to the Department for consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.
