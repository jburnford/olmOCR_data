Vander Veen\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith lists of Ahousaht school children, as directed in your letter of January 30th, 1940.\n\nIn referring to the report of Capt. Barry in connection with proposed day school at Ahousaht, the situation has not been materially changed by the destruction of the residential school.\n\nThe two class rooms remain, but will require some repair at an approximate cost of $90.00, and I quite agree that these buildings would not be worth transporting to another site. The residence referred to was built by the Department, although on Church property, and was not much damaged by the fire. This could be used as a residence for the teacher if necessary, and I would strongly recommend that the teacher be a married man whose wife is a qualified nurse.\n\nMy reason for this lies in the fact that for many years a nurse has been employed at the school, and the natives have become dependent upon her for every minor illness and treatment, and unlike those at other reserves have lost their native self-reliance.\n\nThe proposed site for the new school is very good except for water and it would be necessary to dig and protect a well, as the water supply on the reserve is very poor.\n\nThe number of school age pupils as mentioned by Capt. Barry is overestimated, and possibly Capt. Barry took in the total pupilage at the school. This was made up as follows:\n\n| Ahousaht Band | 42 |\n|---------------|----|\n| Others        | 30 |\n\nOf this total, the thirty of the other bands will go to Alberni school, and of the Ahousaht Band approximately twenty-two will also have to go there, leaving only twenty for the day school.\n\nD.

C.\nUnder date of January 31, 1940, Department Letter 159-2-5, I am instructed by Mr. Phelan that the Church has requested that two teachers be retained for the day school, which request is approved. Capt. Barry, however, will be better able to judge as to the necessity for more than one, as recommended by me in my report on the fire.\n\nWith reference to size of the proposed school, it should not be necessary to provide for more than thirty-five pupils, and would also not need other than red cedar sills, which can be procured locally.\n\nNo provision need be made for manual training, as these people are all boat builders and can give the children practical training on the beach opposite the front of school site, as proposed.\n\nIt would appear from a study of the lists attached that a large percentage would need to go to residential school and this is accounted for by reason of the migratory habits of the people, who follow the fishing around the Coast and are absent from the village for many months of the year, also of course to adverse home conditions in many cases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI would refer you to the contents of Departmental letter 159-2-5 in regard to the construction of an Indian Day School at Ahousaht, West Coast Agency. Mr Hoey's letter is dated January 8th.\n\nThe present Ahousaht Indian Residential School is the property of the Woman's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada. It is not located on an Indian Reserve, but to the south of Mark-to-sis Indian Reserve, Ahousaht Band No. 15, and situated between the small bay and the lake as shown on Plan 3 of the Clayoquot Sound Indian Reserves in your possession.\n\nAt the present Ahousaht Indian Residential School there are two classrooms located in a simple long building with windows all on one side. This building is worth very little, and in any case being on United Church land is not the property of the Department. I have no doubt that in any case the material would be worth taking apart, transporting some half mile along a board walk through the woods to the middle of the Ahousaht village.\n\nThe teachers of the school at present live in the residential school building, which will of course be useless to us when the new Alberni Indian Residential School building is ready for occupation.\n\nAt the present Ahousaht Residential School there is a good house for the Missionary or Principal. This was erected late in 1936 I believe for it is first mentioned in my report on the school dated April 15th 1937, see confidential covering letter.\n\nOn Page 17 of my School Survey, West Coast Agency, forwarded to you in its final form on January 31, 1938 I recommended the erection of a one room day school at Ahousaht, and large enough to accommodate 35 pupils.\n\nIt was suggested that this new school should be located on the high piece of rocky land in front of the Indian village of Ahousaht. It was explained that this site is on the sea, and has large village greens on each side, a path at the rear or village side and the sea in front. It is in many ways an excellent site, is of course on the Indian Reserve, and as the Indians would no doubt like to have the new school in their own village it should not be difficult to obtain the surrender of sufficient land for this purpose.\nConditions have somewhat changed since my Survey Report was made on this West Coast Agency, and as it has now been decided to move a number of the pupils from Ucqualeetza to the new Alberni Indian Residential School a larger local day school will be needed at Ahousaht than was suggested in January 1938.\n\nProvision should be made for the maximum number of pupils that can be taught by one teacher, and I would suggest that the actual schoolroom should be large enough to accommodate forty five children in place of the thirty five previously suggested.\n\nThe actual number of children of school age and under now at Ahousaht has changed since my survey was made, but no doubt the Indian Agent could supply the present figures. It may be taken as granted that there would be around forty pupils available as soon as the present residential school at Ahousaht was closed down.\n\nThe lumber mentioned in my above quoted Survey Report as available at the Ahousaht Residential School has now been used for other purposes.\n\nI never considered that a cement basement would be necessary at Ahousaht, though there weather is very damp. The fact that funds are to be strictly limited leads me to recommend that one large schoolroom with the usual entrance halls is all that is necessary, for the main building. Two toilets and a woodshed would also be required.\n\nAs previously suggested the teacher could no doubt have room and board at the fairly new house used at present by Mr A.E.Caldwell, provided that the United Church intends to locate a Missionary at Ahousaht.\n\nIf the United Church is unable to provide accommodation for a teacher it will be necessary to change the type of day school and to include a residence for the teacher. The Department may consider that in any case this would be better. In this case the type of school erected at Pemberton would be best and a cement basement would be necessary.\n\nThe location suggested above for the new Ahousaht Indian Day School is within a few hundred yards of the whole of the Indian homes.\n\nApart from the list of pupils who will be available in September 1940 for such a school at Ahousaht, and which you can obtain of course from Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge, I believe that I have covered most of the points raised by Mr Hoey. If the school is to be of the size I recommend and taught by one teacher, probably a girl, there would be no need for provision of a Manual Training room. Should it be decided to add a teacher's residence as at Pemberton, provision could be made for Manual Training in the cement basement then necessary.\n\nI hope that the information given here together with that in my previous reports on the West Coast Agency educational needs will enable the Department to gain a fairly accurate picture of the conditions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

It is not located on an Indian Reserve, but to the south of Mark-to-sis Indian Reserve, Ahousaht Band No. 15, and situated between the small bay and the lake as shown on Plan 3 of the Clayoquot Sound Indian Reserves in your possession.\n\nAt the present Ahousaht Indian Residential School there are two classrooms located in a simple long building with windows all on one side. This building is worth very little, and in any case being on United Church land I make the property of the Department. I much doubt that in any case the material would be worth taking apart, transporting some half mile along a boardwalk through the woods to the middle of the Ahousaht village.\n\nThe teachers of the school at present live in the residential school building, which will of course be useless to us when the new Alberni Indian Residential School building is ready for occupation.\n\nAt the present Ahousaht Residential School there is a good house for the Missionary or Principal. This was erected late in 1936 I believe for it is first mentioned in my report on the school dated April 15th 1937, see confidential covering letter.\n\nOn Page 17 of my School Survey, West Coast Agency, forwarded to you in its final form on January 31, 1938 I recommended the erection of a one room day school at Ahousaht, and large enough to accommodate 35 pupils.\n\nIt was suggested that this new school should be located on the high piece of rocky land in front of the Indian village of Ahousaht. It was explained that this site is on the sea, and has large village greens on each side, a path at the rear or village side and the sea in front. It is in every way an excellent site, is of course on the Indian Reserve, and as the Indians would no doubt like to have the new school in their own village it should not be difficult to obtain the surrender of sufficient land for this purpose.\nConditions have somewhat changed since my Survey Report was made on this West Coast Agency, and as it has now been decided to move a number of the pupils from Coqualeetza to the new Alberni Indian Residential School a larger local day school will be needed at Ahousaht than was suggested in January 1936.\n\nProvision should be made for the maximum number of pupils that can be taught by one teacher, and I would suggest that the actual schoolroom should be large enough to accommodate forty-five children in place of the thirty-five previously suggested.\n\nThe actual number of children of school age and under now at Ahousaht has changed since my survey was made, but no doubt the Indian agent could supply the present figures. It may be taken for granted that there would be around forty pupils available as soon as the present residential school at Ahousaht was closed down.\n\nThe lumber mentioned in my above quoted Survey Report as available at the ahousaht Residential School has now been used for other purposes.\n\nI never considered that a cement basement would be necessary at Ahousaht, though there weather is very damp. The fact that funds are to be strictly limited leads me to recommend that one large schoolroom with the usual entrance halls is all that is necessary, for the main building. Two toilets and a woodshed would also be required.\n\nAs previously suggested the teacher could no doubt have room and board at the fairly new house used at present by Mr. A.M. Caldwell, provided that the United Church intends to locate a Missionary at Ahousaht.\n\nIf the United Church is unable to provide accommodation for a teacher it will be necessary to change the type of day school and to include a residence for the teacher. The Department may consider that in any case this would be better. In this case the type of school erected at Pemberton would be best and a cement basement would be necessary.\n\nThe location suggested above for the new Ahousaht Indian Day School is within a few hundred yards of the whole of the Indian homes.\n\nApart from the list of pupils who will be available in September 1940 for such a school at Ahousaht, and which you can obtain of course from Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge, I believe that I have covered most of the points raised by Mr. Hoey. If the school is to be of the size I recommend and taught by one teacher, probably a girl, there would be no need for provision of a Manual Training room. Should it be decided to add a teacher's residence as at Pemberton, provision could be made for Manual Training in the cement basement then necessary.\n\nI hope that the information given here together with that in my previous reports on the West Coast Agency educational needs will enable the Department to gain a fairly accurate picture of the conditions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 26, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant you may purchase dishes and equipment for the Ahousaht Indian Day School at a cost not exceeding $42.00. For the period March 1 to June 30, 1940, an amount of $18.00 a month will be allowed for the purchase of supplies for the midday meal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit a request of Mr. A. E. Caldwell, on behalf of the temporary day school recently established at Ahousaht, for permission to provide a mid-day meal.\n\nAs the location of the temporary school is quite a distance from the village, I would respectfully recommend that this be granted to the end of June, as it will also be a relief measure to the parents of these children who were formerly pupils of the Residential School.\n\nEstimated cost would be as follows:\n\nDishes and Equipment .............. 42.00\n4 months food supplies @ $18.00 .. 72.00\n\n$ 114.00\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nPEA/AM\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 7, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your telegram of the 6th instant requesting authority to open a day school at Ahousaht. In this connection I would refer you to official letter of January 31 from Indian Agent Ashbridge a copy of which was forwarded to you at that time and should have reached you before the date that your wire was sent.\n\nYou should instruct Mr. Ashbridge to notify us regarding the exact date on which day school activities commence. At the same time you should have the two teachers prepare and forward the usual questionnaire forms which are enclosed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M.

In the 1940-41 estimates, despite drastic reductions in every branch of the government service, including our own branch, we succeeded in retaining an item of $3,500 for the construction of a school at Ahousaht to serve the pupils now in attendance at the residential school at that point. It is my understanding that a teacher's residence, the property of the United Church, already exists on the Ahousaht site. We have no information at our disposal, however, to indicate whether or not the present school is actually located on an Indian reserve. If the present buildings are on a reserve, would it be necessary to purchase a site for the new school? Should this school have full basement accommodation for vocational instruction? Would it be possible to secure a sketch of the site, the location of the present buildings and the distance of the school buildings from the Indian homes? I should like to know, also, to what extent we will be able to secure lumber from any of the present buildings that may be abandoned when the new school is erected.\n\nIf you can find a favourable opportunity to discuss this matter with Inspector Barry, I feel confident both of you will have a fair idea of the information we are anxious to secure. The building of an Indian day school at Ahousaht is part of the policy agreed upon by the Government and the United Church when it was decided that the Coqualeetza school should be used in future as a sanatorium for the care of Indian patients suffering from tuberculosis. A list of the pupils of school age in the Ahousaht district and the approximate distance of their homes from the school site should be sent forward.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

M. MacKay,  \nIndian Commissioner,  \nP.O.Box 70,  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAs requested I have given consideration to the contents of Mr Indian Agent Ashbridge's letter 4887/40/C of the 9th instant with reference to the erection of an Indian day school at Ahousaht.\n\nThe present classroom buildings used formerly by the children attending the Ahousaht Indian Residential School are unsuitable for a permanent Indian day school at Ahousaht and are not worth moving. I agree with the Indian Agent that some repair work might well be done at once to make it possible to carry on the education of the Ahousaht children for the balance of the present academic year and until the new school on the village site is ready for occupation.\n\nWhile a married man as teacher, and particularly one whose wife was a qualified nurse would be of the greatest possible value at Ahousaht, the fact remains that we may not be able to secure such a teacher in the near future. I am informed that there will be a small surplus of teachers as soon as the Normal School term ends, but these will be for the most part young teachers and mainly girls.\n\nThe residence mentioned in this correspondence though erected by the Department appears to be on the United Church property and it may be the intention of the Church to have a resident missionary here, hence my suggestion that a girl teacher of the proposed new Ahousaht Indian day school might be able to have room and board in this residence, and thus obviate the necessity for the erection of a residence attached to the proposed new school.\n\nWhen I suggested that there would be around 40 pupils available for the new day school at Ahousaht I took it for granted that most of the Ahousaht children, stated by the Indian Agent to be 42 in his last letter quoted above, would attend such a school. If however it is necessary for some 22 of these to go to the new Alberni Indian Residential School there could still be around twenty available for the proposed school, and my former recommendation of a one classroom building that is a school for one teacher still holds good. It should be large enough to take up to 45 children in case the attendance increases here and fewer pupils from Ahousaht can be accommodated at Alberni.\n\nI note that the Indian Agent does not consider that the retention of two teachers at the temporary Ahousaht Indian Day School is necessary. If there are only 42 pupils in the Ahousaht Band the average attendance would hardly be in excess of 30, and one teacher could handle this quite well.\nMr Ashbridge however states that the Department in letter 159-2-5 dated January 31, 1940 has approved of the retention of two teachers at the present temporary Ahousaht Indian Day School, and it is therefore not necessary for me to make any recommendation.\n\nIt is of course fairer to the two teachers to allow them to retain their positions till the end of June 1940, but they will now I suppose be paid directly by the Department and not out of per capita grant.\n\nIt might be as well to let these teachers know as soon as the Department has come to a decision with regard to the future Ahousaht Indian Day School, for no doubt their services will be terminated at the end of the present academic year in June, and they should be given an opportunity to obtain other employment for the year 1940-41.\n\nThis letter should of course be read in continuation of my former letter on this subject dated January 18th 1940.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

Barry,\nInspector of Indian schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo enclosing letters from Inspector Barry and Indian Agent Ashbridge with reference to the proposed Indian day school at Ahousaht.\n\nAuthority has already been issued for the expenditure of $90.00 for repairing the building to be used for day school purposes between now and the end of June, 1940.\n\nIt has been decided to allow the two teachers salary at the rate of $850.00 a year each from the date on which the day school was opened until the end of June, 1940. While the teachers forwarded questionnaires they did not state the exact date on which they began duties at the day school. This information is necessary before salary can be paid to them. Please let me know at once. I presume that both of them understand that they will only be employed at Ahousaht until the end of June. It is possible, of course, that the authorities of the United Church may recommend their appointment at other Indian schools in British Columbia.\n\nI have read the suggestions contained in your letter regarding the erection of a new day school at this point. In this connection I would refer you to my letter of January 8 last in which you were informed that $3500.00 was being provided for the construction\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nof this school. Our estimates were not considered before Parliament was dissolved and consequently I am not in a position to state definitely at the present time if this amount will be provided but I am inclined to feel that such provision will be made. In the meantime you should make arrangements to secure the site which you consider most suitable for this school.\n\nDo you consider that this building should be built under the direction of the Surveys & Engineering Branch or could the Agent supervise its construction provided we erected it by day labour with a competent foreman in charge? Personally I prefer the latter method. If, however, you recommend construction under the direction of the Surveys & Engineering Branch it will be necessary to complete the attached building data form.\n\nI have noted that it will be unnecessary to erect a teachers' residence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Proposed Indian Day School, Ahousaht.\n\nI have to refer to your letter of January 8th, your file 159-2-5, regarding the marginally noted subject and to enclose letters from Inspector Barry and Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge dealing at some length with the matter.\n\nThe information requested in your letter might be summarized as follows:\n\n(1) The teachers resided in the Ahousaht School building recently destroyed by fire, this building was owned by the United Church of Canada.\n\n(2) The Ahousaht Indian Residential School property adjoins but does not form part of an Indian Reserve.\n\n(3) As the Indians are reported to be quite interested in having a Day School provided, it is fully expected that they would be willing to set aside the site selected in the Reserve for school purposes without cost to the Department. This matter is being taken up with Mr. Ashbridge.\n\n(4) It is considered that a plain school building consisting of one classroom to accommodate about 45 pupils with the usual entrance halls and porch would meet requirements.

Please express to the Indians our appreciation for their granting this site without cost to the Department.\n\nAs authorized in my letter of the 1st instant you may choose the site which you consider most suitable.\n\nI am not certain that there is any necessity for incurring expense in sending a surveyor to survey the small plot of ground that will be used for school purposes. As I advised you in my letter of January 8 it is unlikely that a larger amount than $3500.00 will be available for the erection of this school and if a surveyor's services were secured it would be necessary to pay the cost of his expenses and his services from this amount. Would it not be possible for the Agent to lay out the site in a manner that would be satisfactory to all parties concerned?

In my letter to the Department of February 21st, my file 15/15/4085, the question of sufficient and suitable space for the proposed new day school was covered in item 3 of that letter.\n\nFrom the Agent's letter it would appear as if there is a difference of opinion as to the best location for the school, but this is a matter that will have to be looked into on the ground and a definite decision made. When the site is finally selected it should be surveyed by a B.C. Land Surveyor and the plans and notes of such survey filed with the Department. This survey would have to be at the expense of the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of February 21st, 1940, in connection with proposed new day school at Ahousaht, and to report having held a Band meeting at Ahousaht, and obtained the necessary surrender.\n\nOn looking again over the site, as mentioned by Capt. Barry, I was of the opinion that a better site could be possibly be found very close to the village, and which would be better sheltered. In view of this, I left the matter open and obtained a surrender from the Band of a \"site of suitable size and location for the purpose.\"\n\nThe Band realizes the necessity and are 100% willing to comply with the wishes of the Department.\n\nThree copies of the resolution are hereto attached, together with complete list of voters and vote.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPBA/AM\n\nD.

As I advised you in my letter of January 8 it has only been found possible to provide an amount of $3,500.00 for the erection of this building.\n\nI feel that the most expeditious manner of erecting this building is to do the work by day labour employing a competent man as foreman. Please let me know if there are any Indians who can be employed or will it be necessary to engage white labour? If so, you should let me know the number required and their trade, also if they can be secured near Ahousaht or if they will have to be brought from some other point. Please let me know the approximate date on which construction can be started as we would like to have this building completed before September 1. It is understood that only a class room is required as provision can be made for the teacher's living accommodation elsewhere.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.

There are several capable men among the Indians at Ahousaht who are available for employment in connection with this construction.\n\nMr. Ashbridge has recommended Mr. Llewellyn of Esperanza as foreman carpenter at a salary of $7.00 per day. Mr. Llewellyn is reported to be a capable carpenter and builder and has just completed the new hospital building at Esperanza. The employment of Mr. Llewellyn would be satisfactory to this office.\n\nConstruction can be undertaken as soon as the materials are made available at Ahousaht. A plain one room school to accommodate up to 45 pupils, with cloakroom and porch entrance, is all that is required.

While there he has had the opportunity of consulting some of the men in regard to the Ahousaht situation, and especially in reference to the day school building which the Department proposes to erect in the near future. Dr. Dorey is convinced that a mistake will be made if the new building is in the village itself. He says that the Government could save money if it could use the present residence and school - which are half a mile from the village; and that by staying where the present buildings are, the accommodation would be better. He thinks consideration should be given to this recommendation.\n\nWe should like very much, before any final decision about the building is made, to have an opportunity to see the plans for the new Ahousaht day school. Do you not think this is a reasonable request? Perhaps our representatives in that part of the Island might have some helpful suggestions to make to your Department about the building.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6422, file 868-5, part 1)\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 159-36-5.\n\nI have received your letter of June 12th with further reference to the proposed new day school at Ahousaht. The Department will have received my letter of June 11th in which I recommended that a new school be provided in the village.\n\nIt has occurred to me that the situation referred to by the Department could be met by diverting the funds set aside for the new day school at Kitamaat for such purposes as are now found necessary. There is no urgent need of a new day school at Kitamaat and as pointed out before, construction there should not be undertaken in any case until a decision with respect to the continuation of Kitamaat as a Residential School has been reached by the Church authorities. If it comes to a question of a choice as between Ahousaht and Kitamaat, it would be more satisfactory and meet a more pressing need if a school at the former place were provided.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of May 30th enclosing a copy of a letter from Rev. R. B. Cochrane, Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, in the matter of a location for a Day School at Ahousaht.\n\nI may say that the suggestion that one or more of the remaining buildings of the Residential School unit be used as a Day School was considered some time ago and it was decided then that the site was too far from the village and as a considerable expenditure would be required to put the buildings in condition for our requirements, it would be desirable for these and other reasons to build the school in the Ahousaht village itself.\n\nMy own opinion is that the distance from the village to the old Residential School site is too far for the children to walk, especially in cold, wet, stormy weather, of which they have considerable on the West Coast. This distance would not be considered too great in settled communities or in an open farming country, but there are certain risks in having children traverse such a distance through uninhabited densely wooded country by trail, that should not be overlooked. There is no doubt in my mind that the attendance would be much better if the school were located in the village, and the presence of the teacher daily among the Indian people should be helpful to them in many respects. After careful consideration of all the circumstances, I am satisfied that it would be in the best interests of the Indians and the Department to build the school in the village, as proposed, and would appreciate receipt of the Department's decision in this matter at an early date.\n\nCopies of letters from Mr. Inspector Barry and Mr. Ashbridge are forwarded herewith.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nJune 10, 1940.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have considered with care the Department's airmail letter 159/36/5, dated May 30, 1940, with reference to a suggestion of Reverend R.B. Cochrane that no new Indian Day School be erected in the village of Ahousaht, West Coast Agency, but that rather the proposed Indian Day School be carried on in one of the two rooms formerly used as classrooms at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nI should like to point out to you that should the old classroom or classrooms be used the Ahousaht children will have a daily walk of some mile on a raised plank walk through the woods to and from school. I fear that accidents, children falling off planks, etc., quite likely to occur.\n\nWith the Day School so far from the Indian village it will be almost impossible to keep up a good percentage attendance while if the school were conducted in the Ahousaht village itself, the attendance would certainly be better and the teacher would be in a position to exercise a certain amount of control by visiting Indian parents in their own houses.\n\nIt should also be remembered that if we are to conduct an Indian Day School in this district it would be far better to have it located on the Indian Reserve itself than on property belonging to the Woman's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada, over which we have no control.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nJune 10, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to refer to your letter of June 6th in connection with the proposed day school at Ahousaht. The class rooms in use at the present time are situated on the site of the old Residential School which is church property and approximately three quarters of a mile from the village. These classrooms are badly constructed, poorly ventilated and lighted.\n\nTo modernize these rooms would mean spending considerable money on remodelling and repair, which money could be spent to better advantage in a Department owned school.\n\nThe people of Ahousaht cannot be said to be healthy and the children are not robust. I quite agree with Captain Barry that children having to walk a long distance in wet weather and being obliged to sit in a classroom with their present defects is detrimental to their health and also to school attendance.\n\nHaving the school at the village would bring the teacher into closer touch with parents, ensure better attendance. I would respectfully recommend that the new school as proposed be built at Ahousaht Village.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\n\nMajor D.M.

I think you might very well consider fixing this up.\"\n\nYou will note it has been suggested that we should fix up this matter. Would this involve new batteries or what expenditure would be required? It is not our practice to supply lighting outfits for Indian day schools. Consequently if this is what is meant no such action can be taken. However, the Department is prepared to supply a reasonable number of Coleman lamps if you consider that they would give better lighting than the ecoaloil lamps which are now stated to be in use.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. P.B.

B. Clover, Indian Day School, Ahousaht, B.C.,\nper C.P.R. Lines.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge your letter of April 18th, 1941, and to report on the Ahousaht Day School as follows:\n\nThe old classrooms at present in use are situated about one-quarter mile from the village and are part of the old Residential School, and presumably the property of the United Church. Classrooms are poorly constructed and, apart from doors and windows, would be of little value if torn down and taken to a new site.\n\nIt is not thought that the attendance at the Ahousaht School will at any time exceed twenty-five pupils, and it would be more economical to build a new schoolroom than to utilize the old buildings, with the exception of doors, windows, furnishings and desks. Reconstruction could not be carried out until late in the year, as the Indians are away on the fishing grounds from May to October, and I feel sure they would expect payment for labor.\n\nSince the destruction of the Residential School the Indians have opposed the day school, and have sought admission for their children to both the Christie and Alberni Residential Schools on every pretext.\n\nPresent classrooms have been put in good order and in so far as their construction will permit, and new heater and lighting provided. Also rubber boots were provided for the children to keep them dry during the wet season, and mid-day meal given to eliminate the necessity of going home at mid-day.\n\nIn view of these conditions, I would respectfully recommend that the present classrooms be retained for at least another year, and the allowance for mid-day meal extended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nMay 7, 1941.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nWith reference to the attached file in regard to the application of the Ahousaht Indians for the erection of a new Indian Day School at the Ahousaht Village it is noted that no provision has been made in the Estimates now before parliament for the construction of an Indian Day or Residential School anywhere in the Dominion.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I have no other option but to agree with the suggestion put forward by Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge in the last paragraph of his letter 6501/41/C of May lst that the present classroom be retained for another year, the allowance for the mid-day meal extended, and the United Church be asked to nominate a suitable qualified teacher to take the place of Mr. J.B.

Glover\n15/15/1291\n\nOttawa, April 5, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Ahousaht Indian Day School\n\nI have for acknowledgment a letter dated March 23, 1941, and also copy of a resolution passed by the Ahousaht Band, attached thereto.\n\nIt is noted that in this resolution the members of the Band ask for the construction of a new Indian day school at the Ahousaht Village.\n\nNo provision has been made in the estimates now before Parliament for the construction of Indian day or residential schools anywhere in the Dominion, and it is not at all likely that funds will be available for the construction of an Indian day school at Ahousaht at any time in the immediate future. In view of this fact, I have been wondering if the demolition of the present school and its reconstruction near the village has ever been seriously considered. I am aware, of course, that the existing building is somewhat old and dilapidated, but it has occurred to me that if the Indians are really interested in the education of their children they might undertake, during the summer months, the dismantling of the old building and the construction of a building at the village. A building reconstructed in this sense might not be ideal for educational purposes, but it might be suitable for their needs until times become somewhat normal. I am making this suggestion on the understanding that the labour costs involved would be borne by the Indians. We have no item in our estimates that would enable us to assume payment of the labour costs involved in the reconstruction of this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith resolution passed by the Ahousaht Band expressing dissatisfaction with the school near their Reserve which is one of the buildings formerly used by the United Church Mission for a Residential school and is situated some distance from the village, making it necessary for the children to travel over very rough and slippery ground in the section of the country where rain is very prevalent.\n\nThis matter was previously discussed with the Department in the Commissioner's letter of June 11, 1940. I am also enclosing letters dated June 10, 1940, by Mr. Inspector Barry and Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge.\n\nPossibly the Department may wish to discuss this matter with the Commissioner who is now at Ottawa, with a view to the provision of a school in the village as undoubtedly the present location is prejudicial to the health of the children.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to attach hereto resolution passed by the Ahousaht Band on my recent visit, in connection with school matters.\n\nI may say the Band seems to be very dissatisfied with the present school, as indeed both Capt. Barry and myself are.\n\nThis matter was proposed by the Band themselves, and while I advised them that the Department had this under consideration, they insisted that the request be put forward.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nRESOLUTION OF THE AHOUASHT BAND\nat a regular meeting of the Band, held at Ahousaht, B.C.,\nMarch 7th, 1941.\n\nChairman - P.B. Ashbridge, Indian Agent.\nInterpreter - George Shamrock.\n\nRESOLUTION: We, the voting members of the Ahousaht Band and\nparents of children attending the Day School,\nrespectfully request that a new day school be built before the\nSchool re-opens in October 1941.\n\nOur reason for this request is that the present\nschool is too far from the village and the building is not suit-\nable, resulting in our children's health suffering.\n\nTeddy George\nMartin Charlie\nJoseph Titian\nWill Samuel\nDaniel Charlie\nAmbrose Titian\nErnie Campbell\nMax George\nJ.G.

(RG 10, Volume 6422, file 868-5, part 1)\nJune 10, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to refer to your letter of June 6th in connection with the proposed day school at Ahousaht. The class rooms in use at the present time are situated on the site of the old Residential School which is church property and approximately three quarters of a mile from the village. These classrooms are badly constructed, poorly ventilated and lighted.\n\nTo modernize these rooms would mean spending considerable money on remodelling and repair, which money could be spent to better advantage in a Department owned school.\n\nThe people of Ahousaht cannot be said to be healthy and the children are not robust. I quite agree with Captain Barry that children having to walk a long distance in wet weather and being obliged to sit in a classroom with their present defects is detrimental to their health and also to school attendance.\n\nHaving the school at the village would bring the teacher into closer touch with parents, ensure better attendance. I would respectfully recommend that the new school as proposed be built at Ahousaht Village.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n\"P.B.Ashbridge\"\n\nP.B.Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nGR\n\nMajor D.M.Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\nJune 10, 1940.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have considered with care the Department's airmail letter 159/36/5, dated May 30, 1940, with reference to a suggestion of Reverend R.B. Cochrane that no new Indian Day School be erected in the village of Ahousaht, West Coast Agency, but that rather the proposed Indian Day School be carried on in one of the two rooms formerly used as classrooms at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nI should like to point out to you that should the old classroom or classrooms be used the Ahousaht children will have a daily walk of some mile on a raised plank walk through the woods to and from school. I fear that accidents, children falling off planks, etc., quite likely to occur.\n\nWith the Day School so far from the Indian village it will be almost impossible to keep up a good percentage attendance while if the school were conducted in the Ahousaht village itself, the attendance would certainly be better and the teacher would be in a position to exercise a certain amount of control by visiting Indian parents in their own houses.\n\nIt should also be remembered that if we are to conduct an Indian Day School in this district it would be far better to have it located on the Indian Reserve itself than on property belonging to the Woman's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada, over which we have no control.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to request that authority be given to continue the mid-day lunch provided for pupils of Ahousaht and Ucluelet Day Schools.\n\nThe allowance for this purpose for the past year was:\n\nAhousaht - $15.00 per month. (November to March)\nUcluelet - $8.00 per month. (December to March)\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th ultimo with reference to the Ahousaht Indian Day School and the resolution of the Band asking for the construction of a new school in their village, in connection with which you advise that no provision had been made in the Estimates for the construction of any new school and that the Band might consider demolition and re-erection of the school near the village.\n\nThis matter has been taken up with Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge and I enclose herewith his letter of the 1st instant, also letter of Mr. Inspector Barry of the 7th instant, from which it will be observed that the suggestion is not considered practical.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I would recommend that the matter be left in abeyance until such time as funds are available for the construction of a new school or the Reserve has been inspected by the Inspector of Agencies.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge your letter of April 12th, 1941, and to report on the Ahousaht Day School as follows:\n\nThe old classrooms at present in use are situated about one-quarter mile from the village and are part of the old Residential School, and presumably the property of the United Church. Classrooms are poorly constructed and, apart from doors and windows, would be of little value if torn down and taken to a new site.\n\nIt is not thought that the attendance at the Ahousaht School will at any time exceed twenty-five pupils, and it would be more economical to build a new schoolroom than to utilize the old buildings, with the exception of doors, windows, furnishings and desks. Reconstruction could not be carried out until late in the year, as the Indians are away on the fishing grounds from May to October, and I feel sure they would expect payment for labor.\n\nSince the destruction of the Residential School the Indians have opposed the day school, and have sought admission for their children to both the Christie and Alberni Residential Schools on every pretext.\n\nPresent classrooms have been put in good order and in so far as their construction will permit, and new heater and lighting provided. Also rubber boots were provided for the children to keep them dry during the wet season, and mid-day meal given to eliminate the necessity of going home at mid-day.\n\nIn view of these conditions, I would respectfully recommend that the present classrooms be retained for at least another year, and the allowance for mid-day meal extended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

In that event you may expend an amount of $25.00 for the construction of outside toilets.\n\nPlease advise me if you can make the arrangements suggested in this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Barry and myself that a school be built in the village, same school being rejected by the church. The church building referred to is suitable for a day school and the equipment of the present school can be easily transferred.\n\nConditions for the children at the present school are not good, and I would respectfully recommend that this request be granted.\n\nThe only expense involved I can see at present would be the construction of outside toilets, estimated cost twenty-five dollars.\n\nI may say that Mr. Glover the present teacher is in full agreement with this request, and would give every assistance in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

Arneil Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWill you kindly grant authority for the purchase of an oil heating stove for the Ahousat Indian Day School. This school was supplied with a wood burning heater but it is found that wood cannot be obtained for this stove. A quantity of wood was secured last summer but this will have all been used before the end of January. Miss Moats as well as myself have endeavoured to obtain the services of some Indian to procure wood for this school but this we have been unable to do. Great difficulty is experienced in all places along the coast where wood is required.\n\nI would recommend that as there is an oil station adjacent to the Reserve that they be supplied with an oil heating stove.\n\nQuotations on an oil heating stove were obtained from Woodward's Store (Port Alberni) Ltd., amounting to $90.50\n\nN.W.

One of these dealt with the payment of rental on the church building used as a school at Ahousaht. Apparently, the Church has never received any rental for this building.\n\nThey also requested that we give consideration to the erection of a new school at Ahousaht this summer. Unfortunately, we have not a sum in our Estimates for its erection but I would suggest that we place it in the Supplementaries. If it is at all possible to arrange a transfer of funds from another project, this might be one to which you would give consideration.\n\nBernard F.

As you are aware, only 50% of our funds were voted before Parliament prorogued. As a result we have had to limit our building programme accordingly and I cannot now definitely assure you that this school will be built this summer.\n\nI know this will be disappointing to the Woman's Missionary Society, as indeed it is to me. However, these are matters over which we have no control and we will do everything possible to make the school more comfortable next winter.\n\nA new oil heater has recently been supplied to the school, in an effort to improve heating conditions. As you are aware, we were unable to obtain the services of an Indian to secure sufficient wood for this school. There is an oil station adjacent to the reserve, so we feel that at least things will be more comfortable for the teacher.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

There is not very much that can be done about this in view of the political circumstances which obtain at the present time and under which you have only a part of your appropriation available for 1949.\n\nI am asked, however, to draw your attention to the fact that the church at Ahousaht is being occupied by your Department as a school for the last three years, and, so far, no rent has been paid.

First, the amount of $2450.00 is probably in excess of the value of the building and second, the Department constructed a residence for the principal of the school which was turned over to the Woman's Missionary Society without cost to that organization.\n\nIt is recommended that the amount of $105.00 be paid to the Woman's Missionary Society for rental of this building for the last three months of the academic year.\n\nIt is hoped that it will be possible to construct our own school at Ahousaht in the 1950-51 fiscal year.\n\nWe have not address of the Woman's Missionary Society but it is assumed that the Department will have this information.\n\nW.S.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Ahousaht Indian Day School\nYour file 16-11-3 (159)\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of July 18th and in view of the information contained in your letter, we feel that it would be fair to the Women's Missionary Society to allow rent from April 1st 1949 only.\n\nWe are advising Doctor Dorey to this effect and informing him that we will continue to pay rent for the Church at the same rate as long as we use it for school purposes. A Voucher for the rent should be forwarded at the end of every quarter.\n\nPP/ST Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nJuly 27th, 1949.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nRe: Ahousaht Indian Day School\n\nWe received your letter of June 7th in the latter part of which you drew our attention to the fact that we had not been allowing rent for the Church at Ahousaht which has been used for school purposes.\n\nA reply to your letter has been delayed due to the fact that we were obliged to communicate with Indian Commissioner Arneil.\n\nYou are no doubt aware that the Department constructed a residence for the Principal of the Ahousaht School and it was turned over to the Women's Missionary Society without cost to that organization.\n\nWith the above in mind, we feel that we should only pay rent from April 1st, 1949, and a cheque for $105.00 for payment to the end\nof June will be forwarded to the Women's Missionary Society. We will continue to allow rent at this rate as long as the school is being conducted in the Church.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

The Woman's Missionary Society inform me that they did not receive a remittance of this amount.

These quotations are based on today's prevailing prices of lumber and in the event of lumber prices advancing further it will be necessary for these to be revised at the time of delivery.

We have been unable to interest contractors in tendering on works required in other outlying areas as they have all the work they can do in their own localities and it is not expected that there will be any exception in this instance.\n\nTHAT a competent building company, namely Prefabricated Structures Limited, Post Office Box 469, Vancouver, British Columbia, has agreed to undertake immediately the provision of a two-room prefabricated school with attached teacher's residence, nurse's quarters and dispensary for the sum of $12,510.00 f.o.b. Vancouver;\n\nTHAT Indian Health Services of the Department of National Health and Welfare are prepared to contribute Eight and One-half Per Cent (8\u00bd\u00a2) or $1,000.00 towards the purchase of this building in which provision is to be made for nurse's quarters and dispensary.\n\nMW/CC\nTHAT funds amounting to $11,921.00 are available in Vote 69, 1950-51, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship and Immigration, for the construction of the school and teacher's residence and an amount of $1,000.00 will be provided by the Indian Health Services, Department of National Health and Welfare (Vote 897, 1950-51) for their share of the building.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that authority be granted to accept the offer of Prefabricated Structures Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, B.C., amounting to $13,810.00 for the furnishing of a prefabricated building to be erected on the Ahousaht Indian Reserve, West Coast Agency, B.C.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration\nOttawa, October 26, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nAhousaht Indian Day School\n\nPlease find enclosed a Submission to Council covering the purchase of a prefabricated school and attached teachers' residence for the above Indian Reserve, in the West Coast Indian Agency, British Columbia.\n\nWe have an old school at this point but have been unable to keep teachers, due to the poor condition of the building. In fact, it is one of the very few day schools at which we have not a teacher this year.\n\nYou will note that in order to provide company for the teachers, we have agreed with Indian Health Services to provide a small dispensary and nurse's quarters in this building. They are contributing $500 of the cost of the prefabricated building plus a share of the erection costs.\n\nIt is not known whether this building can be erected this year but it is intended to ship it in to the site during the winter.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\nOctober 16, 1950.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Ahousaht Indian Day School\n\nWe are in receipt of a copy of Dr. Moore's memorandum to Mr. Neary wherein Indian Health Services agree to provide up to $3,825.00 for a dispensary and living quarters for a nurse at the above-mentioned school. This figure was based on 8\u00bd% of the estimated cost of a prefabricated building.\n\nPrefabricated Structures, from whom we proposed to purchase the building, have, we are informed, gone into liquidation. They have arranged to fill all orders already placed with them, but as the Ahousaht School building has not yet been ordered, we will have to revise our plans for the erection of the school at this point and it is altogether likely that construction will have to be postponed till next year.\n\nW.S.

It is the unanimous judgment of our Missionary Committee that one half the cost of the proposed building is the least the Court ought to do.\nI sincerely trust that this matter will receive the favorable consideration of the Board.

This document will put you in possession of the main facts of the case, and will enable you to deal intelligently with Mr Dewdney in discussing the matter. You will see that I have not asked for any definite sum; this is because we do not know, as yet, what the entire cost of the enterprise will amount to, and I have thought that a preliminary grant at the present session, leaving further aid an open question, would be the best way to deal with the case. This much is certain, we have paid out $2500 for the site; the two buildings, for the boys and girls respectively, and the school building common to both, will be erected during the early summer; while the necessary outbuildings, and the appliances for cultivating the land will have to be provided. It is clear therefore that an expenditure of from $10,000 to $12,000 will be incurred before next autumn. I trust from this presentation of the case you will be able to procure substantial aid from the Government; and I think it would not be amiss to remind Mr Dewdney of the fact that we are simply asking a grant in aid, and are putting our own money largely into the enterprise, other Institutes in\nBritish Columbia are being provided entirely at the cost of the Government, and the management given to other churches free of any cost to them.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nA. Sutherland\n\nMemo in regard to other matters will go forward shortly.\n\nA. S.\nVisit of Rev. Dr. Sutherland.\n\nMonday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th were excellent days in Chilliwack for such as availed themselves of their opportunity.\n\nThe occasion was the visit of the Rev. Dr. Sutherland, several secretaries of the Missionary Societies of the Methodist Church, the Rev. C. M. Tate, resident missionary, with his characteristic sagacity, had made interesting arrangements for the improvement of the school. A high-class evening service in the Spanish Schoolroom on Monday at 7:30 p.m., Indian school examination at the Coqualeetza Home on Tuesday at 9 p.m., and a lecture on Prohibition and Politics, in Henderson Hall Tuesday night at 8.\n\nWe regret that we are not in a position to speak of Mr. Tate being unable to attend. The lecture has been briefly reported already by another correspondent. We will make a few statements respecting the examination only.\n\nAmong those present were Dr. Sutherland, Mr. J. B. Bryant, President of the B. C. Conference, Judge Vowell, of Victoria (Indian Superintendent), Mr. McTavish, Westminster, Island agent, Mr. P. R. Wilson, P. H. Hogg and others, also a goodly number of the parents of the children of the school.\n\nThe Rev. C. M. Tate conducted the examination. The scholars did remarkably well throughout. Their answers came quickly and intelligently. Particularly was this struck with this. On the subjects of Geography and Scriptural History. We were much surprised at the original answers given to one of the boys during the question on Anatomy.\u2014What is the use of alcohol? was asked. To preserve the body, said he to all living ones, was the reply. The musical talent of the children was also well evidenced in the highly satisfactory rendering of the hymns collectively.\n\nAt the close of the examination, the gentlemen on the platform briefly addressed the meeting.\n\nJudge Vowell with well chosen words expressed his surprise and pleasure at what he had witnessed that afternoon, he had not expected to find such intelligence exhibited and advanced. He was in sympathy with the object and approved of its method and encouraged its future development and success.\n\nMr. McTavish noted with much satisfaction the progress the school had made since its opening 18 months ago. In all he most congratulated Mr. and Mrs. Tate and the ladies in charge. He also addressed a few words to the parents present in Chinook, pointing out the high privilege the children enjoyed in their training at the Coqualeetza Home.\n\nDr. Sutherland was delighted with what he had seen and heard during the inspection. He thought the work accomplished in the short time the school has been established (less than 3 years) was well worthy of comment; it indicated the aptitude of the school and the efficiency of the teachers and that no doubt the school better regulated and he would have many pleasant recollections and nice things to say about it when he returned to England. He also spoke a few words to the Indian parents which were in tenor similar to Mr. Tate.\n\nThe school being dismissed, the friends were taken through the various rooms of the institution and were shown samples of needlework and other work done by the children under the supervision of Miss Solmers. There are now about 80 children in the Home.\n\nIt is due to all that the three ladies in charge, Misses Clarke, Elderton and Solmers, are well qualified for the important work entrusted to them and of this in course of its operation the Women's Missionary Society commends itself to the hearty support of all right minded and true-hearted people.\nExtract of Letter from Mr. Bowell\ndated Indian Office, Victoria, B.C.\nMay 13, 1891\n\n\"Being present at the Annual Examination of the pupils at the Squamish Home, I was much pleased at the result.

Newbury\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA little over a year ago I was present at the opening of the Home School for Indian Children carried on by the Women's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church at Chilliwack. A few weeks ago I visited it again and was very much pleased to see the progress made by the scholars during the year. There are about 30 pupils in the home. Several of the boys have reached an age when they should be learning some trade or industry which will enable them to become self-supporting citizens when they reach manhood. It is quite a number such boys among the various bands of Indians who would be glad to receive help in that direction. It would be impossible to secure the facilities for a suitable industrial institution and form a home when the present Home is situated.\n\nAfter several conferences with Mr. Tate, our missionary to the Indians of Fraser Valley, I have come to the conclusion that the best means of providing for the welfare of these people is to purchase the Popcorn Mills property consisting of sawmill, grist mill, shingle mill, excelsior mill with the usual machinery for dressing lumber. All is in good running order and the water power is excellent. There are several substantial buildings included and about 60 acres of land partly covered with good timber and partly bare.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nable for farming. In fact there is a considerable area now under cultivation and fruit trees are doing well including 800 prune trees. The place is suitable for milling, farming, gardening, fruit growing and stock raising and is well situated for the Kootenay Indians.\n\nNow I write to you privately first of all, to ask if you think there is any hope that the Dominion Government would undertake to purchase the above property at $15000 for which very moderate price I am told it can be had, and adding the necessary equipment carry it on as an industrial institution under the management of the Methodist Church. It would be of immense benefit to a large number of these people and would be largely remunerative from the start as there is market for all that the mills produce.\n\nI forget to say that the livestock is included with the property. While I have no sympathy with a good deal which has been said recently on this point, yet I do think that the time has come when such an institution should be placed under the care of our church in the Fraser Valley.\n\nIf the above commends itself to your judgment and you think it a wise deed, I shall have the scheme brought before the Government in detail through the proper officials of our church, provided, of course, they approve of the plan. Meanwhile I shall be very much pleased to hear from you on the subject.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.M.

W. Vowell Esq.\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt affords us very much pleasure to welcome you to Chilliwack again, especially as your visit is in connection with a matter in which we are all so much interested, - the opening of this beautiful school building. We wish you to convey our thanks to the Government for the assistance rendered in the erection of this edifice for the education of our children. As the white people fill up our country we are more than ever satisfied, that to compete with them successfully we must have education.\n\nBut, there are also other matters of which we would like to speak. The white people were not here first. By tradition we can trace our ancestry back for many generations, and it has been handed down to us that this land has always belonged to the Indians. We are glad however that the white people have come, and we share with them our\nour land, trees, animals, birds and fish; but, we are troubled when we are told that we must no longer catch our fish in the way we have always caught them, viz., the long net anchored along the sides of our streams and rivers.\n\nWe are also told at certain seasons that we may catch fish for our own use, but not sell them to white people. We think this very unjust; for there are times when the sale of a salmon would bring to us little things which we could not otherwise have. And when the salmon are in season why should the Indians be compelled to pay license for catching and selling what belongs to them.\n\nWe would like you as our chief to enter protest against the wholesale slaughter of the sturgeon in the Fraser River. The Salmon are fished so much at the mouth of the river, that but few of them get up stream. We have always been able to get sturgeon however, and we have said very little about the salmon; but now that the white people are going about to destroy what seems to us our last resort, we think the time has come for us to speak.\n\nWith\nWith regard to our land we would like to say just a word. We are constantly told that unless we clear up our reserves, the land will be taken from us. Have the white people cleared up all their land? Will there not be some left for the next generation to clear up. Many of us are doing the best we can, and are just as anxious for the land to be cleared as anyone; but it does not help us to be constantly told that we are in danger of losing our land.\n\nWe are very sorry that the Government has stopped giving medicines to our sick people, whilst at the same time we are told that our own doctors are not to practice. When sickness overtakes us many of our people die because we cannot pay the white-man doctor, and have no money to buy medicine. If the Government would appoint a doctor to care for us we would be very thankful indeed.\n\nAnd now Sir, we trust that your visit will be pleasant to yourself, and profitable to us. As you seek to guard\nthe interests of the Indian people so will our love for you be increased and praying God's blessing to rest upon you.\n\nWe are Very dear Sir,\nfor the Indian bands in this valley.\n\n(Sgd) Captain John\n- Dick\n- Billy\n- Jim\n- Ned\n- Joe\n\nChilliwack, B. C.\nApril 26th. 1894.\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have the honour by direction of the Department of Indian Affairs to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo asking on behalf of your Missionary Board for a further grant of \u00a3500 towards the building materials for a church of construction at Chilliwack B.C., and in reply I beg to inform you that the Department deferred replying to your communication until hope that it would be able to give you full satisfaction when however the Estimates are being prepared your application will be carefully considered.\n\nNovember 20, 1893\nOttawa, 10th November, 1893.\n\nThe Honourable T. Mayne Daly,\nSupt. General of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe undersigned places herewith file 58,913, on which is a letter of the 31st ultimo from the Rev. Mr. Sutherland, asking for a further grant of $5,000.00 towards the Indian Institute which the Methodist Church is building at Chilliwack, B.C.\n\nThis Institute is to replace the Coqua-Leetza Home which was destroyed by fire in the Spring of 1892, and towards which the Department contributed $1,000.00, besides giving a per capita grant of $130.00 per annum for 10 pupils. The Government has already contributed $5,000.00 towards the new Institute. The Government was not consulted either in regard to the establishment of the Coqua-Leetza Home or the Institute which is to replace it. But when aid was asked the plans of the buildings were submitted to the Department, and the estimated cost was put at $15,000.00. Dr. Sutherland now states however that the cost (excluding the necessary outbuildings) will be about $25,000.00.\n\nThe land on which the Institute is building was not given by the Government; but in September last Dr.\nSutherland wrote saying that more land was required, and enquiring as to a half-section of land which he had been told was available for the institute. He was asked for a description which would enable the Department of the Interior to say whether the land was available; but so far he has not furnished any.\n\nD.S.G.of I.A.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Deputy Minister\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 3rd May 1893\n\nI beg to report that in a letter dated 14th June 1892 from the Victoria office one was informed from the Rev. Mr. Watts, Methodist Mission at Chilcotin, making application to the Deptt. for $2000 to enable him to finish an industrial scheme at that place. On the 2nd July last year he was informed that there was no appropriation for his purpose but that the question of getting Parliament for a grant would be considered. In fact of that same year a petition was sent from the Women's Mission Society of the Methodist Church asking for aid towards the erection of a school building known as the Coquihalla Home in the Township of Chilcotin and towards the maintenance and instruction of pupils therein. The request was that in the Estimates for 1892-93 $1000 was intended to go toward the furnishing of the institution and $1300 per annum for the support of 10 pupils.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 189\n\npupils thereof, the $1000 was expended in furniture & the grant of $130 per acre for each of 10 pupils is still being spent from year to year. In May 1890 Mr. McRoberts of New Westminster wrote in regard to the purchase of the Popcorn Mine property with a view to the establishment of a school at that point\u2014but he was informed by the Dept. that it did not consider it desirable to remove the school at present for various reasons.\n\nOn July 1891 the Dept. received a letter from Mr. Scott of Ontario stating that the Dominion Lands Act at New Westminster had been extended to it\u2014a letter from Mr. McRoberts accompanying on behalf of the Mississaugas for a piece of land lying South-West of the Cootes Lake ordinance for a site for the Orphan Mission School.\n\nIn March 1892 the Dept. authorities informed the Dept. that the Bognia Sect. Home had been completely...\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 189...\n\nCompletely destroyed by fire stating that the Indians were being cared for in the Mission House on an adjoining lot. On the 29th March 47 inhabitants met me here stating that it was no inconvenience to the Ch. people to increase their own property that with that end in view a site of 20 acres had been purchased about 1/4 mile from the Sandus & Co. being a portion of what is known as the Webb farm. The cost of house was $2500 & he considered that the cost of the institute when ready for occupation would be about $1500. He asked for a grant to said that when the plans were ready a copy would be sent to the Dept. The answer was that in Estimates for 1892-3 the sum of $2500 was included. The sum was voted in Oct. 1892. No plans were submitted to Dept. by architect who stated that at $2500 voted by Parliament just paid for the rate of 20 acres & asked that no question of making a further grant.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nGrant be considered by H.E. Dept., the corner-\nstone laid in the supplementary Estimates for\n1892-3, another $2500 was included towards\na building & voted by Parliament making\na total sum of $5000 for the building\nwhich has been paid. On Oct 10th last\u2014\nDr. Butterland wrote saying that he was in-\nformed by Mr. Reid, M.P. of Sherrington,\nthat a 44 acre of land on Butler Lake\nhad been reserved by the Donne Body and\nwas available for the purpose of the Indian\nInstitute at Sherrington if required by\nthe Methodist Society. He stated that\nno 20 acres already purchased was not\nsufficient & asked for information\nrespecting the 44 acre referred to. The\nmatter was referred to the Dept. of Interior &\non Oct 17th this Dept. was informed that\nwithout a more definite description it was\nimpossible to state whether or not the land\nrequired is available.

(RG 1C, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 189\n\nI was informed of this & requested to give the necessary information which up to the present he has not done. In his letter of the 31st Oct he states that the buildings are rapidly approaching completion & will soon be ready for occupation. The contract price for the two buildings is he says $18,500 inclusive of heating apparatus furnishings & etc etc as well. He says the entire cost of the buildings without the necessary alterations will aggregate $25,000.00 towards which the Govt has contributed in all the sum of $5,000.00. He asks that an additional sum of $5,000.00 towards the building be placed in the Estimates for the current year.\n\nJohn McLean\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\nToronto, October 31st\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that the building for the Indian Institute at Killinbach are rapidly approaching completion and will be ready for occupancy in a very short time. The contract price for these buildings was $2,000 exclusive of heating apparatus, furnishings which will take fully $400 more, also exclusive of the site which cost $250. It may be safely assumed therefore that the entire cost, even without barn & other necessary outbuildings will aggregate $2,750.\n\nToward this amount we have received two grants from the Department of $200 each or $400 in all. This is very much below the sum which we had good reason to expect especially in view of what the Department has done for other Institutes in British Columbia.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6422, file 860-1, part 1)\nColumbia. I would earnestly request, therefore, on behalf of our missionary board, that the sum of $5000 additional on building account be placed in the estimates for the current year. Even with this additional aid it will be seen that the missionary society is spending some $10000 on a work that properly belongs to the government.\n\nHoping that this request will receive favorable consideration,\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.

There was quite an extensive gathering of the natives who at the meeting held with them presented me with an address, copy of which\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs.\nwhich I inclose herewith. The complaints in reference to the restrictions placed upon them in regard to the taking of salmon and other fish, I consider not unreasonable as I certainly think that they have every right to be discontented with the provisions of the late \"Fishery Regulations for the Province of B. C.\" as in many cases, should the same be enforced, large numbers of the Indians will be deprived of the means of sustaining themselves and families which from time immemorial, they have hitherto enjoyed without question.\n\nThe destruction of sturgeon alluded to seems almost criminal in its wantonness and some steps should be effectively taken to prevent repetition of the wholesale slaughter of that valuable fish in future. On the 15th. of March Captain Gaudin, Agent of Marine and Fisheries, was notified of the destruction of these fish, and a copy of the protest sent to the Indian Agent, by the Indians of the Lower Fraser, was sent to him; the Indian Agent saw Mr. McNab on\nthe subject about the same time but still nothing was done. On the 17th. instant I wrote to Mr. McNab inclosing Mr. Devlin's report in which he stated that the Indians had threatened to take the law in their own hands, etc. and in reply received an answer, copy of which I inclose herewith, which means very little, if anything, in regard to any actual steps having been taken to prevent the same destructive methods being adopted in future, for the taking of sturgeon, as under any circumstances these fish could not be caught after the 15th. instant, and his stating that \"it is not at all likely that it will ever be resumed under conditions similar to the past\" amounts to no guarantee for the preservation of the sturgeon during the next ensuing season, when it may be again deemed lawful to adopt means for the taking of these fish certain to lead to their total extinction in the lower Fraser. The sturgeon forms a large factor in the food-supply of the Indians living in the vicinity of the lower Fraser, and the depletion of these fish from these waters mean serious loss to, and trouble\ntrouble in connection with, the Indians referred to.\n\nIn regard to the remarks in the address concerning their reserves I endeavoured to impress upon them that for many reasons it was necessary that they should, to the utmost extent within their ability, utilize such land as a means towards their own support, and also as a preparation for the maintenance in comfort of their children, etc., etc.; and assured them that their land and themselves would be looked after by the Department so long as they evinced a desire to help themselves and to profitably take advantage of the means placed within their reach by the Department through its officers. I explained that those who could pay for Doctors medicine, etc., should do so; but that when any of their number were too poor to provide necessary medical attendance or medicine the Agent would see that they did not suffer, etc. On the whole the meeting with the Indians, and the opening of the Institution passed off very satisfactorily; and the\nthe Coqualeetza Home is now one of the most complete establishments of the kind in the Province. The following description of the \"Home\" may be of interest: - \"The building, which is situated at Sardis, about two and a half miles from the town of Chilliwack, is the largest and most complete establishment of the kind in the Province. It is located in twenty acres of land, the whole of which is under cultivation, and is surrounded by beautiful scenery. The structure is of brick with three stories and basement, being 110 feet long by 62 feet in width. It has accommodation for 100 pupils, with a staff of 8 or 10 Instructors. The basement contains dairy, laundry, play-rooms, bath-rooms and furnace-rooms. The ground floor has the kitchen, pantry, dining-room for pupils and staff; sitting-room, bed-room and office for Principal; also sitting-room for lady teachers, bed-room for matron, sewing-room for girls, and reading-room for boys.

Mowat, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nTHE INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTE.\n\nFormal Opening of the School for the Training of Indian Children.\n\nThe formal opening of the Coqualeetza Industrial Institute, an institution organized by the Methodist Missionary Society took place on Thursday last noon last in the presence of a large number of visitors, the staff of the establishment, and the pupils.\n\nThe building, which is situated at Sardis, about fifteen miles from the town of Chilliwack, on a good graded road, presents a handsome appearance, standing boldly out from a broad expanse of meadow and cultivated land with a background of verdure-covered mountains. It is the largest and most complete establishment of its kind in Canada, and has received much credit upon both architect and builder. It is located in twenty acres of land, the whole of which is under cultivation, affording beautiful scenery. The building is the design of Mr. Hooper, the well-known architect, and is in every way adapted to carry out all its requirements. The structure is of brick, with three stories and basement, being 110 feet long by 62 feet in width. It has accommodation for 100 pupils, with a staff of 8 or 10 instructors. There are also kitchens, laundry, play-rooms, bath-rooms, and furnace-rooms. The ground floor has the kitchen, pantry, dining-room for pupils, sitting-room, sitting-room for teachers, and offices for principal and secretaries; the second floor contains dormitories, bed-rooms, store-rooms, and store-rooms. The third floor also contains dormitories, bed-rooms, store-rooms, and store-rooms. The establishment is heated and ventilated throughout by the \"Smad Dowd\" system, which also provides with complete sanitation and comfort; and in walking through the premises, the visitor is surprised and pleased at the order and cleanliness everywhere evident. The dormitories are lined with rows of iron cot-beds, strongly made, with woven wire mattresses, the upper end being elevated to form a pillow. On this is laid a thick felt mattress, very soft and yielding, and for covering there are good blankets.\n\nAn examination of the pupils was then conducted by Miss Smith, their teacher. The questioning was made individually, by classes, and collectively, and after each exercise the questions were also asked by calling by names, the answers being quick and correct in every case. The exercises were interspersed by familiar songs, the children, the singing as well as their answers to the questions in grammar, geography, hygiene and various subjects, proving the thorough patience that had been bestowed upon them by their teacher, Miss Smith, whose whole energy is evidently thrown into the noble task she has undertaken, and who, as also the Rev. Mr. Logan, seems to possess a thorough knowledge of the character and temperament of every pupil, and whose voice or sign is obeyed with a willing obedience, attesting the existence of that happy reliance and sympathy between teacher and pupil so necessary to successful training.\n\nAt the conclusion of the examination, Rev. Mr. Vowell, congratulating the institute, and complimenting the staff and teachers, were made by Rev. Mr. Logan and Mr. Vowell.\n\nThe building was then formally inspected by the Government officials, accompanied by the staff of the institute, all being highly pleased at the commodious and comfortable, and especially cheerful appearance of the various rooms and apartments; after which the guests were regaled with an excellent dinner, on which occasion the whole party broke up into small conversations and knots, until called together to listen to the evening's entertainment, which, after prayers offered by the Rev. Mr. Logan, consisted of several excellent speeches from Mr. Davis, Mr. Wells, Rev. Logan, Mr. Vowell, and Rev. Charles. Very interesting speeches were also made by Mr. Robinson and Rev. Mr. Robson, the latter as chairman, these gentlemen from their long residence and thorough knowledge of the census district, being found especially competent to pronounce on their advancement, and Mr. Robson, by his humorous anecdotes, giving much zest to the evening's entertainment. Rev. Mr. Talbot gave a comprehensive view of the progress of the institute, together with its cost, which, up to the present, was paid for, assisted by a liberal grant from the Government of $350. After which address was formally declar- ed open by Mr. Vowell on behalf of the\nand patchwork quilts of pretty designs. The cots were made in the central prison, Toronto, and the quilts for the most part have been supplied by ladies in the East. There is a hospital in the building, but this is isolated so as to avoid any danger.\n\nThe purpose of this institute is for the care of Indian children, and no child of Indian blood is refused admission, whatever denomination it may belong to. There are at present eighty-eight boys and 29 girls varying from little more than infancy to 15 or 16 years of age, all clean and happy-looking, and all evidently attached to their teachers.\n\nThe staff is composed of\u2014Rev. C. M. Tate, general governor; Miss Clarke, matron; Miss Smith, teacher; Miss Burpee, sewing teacher; and Mr. G. S. Pearson, farming and mechanics instructor, i.e., all whom appear to be specially adapted for the position.\n\nThe proceedings commenced at half past two o'clock in the large school-room, there being a large number of Indians, men and women and children gathered in from the surrounding settlements, all decently and neatly dressed, and seemingly much pleased at being present. Mr. A. W. Vowell, Superintendent of Indian affairs, Mr. Vanier, and Mr. Francis, the Indian agent for the district, were present; but the Lieut. Governor, who had been expected, was not present. Rev. Mr. Royton officiated by a short prayer, which was followed by an address to the Indians in their own language by the Rev. Mr. Tate, after which, on behalf of the Indians, he read the following address:\n\nA. W. VOWELL, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent:\nDear Sir,\u2014I am glad to see you very much pleased to welcome you to Chilliwack again, especially as your visit is a very necessary one, and we are all so much interested\u2014the opening of this beautiful school. We extend our thanks to the Government for the assistance rendered in the erection of this school, and the education of our children. As the white people fill up our country, we must also fill up our schools, and compete with them ever more successfully. We must educate ourselves, and succeed.\n\nBut there is another matter of which I would like to speak. The white people were here before us, by thousands, and they have been here for many generations, and it has been here before us. We have belonged to the Indians. We are glad, however, that the Government has given us land, trees, animals, birds and fish, but we are troubled when we find that in the way we have always caught them, vis.,\n\ntheir improvement, and future well-being. And he was to tell them that it was the wish of the Government who had spoken so much more kindly to them, and who had promised them such a good school, that they would all send their children there. He wished to derive the full benefit of such a good work. He was pleased to receive the thanks of the pupils, and commended the efforts of the missionaries and the Indians. In regard to the matters mentioned in the address, he must tell them that the laws were made for the general good, after due consideration. He had at various times brought the matter before the Government, and had no doubt that the Government would do what was right. The restrictions placed upon the Indians were not made for the benefit of the Indians as the white man. With the Indians, the game would become extinct. In case of any particular grievance, they should appeal to the Government, and they should forward it to the department. With reference to the killing of game, he had heard that the Indians were doing so. The destruction made by the Americans had been reported to him, and taken all steps in his power to have such destruction stopped. The agent for the reserves, the Government had in laying them out, had been careful to see that the Indians were as the Indians. But they did not expect to have a large quantity of game, whereas, the Indians did not expect them to till the land the same as white people. They did not pay attention to take some steps to utilize the land. They need not pay attention to take some steps to utilize the land. No such thing had been told so by the agent. From time to time they had been supplied with food, but it was expected that where the Indians had the means, they would provide for themselves. It takes a great deal of money to purchase all the food for the Indians each year, as the Indians are brought within the bounds of civilization. The price of flour has become very high, and stringent orders have been issued that no one shall attend an Indian without an order from the agent, except in special cases, such as when they need medicines and medical attendance. He would, however, that the Government assist them in such cases. He would know of a case where an Indian was being able to obtain assistance from a white doctor. He could lend them a hand. An Indian had applied for relief, and had been refused. He wished them to understand that he would do everything in his power for their benefit.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inquire how much was voted & the Cooperative Institute to be for the present year.\n\nI think that it is understood that the payments are to be made at this Office.\n\nOur Board will have to pass estimates shortly, hence the question.\n\nI have the honor to\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servt.\n\nC.

The number of pupils now in attendance at the Coqualeetza Institute is 65, and there would be little difficulty in bringing the number up to 100 if the Missionary Board received that encouragement from the Department to which they think they are fairly entitled. It is to be hoped that the Department will see its way to provide for not less than 50 pupils in next year's estimates.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYours Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy the Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr Daly,\n\nI submit herewith a letter from the Revd Dr Sutherland with reference to the Coqualeetza Home. The Department gave $5,000 in aid of this building, and for the current year we provided for 17 pupils at $130 each. This of course is a limited grant for such a large and efficient school. We endeavoured to provide for 30 pupils, but the item was cut down to 17.\n\nWith your authority, I will make a note for an increase to 50 pupils in next year's Estimates. The building and equipment of this school cost a very large sum, and I do not think that the department has given aid commensurate with the importance of the institution.\n\nHon T. Mayne Daly, Yours faithfully,\nSuperintendent general of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, October 10th, 1894.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant asking that provision be made in next year's Estimates for an additional number of pupils at the Coqualeetza Institute, B.C., and in reply I beg to say that I am directed by the Supt. General to inform you that an item will be inserted in next year's Estimates to provide for 60 pupils at this Institution which the Department trusts will not again be struck out as it is most anxious to have the present grant increased up to that number.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Supt.

Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria,\nB.C.\nReferring to a communication from the Department dated Oct. 16th respecting the Indian Institute at Chilliwack B.C., the necessity of increasing the number of pupils for whom a per capita grant is allowed, I have the honor to state that I recently paid a visit of inspection to the Institute in question. Although the new building had been occupied for a comparatively short time I found everything in excellent order and the work most efficiently conducted.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were eighty-one pupils in actual attendance and I was informed that a number more were applying for admission. There will be no difficulty in securing all the pupils that the building will accommodate.\nnamely one hundred or even then we shall go but a short way toward meeting the wishes of large number of Indians with regard to the education of their children. You are of course aware that in regard to cost of site, building & equipment aggregating altogether about $25,000.00, only $5,000.00 was contributed by the Indian Department so that till the present year a per capita grant was received for only ten pupils, the number for the present year being seventeen. When application was made to the Department for an additional grant on building account we were informed that whatever further was done by the Department they would prefer to do in the form of per capita grants, and that a sum for this purpose of about $5,000.\n$500 had been placed in the estimates for the then current year. Subsequently we were much surprised & disappointed to find that this sum had been cut down in Committee by more than one half of that, while doing virtually the work of the Govt. in educating these Indians, the Missionary Society was left to provide a heavy deficit to cover the necessary expenses for the year. I sincerely trust that this matter will be rectified in the present year's estimates & that in accordance with the request contained in my former letter a per capita grant for at least fifty pupils will be given.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.

It would be well, however, for you not count upon it as a certainty, as there is always some room for doubt as to whether any special grant will pass.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRevd A.

Mr Robson, Principal of the Coqualeetza Home, accompanied by a letter from Mr Agent Devlin, relative to the amount December Quarter's Grant to that Institution, whereby it was paid only $543:17 instead of $552:50 the full Grant. The reduction was made on account of one of the first 17 pupils having been dismissed on the 15th December, and having therefore, earned only $28:17 instead of $52:50.\n\nThe Grant to this Institution is paid for the first 17 pupils on the roll, according to the dates of admission as shown on the Register, and in the event of a pupil being discharged by authority (as in the case referred to) he may be immediately replaced by the pupil next in order on the roll who will earn the balance of the Grant for the Quarter, thus putting the School to no loss through the discharge of pupils.\n\nIn view of the circumstances, therefore, the balance of the Grant for December Quarter last, $4:63 will be sent you for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. A Sutherland, D.D.\nToronto\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs\n\nOnt:\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant enclosing a letter from the Rev. E. Robson, Principal of the Coqualeetsa Home, relative to a reduction made in the December Quarter's Grant to that Institution, together with a letter from Mr Agent Devlin on the same subject. In reply I beg to say that the grant to this Institution is paid for the first 17 pupils on the roll, according to the date of admission as shown by the Register, and in the event of a pupil being discharged by authority (as in the case referred to) he may be immediately replaced by the next pupil in order on the roll who will earn the balance of the Grant for the Quarter, thus putting the Institution to no loss through discharges of pupils.\n\nIn view of the circumstances, the balance of the Grant $433 will be sent Dr Sutherland on account of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nA.W.Vowell, Esq:\nIndian Supt:\nVictoria, B.C.\nBritish Columbia,\nIndian Superintendent's Office,\n\nVictoria, 18 April 1896\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit for your consideration Copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Aquilus by the Rev. E. Robson Principal of the Coqualeetza Institute complaining that a reduction was made in the last Quarter's Grant to the School in consequence of the estimate for the same being based on the attendance of the first seventeen pupils, and some of them not having attended their full time etc.\n\nI also enclose copy of Mr. Aquilus' covering letter in this connection in which he fully explains the action which he took in the matter, and I have to state that there would appear to be considerable good reasoning in the views expressed by the said complainant.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W. Howell\nIndian Superintendent\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI find that the grant from the Department for the Institute was cut down $25.00 by account of Joseph Sewell, having attended School less than the required number of days during the quarter he having been discharged from the School.\n\nNow in no event as the Government Grant, cover the expenses of over 17 pupils, and we are carrying about 30 it does seem to me that in a case like that of Sewell, we should be allowed to substitute another pupil for him as a beneficiary of the Government, for the Quarter, this we did but let us urge our\n\nCould you kindly inform me how we should have met the case as to prevent the Institute from losing its just and proper claim. We are to pay at the commencement of each term, each quarter, the names of 17 pupils, who pass out in the first term regardless of their Register number or date. That would constitute with the rule which require the Report to be a copy of the Register. The thing may and surely will happen again, that some of first of the Register shall have left during the quarter. How then pay the Report he made out so as to comply with the rules imposed, and yet secure us against unjust loss. Kindly inform me at your earliest convenience and you will greatly oblige.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Robson.\nFraser Agency.\n\nIndian Office,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\n10th April 1895.\n\nA. W. Vowell Esq.\nIndian Superintendent,\n\nVictoria.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose copy (in duplicate) of communication received from Rev. E. Robson of Coqualeetza Institute, re reduction of Government grant for absence of any of the first 17 pupils on Register during the Quarter. I have explained to Mr. Robson, verbally, that report must be made out from the Register and that the Dept. will only pay for the first 17 pupils on the Report. I feel, however, that this is scarcely fair to the Institute, and when they have such a large number of children who complete the full quarter, even one or two of those first on the list should be absent part of the time, that they should get paid the\nthe full allowance for 17 pupils. To deal justly with the Institute, so long as any 17 pupils on the Register completes the full quarter the Institute should get paid for that number and still more so when they have such a large number of pupils as are at the Coqualeetza Institute. I should have sent you copy of Mr. Robson's letter earlier only for my illness and press of work since I have been able to get around.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt. Servant,\n\n(Sgd) Frank Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., No. 120292, referring to the reported expulsion of four boys, or young men, from the Institute at Chilliwack, with copy of letters from Mr Super't Vowel and Mr Agent Devlin. As the latter two documents give the substantial facts in the case, no further explanation is necessary. I quite concur, however, in the opinion that it is not advisable to admit grown up boys into an Institute like that at Chilliwack, nor was it our intention that they should be admitted. When application was made sometime ago, through the Indian Department, to the Department of the Interior, for a block of land at Kultus Lake, our intention was to utilize it for the instruction of the older boys, and even of young men, and by retaining them permanently at that place to prevent intercourse with the pupils at the Institute proper. The land could not be secured, however, and we were obliged to abandon the project, at least for a time. Subsequently when the young men referred to in the letter sought for admission, as they were reported to be of good character, they were taken in. The experiment has not proved to be satisfactory, and I am writing to the Rev Mr Robson to guard against similar admissions in the future.\n\nThere is one practical difficulty that will always meet us in regard to this matter. In order to obtain the best results it is doubtless necessary that pupils should be received at a comparatively early age; but in order to give thorough\ntraining these pupils should remain until grown up, say till the age of eighteen years, and unless there is some other Institute to which the boys might be sent during the last two or three years of their training, we may experience similar difficulties in the future to those recently reported from the Coqualeetza Institute.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Butterland\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that the attention of the Department was called to the following paragraph which appeared in the Victoria B.C. Weekly Colonist of the 1st ultimo:\n\n\"New Westminster Feb. 23rd:\u2014Four First Simpson boys were expelled from the Chilliwack Indian School for misconduct. Having no money to return home they stole a canoe from the Reserve and came to Westminster, where they were sentenced to one month's imprisonment each.\" Mr. S. [illegible] who was asked for a report in regard to this matter states that he instructed the local Agent to make full enquiry, and as a result of such enquiry it would appear that the so-called boys are in fact young men of about 15 or 20 years of age, and much too old to be placed in a school organized and disciplined for the tuition of children of both sexes, as you will see from correspondence, copies of which are enclosed herewith.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department considers that it would be far better to obtain young children who could be properly trained and educated than to admit pupils old enough to work.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, P.D.\n\nToronto, Ont.\nwork for their living, and who in any event would only remain for a short period in the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\nIn further reference to your letter of the 9th instant relative to the four \"four Tempon boys\" mentioned in the Colonist newspaper as having been expelled from the Chilliwack Indian School, I have the honour to enclose herewith \"copy\" of a letter from Mr Agent Devlin dated 21st instant explaining the nature of the case, also \"copy\" of a letter from the Rev E. Robson to Mr Devlin dated 19th February last, stating his action in the matter.\n\nFrom the tenor of these letters it would appear that the so-called boys are in fact young men; that they behaved very badly and deserved punishment; and that they are much too old to be educated at a school organized and disciplined for the tuition of children of both sexes.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. O. Vowell\nIndian Superintendent\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nTHE B. C. INDIANS.\n\nWards of the Government and What is Being Done For Them.\n\nFew people, think we are to be found in this Province who do not take a strong interest in the Indians. They are the wards of the Government, and as such occupy a large share of the attention of those who administer the affairs of the Dominion. The Government may be located. The Indians in British Columbia are divided into three classes in those in the Territories in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. They are almost a self-supporting community, and if they would only take after and disciplined turn out to be excellent workers, they could support themselves, their families, and those who have to look to them for support. Here again, as unfortunately for the aborigines of the soil, civilization has been forced upon them, so that it might have done for poor Lo. Perceval, who died in England, where the laws of the land are proper. By proper management, surrounded with proper influences\u2014namely, by the white man's instructions with base, vile people being rigidly excluded from the country\u2014thrift and frugal the various tribes become, and the Indians are enabled to emulate the white people and their ways generally. No doubt there are some Indians liable for either good or evil, as are the whites, but they are not charged with their management, and the Indians are not expected to be continually on the alert in their behavior, as the whites are. But do the Indians themselves, and it becomes the duty of the Government to guard with esteem and veneration the men who are selected by the Government to look after their interests and welfare. We believe that his Indians are fortunate in having over them men of excellent character, principles, and habits of industry and honesty, and who are above every other consideration, and who give their care of the people committed to their charge. Such men are rare, and few, if indeed any, rarer than Mr. Vowell, who has been placed in charge of the preservation of the peace among the Indians living on the coast, or those who make their homes in the interior. This circumstance is largely owing to the fact that any grievances which may develop between the Indians are looked into by either the Superintendent or the Inspector General, or by the various agencies in this Province. When the Indians are treated fairly, the Indians have been tampered with by any means, and those who are those who, in defiance of the laws of the land, are engaged in robbing, in many instances helpless creatures, with the result that they are punished with the punishment which the law admits of being inflicted upon those who are found to be in default. Severe as the punishment may appear to be yet it is far better than death, and it is evident that many, who, soon as freed from the charge, go back to their former habits, and at once become themselves to a recollection of their former actions, and are quite prepared to hazard everything for the sake of obtaining wealth at the expense of the Indian, who, when deprived of his liberty, is no more able to control himself or his actions than a child. We will fire off a powder magazine by degrees. The imprisonment of the Indians, with a year or more imprisonment, with hard labor, might have a remedial influence, and as the law now stands, much good might be accomplished. Familiarity with the Indians and their ways, as we have indicated, will result in much good. The Government must look after and provide for the Indians, and the best way of elevating them to a higher standard of morality and physical attainment.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6422, file S60-1, part 1)\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs in this Province, A. W. Vowell, has been visiting the different tribes in this district, in order to ascertain what assistance can be given to them, and to see how they are progressing. He has visited the Squamish, the Squamish Indians, the Alchelitz, the Squamish Indians, and the Squamish Indians. The superintendent visited the tribes, and their properties range in value from $500 to $1000. The crops of potatoes, oats, peas, wheat and corn are very good, and the Indians are very industrious, especially as they were last year. The crops of last year, 1894, and the light crop of last year did not help them out much, and they are unable to supply the seed for last year in many instances. They feel that they are doing well, and the visit of Mr. Vowell, however, has encouraged them, although encouraging words he spoke to them, and they are convinced that the greatest sufferers would be enabled to get a better living by such assistance as would be deemed necessary. It may be stated that in consequence of the visit of Mr. Vowell and his agents, upon the Indians to clear their lands and improve their condition, and place them better off than they were five years ago, they have greatly increased their crops, and are looking forward this season with confidence and hope for the future, and their labors. Many of these tribes are now in a better position than they were five years ago, and are now carefully looked after that they rival the whites in all points of fitness and progress.\n\nMr. Vowell visited the Caribou Home at Sardis, in Chilliwack, which is now in charge of Rev. Mr. Wilson, who has been working with him in an efficient staff of assistants in the management of this deserving institution, which is conducted by the Wesleyan Methodists. At the time of Mr. Vowell's visit there were about 17 pupils, towards the education of whom the government department contributes a per capita sum. Mr. Vowell is certain that the Caribou Home is doing a great work for the after life of the pupils.\n\nMr. Vowell also visited the Mission, was likewise visited. Here he found 77 pupils, who are under the charge of Father Cheneau, and the larger are educated by the Sisters of Charity. They are educated in different buildings, and are given a thorough training in order to fit them for the world. Mr. Vowell demonstrated that it is better to keep the Indians in the mission schools than let them go to their relatives at home, where they are likely to be led astray by doing light work in the fields with their relatives. When permitted to visit their homes they are likely to be led astray by their fellow scholars. When away from their parents, they go back with refined ideas, and as men and women are educated, they are exposed to all influences, and soon make it evident that they are not satisfied according to modern ideas and standards. Mr. Vowell visited in order to everything surrounding them, and they are likely to have a very narrow escape from being degraded. Had it not been for the cool, bracing mountain air, and the water supplied in carrying water in the buckets supplied by the department the entire buildings would have been ruined.\nIndian Office,\nVictoria, April 16th, 1896.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith the Report of the Cequalsetza Boarding School for the Quarter ended the 31st. of March 1896 together with Requisition, in duplicate, for grant ($552.50) for the period mentioned.

I do not know whether this part of the Act applies only to British Columbia, but whether local or general I fear its application will be very embarrassing, as in many of the tribes the number of children who are of pure Indian blood is very limited.

I should think it would be best for his leave of absence for that time. The boy had a holiday last year before I came here, and was promptly returned to the institute as his father had agreed; and the latter assures me now to the same effect. This question of holidays is a vexed one with us. Every child wants a holiday each year, and the parents are continually appealing to us for the same. In many instances the probability is, the parents would not return them promptly, at the expiration of the allotted time, and we are accordingly obliged about consenting to ask for a holiday.

The above referred to circular was addressed to my predecessor, the then Principal, requesting not only the names and offices but also the salaries of the members of the staff.

I may therefore state that the salaries of the Laundry Teacher (Miss M.E. Burpee) of the Cottage School (Miss M.E. Young) were raised from $17 to $20 per month beginning with October 1896, and that the salary of Miss Seroffie (the Kindergarten teacher) was raised from $17 to $20 beginning in January of the present year.

(RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of August 25th, No.121,607, giving the amount appropriated during the fiscal year 1897-98 to the Indian Industrial Institutes and Boarding schools under our care; also inquiring in regard to managing the Coqualeetza Institute on a smaller per capita grant under certain circumstances.\n\nTouching this latter point, the time is scarcely ripe for a definite proposition. It is known to the Department that the entire cost of the Coqualeetza Institute (some $25,000) was provided for by the Missionary Society with the exception of $5000 granted by the Department. This was in such marked contrast to the treatment accorded by the Department to other denominations that it has been a standing grievance with us ever since. The request has been before the Department for a long time that the Government should re-imburse the Society for the expenditure on the Coqualeetza buildings, and thus put us upon a par with other denominations doing similar work. This is one of the points that would have to be settled before the question of a reduced per capita grant can be considered.\n\nDuring the past month I paid a visit to Coqualeetza, and made a careful inspection of the buildings and the character of the work being done. The result of this inspecting was very satisfactory. The premises are in good condition, and so far as I could judge the pupils were healthy, contented, and making\ncommendable progress in the school, and in the various industrial pursuits. The members of the staff give good evidence of being devoted to their work, and of having in a marked degree the confidence and affection of the pupils. In order to do the most effective work, however, several things are necessary. The first is a separate building, chiefly for school purposes, so that the large room now occupied for school work may be turned into a dormitory, which is very much needed; and the kindergarten room into a store room, which is also a necessity. Our proposition would be that we provide plans for the proposed building, with estimates of cost, and that when these were approved, a grant should be made to the Missionary Society, and buildings erected by us under Government inspection, and to the satisfaction of the Department.\n\nAnother thing that is very much needed is additional land. There are but 20 acres connected with the Institute, and this does not afford sufficient space for giving the older boys that training in farm work which is so essential. The 20 acres composing the present site were purchased at the rate of $125 per acre. I ascertained that additional land adjoining the present 20 acres can be obtained at a cost of $100 per acre, which is cheap as prices go in that neighborhood. These are the more pressing matters at the present time, and I trust that they will receive favorable consideration from the Department.\n\nFor sometime past nearly 100 pupils have been in attendance, and others are seeking accommodation, but cannot be admitted for want of room. Just why it is that we should receive a per capita grant for only 50 pupils while in the other Institutes in British Columbia provision is made for the full number in attendance.\nand in some case beyond that, we are quite unable to understand; but I indulge the hope that as this inequality has repeatedly been brought to the attention of the Department, it will be removed during the coming session.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honorable the Super't General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to submit for the consideration of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs some facts and figures concerning the Indian Industrial Institute at Chilliwack, B.C., and to request that provision may be made at the ensuing session of Parliament to supply the more urgent wants of the Institute at the present time. When I visited the Institute last August I found everything in admirable order, under the direction of a staff who in fidelity to their various duties, and success in their work, are not exceeded, if they are equalled, by the staff of any other institute in the country. Nearly 100 pupils were in attendance which crowded the building somewhat uncomfortably, and as additional pupils can easily be secured, the circumstances point to the need of some form of increased accommodation in the near future. Although the number of pupils is so large, the per capita grant is allowed for 50 only, which is in marked contrast to the provision made in all the other Institutes and Boarding schools in British Columbia. My first request, therefore, is that provision may be made by the approaching session for a per capita grant for not less than 80 pupils. This we are fairly entitled to, and I think the request needs only to be mentioned in order to be granted.\n\nIn conversation with the Principal, Matron, and School Teacher, I found that two things are urgently needed at the present time; first, additional land for farm purposes, and second, a separate building large enough to accommodate the two divisions.\nof the school, with one or two rooms for the sewing and dress-making department, and another for Band practice and similar purposes.\n\nRespecting land, it will be remembered that there are about 20 acres adjoining the Institute, which does not afford sufficient room for the instruction of the older boys in farm work to which many of them take very readily. When visiting the place I found that 20 acres additional could be procured from Mr Webb, from whom the present site was purchased, the price asked being $100 per acre, which is $25 per acre less than was formerly paid. There was also an offer from Mr A.C.Wells to sell 50 acres across the Luckakuk River, in the rear of the present Institute site, at the same price as is asked by Mr Webb. Since that time, however, we have learned that on the main road leading from the Institute to Chilliwack there is an excellent farm of some 90 acres, which can be secured for about $55 per acre; the owner being out of the country and desires to sell. The acquisition of this additional land we consider not only important but necessary, and trust that the Department will comply with the request.\n\nRespecting the new building; the present one, as I have said, is very crowded, but if provision were made outside for the school, sewing room, &c., the rooms at present occupied for these purposes could be turned into dormitories, and thereby greatly facilitate the work of the Institute. What we propose is the erection of a building in the rear of the present one at a distance, say of some 25 or 30 feet, consisting of two stories and a basement. The basement to contain heating apparatus, fuel room, and some storage rooms for various purposes, which are very much needed. The main floor to have accommodation for the teacher, and a separate room (but connected) for the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nKindergarten; a large room, or two small ones, for the dress-making department, and perhaps a business office for the Principal. The upper story would contain a room for the boys' band practice in cold or stormy weather; the remaining space could be utilized for various useful purposes. I would, however, suggest that we be allowed to submit plans for this building, which when approved by the Department we would undertake to erect for a specified sum. In the meantime an approximate grant could be included in the estimates.\n\nIt is perhaps unnecessary to remind the Superintendent General that the entire expense for the present building and equipment of this Institute has been borne by this Society, with the exception of $5000 which was granted in two sums by the Department, and this we think gives us exceptionally strong grounds for the requests that are now made.\n\nI am,\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCoqualeetza Industrial Institute,\nChilliwack, B.C., Dec. 1st, 1897.\n\nA.M. Vowell Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your favor of 29th Nov., ult. 616 A.S., just to hand, I regret that a series of unanticipated circumstances has prevented me from furnishing you at an earlier date with the information you desire re land and buildings needed for our Institution. We appreciate the importance which the Department attaches to instruction in farming for boys in the Industrial Institute under its care. We feel that our growing boys of whom there are so many in our Institute should be made familiar with every thing relating to the various kinds of work carried on on the farm, such as the care of horses, cows and pigs\u2014the use of farm implements\u2014ploughs, harrows, spades, hoes, rakes\u2014the tillage of the soil, the growth and management of crops\u2014harvesting, threshing and the proper care of the harvested crops both roots and cereals. With such views as these, you will understand\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC-IC, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 1)\nunderstand that we feel ourselves greatly handicapped, and quite unable to carry out the system of training which the above scheme, so briefly outlined involves. We believe it to be practicable to have the boys while under our care made as intelligent on the subject of farming as are the majority of white people who are obtaining a livelihood by this means. Our idea is that they should be made to understand how to prosecute farming so as to make it remunerative. We would have them impressed with ideas of thrift and spurred up in the direction of an ambition to acquire a competency and become qualified for citizenship; this being as I take it the goal at which the Department aims. We should like to extend our dairying department. We think this should be made a specialty, in view of the peculiar adaptation of this climate and much of the land also, for dairying purposes and because of its remunerativeness. If we had sufficient land we would have a dozen cows instead of five, as it is we have not pastureage for five. With only 20 acres our present area of land including that occupied with buildings and grounds, we are able to have only a small variety of produce or only a very small quantity of each of several varieties.\nvarieties. Our agricultural operations ought to cover a much wider extent of ground. I pointed out these things in detail to Rev. Dr. Sutherland on the occasion of his recent visit. He saw the great importance of our being possessed of more land, and as a result of some inquiries instituted for his information it was ascertained that some land adjoining our present premises could be obtained at a cost of $105.00 per acre. We could get 70 acres at this price.\n\nAnother piece of about 32 acres is offered for sale in a lump at $600.00. This land though not contiguous to our present property is near at hand and I believe is of excellent quality. But I have to make inquiry at once concerning this as to title. I have heard that there is a flaw, this may not be correct. Now as to building, in the first place the addition of a kindergarten teacher to our staff, and the introduction of that system of instruction made necessary a suitable room. The present building has no such room. The kindergarten work is being now prosecuted at a serious disadvantage. Indeed we have at present seven children who are of a suitable age for this work who cannot be accommodated.\naccommodated in the room used for this purpose besides the 31 who are being taught. Hence one of the reasons for a new building is that we may have a room sufficiently commodious and otherwise adapted to kindergarten instruction. The room now used is very much needed for other purposes. In the second place, our dormitories are well filled whereas we have on file several applications for admission on behalf of children who are proper persons to receive the instruction which it is the purpose of our Institute to impart. What we propose therefore is that in the erection of an additional building both schools\u2014the regular school and the kindergarten shall be accommodated, and that the present school room shall be utilized for dormitories.\n\nA third need to be supplied by the new building is that of a sewing department easily accessible to the public where the larger girls who shall have become proficient in housekeeping and plain sewing shall acquire the art of dress making by the practice which comes from doing custom work under a thoroughly competent Instructor. I may say here that we have advertised ourselves to the surrounding community as prepared to do dressmaking in its various branches.\nbranches, the result of which is that we have all that we can do, and are giving the very best of satisfaction. But the sewing room in which the less proficient girls are learning plain sewing, and mending as the clothes come from the laundry week by week, is inadequate for both kinds of work and unsuitable for obvious reasons for the custom's work. We will also have the custom's work department in the new building; it will have two rooms the waiting and fitting room. Then the instruction which nearly 20 of the boys are receiving in Band music and the need of almost daily practice require that they should have a suitable room for the purpose. We propose that they shall have such a room where their instruments will be kept and where during suitable hours their practices shall be enjoyed in. Again we are at a loss situated as we now are for a suitable room in which to lodge the parents of the pupils who come from a distance to visit the Institute and see their children. We propose that the new building shall supply this convenience; the basement will contain the furnace for heating the building and will also afford room for storage the need of which is now much felt. I enclose\na plan, a mere outline sketch of the proposed building sufficient to show how it may be made to serve the above indicated purposes. It would be well if we were near to an Architect who could execute a plain sketch and supply an estimate of the approximate cost. It may be that the enclosed will be sufficient for your purpose. I forwarded a plan similar to the enclosed to Rev. Dr. Sutherland who thought to have an Architect prepare suitable plans.\n\nIn case of the building being proceeded with complete plans and specifications would of course be necessary. As we have two more teachers now than when this building was first opened we have had to occupy two of the rooms as teachers rooms that were originally planned for hospitable rooms, and as we shall shortly have another teacher the remaining hospital room will have to be similarly occupied and what we now propose is a hospital ward on the second floor of the new building which could contain if necessary half a dozen beds, adjoining the hospital ward would then be a nurse's room, this important feature was overlooked in the plan sent to Dr. Sutherland but I shall write him and forward the new idea. The accompanying plan will show\nthe measurements. I should have said when speaking of the land that I am unaware of any land to be had sufficiently near for our purpose except the two pieces which I have here mentioned viz.: the 70 acres and the 90 acres.\n\nThe main school room shall have capacity for say 130 children when all are called together on occasions, as when the present school room is turned into dormitories we shall have capacity for 130 in the building. I do not know that I can add anything as to plan of building. It is the intention to have the ground floor of the new building raised up from the ground so that there will be plenty of light from the basement windows as these will be placed above the general surface level of the ground. I am quite unable to form an estimate of the cost of the building. I should have been glad to have had Mr Hooper give an estimate as he superintended the construction as well as prepared plans and specifications of the present building. If he were in Victoria and you could send the sketch forwarded herewith to his office he would willingly give you an approximate figure of cost both in Brick and Frame.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed) Joseph Hall\n\nIndian Affairs.

The land at present at disposal of the Institute is not by any means sufficient for an Institution of such dimensions, and the tracts of land mentioned in Mr. Hall's letter seem offered at a reasonable price. The accommodation afforded in the present building for the large staff and number of pupils is not up to the reasonable requirements and the new building asked for is almost a necessity.\n\nIn reference to the per capita grant I should most certainly consider that if additional land and buildings are supplied by the Department a per capita allowance of $100.00 would be ample considering that by far the greater portion of the required food-supply could be raised upon the lands of the Institute, and the clothing, boots and shoes, etc., could also be made in the establishment.\n\nWere\nWere it not that the plan of the proposed new building sent by Mr. Hall was not complete enough I should have reported immediately on receipt of his letter yesterday.\n\nI have, however, hunted up Mr. Hooper and he has promised to supply me with a more comprehensive plan and also with an approximate estimate cost of building, etc. which when I receive shall be duly forwarded.\n\nAs it is uncertain when I may receive the latter I send Mr. Hall's letter and my report on at once.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 23rd ultimo making certain requests in connection with the Coqualeetza Institute at Chilliwack B.C., I beg to remind you that in a letter of the 3rd December last you made similar requests, and your letter having been submitted to the Superintendent General, you were informed in reply that provision had been made in the Estimates for 60 pupils at the Coqualeetza Institute and that, in the event of the item passing, the full amount would be paid from the 1st of July next, and that it was hoped that this increased allowance would assist in making necessary changes in the school, but that the Superintendent General regretted that he could not make any special grant for the objects mentioned in your letter.\n\nI may add that the Department has refused the claims of other Industrial schools equally entitled to consideration, for somewhat similar grants, and it does not see its way, therefore, to alter the decision already conveyed to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Smart, Esq.,\nDeputy Super-General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn pursuance of our conversation a few days ago I enclose herewith a memorandum indicating where we earnestly desire the customary aid from the Department in prosecuting our educational work among the Indians. I have the more confidence in bringing these matters to your notice because from our conversation the other day I observed that the policy that you would like to see followed regarding educational work among the Indians is almost identical with what I have been urging for years past. When you have read the memo you will probably think our requests somewhat numerous. While I can conscientiously say that the needs in all cases are great, and work important, I suppose for the Department to undertake so many things at the one time would be difficult if not impossible. Permit me to say, therefore, that among the objects named the most important and pressing are the beginning at Hug-wil-get, additional accommodation at Coqualeetza, enlargement at Morley (already provided for in part), a boarding school at Whitefish Lake or vicinity, and an boarding school & hospital work at Norway House. I could say a great deal to show the reasonableness of the requests.\nwe are making, but I take it for granted that this is not necessary.\n\nWith respect to the enclosed memorandum, you are quite at liberty, should you think it advisable, to treat it as a private communication. On the other hand, if you should think it best that it should go among the official correspondence of the Department, I am quite contented. If it is thought advisable I can write also to the Superintendent General, but will await a reply from you before doing so.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nA. Sutherland\nSir,\n\nReferring to our conversation in your Office on the 24th inst., I beg to submit a brief memorandum on the more important points, trusting that they will have your serious and favorable consideration.\n\nAs to the Coqualeetza Institute at Chilliwack, B.C., I beg to remind you that the entire expense of providing buildings and equipment was borne by the Missionary Society. It appeared that we had to do this or go without an Institute altogether, and in this respect the treatment was in marked contrast with that accorded to other Missionary Societies and Churches for whom buildings and equipment were provided by the Government. The only help received toward the original cost consisted of two grants from the Department of $2500 each, which exactly represents what we had to pay for the 20 acres of land upon which the buildings stand. Then after a length of time we received a per capita grant for only 10 pupils, at a time when more than 50 were in attendance; afterwards it was increased to a grant for 17 pupils, and ultimately within the past year or two a grant for 50, although fully 100 were in attendance. Here again is a marked discrimination, for I find from the Departmental Blue Book from the report of the Auditor General, that in the case of other Indian Institutes in British Columbia a per capita provision has been regularly voted by Parliament sometimes for a larger number than is...\nactually in attendance, although I presume that payments were made only for those who did actually attend. The crowded state of the building at Coqualeetza embarrasses the work, and has, indeed, an element of danger. What we very much desire is the following:\n\n1. That the Department will supply us with additional land, either by purchase or rental, so that we may have room enough to give the older boys the training in farm work which is so essential. I am informed that a farm of about 90 acres, half a mile or so from the Institute, can be purchased from a non-resident at about $55 per acre, which is only about half the price usually asked for land in the Chilliwack valley.\n\n2. The erection of a building near the present Institute to furnish accommodation for the school work proper, that is, for the Kindergarten department and the advanced classes; also room enough for the Sewing Teacher and Dressmaker and her pupils, with perhaps an Office for the Principal. What we would propose is that we send you a rough sketch of the accommodation that is needed, and when plans are approved by the Department, a sum be voted for the cost of the buildings.\n\n3. A per capita grant for 80 pupils instead of 50 as at present. As we have stated, fully 100 pupils are in attendance, of whom I believe 90 per cent are Indians within the meaning of the Act.\n\n4. A beginning of Institute work at Hue-wil-get, on the\nUpper Skeena we deem very important, and Boarding school work at Bella Bella, and at a point on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, is almost equally important. At Hug-wil-get we have land already secured, and some improvements made.\n\n5. McDougall Orphanage, at Morley, N.W.T.\u2014I am informed that there is a grant of $2000 available towards the enlargement of the building. The Indians are very averse to sending their children while they are so huddled together in the present limited space. In this case also, if the Department approves, we would furnish rough sketch of enlargement required, and proceed in the way suggested with reference to Coqualeetza. At Morley it will also be necessary for a house to be erected for the Principal. It is under contemplation to appoint Mr Stewart, who is now Principal's assistant at Bredon and if he, or any other man with a family, is appointed, a separate house would seem to be a necessity.\n\n6. Boarding Schools.\u2014There are three points in the North-West where boarding schools, from our point of view, are urgently needed; First, at Battle River, in Samson's Band; Second, Whitefish Lake, or between Whitefish Lake and Saddle Lake, in connection with Pakan's Band; Third, At Norway House as a centre from which quite a number of Bands can be reached. At these points the expenditure need not be very large. In each case probably $2000 would provide a building large enough to begin with. At Norway House, we are very desirous of institut-\ning medical and hospital work, and if the necessary buildings and outfittare provided for by the Government, I think that we can provide the Doctor and the Nurses. Of the vast importance of work of this kind among the Indians I need not speak, and perhaps there is no other centre from which so many can be reached as at Norway House.\n\nCommending these various matters to your kind and favorable consideration, I am,\n\nSir,\n\nYours Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Butterland\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy the Super't General of Indian Affairs\nI have the honor to forward herewith the Report for the Coqualeetza Boarding School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1897, together with Requisition, in Duplicate, for grant ($1625.00) for the period mentioned.\n\nThe address to which the cheque in payment is to be sent is given on the Requisition.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\n\nVictoria, October 26th 1898.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to inform you that I am in receipt of a letter dated the 24th instant from Mr. Agent Devlin wherein he states that he is advised by the Reverend Joseph Hall, Principal of the Coqualeetza Institute, that the Indian Department has notified the General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society at Toronto that the grant in aid of this Institution has been increased from 50 to 80 pupils at the usual per capita allowance of $130.00 per annum. In this connection I would refer you to my letter of the 7th of December last, No. 730. A. 3. in answer to your communication of the 25th of August previous, File No. 121,607 and would now ask if it is the desire of the Department that the additional\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nadditional sum of $3900.00 per annum be allowed provided such amount be earned by the Institution as shown by the Reports of the School which are forwarded to the Department from this office at the close of each quarter in the year?\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt. Servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\nOttawa, 22nd July, 1908.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th instant, making enquiry as to the provision made by Parliament for the Coqualeetza Home, Chilliwack, B.C., during the fiscal year just entered upon, I am directed to say that the sum of $10,400 has been voted to provide for 60 pupils at $130 per capita, and the school is therefore now at liberty to proceed on this basis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto,\nOntario.\nTHE SECRETARY.\n\nWith reference to the letter hereunder from the Rev. Dr. Sutherland, asking whether the item for provision for 80 pupils at the Coqualeetza Institute, Chilliwack, B. C., was voted by Parliament at its recent Session, and if so, whether the Methodist Church is at liberty to proceed on the new basis, I beg to say that the sum of $10,400, to provide for 80 pupils at $130 per capita, has been voted for 1898-99; and as the Rev. Dr. Sutherland was informed, by direction of the Superintendent General, on the 14th January last that, if the item passed, the full amount would be paid from the 1st July instant, he ought now to be advised accordingly.\nSir,\n\nIn a letter from the Department, dated April 6th, No. 120292, it was intimated that provision would be made in the estimates for the year beginning July 1st, 1898, for 80 pupils at the Coqualeetza Institute, Chilliwack, B.C. Will you be good enough to inform me if the item was voted by Parliament, and if we are at liberty to proceed on this new basis for the year.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., No.120292, stating that provision has been made in the estimates for 80 pupils at the Coqualeetza Institute. I sincerely trust that on this occasion the item will be passed, and that it will not be dropped from the estimates, as was done with a similar item on several former occasions. Permit me to say that this increase in the number of pupils will not provide either for the additional land asked for, or for the building for school purposes, but will barely provide for maintenance and management, for which this year a considerable sum has been paid by the Missionary Society.\n\nWith reference to the statement that \"the Department has refused the claims of other Indian schools entitled to be considered for somewhat similar matters\", permit me to say that I think there is some misapprehension upon this point. We have asked for consideration because in all other cases land, buildings, and equipment have been provided by the Government, while in our case we were obliged to erect the buildings at our own expense, or be without them altogether. We are simply asking for such consideration as will put us somewhere within sight of what has been done in the case of similar Institutions controlled by other denominations.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary of the Indian Department,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 5th November, 1898\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to the amount of the per capita grant to be paid the Coqualeetza Home this year; and in reply I beg to say that it has been decided to pay for the 30 pupils provided for at $130 per capita, and the amount of the requisition forwarded by you for the September quarter grant has accordingly been raised to $2338.10.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith an extract from a letter from the Rev J. Hall, Principal of the Coqualeetza Institute, reporting the success of the pupils at the annual Shows at Chilliwack and New Westminster. I feel sure that this information will be as gratifying to the Department as it is to us.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Sutherland,\nGeneral Secretary.\nExtract of a letter from the Rev Joseph Hall, Principal of the Coqualeetza Institute, Chilliwack, B.C., dated October 20th 1896.\n\n\"We have had our Annual Shows at Chilliwack and New Westminster. We obtained 24 prizes at Chilliwack; 18 in the girls' department, and 6 in the boy's. The girls' work consisted of sewing, plain and fancy, knitting, darning, and mending. The sewing included also dressmaking. In all this the girls gave a good account of themselves. Their work was universally admired, as indeed it deserved to be. The girls' work secured 13 first prizes, and 5 second. It is to be remembered that the competition was against white girls and women. Some of the latter regarded themselves as experts in the lines in which they exhibited, but were fairly beaten by our pupils. In the vegetable department we won 2 first, and 4 second prizes. At the New Westminster Show we had to try our mettle as against the Institutional schools. Five schools entered. We came out ahead again; William's Lake being second, and Kamloops third. Our exhibit was greatly admired by visitors. Every department was represented. For our baking exhibit, it was necessary for the girls to be up at 1-30 o'clock on Monday morning, as the articles had to be down that morning at New Westminster, and the boat left the Chilliwack landing at 7 o'clock, and we must leave the Institute at 6 o'clock. But the bread, biscuits, cookies, ginger cakes, and layer cakes, are all ready and boxed up for the boat when the hour for leaving arrived. The Kindergarteners, too, had their handy work in. Ours is the only school in the country that has a Kindergarten department. Then the sewing work and fancy work showed up well.\"\nA girl's cloak, cut, fitted and made throughout, by one of our girls for the occasion, showed what our dressmaking department is accomplishing for the girls. It was critically examined by many lady visitors, who expressed their surprise and delight, to know that the work was so excellently done. A child's dress by another of the girls won equal commendation. A large display of vegetables, cultivated by the boys from ten to 16 years of age, did great credit to them.\n\n\"There was great rejoicing in our Institute when the news of our success reached it; and of course when I came home I had to supply a large amount of details respecting the affair as possible.\"\nMy Grand Daughter's Indians Agent\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of 15 January, stating you received a letter from Mr. McAllen signed by me, and that you want my evidence and proof about my complaint to Mr. McAllen, that I complain the two teachers badly used my Grandchild. Badly used, the answer is by leaving blue marks up on the arm. I saw three marks on my Grandchild's arm; then she told me that is not the only place Miss Campbell whipped me. She whipped me across the back and I almost fainted. But the teacher made her stand up in the first floor for two hours and moved her up stairs until stood for three hours and her legs were swollen from fatigue. And the teacher locked her in a room upstairs, that is what I call badly used; locking her up in a room all day Sunday with one piece of bread and one cup of cold water. The reason why Miss Campbell whipped my Grand Child was for leaving a cottonwood boot. The answer why we are treated like a dog. On Friday the 5th January I went Mr. Pearson home in Jack Wilson's house and had his card, and he signed a warrant and jumped at my Grandchild and commenced dragging my Grand Child over the floor, that is what I call using my Grand Child like a dog. The White man knows how to read, but we Indians do not know how to read and write or understand the law, but do not know when we break the law. You see Mr. Pearson did not tell anyone what he was going to do until after my daughter interfered and then Mr. Pearson told me just before that he could put her [illegible] in jail, then we found out that my daughter had broken the law, not until it was too late. He told me, he could you call that treating the poor Indian right. If we were up in the same class as the White people, we would not say that Mr. Pearson was treating us like a dog.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Allen, and bearing the signatures of Jack Usilick, James Usilick, Fred Usilick, and Mrs. Jack Usilick; in which are certain complaints made as to the treatment which the children of the Institute receive at the hands of the teachers. It is alleged that they are abused; that it is for this reason that they run away; that the Indians are used like dogs. This last complaint does not seem to be used against the Institute, nor to refer to the treatment of the children, but of the adult Indians, as it is immediately added apparently by way of explanation that they do not understand the law like the white man. It is further stated that Jack Usilick is in jail for keeping his child from school; and that Mr. Pearson went to Jack Usilick's home and ran in without warning; that he grabbed hold of the girl, and was going to run out of the house with her like a dog. It is claimed that this is not using the Indians right. Rev. Mr. Allen is appealed to for assistance if he can render any; and it is implied that it is the wish of the appellants that the Indian Department shall be advised of their grievances.\n\nYou desire that I explain in Triplicate for the information of the Department whether...\ngrounds for the assertions which the above named Indians make in their letter of complaint; also whether Mr Pearson acted in the manner described; and that I should report all circumstances fully, and with as little delay as possible.\n\nThe letter of the Indians, then, first, prefers a general charge of abuse of the children in the Institute. To this general charge, of course, only a general denial can be given; and this denial I now give; I deny most emphatically and unequivocally that the children of our Institute are abused by their teachers. The children do receive chastisements varying according to the nature of the offences which they commit. Corporal punishment is occasionally resorted to, but always with reluctance, and when other means fail to bring the refractory into submission to the authority of the teachers. I am happy to say that instances of insubordination are very infrequent indeed, and generally very readily conquered. Besides, we have occasionally an instance of unusual culpability which has to be corrected by suitable severity. But in no instance has any child received treatment which could be properly called abuse. No bruises are ever inflicted, and always justice is tempered with mercy; usually the pupil is reasoned with and shown how impossible it is that the offence committed can be allowed to go unpunished. Upon the general charge I have I think said all that is necessary. If any specific instance of wrong treatment is adduced I shall be prepared to deal with it. Instances do occur as in other similar institutions of pupils running away. I will not say that in no instance has any runaway given it as one of the reasons for his doing so that he did\nnot like the treatment he had received; but I will say that so far as my knowledge goes, very seldom is this reason assigned, and when it is given it will generally be found that the pupil assigned it in hope of being thereby justified in the eyes of others for taking this step, although this reason is not the real one for his running away. The restraints of discipline in study and work in many instances they may not like; to roam about in idleness, riding about on horseback at their pleasure, gallopping about from place to place and occupying themselves in unprofitable amusements they may prefer; but that any pupil ever had a reason for running away in his having received abuse or wrong treatment in the Home I must most emphatically deny. As in the previously considered general charge this is all that I can do. Let one particular charge be preferred and it shall be dealt with on its merits.\n\nAs to the assertion that Jack Usilick is in jail for keeping his child from school, I cannot understand how such a statement could possibly be made. I wonder how Jack Usilick's name came to be subscribed to such an unblushing falsehood. Was Jack's name signed to it without his knowledge? In this case the falsehood would not be his. He must at the time this letter was written have received his sentence. He must have had his trial, at which I am informed, Mr Indian Agent Devlin and Mr Stipendiary Magistrate Pelly presided. Every one in the court room must have known that he was committed to jail for being drunk and for beating his wife. The presiding magistrates would not allow the case to proceed without the prisoner being\nadvised of the offence with which he was charged, and opportunity being afforded him to make his defence and to adduce any testimony he might wish to offer on his own behalf. Neither would sentence be imposed without the nature of the offence being enlarged upon, and the justice of the penalty being pointed out. Thus the assertion of the letter is utterly foundationless and inexcusable.\n\nI come now to the last point viz: concerning Mr Pearson.\n\nOn Friday Ev'g Jan. 5th, Jack Usilick's daughter having been away from the Institute nearly a week, Mr Pearson went to bring her back. He found her in her father's house. Mr Pearson does not remember whether he knocked at the door or not. Several people were in the house, and no objection was made to his entering. He explained his errand, stating that Mr Indian Agent Devlin had sent him for Charlotte. Mr Pearson told her to put on her things, meaning her hat, jacket &c. She did not attempt to get ready. He told her that if she did not put on her things she must go as she was. He then took her by the hand and drew her arm under his much as a gentleman and lady walk arm in arm, and told her to come along. Her mother then interfered, placing her hands upon Mr Pearson by way of preventing him from going forward with Charlotte. He warned her that she should not do that. Two American Indians who were present also stepped up and interfered to prevent Mr Pearson taking Charlotte away. As Mr P. was alone he released his hold upon the girl and withdrew, returning next day with help. But the girl has just told me that Mr Pearson was not in the least harsh nor rude, and that\nif any one says that he was they say what is not true,\nI do not think that I can say more. I am prepared to\nmeet all or any accusations or charges that may be\nbrought forward, by whomsoever they may be made.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nMy dear Mr Devlin,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, 21st November, 1898.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing an extract from a letter written by the Principal of the Coqualeetza Institute, in regard to the success of the pupils under his charge at the annual exhibitions at Chilliwack and New Westminster.\n\nThe Department is much pleased to learn that the school has acquitted itself so creditably.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, B.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, Ontario.\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to state to you that we the Indians of Penetanguishene and Res are very at heart by the way our children are used or treated by teachers of the Cogswell's Home. Regarding the children, Mr. Allen was very thankful for your advice on this case. Can we defend our children from being abused or in any way to protect our children? Why would not consider why the children are among the house told Mr. Devlin about the matter but he would not listen to us. Also the Indian Dept of Canada which we do not understand why we are Indians and do not understand the fact like the white man. You say just believe it is in fact for keeping his child from school. On the same day Mr. Pearce went to Mr. Devlin's house and ran him without giving warning, and grabbed hold of the girl and was going to pull out of the house with her into a dog. How would you say that is treating the Indians right. We beg of you to assist us if it is in your power that is by sending out at the Indian Department of Canada.\n\nWe are,\n\nJacob Heydenick,\nJames Heydenick,\nFred Heydenick,\nMichael Molson.\nSir,\n\nI have received your letter and contents asked me if I am pleased to get your letter back that you want my evidence. I cannot say anything worse than I said before. You will see by Father and Sisters letter, I was told by my Sister and the two young men, the way Mr. Macdonald treated my niece by dragging her over the floor without saying a word or warning. Nothing more than to your death. I seen Mr. Macdonald and told him why did he not tell my Jack Weyaliet that Mr. Macdonald told you to tell, and he said he did but no one prove that he did not and he said he did. That is what I call using my niece bad and my Sister, and in answer to what you wrote me or us to by going to the School, and seeing our children and having them write for us. In the first place the girl would be afraid to write for us. And, 2nd, Mr. Hall would not permit us in. That is our thing here because they would not let Charity Wesley, or James Weyaliet or not even open the door to go and see them.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFred Weyaliet\nJanuary 22nd 1900\n\nMr. Berlin Indian Agent,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to let you know that we went to the Squakutza Home the last two Saturdays to get our children back as usual but to our surprise we were shut out and no reason given to show why they would not allow us to enter there. We then better turn our children out and then I will not bother them. Miss Burpee and Miss Allan would not let us have the children, too much that Mr. Reid and the teacher get out of the Squakutza Home and get a new set of teachers and principal and it is the work of a good many.\n\nWe Remain,\n\nJames Neyabick.\n\nCharley Smiley.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose Copy of letter addressed to Rev. Mr. Allen and signed by Jacob Nogalak and James Nogalak. I beg to state that Rev. Mr. Allen is the Rector in charge of the Episcopal Church at Chilliwack and also signer of the letter as four Indians residing on Beachton Reserve. Rev. Mr. Allen handed the letter to me in the Court House at Chilliwack on the 6th Inst., explaining that personally he knew nothing whatever about the matter that the Indians had brought him the letter and knowing that I was in Chilliwack thought it best to hand the letter to me so that it might be investigated. I accordingly sent copy of letter to Rev. Joseph Hulbert, Principal of Squamish Institute, requesting him to explain for the information of the Department whether there were any grounds for such complaint, and beg to enclose his reply. I also wrote to the four Indians requesting them to furnish proofs in connection of their statement complaining of their being not the work of the Department, that any child should be harshly punished at school, but that sometimes some found children discontented and attentive to their business, and that it was necessary that such child should be made to understand that if they were disobedient or neglectful that they would be punished. Enclose Copy of their replies to this letter. These complaints have arisen through the daughter of Jacob Nogalak having been allowed\n\nIndian Affairs.

He found a chance to progress at the house the Father and Mother both drunk, and quite a number of other Indians present who caught hold of Mr. McPhearson and prevented him from taking the girl back to School. Mr. McPhearson also found another Runaway pupil at this house and was not permitted to bring her back either. On my arrival at Chilliwack a couple of days later I met Mr. McPhearson and found out that he had been imprisoned with H.L. for being drunk and for refusing to tell who supplied him with the liquor. Mr. McPhearson also Charles an Indian woman to pay a fine of six and eight for interfering with Mr. McPhearson in the execution of his duty in taking these girls back to School. I believe that complaints against the School Authorities are not worthy of mention and are simply an excuse to get their children out of School. If anything the Principal and Staff are too kind to them.\n\nThe pupils were returned to the School on the 6th June before\n\nCpt. Chilhowee\n\nIndian Superintendent Victoria\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 1C, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, 27th October, 1905.\n\nReverend Sir:-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th inst., calling the Department's attention to an unavoidable deficit of $1000.00 which has occurred during the past year in carrying on the Coqualeetza Institute. You attribute this deficit to embarrassing regulations:\n\nFirst: - The strict application of the rule of discharge of pupils who have reached the age of 18 years. With regard to this rule I beg to say that greater latitude has been allowed the Coqualeetza Institute than to any other school for discharge. The last return shows that there were eleven pupils who had reached the age limit of 18 in attendance at this school, 5 of whom were 18 years old and 6, 19.\n\nSecond: - As to the payment of only half the per capita grant for pupils under ten years of age, I beg to say that this rule is applicable to all the industrial schools and the Department does not consider it advisable to change it, as it would only lead to filling up the schools with very young children instead of those of an age to benefit by the industrial school training given at these institutions.\n\nThird: - The Department cannot pay the per capita grant\n\nRev. A. Sutherland,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, Ont.\ngrant for more pupils than the number authorized, so being the limit at this school. I may add that this number is 30 in excess of the number allowed in all the other industrial schools in British Columbia with the exception of Nisibin, which has 60 pupils allowed for, so at the full per capita rate and the remaining 30 (girls) are only paid for at the rate of $100.00 each.\n\nThe last return shows that there were seven pupils for whom no grant was claimed and in a note the Principal states that they are non-Indians and are educated at the Institute by permission of the Methodist Missionary Society.\n\nWith regard to your statement that this limitation is all the more noticeable because in the case of other schools in British Columbia provision is annually made as shown by the blue-books for a larger number than are actually in attendance, while in the case of Coqualeetza provision is for a less number than are actually in attendance.\n\nI beg to say that with the exception of the schools at Alert Bay and Lytton the attendance at the schools is in excess of the number provided for, and Lytton has only been lately established and has provision for 40 pupils, which number will shortly be reached at the rate at which they are being recruited.\n\nAs to your suggestion that there should not be a rigid application of the age limit, I may say, as before stated, that this rule has not been rigidly enforced in this school in the past, but there must be some fixed age for the discharge of pupils and 16 is considered the most suitable.\n\nThere have been 269 pupils discharged from this Institute, 55 of whom are now dead, which is over 20 per cent. This is an exceptionally high death rate and it is questionable\nquestionable whether long residence in school has not something to do with it.\n\nAs regards your second suggestion I may say that the Department cannot pay for more than 60 pupils under any circumstances and the way to ensure the drawing of the full grant will be to keep pupils over the age of 10 years.\n\nThe financial statement of this Institution supplied by our Inspector shows the total receipts were $11,931.79, while the expenditure amounted to $12,344.75, leaving a deficit of $1,412.96. This deficit will be more than wiped out when the grant for the Principal's residence is paid. It will be difficult to avoid a deficit if the authorized number is exceeded to any extent and the Principal should govern himself accordingly. The School would be on a good paying basis if he would restrict himself to the authorized number of pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSTEWART\n\nAsst.

The strict application of the rule to discharge pupils who have passed the age of eighteen years.\n2. The payment of only half per capita rates for pupils under ten years of age.\n3. The strict limitation of pupils claiming per capita grant to eighty in number, while at another of them, during the year, the number runs up to nearly two hundred.\n\nThis is all the more noticeable because in the case of other schools in British Columbia, provisions are usually made, as shown by the blue-books, for a larger number than are actually in attendance, while in the case of Regulation the provision is for a less number than are actually in attendance.\n\nIn order to avoid this inequality, and to enable the Principal to carry on the Institution without embarrassing deficits, I would respectfully suggest:\n\n1. That there should not be a rigid application of the age limit, and this I suggest also for the sake of the\npupils themselves. Some of them would be very greatly benefited by a longer stay in the school.\n\n2 - That the Principal be allowed to claim per capita for more than eighty with the proviso that the aggregate amount does not exceed the ten thousand four hundred dollars allowed for eighty pupils between the ages of ten and eighteen.\n\nI would also respectfully suggest that the Superintendent General consider the unavoidable deficit of the past year with a view of affording us some relief.\n\nI have the honor, Sir to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I may quote in this respect the Kuper Island and Clayoquot Industrial Schools and the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School.\n\nShould such consideration meet with the approval of the Department the schools last mentioned are, I consider, deserving of an increased grant, and in conclusion I may remind the Department that the Kuper Island Industrial School has twice applied for such consideration, see my letter of 6th September last, No. 601 Z-4, and previous correspondence.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs,\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. Rowell, K. C., of Toronto, is preparing the legal document that I was asked for when I was in Ottawa a few weeks ago. He will mail it to you in a day or two.

What the Church requests is simply the assurance that the Government will meet the expense of the new addition, and in the meantime, the Church will put up the money.

A spirit of unity and a homelike atmosphere pervades the school which cannot help but have an influence for good on the children.\n\nThe Principal is doing good work and is a very valuable man; he appears to be the right man in the right place.\n\nHis present salary does not seem quite sufficient remuneration for a man of his standing and experience. As a recognition, therefore, of his ability and success, I would suggest that his salary be increased to $750.00.\n\nThough a layman, he emphasizes the side of religious instruction, and the children, when subjected to a close examination, manifested an intimate knowledge of biblical and moral truth.\n\nWhile a few criticisms have been set forth in this report, I feel that it is a pleasure for me to state that the whole institution is well managed and doing good work, and its influence will be a strong factor in fitting the children for life's duties.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Harris\nREPORT OF THE COQUALNETZA INSTITUTE\nFOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30th., 1907.\n\nBUILDINGS\n\n1. The Main Building is a fine three storey brick with basement.\n2. Principal's Residence: This is a good substantial, well built two storey with basement.\n3. Farmers' Home: A nice comfortable cottage.\n4. Barn: 56 by 46, which comprises a horse stable with room for eight horses, drive shed, apple cellar and cow.\n5. New Henry: 32 by 16.\n6. Cow Stable: 56 by 30, accommodation for 30 cows\n7. Granary: 30 by 20\n8. Work Shop: 16 x 12\n9. Bake Shop: 16 by 12\n10. New Open Shed: 40 by 20, with good shingle roof.\n11. Barn, 60 x 60. This is in the centre of farm and used for storing hay and grain crop.\n\nThe most of these buildings are in a fair state of repair and answer the purpose intended.\n\nFARM AND GARDEN:\n\nThis consists of about 90 acres of good rich land well adapted for agriculture and gardening.\nThe crops are as follows:\n\n25 acres of grain\n30 \" \" hay\n14 \" \" roots, garden fruit and orchard.\n20 \" for building grounds and pasture\n\nThe crops are looking well and the outlook is for average crops.\n\nThe Chilliwack valley is beautifully situated and well adapted for fruit, orchards, gardens and farms, and this farm can be utilized for training these boys for farmers, gardeners and stock men.\n\nThe lack of neatness and finish around the stables and fields gives the impression that the farmer fails in making his Department the object lesson that it ought to be as a training school for Indian boys.\n\nHe has been here only a few months, yet it is a question if he is the right man for the position.\n\n**LIVE STOCK:** There are 6 horses, two work teams, a driving horse and a pony. Two of the work horses are nearly used up, one in the wind and the other by age.\n\n21 head of cattle, mostly milking stock (with quite a strain of Jersey) prove to be a good asset to the Institution, and 50 hens and 13 pigs make up the live stock.\n\n**STAFF:** The Staff and Salaries paid are as follows:\n\nPrincipal R. H. Cairns, $600. House, food, fuel & light\nFarmer, Chas. Reid, $600. House and Garden\nCarpenter Louis V. Masters, $400. Board and washing.\nMatron Miss F. M. Kinley $300.

Jeffries 240. \"\nBand Master R. Marshall 180. \"\n\nThe building is kept neat and clean and excellent work is done in the laundry, kitchen and sewing-room.\n\n**CLASS ROOMS:** In the School Room Department I found two teachers doing excellent work in the most approved methods.\n\nThe children were bright and evinced a keen interest in their studies, and their standing is above the average usually found in such schools.\n\nThey are classified as follows:\n\n| Standard | Pupils |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1        | 37     |\n| 2        | 10     |\n| 3        | 20     |\n| 4        | 15     |\n| 5        | 4      |\n| 6        | 6      |\n\n34 of these are classed as good and 56 fair.\n\n**HEATING & VENTILATION:**\n\nThe Smead Dowd system is in use and gives excellent satisfaction when properly handled, with probably the exception of heating a few of the smaller rooms, at strategic points in...\nextreme weather.\n\nThe system provides for the heating and use of the air but once, and in a climate no colder than that of the Chilliwack Valley, no better ventilation need be looked for\u2014pure fresh air pouring into the building as fast as the furnace can heat it.\n\n**PUPILS:** There was an average attendance of 83 during the year. 11 of these are under ten.\n\n7 were in attendance for whom no grant was received, these having been brought from homes not on Indian Reserves.\n\nThey are bright, happy and contented.\n\nTheir general health has been good. Two have been sent home on account of ill health; one of these died and the other is not improving. At present pupil No. 183 is not in good health and the Dr. advises that he be sent home.\n\n**FINANCIAL:** The books and accounts are all kept in a good business manner. All accounts are paid at the end of each and every month.\n\nI made a careful audit and following is a statement of the receipts and expenditures:\n\n| Receipts          |       |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| Balance in Bank July 1st, '06 | $145.72 |\n| Mission Rooms     | 9000.00 |\n| Farm Produce, etc.| 2190.01 |\n\n| Expenditure      |       |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| Salaries          | $3608.75 |\n| Clothing          | 1414.32 |\n| Food              | 3509.72 |\n| Item                        | Amount   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|\n| Forward                     | $8,622.79|\n| Fuel and Light              | 291.70   |\n| Buildings and Repairs       | 685.25   |\n| House Equipment             | 585.00   |\n| Farm & Garden               | 315.25   |\n| Travelling, freight, etc.   | 265.62   |\n| Miscellaneous               | 532.63   |\n| Balance in Bank             | 137.49   |\n\n**Total:** $11,335.75\n\n---\n\n**NEEDED REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS:**\n\nThe buildings lost by fire in December last have not been rebuilt. One of the girls' dormitories is being used for a primary school room, and the loss of the buildings have cramped the room and comfort in other departments.\n\nThe work of reconstruction ought to be decided at as early a date as possible.\n\nThe main building is in great need of new ewe troughs.\n\nThere is a four inch water pipe with 80 lb. pressure within 135 feet of the main building. This ought to be brought on the premises, and at least two hydrants placed at convenient points with hose sufficient to protect the main building and Principal's residence from fire.\n\nA new range is required in the kitchen.\n\nThe dormitories should have 100 quilts and 100 blankets.\n\nThe furnishings of the private rooms and some other portions are hardly up to the average of the Institutions throughout.\nThe Methodist Church.\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT.\n\nToronto, Aug. 22nd, 1907.\n\nDictated - Dr. S.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received from Rev.

These two buildings cost about $440, $400 of which was met by special grant and the balance was paid out of current expenditure.\n\nTwo tent dormitories have been well built by the special grant of $407 from the Government. These have good floors, shingled roof, chimneys and canvas sides, which can be kept open.\n\nThe boys' dormitory is 45 ft. by 16 ft. and has accommodation for 18 boys.\n\nThe girls have not yet occupied their's as a dormitory. It has been used as the Primary school room. These buildings cannot be surpassed in the British Columbia climate for comfort, fresh air, and sanitary conditions.\n\nA bath-room has been fitted up for the lady members of the staff, at a cost of $100.\n\nFARM AND GARDEN.\n\nThe farm and garden are looking well. There will be abundance of fruit and garden produce, and the average of the entire crop will be the largest yield in five years.\n\nCLASS ROOM.\n\nThe usual work of the Class Rooms has been well maintained by the teachers, who are energetic and up-to-date in their methods.\n\nINDUSTRIAL WORK.\n\nThe girls are receiving a training in the work of the kitchen, laundry, sewing room, and general house keeping; and the boys on the farm, garden and in the workshop.\n\nTHE PUPILS.\n\nThere are 90 pupils on the roll, 80 of them being present, the others being out on holiday,\u2014are expected in the near future. They are all well fed and clothed, and appear to be in good health.\n\nSTAFF.\n\nThe staff and salaries paid is as follows:\u2014\n\n| Position     | Name          | Salary |\n|--------------|---------------|--------|\n| Principal    | R. H. Cairns  | $600   |\n| Farmer       | Charles Reid  | \"      |\n| Gardener     | L. V. Masters | \"      |\n| Fireman      | Mr. Figgins   | \"      |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Chamberlin, \" 240\nSeamstress, Mrs. Jeffries, \" 240\nTeacher, Mrs. Pitman, \" 300\nTeacher, Jr., I. Clark, \" 300\n\nMr. Cairns receives $200 a year from the Missionary Society for the missionary work he does in connection with the mission of the seven Indian Reserves. He also receives his table supplies and light and fuel for his home. As a mark of appreciation I would recommend that he receive an advance of $100 on his salary.\n\nSALE OF LAND.\n\nOne acre, a three cornered piece next to the Creamery, was sold to the Creamery Company for $500. This Company is donating it to the B.C.H.R. Co. for a station.\n\n.62 and .24 of an acre is sold to the B.C.H.R. Company for $200 and $85 respectively, a total of 1.86 acres for $285.\n\nIn making a transfer it was found that we could not produce a certificate of title. The Institute property has been obtained in four different transactions, and it now appears that we are not able to produce a certificate of title for any of it. To remedy this I engaged Mr. J. Polly, a lawyer of Chilliwack, with instructions that if the certificate of title cannot be found, to proceed and secure new certificate.\n\nWhen the Principal receives this $325 for sale of land, I would recommend that it be disbursed as follows:\n\n1. Pay Mr. J. Polly for his services, which will be $40 or $50.\n\n2. Pay Mr. Wells $50, a promised donation towards a bonus of $1000 to the B.C.H.R. Co. About the beginning of the year a public meeting promised $1000 as a bonus, and all has been paid but the promise of the Institute. This was authorized by the late Dr. Sutherland in a letter addressed to Mr. Cairns, dated Feb. 3, 1910.\n\n3. That the Principal be instructed to spend the balance in improving the fences of the entire property. Nothing has been done in this direction for some years.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS NEEDED.\n\nSome provision must be made for better accommodation in the laundry by providing a dry room and summer quarters. This can be done in an open shed, which stands at the rear of the main building at a cost of about $400. I would recommend that a special grant be made for this purpose.\n\nThe many improvements outside the main building together with those inside, especially those made by our W.M.S. during the past two years in refurnishing the private rooms of the lady members of the staff and also fitting up a bath-room for them at a total cost of $600, has left the ladies' sitting room and the spare bed-room much below the average of the tone of the Institution. To create harmony, these two rooms should be refurnished at a cost of $250 or $300. This ought to be referred to the W.M.S. for their favorable consideration so that they may have the opportunity of doing something for the women.\n## Financial Statement\n\n| Description                                      | Receipts | Expenditure |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------|\n| Balance on July 1, 1909                          | 30.11    |             |\n| Missionary Society Maintenance                   | 9695.00  |             |\n| \" Repairs                                       | 750.00   |             |\n| \" Hog Pen                                       | 400.00   |             |\n| Farm & Garden Products                           | 2200.48  |             |\n| Government grant for Dormitories                 | 406.99   |             |\n| W.M.S. for Ladies' Bath room                     | 100.00   |             |\n| Deficit as over draft                           | 255.15   |             |\n| Salaries                                         |          | 3802.00     |\n| Clothing                                         |          | 1429.38     |\n| Food                                             |          | 4586.20     |\n| Fuel and Light                                   |          | 694.32      |\n| Building and Repairs                             |          | 1842.72     |\n| House Equipment                                  |          | 316.57      |\n| Farm and Garden                                  |          | 320.10      |\n| Transport, Traveling, etc.                       |          | 300.05      |\n| Extra Labor                                      |          | 7.00        |\n| Miscellaneous                                    |          | 644.59      |\n\nTotal Receipts: $14045.75  \nTotal Expenditure: $14045.75\n\nThe overdraft of $255.15 is due to the fact that the earnings of the school on the per capita grant exceeded the appropriations of the Board by over $300.

One of them, William Henry Vianan, Mr. Agent [illegible] reports is not an Indian, as his father was a white man and his mother lives in New Westminster. Concerning the other two children referred to by Mr. Raley, Adelaide Smith and Joseph Long, Adelaide Smith's parents are both half-breeds living in Stanley Park near Vancouver; they have lived on an Indian reserve nor are they following the Indian mode of life. Joseph Long's father was a white man and her mother a half-breed. She has lived at Stanley Park all her life. Her father is now dead and at present her mother is living with a man named Cole.\n\nMr. Raley was informed that, as none of these children complied with the Department's ruling regarding the admission of half-breeds, they could not be considered as grant earning pupils. He wants the Department to reverse its ruling, which I consider would be unwise. Mr. Raley's letter\nletter and the other correspondence relating to these children is turned out herewith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

When I was in the office in the month of September, 110 pupils was agreed to by the Deputy Superintendent General, and in harmony with this I presented the question of closing the Boys' Home at Port Simpson to the General Board of our Missions, and a very important part of the proposition was that we should receive the Government Grant for 110 pupils at Coqualeetza in lieu of closing this home.\n\nI also wrote to Mr. Raley instructing him to go north and gather what pupils he could with the understanding that he would get the grant for 110; this was done before your communication of Oct. 10th. Since then I have been waiting to see what success Mr. Raley would have in gathering in the pupils before replying. At the present time they have 118 children in residence who have passed the Doctor's examination. Four are to receive their discharge, leaving 114. Mr. Raley also informed me that he has 15 additional applications on file, so that the question of securing pupils is beyond all doubt. Mr. Raley further informs that there is no undue crowding. The main building was erected with space for one hundred and since that time there have been two dormitories erected each with capacity for 20, this would give sleeping capacity for 140; he has also arranged for an extra dining-room which accommodates 18, and there is ample accommodation in the class-rooms and in the other departments of the Institution.\n\nIn as much as our General Board accented of the proposition of closing the Boys' Home at Port Simpson with the understanding that the grant would be made on the basis of 110 at Coqualeetza, I trust that this will be conceded by the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTP/JM.\nCOQUALEETZA INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTE\nCHILLIWACK VALLEY\n\nSARDIS, B.C. 11th January, 1915.\n\nJ.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSchools Branch -\n\nI think we might allow 110 pupils at the Coqualeetza school with the understanding that this should be the full extent of the enrolment. Both Mr. Ferrier and Mr. Haley should be given to understand that the Department will not consent to the over-crowding of this school.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nRev. Mr. Ferrier has replied to the Department's letter of the 10th of October, last, with reference to the proposed increase in the pupilage of the Coqualeetza Home to 110 pupils. In the Department's letter above referred to Mr. Ferrier was informed that, after discussing the matter with Mr. Inspector Cairns, it was considered that if the grant to Coqualeetza were increased to 100 pupils it would be making provision for all the school could accommodate.\n\nSince the date of the Department's letter to Mr. Ferrier Mr. Agent Deasy writes stating that fifteen children from Massett and Skidegate were sent to this school and authority had previously been given to take ten there from the Fort Simpson Boys' School. Mr. Ferrier states that there are now 115 children in residence at Coqualeetza and that four are being discharged and will leave 114.\n\nAs the Department desired to know whether it would have sufficient accommodation for 110 children, Inspector Cairns was asked to visit this school and report what extra accommodation, if any, in the way of dormitories...\nwas provided over and above that which was made for the Port Simpson children and also to state the number he considered there would be room for. A letter has just been received from Mr. Cairns in which he reports that there were 117 pupils in the school on the day of his visit, the 4th instant, one girl was in the hospital and three were on holidays, making an enrolment of 120 pupils in all. He states that a new dormitory has been added, which will accommodate 18 pupils and give them sleeping accommodation in the school for 120. He gives the dimensions of the dormitories, which show that they have the required number of cubic feet of air space for this number. The two classrooms have air and floor space for 76 pupils. As the half day system is followed at this school there is ample room for all the pupils. Mr. Cairns claims that, while there is sleeping accommodation for 120 pupils, this number would lead to crowded conditions in the kitchen, lavatories and bath rooms and he states that in his opinion good work can be done with an average attendance of 100 pupils and when you get beyond that number you are apt to choke things. He states that Mr. Raley, the Principal, will have to be restrained or he will overcrowd the school. He has many applications for admission and he does not know how to refuse.\nMr. Ferrier states that he is informed by Mr. Raley that there is no undue crowding. They have sleeping capacity for 140 pupils and they have also arranged an extra dining room which will accommodate eighteen and there is ample accommodation in the class-rooms and other Departments of the institution.\n\nMr. Ferrier says his church accepted the proposition of the closing of the boys' home at Fort Simpson on the understanding that the grant would be made to Ootakleetza on the basis of 110 pupils and he trusts that this will be conceded by the Department. Mr. Ferrier made this proposition in his letter of the 29th of September, last, but I do not see that the Department ever agreed to allow 110 pupils.\n\nThe question is whether the Department will pay for 110 pupils at this school, as they have accommodation for that number. If it does it should be on the distinct understanding that this number is not to be exceeded.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

H. Cairns, who was principal for some eight years, resigned, and Rev. G. H. Raley was appointed to take charge on the 1st of July.\n\nThe Boys' Home at Port Simpson was closed, and fifteen of the pupils were transferred to the Coqualeetza Institute. The Government grant was changed from the basis of 90 to 110. Mr. Raley has been successful in filling the school. There were 113 children present at the close of the year in March, and 117 on the roll.\n\nThe present staff and their salaries are as follows:\n\n| Staff                                      | Salaries |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|\n| G. H. Raley, Principal                     | $1,000.00|\n| J. Stronach, Farm Instructor               | 600.00   |\n| Miss Allen, Mechanical Instructor          | 600.00   |\n| Miss G.

Deanw, Laundry Teacher           | 280.00   |\n\nIn addition to the above salaries, the staff receives board and washing.\n\nThe tent dormitory, which was built during the year, has sleeping accommodation for twenty boys, and also makes provision for a member of the staff.\n\nSome other improvements have been made, viz:\n- A concrete floor has been laid in the girls' basement.\n- Three out-buildings and the cow barn have been painted.\n- The fences have been whitewashed.\n- Some improvements have been made to the electric light system.\n\nThe live\nThe live stock consists of:- 6 horses, 14 cows, 6 two-year-olds, 10 yearlings, bull, 25 hogs and a flock of hens. For some years the farm was not kept as clean as possible. During the past two years Mr. Stronach has rendered good service as farming instructor. Great care will be necessary in keeping the weeds from spreading.\n\nSTATEMENT OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE YEAR.\n\nRECEIPTS.\nMissionary Society $12,700.00\nFarm and Garden 1,858.91\nIndian Department 153.15\nSundries 53.72\nSale of Land 514.05\nCash on Hand, April 1st, 1914 86.48\n\n$15,466.37\n\nEXPENDITURE.\nSalaries $4,324.74\nClothing 1,285.70\nFood 6,058.81\nFuel and Light 729.44\nBuildings and Repairs 295.60\nHouse Equipment 746.75\nFarm and Garden 532.03\nFreight, etc. 680.31\nExtra Labour 80.00\nMiscellaneous 731.75\nBalance on Hand, March 31st, 1915. 15.74\n\n$15,466.37\n\nThe half day system is adopted, the girls and boys working for one half of the day in the class-room and the other half at some industry. The girls are taught housekeeping, cooking, sewing, laundry work, music, etc. The boys are taught farming, gardening and care of stock. Many of these boys live in the north where farming and gardening are impracticable. Carpentry work and boat building should be added to the list of industries. The question of putting in a carpenter involves more than the payment of a salary.\n\nMaterial\nMaterial and tools must be found to work with. Repairs to the present buildings, and some new buildings that are necessary in connection with the Institute will keep a carpenter and a half dozen boys for the next four or five years. Some extra provisions should be made to provide for this necessary material over and above the per capita grant.\n\nThere are a large number of repairs and improvements needed.\n\n1. The main building needs kalsomining and painting. The plaster is badly wrecked in many places, especially in the ceilings of the ground floor and hall-ways. The plaster should be replaced by Metallic ceilings and walls.\n\n2. Window screens are needed for the main building and the Principal's Home.\n\n3. The staff dining room and the parlour in the main building should be repapered, and also the parlour and sitting room in the principal's home.\n\n4. There should be a hot water heater connected with the bath-room and laundry, and also a bath room fitted up for the lady members of the staff.\n\n5. The drainage system of the main building is leaking between the building and the tank and needs repairing. I have not been able to discover whether this is a septic tank, and if so, whether it is properly installed. In order to make this examination, it would be necessary to empty the tank or remove the roof.\n\n6. The wood-shed removed and a new one built where it would not take up so much of the boys' play ground.\n\n7. The granary moved as it occupies ground that should be used for the boys' play ground.\n\n8. A carpenter shop and general workshop is much needed.\n9.- Another cottage built for the accommodation of a mechanical employee.\n\n10.- A new laundry with washing machine and extractor. This could be operated by installing a five horse-power electric motor.\n\n11.- A new corn barn and silo.\n\nAll these repairs and new buildings should be attended to at the earliest possible date.\n\nGood work is being done in the class-rooms and also in the industries in all the departments which are covered in the present program of the school. Care is taken regarding the moral and religious instruction of the pupils. Good order and discipline is maintained throughout the Institute.\n\nWith the addition of the mechanical department and an increase of pupils, this Institute should become a model industrial school. All of which is respectfully submitted.\nCOQUALEETZA INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTE\nCHILLIWACK VALLEY\n\nSARDIS, B.C. 4th May, 1915.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to apply to the Department of Indian Affairs for summer holidays for pupils of Coqualeetza Institute, commencing as nearly as possible the beginning of July.

Keep it until Fair Time.\n\nThis issue is an addition to the Prize List of the Fair. Keep it for Reference.\n\nTHE FAIR 1915.\n\nIn less than one month the 1915 Fair of Northern British Columbia will be a thing of the past. Notwithstanding the financial outlook, prospects for a greater and better Fair for 1916 are good. The leading question is whether the 1915 Fair will justify the decision of the Directors early in the year to hold the third Annual Fair at this place. We think the continuance of this important feature of Northern progress. From the point of view of organization there is no doubt in the affirmative. Reports from all sides indicate increased exhibits and increased attendance. We hope the fair will be attended and the citizens of Prince Rupert will extend a right royal welcome to the visitors in September next.\n\nFAIR DATES ARE SEPTEMBER 22, 23, and 24.\n\nCommercial Display.\n\nSpace is being fast taken up for commercial exhibits. Most of the firms doing business in the Northern Interior are anxious to exhibit.

G.H. Raley, Principal, met me and took the trouble to show me over the building in which the children are educated and where they reside. I called at the Industrial School, without notifying the Principal and found the children at their mid-day meal. They all appeared in good health and the food provided was wholesome and sufficient in quantity for each individual. The sleeping and other rooms were in good order. It was my first visit to the Institute and I must congratulate the Principal and those associated with him on the beautiful location and the opportunity to teach the children how to best make their living after leaving the Institute. The property covers a great deal of level and cleared ground. It is an ideal place for such an institution.\n\nMy visit will give the Indians a better idea of the conditions in a neighborhood many miles from this Agency.

Mr. Tyson states that he visited this school on the 29th ultimo and dinner being served a few minutes after his arrival the Principal conducted him through the dining room in which the children assembled, in order that he might have an opportunity of forming an opinion as to the food served. He states that the food was good and substantial in quality and an ample quantity was served. After dinner he inspected the children from Massett and Skidegate and found that they were all in first class physical condition, their clothing was clean and substantial and, with one or two exceptions, the shoes worn by the children were in good condition. Mr. Tyson states that the Indian parents have no just cause for complaint.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Indians that the children are well looked after at this school and that they have no cause for complaint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThos.

Dinner being served a few minutes after my arrival, Mr. Raley kindly conducted me through the dining room in which the children were assembled, in order that I might have an opportunity of forming an opinion as to the food served. The meal, which was served on enamel dishes, consisted of soup, boiling beef, potatoes, a pudding and bread, with water to drink. The food was good and substantial in quality and ample quantity served.\n\nAfter dinner Mr. Raley kindly collected all the children from Massett and Skidegate. On inspecting these children I found that they all were in first class physical condition, the clothing was clean and substantial, and with one or two exceptions the shoes worn by the children were in good condition.\n\nOn the whole I must say the Indian parents have no just cause for complaint.

The farmers in the neighborhood are, to say the least of it, feeling the shortage of labour, and in these times when production to the highest degree is an essential form of true patriotism, the question has come to me whether a means could not be devised whereby we could at the Institute with the older pupils, say seventeen years of age, assist the neighboring farmers during the spring and summer work.

There will be about 55 in all who will not be able to go home for holidays, and if it is at all possible to finance again this year I shall be pleased to take them for an outing.\n\nThe maintenance of children away from home is more than at home but if the Indian Department could arrange to allow the same grant as last year which was $120.00 for transportation, we could finance the holiday.\n\nThe two years we have had our camp, the Ocean Park Board of Control have expressed pleasure at the conduct of the boys and girls, the order, cleanliness, and general spirit of the camp. This year they have offered us the use of the camp, tents and utensils for the last week in July and the first two weeks in August.\n\nThe change did both the children and the teachers who had charge of them inestimable good. The\ninvestment was rightly placed in the interest of Child Welfare. This year we need it especially for the little children.\n\nOur School has prepared an exhibit this year to be sent to Ottawa we believe the Department will be pleased with.\n\nBelieve me\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.C.

Raley, Principal of Cequleetza Industrial Institute, with reference to the \"epidemic of influenza which swept over the country recently:\"  \n\n(Copy.)\n\n\"Cequleetza Industrial Institute,\nSardis, B. C., Nov. 22nd, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Deasy.\u2014We are now about clear of the Influenza. George Price, of Skidegate, is up and around the house, probably will be out tomorrow if the weather is fine. He had a very severe attack. Ezra Meedy has not completely recovered; he never was very strong. I am keeping him in bed and in all probability the Doctor will allow him to get up tomorrow or the next day. The rest of the Skidegate and Massett boys, in fact all the boys and girls, with the exception of one, are now able to be out. I think it is wonderful how you and Mrs. Deasy have met the situation at Massett with so few deaths. Down here Mr. Indian Agent Byrne and Desminien Constable Grant informed me that the Pitt Meadows as many as forty funerals were held out of about 260 Indians. The Lillooet tribe suffered greatly as did also Kitimat, Bella Bella and Kitkahtla. Trusting that Mrs. Deasy and yourself may both be sustained in these trying times by the Power in whom we trust and that you may really feel much comfort in the knowledge that you have given the best you could of yourselves to help these unfortunate people during their severe visitation, believe me, (Sd.) Geo. H. Raley.\"\n\nIn a previous letter Rev. Mr. Raley informed me of the death of an Indian Pupil, from Skidegate, Josephine McKay, daughter of the Chief Councillor of the Skidegate Band. This girl was the only victim that died from Influenza, at Cequleetza Institute, from the children of the Massett and Skidegate Bands.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly 10, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier -\n\nI have read with much interest the enclosed memorandum regarding the work at the Coqualeetza Institute.

While there was only about half of last year's grant taken up; this year, on account of the epidemic of Influenza last year, I have a large number coming down from the North. The voucher of the Steam-Ship Company will be sent.\n\nWhile the grant of Ten Dollars ($10.00) does not cover the total cost of the average transportation of each pupil, yet, it is of great assistance and helps to eliminate the strain of financing this Institution.\n\nThanking the Department for former interest in this matter and trusting this application will meet with your favor,\n\nYours Very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, November 27, 1919.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant applying for a grant of $150.00 towards the cost of the transportation of children from Northern British Columbia to the Coqualeetsa Institute and stating that you have a large number of children coming down from the north to the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will allow a grant at the rate of $10.00 each towards the transportation of these Indian children, the whole amount not to exceed $150.00. You should forward properly certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred by you, not to exceed the above amount.\n\nYou will be good enough to see, before these children leave their reserves in the north, that applications for their admission are filled in and signed by one or other of the parents, or the guardian, as the case may be, also that they have been examined by a doctor, who should fill in and sign the certificate of health form. Care should be taken to see that the children brought to your school from these distant points are in good health and all applications should be forwarded as soon as completed for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. H. Haley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetsa Industrial School,\nCardis, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nIf the children of the institutes were learned in dressmaking, boat-building and running of gasoline engines, we might do better with the sons and daughters of fishermen. Many of them have sewing machines in their houses and they send thousands of dollars to departmental stores before they will use the machines. The younger children of this province are able to care for themselves in a financial way. The Department educated them and we find the younger generation not or a person with the older ones when they come back to the reserve and an environment they have not been in touch with for years. Reserve life is not to their liking, and their morals appear disheartening. Marriage does not appear to benefit some of them, through relations and friends assuming the right, according to the old customs, of selecting husbands and wives. Great care should be taken in the marriage of young Indians and the license system is improving them in some respects. At the same time our Indians are advanced enough to come under some law whereby the marriage must be respected.\n\nThey have missionaries and churches on the reserves yet the Indian Agent is faced with the responsibilities of endeavouring to stop amongst those who are married without question. Marriage is a moral law for the good of mankind and it should be for the Indian what it is to the white man. Partaking the women was the main fault that we had to correct in the early days and it is not entirely eradicated. Illegitimacy, especially among the Indians who return from the schools, is not on the decrease. I am compelled to state that the birth of illegitimate children to girls, supposedly educated, is increasing. Naturally the Indians to a certain extent are \"unmoral\". They appear to know little of moral training and our greatest difficulty is keeping the young men and women from co-habiting, even with examples before them and with teachers of morality in their midst. Environment is against them and the young women are the mark of many of other races, associating with them, without considering the evil in the young men who associated with them in the boarding school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThomas Deasy\nIndian Agent\nJuly 5, 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Raley,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt this morning of the pamphlet regarding the commencement exercises at the Coqualeetza Institute, also the photographs which you sent.

Barber Press\nChilliwack, B.C.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCoqualeetza Institute, a residential school or college for the academic, technical and vocational training of the Indian boys and girls of British Columbia, has been in existence since 1886. It is located about 70 miles in an easterly direction from Vancouver. The situation of the Institute is particularly favoured, being in the midst of the famous Chilliwack Valley, one of the most fertile spots in the Dominion. The interest in the Institute is more provincial than local, the pupils being recruited from native villages lying between the border of Alaska on the north and the Straits of San Juan on the south.\n\nThe year just closing has been the most successful under the present regime. While advancement has been apparent in every department, a decided forward movement has taken place along the line of manual and vocational training for the boys, and home nursing for the girls. The year has also been marked by the organization of an Alumni Association.\n\nLet me express my thanks to the student body for their general good conduct, diligence and progress, and above all, for a united effort to heighten the tone of the school.\n\nLet me also record my appreciation of the devoted services, hearty co-operation, and splendid esprit de corps on the part of every member of the staff, without which the present status of Coqualeetza could not have been attained.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at Sardis, B.C.,\n30th June, 1920.\n\nPrincipal.\nMEMBERS OF THE STAFF, COQUALEETZA INSTITUTE.\n\nReading from left to right.\n\nSitting\u2014Miss B.

How many of them have developed their lives in the service of others? Very few. Gentleman, I tell you that the standard is wrong. We must manufacture something different. We must adopt a true standard by which to measure up the lives of men and women. That standard is embraced in the one word\u2014service.\"\n\nVALEDICTORY.\n\nWe, the members of the graduating class of Nineteen Twenty have come to say Farewell. We are standing at the threshold about to leave our school life and to enter the world where each must play his part.\n\nIt is with high hopes for the Future and with joy that we begin \"Our Walk Through Life.\" We feel the better prepared to take our place in the world as citizens after the years spent within these walls of learning.\n\nTo the members of the staff who have played so important a role in our school life, we owe our deepest gratitude. We shall endeavour to make the lessons taught a part of our lives.\n\nANNIE KELLY.\nThe above class in Manual Training was formed last October. It has already reached, for the first year, a high standard of efficiency. It is conducted by Mr. A. G. Jamieson along similar lines to those followed in the public and high schools of the Province. The work of the boys will be exhibited this year in some of the central Exhibitions of the Province.\n\nVOCATIONAL TRAINING.\n\nA course of lectures on Farm Agriculture, extending from November 4th to December 18th, 1919, was delivered at Coqualeetza, and a course of lectures on Horticulture, extending from January 15th to March 5th, 1920.

For this purpose an endowment has been operated by the late Mr. Thomas Vannier, and the nucleus of a fund deposited, known as the \"COQUALEETZA CHAPEL FUND,\" in Trust, No. 2245.

The cost will not be more than it was last year and possibly it might be less.\n\nI am about to have a holiday for a couple of months and a trip to the East accompanied by Mrs. Raley, and if all is well, we shall take the liberty of calling upon you.\n\nI received today plans of the new building from Mr. Orr, and am quite pleased with the general arrangement of the interior, which should make for very efficient work. The Elizabethan design of the exterior is certainly most pleasing. The building will be a very attractive one.\n\nAgain thanking you for your continued interest in our western work, believe me,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I should also like to thank the Department for the favourable consideration of the request for payment of expenses incurred by me during the recent epidemic of measles to the amount of $329.90.\n\nI am quite aware the Department is under no obligation to come to my assistance in the matter. On that account I am the more grateful.\n\nAs you must be aware also, institutions of this nature are most difficult from the financial standpoint unless the Department does, as it has in this and in other cases, relieve us in case of emergency. There is no doubt many appeals for help come in a constant stream to the Department and were it not for the fact of the sincere desire of the officers of the Department to make their schools as efficient as possible and render all the help they reasonably can many would be turned down.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant applying for a grant of $150.00 towards the payment of the transportation of new pupils from northern British Columbia to the Coqualeetza Institute.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will pay accounts for transportation to the above amount, upon receipt of properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, with receipts attached from the transportation company covering the amount of the charges.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Geo. H. Raley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Institute,\nSardis, B. C.\nOctober 24th, 1921\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed herewith is a Resolution passed by our General Board of Missions at its recent Meeting in Toronto. The Department will see that this is a request for the per capita grant to be paid to this Institute for the total average attendance shown on the September quarterly report, and every following quarter until the building now under construction is completed.\n\nThis I believe to be a very reasonable request, inasmuch as the Methodist Church is not drawing any per capita grant for our work at Fort Simpson, on account of the destruction of the building there by fire; nor is it drawing a per capita grant for any School in the Province of Alberta, which was formerly paid for work done by our Church within the bounds of that Province.\n\nI may say further, that inasmuch as the Methodist Mission Board is meeting a financial deficit that occurs in the management of the Coqualeetza Institute from year to year, -- the deficit this year being about $3000.00, -- the extra per capita grant would be of material advantage in reducing this deficit during the coming year.\n\nTrusting that this will receive the favorable consideration of the Department,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[T. Ferrier]\n\nTF.MT\nRC.L.\nOctober 31st, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 24th instant, enclosing a copy of the Resolution adopted by the Methodist Church Missionary Board to the effect that the Department of Indian Affairs be asked to pay the per capita grant for all pupils accepted by the Department, and provided for and kept in residence at Coqualeetza Industrial School until such time as the new building is completed. I have noted that the Resolution states that the Principal can make temporary accommodation for more than 110 pupils. You have pointed out, in view of the fact that there is no charge against departmental finances at Fort Simpson and at Edmonton in connection with per capita grants, that this is a reasonable request.\n\nIn reply I beg to state our Architect believes that the Principal, Mr. Raley, can make temporary accommodation for more than 110 students, and, upon receipt of the September quarter report and future quarterly reports, until such time as the new building is completed, that the Department will pay the per capita grant for the total average attendance shown.\n\nWould you write the Reverend Principal and ask him to exercise every care and see that the accommodation is not so crowded that the health of the pupils is endangered.\n\nI hope that this will assist the Methodist Church in their educational work among the Indians in Southern British Columbia.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nAt the time of my visit to this school, the following needs were emphasized: 1: sewing machines; 2: team of horses; 3: bedding for the children's dormitories; 4: lantern for the auditorium; 5: bakery equipment (dough mixer); 6: kitchen equipment; 7: power spray for the orchard.\n\nI told the Principal that the bedding and the team of horses would likely have to come out of the per capita grant. I wired, advising immediate installation of the kitchen equipment. Mr. Raley wanted the bakery equipment in this fall.\n\nThe Provincial Fire Warden believes the building is in bad shape in case of fire. He feels that there is not adequate protection for the children.\n\nA corner lot 100 ft. x 40 ft. was sold by the Church authorities years ago. There is a cottage on it; the property is now rented by the school and it really should be purchased. About $1000 would be a fair offer.\n\nWhen the new main wing is erected, it would be well to use asbestos shingles on the roof. The Secretary of the B.C. Shingle Federation told the Principal that he would not complain any more in this connection.\n\nMore land is really needed at Coqualeetza. If the 20 acres contiguous at the north of the school, and worth roughly $8500, were purchased, the institution would have a solid block.\n\nThe two most noteworthy features in connection with the instruction offered were the manual training work and the splendid coordination between classroom and kitchen.\n\nThe Principal's residence needs painting and interior decorating, new floors, a new heating plant and more bath and toilet fixtures.\nJuly 27th 1922\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to apply for permission to take the pupils of Coqualeetza Institute for the holidays to Ocean Park.\n\nSince the time when through your kind consideration, the Department first gave us assistance, we have been able annually to enjoy this camp at Ocean Park, to the great benefit, both physically and mentally of the pupils of the school.\n\nThis year our camp will consist of 71 in all. We shall however have to divide, the girls going to Ocean Park and the boys to a Boys' Scout Camp two miles from Ocean Park at a place called Crescent Beach. The reason for this is, the Park is becoming so popular that the authorities cannot let us have more than seven tents, a number sufficient for the girls and the teachers who accompany them. I mention this because the dividing of the camp will cause\nextra expense.\n\nThe cost of transportation and any extra expense incidental to the treat and pleasure of the outing will be TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS OVER AND ABOVE THE ORDINARY EXPENSES OF THE INSTITUTE WITHOUT THIS OUTING. We will be grateful if the Department would favorably consider granting this amount this year. We will keep within it and forward the necessary receipts and vouchers.\n\nThe change from the monotony of routine life in the Institute, the freer and more natural life of the native child, the benefits and happiness resulting from such a change all in the interests of the welfare of the children, encourage me again to ask your favourable consideration.\n\nThanking you for the deep and continued interest in the work we are trying to do\n\nBelieve me\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Might I suggest the inauguration of our work in the new building would be incomplete without a representative from Ottawa and we should be greatly honoured and genuine pleasure would be given if that representative were yourself. You are our first choice and we would propose a postponement of the affair if you could not come till later.

Tomorrow afternoon from 2 to 5 and 7:30 to 10 p.m. the I.O.D.E. will present a set of war memorial pictures and the institution will be thrown open to the public for inspection.\n\nThe new school is the fulfillment of the ideals and self-sacrifice of the early missionaries as it was 36 years ago when Mrs. A. Tate took in her home a few Indian children and established the first Indian day school. Later she established the first mission residence with 12 pupils and in 1892 the first Coqualeetza Institute was built. In 1929 the old building was deemed inadequate and the Federal Government through the Indian Department planned the present magnificent and modern building around the sale of unoccupied Indian lands.\n\nThe name Coqualeetza means \"place of camping,\" referring to the district by the Indians who once a year assembled on the Vedder River to trade their blankets. At present there are more than 200 Indian boys and girls being educated in the new school.\nOttawa, October 21, 1924.\n\nRev. G. H.

A. Duncan C. Scott.\nOttawa, Sept. 12, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Raley:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the formal opening of the new building at Coqualeetza. I have had some correspondence with Rev. Mr. Ferrier, relative to the most suitable dates for your function and the one at Edmonton, but no definite arrangements have been made as yet.\n\nI regret that I will not be able to go to B. C. this autumn, but I am trying to arrange for the presence of the Prime Minister at the Coqualeetza opening. I understand that Mr. King is to be in your province and it is possible that he can be present.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Ferrier today, advising him to fix the dates for both Edmonton and Coqualeetza some time during the last two weeks in October. There is a possibility that the Honourable Mr. Stewart will be available for the Edmonton ceremony.\n\nI am sending, by registered mail, the cuts you requested for your booklet. I should be pleased if you would return these to me when you are through with them. I understand that the Rev. Mr. Ferrier is arranging for the presence of the chief officials of the Methodist Church and I am indeed pleased that you are giving such prominence to the opening of the new buildings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

RALEY\nPrincipal of Graduation Residential School\nFOREWORD\n\nCOQUALEETZA Institute for forty years has been a unit in the educational work of the Province of British Columbia.\n\nThe present economic requirements of all people demand that schools provide instruction along eminently practical lines. The Indian Department of Canada, in conjunction with the Church, with commendable foresight and enthusiasm is providing a system of modern training institutions or residential schools, with an essentially vocational foundation which will fit the Indian youth of both sexes as fully as possible for the life of their immediate future and the changing conditions which may affect their more remote future.\n\nThe highest aim is to make christian citizens of the pupils, and so they are taught to \"Fear God,\" and \"Honor the King.\" We seek to give the girls a clear idea of what true womanhood means. This embraces a study of the virtues and graces which go to make happy homes. For the boys we crave a conception of true manliness, a love for honest labor and an intelligent interest in the affairs of the state.\n\nIn all, we seek to instill a reverence for sacred things and respect for the rights of others. We have visions of leadership for some and a healthy atmosphere of usefulness for many, and the following lines seem to express what we desire all shall learn:\n\n\"We are not here to play, to dream, to drift,\nWe have hard work to do, and loads to lift,\nShun not the struggle, face it, 'tis God's gift.\nBe strong, be strong!\"\n\nSardis, B. C., October 21st, 1924.\n\nPrincipal.\n\"I was going further, but when I came to the place and beheld the thing, I stopped.\" \u2014 Bunyan\n\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSEARCH British Columbia over, no happier choice of location could have been selected for Coqualeetza Institute than that which it occupies. The Institute is planted in the heart of the Fraser Valley, two miles distant from the banks of the Fraser River. The valley itself is luxuriant with verdure, trees and flowers and its level fields are hemmed in by great mountain ranges, the sentinels of which are Mt. Cheam and Mt. Tamahai, lofty peaks, the source of the rivulets which run hither and thither through the country.\n\nThere is no doubt that unconsciously the beauty of the landscape, with its majesty and coloring, has an uplifting effect on the impressionable minds of the young.\n\nThe comfortable homes in the peaceful valley also tend to teach happiness and contentment, and the fact that many persons of culture and refinement are interested in the education and development of the native children, is a stimulus to our efforts.\n\nIn short, Coqualeetza Training Institute owes not a little to its advantageous location, in its manifold development work, which includes academic, prevocational, social and athletic lines, all necessary to the making of well-rounded, independent and self-supporting citizens such as the native boys and girls must learn to be in this land of Canada.\n\nAt present the school plant consists of a new, modern residence for 200 students with class rooms and assembly hall. It is comfortable and commodious, equipped with new furniture.\n\nA principal's residence and one school officer's cottage are the other dwelling houses.\n\nAn up-to-date new farm completes the list.\nHISTORICAL\n\n1880\u2014First Indian Day School organized by Rev. and Mrs. C.

Miss Elderkin was placed in charge.\n\n1891\u2014The Coqualeetza Home was destroyed by fire, half of the pupils were sent to their homes, those remaining with their teachers were sheltered in the Mission House.\n\n1893\u2014A new building was erected. The edifice was completed in brick, three stories high, and a basement under the whole building, with accommodation for one hundred pupils. This was called the Coqualeetza Industrial Institute. Rev. C. M. Tate was made formal Governor.\n\n1920\u2014Dr. Duncan C. Scott, after consultation with Rev. T. Ferrier and Principal Raley, decided the 1893 building had served its day and arranged for plans to be drawn up for a new building. The same year R. Guerney Orr, Esq., Architect for the Indian Department, visited Coqualeetza, obtained data and commenced plans.\n\n1921\u2014The first unit of the new educational plant was commenced.\n\n1922\u2014The Assembly Hall with the boiler room completed.\n\n1923\u2014(May 27th) The Rev.

Neither is it correct that only children of full Indian blood are admitted free at the institution, as they are open to all children of enrolled members of bands, and in British Columbia there are a great number of persons of mixed Indian blood who are considered to be Indians under the Indian Act. For pupils of full or mixed Indian blood, being members of bands, the Dominion Government, through the Department of Indian Affairs, pays to the management of Residential Schools a per capita grant ranging from $150 to $176 per annum. Children of mixed blood who are not members of bands are not eligible for admission to these schools, as they do not come under the category of Indians as the term is now controlled by the provincial or municipal authorities in each province.\n\nAs an illustration of what is has been costing the Government of Canada for the education of Indian children in the Province of British Columbia, it is only necessary for me to point out that since this province entered the Union in 1871, the total amount expended by the Crown up to March 31, 1923, was $4,321,953. Prior to the entry of British Columbia becoming one of the provinces of the Dominion school work was nothing done along educational lines by the Colonial Government, but during the first 10 years thereafter the amount expended by the Dominion Government was $10,188; for the years 1882-83, $1,189; 1883-84, $1,000; 1884-85, $32,764; 1885-86, $482,541; 1886-87, $740,623; 1887-88, $750,948, and for the three years, 1890-91, 1891-92, 1892-93, the cost was $1,359,536. The figures for the final year that have not so far been published.\n\nIn the Province of British Columbia at present there are 43 Indian Day Schools with an enrollment of 1,550 pupils. Operating cost of these schools is approximately $150,000 per annum. There are also 16 Residential Schools in operation at which institutions, up to March 31, 1923, was 1,276 pupils. The new school at Sardis and one now under construction at Kaslo, both of which have capacity for a very considerably larger number of pupils than did the old schools being replaced by the new ones, when completed, should bring the enrollment up to approximately 1,000 pupils. The total operating cost of the 16 Residential Schools amounts to $663,630 per annum. All the funds for Residential and Day Schools are provided for by parliamentary appropriation.\n\nDuring the past seven years new Residential Schools have been built by the Department of Indian Affairs from public funds as follows:\n\nAlberni, $72,000; Kuper Island, $110,000; Fraser Lake, $188,000; Sechelt, $125,000; Sardis, $206,000. At Kamloops the entire unit of a fine large school with accommodation for 200 pupils has been completed and the contract has now been let for the east wing, and on completion of this second wing the west wing will be constructed. It is estimated that when the school is completed next year it will cost approximately $225,000.\n\nW.E. DITCHBURN,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDecember 9th, 1924.\n\nH. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA question has often arisen in my mind as to the right interpretation of the instructions of the Department regarding correspondence. We are instructed to \"address the reply to the Secretary of the Department\". Does that mean that the envelope shall be directed to you and the letter written to the head of the branch on the subject which belongs to his particular branch.\n\nFor instance if I want information or advice on school matters shall I write to Mr. Russell Ferrier and address the envelope to you or shall I write to you as Secretary of the Department and also address the envelope to you.\n\nThe same applies to building. Shall I as it were not recognize the presence of the architect and write to you as well as address the envelope to you. Is it the wish of the Department that we write as though the various branches were nonexistent so far as we who are outside are concerned?\n\nIt makes no difference to me but I am anxious to do the right thing as the Department wishes it to be done. At the same time I do not wish to be discourteous to any members of the Department.\n\nIf at your convenience and without any trouble could you let me know the custom and wish of the Department I should esteem it a favour and conform to it.\n\nThanking you for your interest and wishing you the compliments of the season,\n\nYours very truly,\nDecember 15th, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th inst and in reply I have to inform you that official correspondence should be addressed to the Secretary of the Department and if the subject matter of the letter should be one relating to schools, it will be referred, upon receipt, to the Schools Branch or if to buildings, to the Architect of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am of the opinion that it is important that the public should know the full circumstances of the case, otherwise a false impression is liable to be created, not only among the whites, but the Indians as well.\n\nYour item makes it appear that the Coquihalla School is provided for through the sale of unoccupied Indian reserves and that the institution is free to take blood Indians, but those of mixed blood are not.\n\nIn this connection I beg to state that the funds for the building of this school were provided for by partial sale of the appropriation and not through the sale of unoccupied reserves, as stated. Neither is correct that only children of pure Indian blood are educated at such institutions, as they are open to all children of enrolled members of bands and to the children of the wives or grandmothers of persons of mixed Indian blood who are considered to be Indians under the Indian Act. For pupils attending the schools in Sicamous, both members of bands, the Dominion Government, through the Department of Indian Affairs, pays the maintenance of each child at the rate of $170 per capita grant ranging from $150 to $170 per annum. Children of mixed blood who are members of bands are eligible for admission to these schools, as they do not come under the category of Indians, and the white authorities have been very provident or municipal authorities are open to them.\n\nAs an illustration of what has been done by the Government in the education of Indian children in the Province of British Columbia, it is only necessary for me to point out that since this province joined the Union in 1871 the total amount expended for this purpose up to March 31, 1923, was $4,231,835. Prior to the date of British Columbia joining the Union, although the hands of the Dominion apparently there was nothing done along educational lines by the Canadian Government, but during the years following thereafter the amount expended by the Dominion Government was $10,136; for the years 1890 to 1899, $442,941; 1899-1909, $740,629; 1909-19, $750,049, and for the three years, 1919-21, $1,000,000 was committed to the schools. The figures for the fiscal years 1923-24 have not so far been published.\n\nIn the Province of British Columbia at present there are 43 Indian Day Schools with a total enrollment of 1350 pupils. The operating cost of these schools amounts to nearly $140,000 per annum. There are also 16 Residential Schools, the enrollment at which institutions, up to March 31, 1923, was 1275 pupils. The old school buildings, and one new under construction at Kamloops, will have a capacity for a very large number of pupils than the old schools being replaced by the new ones, and this, therefore, should bring the enrollment up to approximately 1500 pupils. The total operating cost of the 16 Residential Schools amounts to $266,287 per annum.

All the funds for Residential and Day Schools are provided for by particular legislative appropriations.\n\nDuring the past seven years the new Residential schools have been built by the Department of Indian Affairs from public funds as follows:\n\n| Location | Cost |\n|----------|------|\n| Lake     | $188,060 |\n| Secwepemc | $129,600 |\n| Sardis    | $290,400 |\n| Kuper Island | $110,000 |\n\nAt Kamloops the contract for the new large school with accommodation for 175 pupils has been completed and the contract has now been let for the east wing, and on completion of the second unit the school will be complete. It is estimated that when this school is completed next year it will cost approximately $1,000,000.\n\nW.R. DITCHBURN,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your telegram of 30th October drawing my attention to a statement published in the Vancouver Sun of the 21st (should be 22nd) relative to funds for the building of the new Coqualeetza School which made it appear that these funds were obtained from the sale of unoccupied Indian Reserves, and asking me to arrange for publicity of a statement that parliamentary appropriation provided all funds for this activity, I am attaching hereto two copies of a letter from myself printed in the Vancouver Sun of the 26th November, though I had forwarded my letter to that newspaper on the 7th. I hope you will agree that I have laid the matter before the public in comprehensive form.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDecember 16th, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Ditburn,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 13th instant enclosing clippings from the Vancouver Sun of November 26th containing your letter. This is certainly a very comprehensive statement and fully meets with my approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. H. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSchool Helps\n\nIndian Artists\n\nHaving a fine collection of early Indian handiwork, the new Coqualeetza Indian Institute at Sardis, B.C., promises to be a museum as well as a manufacturer. The school there will provide modern industrial education for the Indian youth of the province and also preserve for future development the early arts and handicrafts of the race.\n\nThe grand building just completed houses comfortably 200 students, boys and girls, in the main structure which cost $200,000 and which is supplemented by shops and barns. Its construction goes in line with the government's policy of providing for its Indian children schools that are something to be proud of.\n\nRev. George H. Reid, the principal, hopes to organize a league to provide wider markets for the native workers, to perpetuate familiarity with their fading past and to encourage purely native art. Already the walls of the main hall and reception rooms are covered with over 600 specimens of native work, revealing wonderful artistic skill and telling to the uninitiated much of the ethnological history of the Pacific Coast.\n\nThe school was founded in 1923 by a Methodist missionary, Rev. C. M. Tate.\n\nThe first sod of the new building was turned by Rev. Dr. Chown, the foundation stone laid by Duncan Campbell Scott, Litt.D., F.R.C.C., superintendent of Indian affairs and the completed structure dedicated by Rev. C. E. Manning, general secretary of Methodist home missions.\n\nExpense and responsibility for the diversified education offered in agriculture, domestic sciences, trades, sciences and letters are borne jointly by the Dominion and by Methodism. W. B. Ditchburn, Indian commissioner for British Columbia, R. H. Grant, inspector of Indian schools, and Rev. T. F. Foster, Methodist superintendent of Indian hospitals and schools, have direct oversight. Their sympathies are with the policy of conserving the younger generation to prize the achievements of the past and to learn to fit themselves into white civilization.\nCoqualeetza Residential School\nSardis, B.C.\n\nCommencement Exercises\n1925\n\nJune\nFOREWORD\n\nYOU will see as you turn the pages we have achieved; and what now? Why, still further achievement. We are not unmindful of our present attainment, for it is too wonderful, but it is the very thing which causes us to reach forth.\n\nWe present to you in this issue pictures of our beautiful building.\n\nWhat effect has it on our work?\n\nIt inspires us to press forward and live up to our motto, \"No backward step.\" It breathes an air of culture, refinement and learning hitherto unfelt. It attracts pupils as never before. It pleases and surprises our visitors. It radiates happiness, comfort and warmth and in the midst of such surroundings expansion is the natural sequence.\n\nOur official opening was nearly all that could be desired. One presence was lacking. We refer to Duncan Campbell Scott, Litt., D., F.R.S.C., Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, to whom the native people of Canada owe much. We trust he will be present when the expansion vision is realized.\n\nDated at Sardis, B.C.\nJune, 1925.\n\nPrincipal.\nFOUNDERS' DAY\n\nOctober 21st, 1924\n\nMARKING an epoch in the development of the educational life of the native people, the New Coqualeetza Residential School, Sardis, was opened for Indian children of the Province of British Columbia on the 21st day of October, 1924, by the Rev. Dr. Manning of Toronto, General Secretary of the missionary Society of the Methodist Church of Canada, with a golden key, symbolic of Christian education, which opens the door leading into every avenue of life and knowledge worth while.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq., Indian Commissioner, of Victoria, ably presided over the opening ceremony. On the platform with him were, representing the Department of Indian Affairs, Mr. J. H. Agar, A. J. Davies, of New Westminster, and Mr. R. H. Carins, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province. Representing the Methodist Church with Dr. Manning were the Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Schools and Hospitals for Canada, Rev. and Mrs. Tate, the founders of the original Coqualeetza Industrial Institute; Rev. O. Dunlop, D.D., Superintendent of Missions; Mrs. Derbyshire, representing the Women's Missionary Society; Rev. J. W. Westman, President of Conference; Dr. J. H. White; Rev. R. Whitmire, M.A., D.D., and Rev. Frank Raley. Over five hundred people gathered from far and near, exclusive of 201 pupils and a staff of 10 to witness the impressive ceremony.\n\nDirectly the doors were opened a public reception was held, Principal and Mrs. Raley and Miss Bell (the matron) receiving the guests. Members of the staff and senior pupils acted as guides to show the guests over the building. Tea was served in the staff dining-room, with Miss MacGregor, the boys' matron, acting as hostess, while Mrs. C. S. Pearson and Mrs. E. A. Wells presided at the tables. These two ladies had taken part at the opening of the original school. At 7.30 sixty guests sat down to a sumptuous banquet prepared by Miss Beckett, assisted by Miss Price and Miss Raley. Several toasts were proposed and responded to.\n\nWednesday a reception was held both afternoon and evening. About three hundred guests called: Mrs. J. H. White, Mrs. Teasdale, Miss Taylor and Miss McGregor officiated at the refreshments.\n\nAn interesting and impressive ceremony took place during the evening, when Mrs. A. U. DePorceer, of Vancouver, Organizing Secretary of the Provincial I.O.D.E., formally, on behalf of the Order, presented a collection of War Memorials Picture to the school.\n\nThursday evening the staff and the pupils and a few ex-pupils enjoyed a family banquet, the toast list being carried out by the pupils.\n\nExtract from Vancouver paper:\n\nCoqualeetza Residential School offers the Indians a unit in the educational life of this province. The educational work pursued at this school being a well-balanced combination of practical work with the academic, the school possesses the advantages of the ordinary modern convent and college, is ideally situated and ideally suited for the pursuit of both. With accommodations for 201 pupils and a staff of 15, the school is surrounded by ninety-two acres of the finest agricultural land in the well-known Sardis district, this land serving an excellent purpose for the training of the pupils in the various branches of farm work. One of the most modem of barns, with its stock, provides for instruction in animal husbandry.\n\nThe practical work includes instruction in the various branches of gardening and fruit production. In the school, the girls are taught all the branches of housekeeping, including baking, sewing, laundering, etc., and a visitor is delighted and surprised at the practical use the girls make of these accomplishments. The school has a large vegetable garden, and the pupils are instructed in the care of the same. The market food supply of the school is practically provided for by the products preserved and fresh of the farm.\n\nThe school is named after the Coqualeetza River, which flows off here, on which is located the namesake of twenty-three of the staff and students of Coqualeetza who fought in the Great War. The prevailing spirit of the institute is a high and worthy one, in endeavor to live up to its motto, \"Vestigia Nudia Retenus.\" The school is under the direction of Mrs. J. H. White, who has been appointed with standard set by the principal, Rev. G. H. Raley, who adopts as his own motto the words of G. Glotz, \"To my awards union things are achieved when they are well begun.\" The New Coqualeetza is surely well begun.\"\nMrs. G. H. Raley\n\nThis is an opportunity to place on record our gratitude to Mrs. Raley, the wife of the Principal. We know of her untiring devotion to the cause. Her many acts of kindness and consideration for the children and their friends have not passed unnoticed. She has been a true friend and a powerful helper to the school. The native people of Northern British Columbia know that in all the past years she never spared herself to make life happier for them whenever it was in her power.\n\nMoreover, we are told by one who knows that it was Mrs. Raley who interested friends in the East so that the school is equipped by a piano, Victrola, and a large quantity of bedding, quilts and table clothes were donated. Precisely she has avoided associating herself with many benevolent bodies lest they be aware of her thoughtfulness. So now we take all the more pleasure in bringing to light her unselfish interest in the welfare of the school. Cognerons.\n\nREV. S. D. CHOWN, D.D.\n\nCoqualeetza was honoured in January by a two days' visit from the Rev. S. D. Chown, D.D., General Superintendent of the Methodist Church of Canada. This is historic for Dr. Chown was making his last tour of British Columbia in his official position as head of the Methodist Church. He very graciously addressed the entire school, assuring them he has never failing interest in Coqualeetza but has been glad of presenting him with an address which she had compiled in the name of the student body, Principal and Mrs. Raley and the staff of the school tendered Dr. Chown a reception, inviting as guests the Senior Students.\n\nMISSIONARY PAGEANT\n\nIn Wesley Church, Vancouver, 25th to 29th November\n\nCoqualeetza had its little share in the great Centenary Missionary Pageant put on in Vancouver last November. Representing the Local Committee, Mrs. Raley was present with ten pupils. The latter called forth abundant applause when the vast audience realized that these boys and girls were educated native children, the outcome of Christian Missions. Mrs. Raley's display of Indian curios was the unique attraction of the Missionary Conference.\n\nThe Spirit of Missions is duly fostered at Coqualeetza and this year found Missionary givings greatly increased. The students from the youngest to the oldest have learned that \"it is more blessed to give than to receive,\" and although some have but a few pennies, all are most desirous of helping along the great cause of Missions.\nGraduation Class, '25\n\n(Reception for Class by the Staff, June 19th)\n\nFront Row (seated, left to right): Alice Cline, Isabella Robinson, Jessie Sampson\nBack Row (standing, left to right): Philip McKay, Alice Brooks, Susan Jones and Charles Barton.\n\nClass motto: \"Ours is our land.\"\nClass word: \"Others.\"\nClass colors: \"White Rose.\"\n\nIn whatever community a graduate of Coqualeetza may reside, let him bring honor to his Alma Mater by living up to ideals and putting into practice principles which he has been faithfully taught, and which, if conscientiously adhered to, will help build up a healthy, prosperous and happy people.\n\nCLASS HISTORY\n\nReading from left to right:\n\nALICE CLINE.

A host of pleasant associations lies behind us, and it is with regret we bid good-bye to the staff and students. As we leave the school for which we have been taught and we fitted in to meet the future untried, we realize more fully how much we owe to it.\n\nIt is indeed a great privilege to be the first graduates of New Coqualeetza, and just as New Coqualeetza has grown from a mere idea, so must graduates grow by being true to their ideals and assuming responsibility. Leaving does not mean we sever our connection with the school, as we hope to uphold the traditions of the Alumni Association. We shall try to come show our devotion and loyalty to our Alma Mater by being true to her ideals and guarding well her honour. As we go out, we ask the teachers to accept our thanks, forget our faults and magnify our virtues.\n\n(Signed) CHARLES BARTON, President and Valedictorian.\nMiss Elmo May Gladstone\n\nWe are pleased to show you our most advanced pupil, who is completing her second year at Chilliwack High School. Her standing is with honours. She hopes to matriculate, as did her sister, Sophia (now Mrs. Read of Victoria).

The matters reported were local, political, educational, social and historical.\n\nThe following were responsible:\n\nGodfrey Kelly, Joseph Gray\nArthur Angus, Peter Williams\nElizabeth Robinson, Anne Williams\nElmo Gladstone, Hope Castle\nHope Castle, Marjorie Barton\n\nDOMESTIC ECONOMICS\n\nHOME TRAINING\n\nMiss E. B. Bell\n\nThis includes personal hygiene, care of children, housekeepers' responsibilities, social duties and child welfare.\n\nThe following girls have done splendid work and are worthy to receive certificates of standing:\n\n1. Alice Brooks, 2. Sophie Joseph, 3. Sophrena Wallace.\n\nSpecial mention is made of Alice Cline.\n\nLAUNDRY\n\nIn charge of Miss M. E. Taylor\n\nTheory: 11\u00bd hours weekly; application, 18 hours weekly.\n\nOnce again we are prepared for our annual test of three weeks' camp out in the glorious sunshine and fresh, pure air, when before our eyes not only the mountains of piles of soiled clothes, which are soon made clean and white by the electric machines, but also the laundry.\n\nThe girls have no less to do than in the old laundry, but rather more, owing to an increase in the number of pupils and the fact that they must be able to turn out all kinds of work in the big, light airy room, with its whirl and hum of the revolving tubs, and the rushing of water, the girls must learn to handle their boards, transforming these masses of wet clothes into clean crisp forms of all shapes and sizes ready for little bodies whose greatest joy in life seems to be playing.\n\nSpecial mention is made of: 1. Jessie Simpson, 2. Mamie Ingram, 3. Lucy Jones.\n\nMANUFACTURING\n\nInstructor: Miss E. Carstairs\n\nTheory: 11\u00bd hours weekly; application, 18 hours weekly.\n\nOne of the most utilized departments in our new building is that of the manufacturing room. Here with its five machines\u2014two treadle, two power, and one for the making of button-holes\u2014hundreds of garments, as well as other useful articles, are made, and mostly everything belonging to the linen cupboard are made.\n\nBesides the practical work, the girls are encouraged to make things for themselves, thus demonstrating and produce quite up-to-date creations. In the sewing of these they take great interest.\n\nOn leaving the school, each girl graduate takes with her a complete new outfit, which, generally, she herself has made.\n\nIf only someone would invent a machine for the making of old stockings, sometimes footless, and sometimes holes in the new, he or she would merit the heartfelt gratitude of the whole institution.\n\nWorthy of special mention and ranking as follows: 1. Alice Cline, 2. Susan Jones, 3. Alice Brooks.\n\nMENDING ROOM\n\nIn charge of Miss D. M. McKinnon\n\nTheory: 3 hours weekly; application, 6 hours weekly.\n\nCould one take a peep one day and see the stacks of clothes and pressing needing repair, she would immediately think of a revised Ten Commandments, \"for grime may come and go, but clothes pile up forever.\"\n\nHowever, with such girls as Mercy Wesley, Sophronia Wallace, Doris White, Rosalind Watson, Alice Percival, Alice Edgar, and Alice Sepass, we soon see our mending diminish.\n\nOur girls also take keen interest in the art of embroidering ducks and bunnies for relaxation, and our specimen books, I think, are worthy of praise for such small children, most of them being under ten years of age.\n\nRecommended for diploma: Mercy Wesley.\nMANUAL INSTRUCTOR'S ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1924-25\n\nA.G. Jameson (Instructor)\n\nAs the school year again draws near close the Manual Instructor has pleasure in presenting his report.\n\nThis year our work is to be the most productive of our lives. Our new residence, all of which we hope will help to tastefully furnish and be of interest to the resident and future pupils, is now being fitted out. The walls of the walls, the trimmings of the historic pictures presented by the L.C.D.E., and which now cover the walls, was a work of much thought and care. Large corn show cases, which have found a place in the Entrance Hall, help by their very appearance to make the room look like a museum. We are proud of the large bookcase occupying one side of the main room. This bookcase will be filled as time goes on with the ever-enlarging \"Spencer Library.\" The instructor and his pupils have received many gifts of this precious treasure. The boys are interested in the development and are commended for their faithfulness and their craftsmanship in this and all other work undertaken during the term.\n\nSTANDING OF MANUAL PUPILS\n\nFirst Class: Amos Williams, Peter Williams, Charles Barton, Nelson Grant.\n\nSecond Class: Joseph Grey, Edward Young, William Gladstone.\n\nNote: Godfrey Kelly was only a short time at Manual, but in that time he proved himself a most capable student, eager to help and to learn.\n\nCARPENTRY\n\nIn charge of Mr. J.B. Pattison\n\nThe past year has been one of expansion and construction, reminding one of the Chambered Nautilus turning its own shell and building a larger one within. Several old buildings had to be torn down so that we could begin the new technical building, our chief work. The erection of a building of this size by the hands of the boys is no small undertaking, but the interest which has been shown in the work right from the time we started on the foundation shows that the boys are learning something of construction that will be of great help to them in after life.\n\nAmos Williams, Charles Barton and Willie Gladstone are specially mentioned for proficiency in their work.\n\nSHOE REPAIRING DEPARTMENT\n\nIn charge of Mr. George Ferguson\n\nDuring the past year considerable progress has been made by the boys under my charge, some have already graduated and give promise of future skilled ability. Oscar Ingram has shown particular talent and skill and may also be considered. During the period under revision about 300 pairs of boots have been repaired, and there is no doubt considerably more work could be done in a properly equipped shop, which would be of great advantage, not only to the apprentices, but to the school.\n\nMECHANICAL ENGINEERING\n\nEngineer, Mr. Walter J. Isaac\n\nThe boys working under me this year have, owing to the different conditions prevailing in the new building, been able to acquire more experience in a variety of ways. During the winter they were very busy in assisting me with such repairs and alterations as were necessary, and I have found them of great help, especially Alfred Moody, Amos Williams and George Daniels. The latter seems never happier than when at work.\n\nAGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT\n\nInstructor, Mrs. J.H. Teasdale\n\nAnother year has passed, and although we, in our department, have nothing spectacular to report, we are pleased to say that there has been a steadily increased interest on the part of the boys.\n\nThis month we have mixed milk for the first time. Conducting the operation, to determine the profit and loss of each cow.\n\nThe first test has shown the high percentage of butter fat produced by the herd. I am glad to report that the boys interested in the milking boys in this.\n\nTwo of our boys, namely, Amos Williams and Nelson Grant, gained the first and second prizes at the ploughing competition open to the whole Chilliwack Valley to boys of their own age.\n\nThe handling of the turn boys was as follows: 1. Nelson Grant; 2. James Joseph; 3. Stanley Shaw (teamsters); Robert Thompson, Charlie Williams, Reginald Clayton (stock).\n\nTHE HORTICULTURAL DEPARTMENT\n\nInstructor, Mr. P.F. Price, O.A.C.\n\nThe Horticultural Department is endeavoring to keep pace with the ever-increasing numbers of students.\n\nWe have nearly seven acres in garden and fruit, which require a great deal of attention. Preparation of the ground, hot beds, seedling, transplanting, weeding and cultivating are part of the course. Small fruits, their culture and care are included.\n\nThe boys take to the work very keenly. Many of them will have a good practical knowledge of the work, by which they will be able to earn a living when they graduate.\n\nA number of trees have been planted and arrangements made for the erection of the new building. Landscape gardening has been occupying our time to some extent. The foundation for the beautifying of the grounds and building has been laid. A number of clambake and strolls have been set out this year.\n\nThe following boys are deserving of special mention in this department: Edward Young, Paul Mason, Oscar Ingram, Philip McKay.\n\nSOCIAL ENTERPRISES\n\nCougaleetza endeavours to put a bit of the home spirit into its school life by observing special days and occasions. Thanksgiving called for a taffy pull in the evening. Christmas evensong was attended by trees laden with gifts, and its graded matters.\n\nSt. Valentine's Day was celebrated by the Principal and Mrs. Ferrier having his birthday, by a party for everyone, or rather parties, for our numbers are so large now, the latter was in the hall.\n\nThe Easter holidays were similarly observed, and Victoria Day and the King's Birthday were celebrated with picnics.\n\nDuring the visit of the Rev. and Mrs. Ferrier, the senior students and the mentors gave a reception for them, and while in residence were sent for by the Principal's family and the staff. A very happy and successful evening was enjoyed.\n\nDuring the year, the Cougaleetza choir has enjoyed several very delightful motor rides, a trip to the movies and Church services, and also a social evening at which the staff were invited. The choir is indebted to Mr. Teasdale, their conductor, for these pleasant outings and parties.\n\nCULINARY DEPARTMENT\n\nUnder Direction of Miss L. Maclean (supply)\n\nTheory 1\u00bd hours weekly, application, 18 hours weekly.\n\nThe month of June brings us to the close of the second annual session in the culinary department of our new building.\n\nThis is perhaps not out of place, because three issues from the daily meals for nearly 230 people and many extra guests. Nearly every day was preceded by the preparation of the food for the next meal in season.\n\nThe breakfasting is a department by itself and includes the duties who see an opportunity to serve. Of course, they supervised from start to finish. Weekly cooking lessons are given a number of girls, who thus are trained in the art of cooking.\n\nThe prevailing idea in the mind of the cooking master is to produce good wholesome food, which will go to build up body and muscle and establish general good health in the boys and girls and fit them for the future.\n\nSpecial days call for the special food, and, from the child's point of view, the end of a perfect day is that which finishes with a thanksgiving.\n\nSpecial mention: Susan Jones, Hazel Peters, Mercy Wesley, Gwynne Watson.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The weather was ideal and the spirit was good. This holiday outing has become a settled event, and is anticipated eagerly, and serves tops for conversation for months following. It is one of the sugar plums of the school.\n\nWe are indebted to the Sardis Dramatic Society for presenting two plays in our Assembly Hall; \"His First Crusade\" and \"On the Streets,\" and to the Carman Ladies' Aid for presenting \"Singing for the Stars.\" The pupils also appreciated the performances of the Band. The evening entertainments were followed by a social hour with refreshments served by the ladies of the staff.\n\nTo see during the year Coqualeetza has opened its doors for social affairs of local organizations. In January, the Henry Tejon Chapter, I.O.D.E. held its gala. The programme consisted of solos and a lecture by Principal Riley on \"Legends of Indian Basketry,\" demonstrated by his collection.\n\nThe annual reunion was given the auspices of the Hospital Auxiliary, when the boys of the school staged an original play, \"Life of Old BC.\"\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND THANKS\n\nAn organ for Cotton Lake Church from Sixth Ave. Methodist Church, New Westminster.\nAn organ for the Institute donated by the Alice Betts Circle W.M.S., Queen's Ave Methodist Church, New Westminster.\nA large piece of wall-paper for the Mr. and Mrs. Robert Collinson, ex-pupils of the Institute, distributed among the various classes and rooms of the School.\nPictures which adorn the walls of the school from Mrs. Gilley, Mrs. Evans and Mr. Haggerty.\nSix copies monthly of the Junior Red Cross Magazine.\nThe Book Club, consisting of fifteen volumes, Mr. Russell Ferrier, Ottawa.\nBooks, Mrs. David Macdonald, Victoria.\nAfternoon tea service, Miss Grace Breckville.\nTowels, Current W.M.S.\nThree beautiful art and hostess hand-painted tea-dress linen tablecloths and seventy-five yards of damask for students' tables, Sir Joseph and Lady Flavelle, Toronto.\nChilliwack Auxiliary W.M.S. for making four hundred pillow slips.\n\nWe are indebted to many other W.M.S.

Two or three have their own instruments\u20142 violins, 1 guitar, 1 mandolin, mandorgans. Many a dull or wet evening is made bright and happy by the strains of sweet music\u2014or otherwise\u2014supplemented by amateurs who would be in the concert, with tin whistles and the lonely corn covered with tissue paper. Some of the boys are really good, and some are striving to be good.\n\nCONTRIBUTED\n\nOur teacher, Robert Lawson, is out of work now. The small animals, to save their skins, vanish at his approach, for they know once seen they hear no more.\n\nOur \"Champion\" has hurt his hand, now all the balls he can't catch\u2014he misses.\n\nOur tallest boy is still growing. If he keeps it up we shall save our leaders.\n\nAxes to grind, axes to grind, is the song of our little wood-burners.\n\nOur new little typist is getting on famously. She can do five words in fifteen minutes. Some speed!\n\nHazel Peters is our star ball player. Boys, beware\u2014the girls will get you if you don't watch out.\n\nLucie Wilson and helpers are to be congratulated on their cookies made for the picnic on June 3rd. Te \"oh's\" and \"ah's\" of satisfaction should encourage them to bigger efforts for the pie-making on Saturday morning.\n\nMrs. Riley could not imagine how the boys and girls could put away so much of the good things to eat at their picnic in so short a time. Simply practice, Madam, that's how.\n\nMiss Price, Miss Bell and Mrs. Scarlett are worrying over whose sweet peas will blossom first. No bets taken.\n\nSounds coming from the kindergarten room the other day called us to investigate, where we found a \"young rat going on.\" All the old nursery rhyme characters were trying to come to life and undo the other fellow, and the two big tares were the loss of the whole lot.\nDear Sister,\n\nI have a little time to myself today, so thought it would be a good idea to write you a letter.\n\nBrother Isaac has gone to the \"Miller\" to pay a bill, and it is simply pouring cats and dogs. This is the first time he has ever even \"nurse\" need a storm of this sort, but the mo \"Clements\" y of the weather did not dampen his enthusiasm for his work. This morning he was doing a long dress bill, and the \"Taylor\" is making Brother Isaac a \"MacGregor\" Tartan suit\u2014we will have to see if \"Dad\" can be put to get him into it, for the \"Pattern\" alone will scare him. However, we bribe him by saying that we are going to have \"Makin's\" best tea and everyone will do anything to get a cup of this special brand.\n\nYou must \"single out\" the \"Makin's\" tea\u2014there is a story of another doctor's account hangs over her, and since having \"Kalee\" fever she has become \"Kaley\"\u2014nervous.\n\nDid you know we have our new home almost completely furnished? It has been rather a task for the \"Pov\" of everything is so terrific. You must get \"Jame-on\" to drive you over to call some day. We live in \"Tee-Dale\". We have a new clock \"Bell\" and it surely is a \"buzzer\", so do not be afraid I shall not hear you.\n\nAs ever,\n\nS.

G.\n\nA FEW REASONS WHY THE ADDITIONAL PER CAPITA SHOULD BE GRANTED FOR EXTRA PUPILS\n\nI Some of the Indian children would have absolutely no chance and their status would never be improved. Each case is urged by either Indian Agent or missionary.\n\nSome of the children whom I have had to take not only needed a chance but a home and were taken from homes of comparative destitution.\n\nAmong the last forty names on the register of children received into the school were:\n\n5 fatherless,\n9 motherless,\n1 orphan,\n6 father and mother living apart under deplorable conditions.\n1 committed to the school.\n1 whose right arm is amputated whose tribe feel he would be better cared for at Coqualeetza.\n\nSeveral have had their names on the waiting list two or three years. Many of the above are as needy as they are deserving.\n\nWe have done the work fed clothed and educated the extra pupil without crowding. We have fulfilled the requirements of the agreement the Department has with the church except the important one. The sanction of the Department.\n\nFrom your letter of January 12th, and from conversation with you on this subject last May I felt encouraged to believe provision might be arranged if I could accommodate the children without overcrowding.\n6. As to accommodation, there is absolutely no crowding.\n\n**KITCHEN** The range is a heavy duty Gurney Hotel range, four ovens with surface space for three hundred.\n\n**BAKERY** We do not run it to capacity in either oven space or days per week.\n\n**LAUNDRY** The machinery is well able to take care of the washing without taxing its power.\n\n**DINING-ROOM** Before we took into residence the extra twenty pupils, we had used since the opening of the building little more than three quarters of the large dining-room, two of the tables each accommodating eighteen being unused.\n\n**CLASS-ROOMS** The half day system is maintained except in the case of fifteen pupils in grade VIII and IX, who attend the class-room both morning and afternoon. There are one hundred and forty-seven individual desks. Deducting these fifteen desks there remain one hundred and thirty-two for the balance of the pupils namely two hundred and ten. In other words one hundred and five occupy the one hundred and thirty-two desks each session. There is space for another five desks in the Primary room also in the junior without crowding or giving the appearance of crowding.\n\n**RECREATION ROOM** We have moved one of the old tent dormitories and placed it near the outside dormitory for additional play room. This will be finished to harmonize with the general building scheme.\n\n**DORMITORIES** To meet the increased number of pupils we moved the largest open air dormitory to a suitable location and rebuilt it, boarding the sides with matched lumber then covered the sides with two thicknesses of tar paper, and finally with shingles. We boarded the walls inside with dressed lumber and kalsomined it. This building is sixty feet...\nby eighteen by ten with open space to roof instead of ceiling, electric light is used and a stove for heating. The building is warm and homelike, only an occasional fire was needed last winter. The risk is small and a male officer of the school is always in charge. The beds are similar to those in the main building. No exception can be taken to the supervision as opening into this dormitory is a staff room where two male members sleep either one or the other always being on duty. The boys occupying this building are not over twelve years of age except the trusty monitor, their health has been excellent and their behaviour all that could be desired.\n\nPersonally I feel I have a good case if dealt with on its merits and without prejudice. I admit I took these children to care for in faith I was doing right but without permission being granted.\nThe United Church of Canada\nRev. T. Ferrier\nBrandon, Manitoba\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed is a communication from the Rev. Mr. Raley, Principal of the Coqualeetza School, which is his reply to my enquiry re accommodation for 225 pupils in his institution.\n\nIt will be noted that he has been keeping considerably over 200. His reports will show this. His plea is for payment of the per capita grant for all he has kept and educated.\n\nI will be pleased to endorse this request and recommend it to the favorable consideration of the Department.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\nThe Rev. T. Ferrier  \nSupt of Indian Education  \nand Hospitals for the United Church  \nBRANDON Man.\n\nJuly 22nd, 1926\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI am surprised to learn from your letter of June the 24th, the Department would pay no per capita grant for children who are not sleeping in the main building.\n\nNot knowing the facts which would lead the Department to such a conclusion, I am at a loss to reconcile the idea with the policy of the Government. Has the Department the idea the children to are not supervised by responsible officers of the staff when they are not sleeping in the main building, or are not so warm and comfortable, or that they are not kept in as sanitary and healthful condition?\n\nI may be wrong, but I do not think the Department will turn a deaf ear to your request as representative of the United Church of Canada, for a grant for an extra number of pupils. I am presuming you have urged the case as your letter of Jan. the 12th, and our later business conversation at Sardis, last May would lead me to believe.\n\nYour letter and the almost total rejection of the building and repair account together with the treatment of the per capita holiday allowance would indicate financial stringency. I can hardly\nthink an unsympathetic attitude exists at Ottawa towards Coqualeetza.\n\nI am quite aware I have undertaken work for the school in the interests of Indian children, unauthorized, but looking back over the history of the work of the church in British Columbia, nearly every new phase of the work which has been worth while was started by the man on the ground then recognized and sanctioned by the church.\n\nEnclosed is a statement of few reasons why further consideration might be given to the issue and the payment of the per capita allowed for the extra number we have housed supervised, schooled, fed, housed clothed and educated.\n\nLast night's paper gave the return of the High School Entrance examinations. We sent in six to write and they all passed. One Dorothy Mattheeson ranking the highest in Chilliwack city or centre in the written examination. Tonight's paper brought us also the good news that all the IX grade students passed six wrote. It is a good record for the year 100%.\n\nOn the 24th we hope to hear the good news of Ella Gladstone's success.\n\nWith kind regards\n\nYours sincerely\nAugust 16, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThe Church authorities and the Reverend Principal are urging that the Department allow an increased pupilage at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. The present pupilage is 200. There was, however, an enrolment of 238 for the June quarter. The active enrolment was 217, with an average attendance of 214. The March and December quarters showed average attendances of 219 and 221 respectively.\n\nThe main building has ample facilities for those that are attending, with the exception of dormitory accommodation. The Reverend Principal has utilized one of the former outdoor dormitories, 60'x15'x10'. In this building there are boys under seven and two members of the staff. The dormitory and other domestic arrangements appear to be quite satisfactory for the number enrolled.\n\nThe Church authorities ask that the school be allowed grant for the actual average attendance. I can hardly recommend this, as the management has been given to understand on several occasions that the pupilage was 200. However, as extra pupils are being satisfactorily provided for and educated, I wish to recommend that the pupilage be increased to 220 as from the 1st ultimo on the understanding this is the maximum and that the present suitable arrangements for housing the children are continued.\n\nRussell F. Harris\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, August 17, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI have your letter of the 50th ultimo, requesting that the pupilage of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School be increased. The pupilage at this institution has been placed at 200 and provision for this number is made in our Estimates. To increase our responsibility without arranging for the necessary Vote by Parliament is impossible at the present time, as the funds for Indian Education are extremely limited.

Raley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Residential School,\nSardis, B.C.\nCoqualeetza Residential School\nSardis, B.C.\n\nCommencement Annual\n\nJUNE, 1927\nForeword\n\nThe plea made by the British Columbia Indians to the Indian Department a few years ago for High School privileges is now being met. Already a Junior High School has been in operation at Coqualeetza since 1924, with very gratifying results. Since publishing our last Annual, thirteen of our students tried the Provincial Examinations and thirteen passed (1926). In this connection Coqualeetza desires to express thanks to Principal Woodworth, B.A., and the staff of Chilliwack High School, for tutoring one of our pupils successfully through her Matriculation. We are demonstrating that it is quite possible for the native boys and girls of British Columbia to take a High School course with great advantage to themselves and the community. The brighter pupils through this course try out their capabilities in self analysis and find themselves, and their best suited activity in life. It is true there are failures\u2014the same is true of all peoples\u2014but the failure, or partial failure of some is due largely to the fact that they drift into unsuited employment upon leaving school. To help a graduate of the school in a wise selection of the work for which he is best fitted, is to render a most valuable service.\n\nWe are demonstrating also that it is quite possible, under satisfactory classroom conditions, to complete up to the seventh grade, a grade a year, even when but half a day is being spent at academic work, and the other half at pre-vocational training.\n\nThe time is approaching when, under the influence of Christian education, the citizenship of Canada will be enriched by the enfranchisement of a large number of progressive Indian youths.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated at Sardis, B.C.,\nJune, 1927.\nFounders' Day\n\nThe 21st of October\u2014Founders' Day\u2014was celebrated in the usual manner. The first order of the day was the Flag Raising ceremony, conducted by Principal Ralph; followed by Tree Planting, where Mrs. Ralph, Mrs. H. White, Rev. Dr. White, Miss Wilson, the Principal, Mr. Fordham (the Head Master), and a number of other members of the Staff and Student Body put in a row of young maples along the driveway, to stand a living and lasting memorial through the years to come.\n\nIn the afternoon a football match between the Coqualeetza Team and the Chilliwack High School Team was played on the field. Though the Coqualeetza boys were beaten 3-0, we find it impossible to report that two of the three winning goals were shot by one of our own students, George Wilson, playing on the High School Team. After the game our boys entertained the visitors to tea and games, then the Coach of the High School Team, Mr. T. R. Smith, addressed us with a very pleasant concert, including readings and songs several of which were of his own composition.\n\nAccording to custom, the school was thrown open to the public during the day, and a number of visitors availed themselves of the privilege of seeing what is being done, and how it is done, in our institution.\n\nValedictory Address\n\nJUNE, 1927\n\nAnother year has passed, and we, the 1927 Graduates, are about to leave school for goods, as we say, and go out into the world of which we know but little, but where we hope to make a mark and things that we have been taught during our days at Coqualeetza. Throughout our school life we have been looking forward to this time with eager expectation. Now that it has arrived a feeling of sadness comes over us at the thought of saying goodbye to the many pupils and teachers who have been our friends. Often in our future life we will look back and recall the many happy times we have had here among them, and treasure their patronage and kindness. We shall go abroad, possibly even in another country than Canada, we will try by our example to be a credit to our school. We have the joy of knowing that it was the greatest wish of our people that we should have this opportunity of education, which enables us to find out our talents and develop our best qualities, and although it will be our earnest endeavor to justify their hopes in us. In saying goodbye, we thank our teachers. The influence they have exerted on us during our school days will be a power for good in our future lives, and we know that their best wishes follow us.\n\n(Signed) MINNIE E.

Principal Bailey.\n\nPresident, Max John Barton.\n\nSecretary, Miss Wilson Gordon.\n\nRepresentative of Staff, Miss Gordon.\n\nRepresentative of Girls' League, Dorothy Matheson.\n\nRepresentative of Athletic Association, Hector Moses.\n\nRepresentative of Entrance Class, Robert Gray.\n\nRepresentative of Lower Class, Peter Antoine.\n\nPeter Antoine, Hattie Morrison, Minnie Wilson, Henry Castle.\n\nInteresting meetings have been held regularly, and on two occasions meetings have been held in conjunction with the Staff, for the discussion of joint problems and the development of a spirit of cooperation.\n\nChurch Anniversary Services\n\n\"COQUALEETZA SUNDAY\"\n\nJune 26th, 1927\n\nThere will be special music at the School Choir, and the address to the Graduating Class will be delivered by the Rev. Principal W. H. Smith, D.D., of Westminster Hall, Vancouver, B.C. Following this will be the presentation of Bibles.\n\nThere will be an offering taken at this service on behalf of the \"Coqualeetza Chapel Fund.\" For many years the need of a suitable place in which to worship on the Lord's Day has been felt. The present building provides such a place, but there is not enough space to accommodate our regular Sunday congregation; hence during the week it is used for all kinds of social gatherings, parties, all types of lectures, moving pictures, and various forms of amusement. It is felt that in order to inculcate a fitting spirit of reverence in the hearts of the school students, the work of the chapel should be conducted in a manner kept wholly sacred to such purposes. With this aim in view of erecting such an edifice, the \"Coqualeetza Chapel Fund\" was instituted in September, 1916. The \"nest egg\" of the Fund was $2.50 conscience money sent in by a friend. This was deposited \"In Trust\" in the Bank of Toronto, Vancouver. On November 30th the interest on it was $1.00 cents. The fund was starting to grow. It has been growing ever since, until up to date (June 10th, 1927), it stands at $701.19. No public appeal has been made, but on Graduation Sunday the offering is devoted to this purpose; a yard of adhesive tape on the piano in the Principal's residence has received hundreds of pieces of small change; a few private donations have been received; there is one lady member of the Staff who subscribed one dollar; a monetary offering is placed in a special box covered with Indian designs for receiving any donation; visitors and others may from time to time wish to give. This offertory box stands at the entrance of the Assembly Hall, and is opened once a month and the contents deposited \"in trust\" in the Bank of Toronto. The number of the account is 2245. Our objective is $10,000.00.\n\nCoqualeetza Alumni Association\n\nA strong branch of the Alumni is established at Skidegate, and during the year has been a most helpful and popular association. The ideal is \"Service,\" the word being chosen by Miss Selma Cross. The Alma Mater is justly proud of its activities during the year. Its charter officers are President, Mr. Albert Jones; Secretary, Mr. Henry Green; Treasurer, Mr. Solomon Wilson.\nChoir\n\nStanding: Roland Watson, Mr. C. H. Lovell, Peter Antunes, Robert Gray, Principal Riley, Ernest Wilson, Percy Barton, Jack Johnson, Mrs. H. Raley, Dorothy Wilson.\n\nSeated: Violet Albany, Miss Colman, Miss Milmont, Miss K. Clarke, Mrs. H. Raley, Dorothy Wilson.\n\nFront Row: Clarence Wesley, Miss Matheson, Lucy Jones, Minnie Wilson.\n\nUnfortunately the Conductor, Mr. Bartendale, under whose able tutelage the Choir has done splendid work, was unable to be present when the picture was taken. We have included this year a set of new Anthem books, in which he has been very busy to supply. We might mention that although \"Trooki\" is not officially a member of the Choir he has such a lovely voice that he quite fittingly takes a place in our picture.\n\nEntertainments, Concerts and Special Services\n\nOur Christmas Day Service this year was held in Carman Church, which was kindly lent us by the Board of Managers.\n\nCultus Day and Kelgard were not forgotten by the Choir, and both were visited. Two entertainments were held at both places, under the direction of Miss Colman and the Fine Music Room, and were very much enjoyed.\n\nArmistice Day Service was conducted with particular solemnity on November 11th. It commenced with flag-raising and lowering, ringing of the school bell, the playing of Taps, and the observance of the two-minute silence, followed by the tolling of the bell.\n\nThe Board of Managers very kindly invited all who cared to come from Coqualeetza to join a special concert given by the Choir and a guest player: \"A Pair of Gloves.\" A large number of the students and staff took advantage of the opportunity, and enjoyed the very creditable entertainments.\n\nThis Variety Festival Season during the year were celebrated by the Choir. At Halloween we gave four different parties, each of different grades; likewise at Christmas, and at St. Valentine's Day. Our Easter Party, as is customary, took the form of a Masquerade on New Year's Night. The concerts were especially well done, the best being: Peterkin, Gertrude Lawson, \"Easter\"; School Column, Hatte Macdonald, \"Easter\"; School Column, \"Percy\"; Funnister, Ronald Harris, \"Monkey\"; Coqualeetza Staff, \"Christmas.\" This year took the form of a Variety Concert. A number of musical items were contributed by the Choir, Miss Colman, Miss Young and Miss Milmont's piano pupils, while the C.G.I.T. Girls did several very pretty costume drills. The programme was well arranged and excellently carried out.\n\nMiss Evelyn Kayser, who has been studying under Miss Mary E. Harvey, Vancouver during the past year, gave us several musical selections.\n\nWe Are Invited to the German Church Choir for two splendid musical treats. On November 25th they came and sang their Thanksgiving Cantata, \"The Giver Divine,\" in our Assembly Hall. On December 23rd they came again, this time for Christmas Cantata, \"The Life of Christ,\" which was most effectively interest on the part of Carman Choir, as well as the beautiful music.\n\nMiss Margaret Harvey of the Coqualeetza Staff rendered most valuable assistance in editing the Commencement Annual this year.\n\nMusic lovers amongst us were accorded a rare treat last November, when a concert was held in our Assembly Hall under the auspices of the LO D.C. The artists were Miss Amy Fleming, Con- tralto, Gold Medalist of the B.C. Musical Festival of last year, who sang a wide variety of songs with wonderful sympathy; Miss Bliss Gwinn, baritone, Love, Pannini, who played several delightful pieces on the piano; and Miss Evelyn Kayser, her teacher, Miss Mabel Winners, Lady Principal of Colonie.\n\nAn Interesting Concert of the session was that put on by the Band, under the capable direction of Mr. James Murray's band. A number of amusing skits, several musical items, and a boy solo, \"The Boy Scout,\" by Donald Murray, Mr. Harvey Lusham, from Vancouver, assisted towards making an affair of real merit. The Scouts had earned the right to their Entertainer's Badges. The decision was unanimous and hearty in their favour.\n\nPage Nine\nC.G.I.T. Leaders, 1927\n\nStanding: Mary Underwood, Lydia Young, Delaina Allard, Ruth Castle (Group President).\n\nThe C.G.I.T. is a new organization, but from the very first it has held the interest of the girls. There have been many interesting activities, such as dancing, skating, and other things which have been enjoyed. Two costume drills contributed to the Christmas concert were well received. The Christmas project was the dressing of dolls for poor children. The short hikes taken from time to time, and all the activities of the organization through the year have been thoroughly enjoyed by the members.\n\nOur Boy Scouts\n\nThis has been an active year for the scouts. The meetings have been enjoyed, and several splendid hikes taken. Good work has been done by the scouts toward getting their badges, and in this they were greatly aided by their Patrol Leaders, Percy Gladstone, Peter Antoine, James Joseph, Eli Tate. Percy Gladstone's patrol has been the most successful. Interest was stimulated, early in April, by the collection of money for the war. On the 26th of May, the annual meeting of the District was held at Chilliwack. Patrol Leaders' Council, which held its Easter Camp in Chilliwack. Speakers at the afternoon meeting in the Assembly Hall included Mr. Robert Gray, Mr. Leslie Price, Mr. W. H. Wilson, District Commissioner, Mr. William Comissioner Carbin, Principal Riley, Mr. Leslie Price, Chilliwack Scoutmaster, and Mr. Wayne, President, Patrol Leaders' Council. After the speeches the scouts adjourned at a Supper served by the ladies of the school, and attended by about a hundred delegates. The function was approved by all as establishing and cementing a bond of friendship between our Scouts and the others of the District. The Scout Committee for the year was composed of Principal Riley (Scout), Miss McGregor, Mrs. Palmer and Mr. Stewart, and Robert Gray was Troop Leader.\n\nOur Cadets\n\nA visit from Col. Hill of Ottawa, Col. Conne and Capt. Connington, all leaders in the Cadet Corps, meant, resulted in the development of a Cadet Corps in the school, under the leadership of Lieut. Price. No boy can be a Cadet until he has passed the Tenderfoot Scout Tests. We have, however, over thirty Cadets already, working at the regulation physical drill and musketry.\n\nPage Ten\n\nCommencement Annual\n\nRecital\n\nAuditorium, 7:00 p.m., Thursday, June 16th\n\n\"GOD SAVE THE KING\"\n\nAloha\n\nCOQUALTEZA ORCHESTRA\n\nWaltz Duet\n\nLUCY JONES\n\nMinnie Wesley\n\nPreser\n\nNarcissus\n\nHATTIE MORRISON\n\nSlater\n\nA Prayer\n\nRUTH CASTLE\n\nBeethoven\n\nTimbrel\n\nRUTH CASTLE\n\nMISS MILNOM\n\nFirst Rose Waltz\n\nMADELINE PARNELL\n\nPreser\n\nOn the River, Violin Solo\n\nDOROTHY MATHESON\n\nCarr\n\nMinuet in G\n\nLUKE NELSON\n\nMISS MILNOM\n\nBeethoven\n\nSchmuckt\n\nROALDING WATSON\n\nSchubert\n\nNapolitaine\n\nETHEL COLLINSON\n\nSartoris\n\nAt Evening\n\nMINNIE WILSON\n\nWallenbaupt\n\nFeu Folleti, Op. 45, No. 2\n\nALBERTA JONES\n\nSimple Aria\n\nMARJORIE BARTON\n\nThom\n\nAlla Minuetto, Violin Solo\n\nCLARENCE WESLEY\n\nCarr\n\nL'Aviendic, Op. 45, No. 2\n\nEUGEN TATE\n\nHeller\n\nSparklets\n\nROBERT GRAY\n\nMoler\n\nL'Havodelle, Op. 108, No. 24\n\nALBERTA JONES\n\nBergmuller\n\nLonging for Home\n\nMINNIE WESLEY\n\nJungmann\n\nGrand March, Op. 102\n\nCOQUALTEZA ORCHESTRA\n\nJohnson\n\nThe Recital is given by the pupils of Mrs. Edstrom and Miss Milnom.\n\nPage Eleven\nSocial and Personal\n\nOver our ex-graduates, Miss Isabel Robinson, who was recently engaged, being chosen \"Queen of the May\" at Kitimat.\n\nShortly after the New Year, Mrs. Baker entertained at her home in the honour of the school and one of the Staff Council. Games and music were enjoyed by the guests.\n\nOn Two Different Occasions this year, October 7th and June 1st, the E.O.D. Club held business meetings in the School's Recreation Rooms, followed by a social time. We are very grateful for their cooperation.\n\nWe wish to take this opportunity to thank Mrs. E. Mitchell of Vancouver for her kindness and courtesy in making and carrying out the plans for the Vancouver excursion when they were making connections between St. John's and the North.\n\nDuring the past year Coqualeetza has been visited by delegates from several conventions, among them being the Provincial Women's Institutes, the Board of Trade and the Provincial C.C.A.\n\nCoqualeetza has been very fortunate to receive a call from one of its former instructors, Mr. Linton McKie and his bride, Mrs. and Mr. McKie visited us during their stay in Vancouver, and we felt flattered by their interest in driving up to pay their respects.\n\nIt is with deep regret that we announce that the Honorable and Reverend T. R. Penney again expects to be with us on our Annual Field and Sports Day. However, he has participated in this event for so many years now, and taken so deep an interest in the welfare of the school, that it cannot be regarded as quite indispensable to the success of the occasion.\n\nThe Reception to the Graduates on June 12th was most pleasingly erection. The guests of honour were Edna Harris, Manager of the Ladies' Auxiliary, while the hosts of the evening were the staff and the Students' Council. Music and games were much enjoyed, and the whole affair ended in the happy memory of a very happy evening.\n\nTo the regret of both students and staff (excepting the members of the Students' Council), Mr. McKie was forced to return to his home in the middle of the term owing to the serious illness of his wife. Before leaving, Mr. McKie entertained the members of the Students' Council at a moving picture in Chilliwack.\n\nWe Have Two Witnesses to report among the ex-pupils. Miss Edna Weather, who graduated last year, married Mr. Robert Crosby in Skagitain in December, and Mrs. Weather joined us here up until November, when she was called home by the death of her father. Our sympathy goes out to Mr. Frank Jones, also a graduate of Coqualeetza. Both couples have our very best wishes for happiness and prosperity.\n\nAmong the Inspectors who have visited us during the year have been Rev. Thompson Ferrer, Inspector of Indian Schools; Mr. and Mrs. McMillan, Inspectors of Schools for the United Church, who paid us two visits; Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Inspectors of Schools for the Province, who was also here twice; Provincial Public School Inspector Daniels; Provincial Superintendent of Schools Mr. W. M. Agent Daunt of New Westminster.\n\nWe Wish Very Sorry, early in the session, to lose the services of Miss Clement, who had been in the school for several years, and who left us to take charge of the administration of a large school but was made to Miss Clement, as a token of our regard. Miss E. Griffiths, B.A., Senior Matron, has been obliged to be transferred to leave us in the middle of the term, under doctor's orders. We have been very fortunate nearly through her efforts that the Coqualeetza pupils were successful last year. The school has been visited by the Hon. Mrs. of Vancouver.\n\nTo the Deep Regret of All, our Matron, Miss E. B. Bell, was forced to tender her resignation due to ill-health. A farewell reception was held at the school in her honour, and presented her with a basket of fruit, a dress, a cake (a brain disease kettle), and a card. Miss Bell is recovering (we pray), and it is the wish of all her friends here that she may soon be able to return to us. The place as matron has been taken up by Mrs. A. G. Palmer, Assistant Matron, who has been with us this year has been Miss Nellie Simms, of Toronto, Children's Work Secretary of the Board of Religious Education of the United Church of Canada, who is a daughter of the late Rev. John Simms, Principal of the Missionary College in Edmonton at Norwood House thirty or forty years ago; Miss Simms has been connected with the Y.W.C.A., Vancouver, niece of the Rev. T. A. Moore, Secretary of the General Assembly of the United Church of Canada, and Miss Cooke, a noted Indian Entertainer, from Ottawa. Miss Victoria Macdonald, who is the wife of one of recognized merit; Dr. C. H. Heaslet, General Secretary of the Canadian Council of Churches; Dr. D. Chalmers, D.D., LL.D., of Toronto; and Dr. C. E. Macklin, life-long friend of our School's Doctor, J. H. Macdonald, who was a pioneer doctor and explorer, whose son, we might mention, was one of Shackleton's companions in his expeditions to the South Pole.\n\nPage Twelve\n\nLecture Course\n\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL is greatly indebted to the University Extension Lecturers and others who have periodically given us the benefit of their services. The 1926-1927 Course has been a very successful one, and we are pleased to announce the new features introduced during this year, in having each lecture preceded by a musical number. These have been contributed largely by members of the staff and the students, the School Choir, and the students' band. We are also very grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, who has been responsible for the most successful arrangement of these musical numbers. After each lecture a pleasant social hour was enjoyed when the students of the staff met the lecturer. Following is a list of the lectures which have had the opportunity of hearing this season:\n\n1927\n\nJanuary 11\u2014Principal Baker, \"History of Nations.\"\n\nFebruary 5\u2014Prof. John Davison, U.B.C., \"Botanical Hints for Amateur Gardener.\" (Demonstrated)\n\nFebruary 8\u2014Rev.

In addition, we are indebted to the following speakers:\n\nREV. HUGH DOBSON\n\n\"The Ethics of Alcoholics Beverages\"\n\nH. J. BARBER, ESQ., M.P.\n\n\"National Parks of Canada\"\n\nJ. L. STARK, ESQ.\n\n\"Illustrated\"\n\n\"Across Canada\" and \"A Trip To Europe\"\n\nINSPECTOR R. H. CAIRNS\n\n\"Visit To Indian Schools of B.C.\"\n\nT. H. WILKINSON, Dominion Forestry Department\n\n\"Illustrated\"\n\n\"Forest Preservation\"\n\nREV. T. FERRIER\n\n\"Illustrated\"\n\n\"Seeds\"\n\nAmong the interesting Sunday speakers we have enjoyed hearing Miss Isabel Winters, Lady Principal of Columbian College, New Westminster, who gave a most helpful address on \"Boarding School Ideals\"; Rev. J. T. Murray, pastor of the United Church, Belcarra, British Columbia, who preached a series of three Sunday sermons giving a fascinating sketch of missionary work in the British West Indies; Miss Dorien Milson, who gave an inspiring talk on the Bible Hills Residential School in Saskatchewan at which opportunity she taught Miss Anna Fournier, Member of the Religious Education Council; Rev. Principal Lett, Mr. Earle Ashfield and Mr. Robert Henderson, all of whom from George's School, Toronto; Rev. P. S. Scott, of the Anglican Church, delivered Mr. Arthur Sutton, U.B.C.; and others.\n\nWe have had a number of Fine Moving Picture Shows throughout the season, the films being sent from the Film and Slide Corporation in Vancouver, and several missionary lantern slides, with accompanying pictures were sent out from the United Church Offices, Toronto. Also slides lent by the Postal Authorities, depicting the various post office operations in Canada.\nItems of Interest\n\nA LATE SPILL of cold and frosty weather last winter made it impossible for us to erect a skating rink on the playground which they much enjoyed.\n\nWe have GREATLY ENJOYED the reading of \"The Coqualeetza,\" the Quarterly Review of St. George's Residential Indian School at Port Hope, which has been sent us by Mr. Macdonald.\n\nOur boys who attend the Technical High School in Chilliwack were privileged this year, as last, in being taken on their Instruction Mr. T. W. G. Colman, to visit a number of the largest industrial plants in Vancouver. A very pleasant and profitable day was had.\n\nThe Annual Collection with the Maintenance and Extension Fund was made this year by Rev. J. T. Burchill, late of Belcarra, and Mr. Colman. The amount subscribed to that we were able to send away $48.00 in excess of our objective of $275.00. Miss Colman ably attended to the collection during the year along with the collection and remittance of the money.\n\nThe Christmas Decorations this year were especially worthy of mention. A number of everything imaginable were made by the students and these, with holly berries and bright mottoes made the hall a veritable Christmas tree. We also had an interesting display of paintings by the students, representing the Three Wise Men going to worship the baby Jesus. This was placed whole spread over the back of the Assembly Hall platform.\n\nThis Music Department of the school is growing steadily in interest and numbers. We have a class of twenty taking piano lessons this year, and two classes found it necessary to purchase an extra piano in order to accommodate them. In addition to this, three students are learning to play the violin. This year we shall have four pupils and two pupils in viola will try the Royal Academy Music Examinations in Chilliwack.\n\nTranquil Our Football Team was eliminated early from the league owing to the fact that we had really not the weight this year to compete with the other teams. However, yet considerable football has been enjoyed. We have tried to keep up our enthusiasm for the sport of the present of a football to our boys on his visit to us in October. The Department of Indian Affairs has supplied us with a number of balls this season.\n\nCoqualeetza is doing what it can to foster the Native Art. The facilities of the Art Room are used by the drawing classes in the schoolroom and last year a number of paintings of Telkwa, Penticton and other places were exhibited at the Vancouver Exhibition. In the Manual Training classes the pupils are encouraged to employ Native Art designs in the making of their models. A class in basketry has been established for the purpose of making baskets for the Fraser and Thompson River Basket Making\u2014these are, a cup basket based upon the design of the decorated Salish Indians; conventional designs of a geometrical pattern by imitation.\n\nALASKA THIS YEAR. Coqualeetza has demonstrated its ability to hold its own in various contests in which we have competed. We are proud to have won the first prize and second place diploma to all Indian Schools in the Province of British Columbia for the best written composition. A num- ber of prizes, a first and second, were also won for our short stories entered in the contest at the Chilliwack Exhibition. In a Ploughing Match held at Chilliwack, James Joseph came third in the ploughing competition under the plough and took first place for the best finish. Two of our boys, David and Robert, thereupon proceeded to amuse themselves by taking first prize in a Banjo Contest held at the Strand Theatre, Chilliwack. They first, then played a well arranged program and were by the Management to repeat their performance on another occasion.\n\nDepartmental Reports, 1927\n\nACADEMIC\n\nGRADE X: Hector Moses, Marjorie Barton, Donald Collinson, Chilliwack High School.

We have enjoyed a very happy year with our girls and boys. The health has been very good, except for an outbreak of a mild type of measles, which caused a little delay to the work for a short period but caused no serious cases and the students were able to make up for lost time quickly. The work in all departments has been carried on in the most satisfactory manner, and splendid progress has been made.\n\nThe following girls have done excellent work, and are worthy to receive certificates: Eden Harris, Lucy Joseph, Violet Albany. Special mention is made of the following Juniors: Ruth Castle, Alice Percival, Mercy Wesley, and Delvina Allard.\n\nCULINARY DEPARTMENT\n\nMiss A. M. E. Hare\n\nTheory, 1\u00bd hours; application, 18 hours, weekly.\n\nThe value of a well cooked meal to the human needs is well understood, and it has been the aim of this Department to supply those needs.\n\nExtra classes have been made on such days as Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc., to have meals suitable for those occasions.\n\nThere has been a short course of lessons in cooking in addition to the practical work of cooking, and we know we have really good cooks among our girls. We desire to mention especially: Effie Colman, Violet Albany, Violet Albany, and Edna Tate, Ruth Castle, Grace White, and for the most improvement, Alice Williams.\n\nBAKERY\n\nIn charge of Miss J. Meek\n\nA VERY busy department is the Bakery, where during the year the boys convert about thirty tons of flour into 45,000 large loaves of a quality of bread which among the students' body has kept the standard of quality high. Further than this, a baker producing an inferior batch is apt to visit upon himself an almost unbearable measure of unpopularity within the student body. It pays to have good bread.\n\nSpecial mention: James Joseph, James Collinson, Percy Barton.\nLAUNDRY\nMiss M. E. Taylor\n\nTheory, 1/2 hour; application, 22 hours weekly.\n\nMotto: \"Cleanliness is next to Godliness.\"\n\nFor several years now the laundry has been run by Miss Taylor, and we feel that she has done an excellent job. The machines are in splendid order, and the work is strictly supervised. Our 220 girls and boys are kept clean and tidy at all times. They receive a thorough training in this important branch of housekeeping. One of our specialities is that of pressing.\n\nSpecial mention is made of Constance Jones, Rosalind Watson, Beatrice Jones, Rose Woods, Lena Joseph.\n\nSEWING ROOM\nMiss A. Palmer & Miss E. Scott\n\nTheory, 1/2 hour; practice, 18 hours weekly.\n\nHere we strive to make our girls useful by giving them a thorough knowledge of how to cut out and make garments for both boys and girls. Every week a certain number of garments are required from each girl, and during the sewing period they are taught how to help themselves when ill. The girls get through a vast amount of work. Then there is the mending and darnsing, which is taught in another bright room, and the large pile that are needed to keep the boys and girls comfortably clothed. Each girl makes a complete outfit for herself before graduating. The boys' uniforms are also partially made by the pupils. The following girls are commended for their work: Constance Jones, Clara Gray, Gertrude Lawson, and the following boys: Betty Barton, Emily Lee, and Louisa Smith.\n\nNURSING\nMiss H. M. Callison (Field Matron)\n\nThe season 1926-27 has been an exceptionally healthy one. During one epidemic, Measles, of which there were one hundred and four cases, there has been very little sickness. We have had the usual little colds, coughs, and ear-aches, etc., few cases of which have been serious. We have had but one birth, but all have made satisfactory recoveries, and the children are in good condition physically.\n\nDuring the hop-picking season, the Nurse gave attention to about 120 patients at the hopyards, and throughout the year she has visited the sick and attended to the matters affecting the vicinity.\n\nREPORT OF MANUAL TRAINING INSTRUCTOR\nMrs. A. J. Jamieson\n\nThe Instruction Department makes report of what has, in the opinion of the instructors, been a most successful year's work. A very wide range of subjects occupied some time this term, from small projects involving decorative work in Indian Motifs, to fairly large and more ambitious efforts. Mechanical drawing also entered into the curriculum, and the boys were given a chance to express their ideas in pencil without ever using a draughtsman, delighting to work with pencil and paper.\n\nTo the teacher's satisfaction, a great interest remains in the minds of the young Native in the strange things they have learned during the past year. It is pleasing to see this end to know that in the Grade departments and the Technical alike these things are being kept alive and fostered, thus assuring the future of the Manual Training Department.\n\nNoting the enthusiasm of the majority of the boys under his care, the Manual Instructor feels sure that handwork amongst the Indians is one of the best agencies for the uplift of our youth from the crude and primitive stage to the more advanced. The walls of Coqualeetza.\n\nAs a concrete proof of the efficacy of the work which goes on, one can only wonder at the seven-year-old boy who came to the school last fall to learn to join, and his Senior Brother (Carpentry), and with the exception of two, the pupils passed in the most satisfactory manner.\n\nThe following pupils graduated:\n\n1st Class: Robert Gray, Clarence Wesley, David Mason, Ronald Harris, Percy Barton (2nd year).\n\n2nd Class: Charles Collinson, James Collinson (2nd year), James Joseph (2nd year).\n\n3rd Class: James Jones, Willie Lemon, Bert Nelson, James Barlow, Percy Jones.\n\n4th Class: William Smith, Robert Smith, Cecil Brown, Luke Nelson, Louis Williams.\n\nThese young boys have only been in a short time, and one cannot tell how they may do at this class of work. They are quiet, willing boys, and it is a credit to their instructors.\n\nCARPENTRY\n\nConsiderable carpentry has been done through the year. A new floor was put in the Annex, and also the barn has been sealed and painted white. Besides this some general repair work has been done and the Senior Manual boys have thus demonstrated in a practical way what they have learned under the able instruction of Mr. Jamieson.\n\nMECHANICAL ENGINEERING\nEngineer, Mr. J. Wright\n\nThis Department was successfully conducted through the winter by Mr. Elwyn Hopkins, who recently left to fill a position where his abilities will have a wider scope. He is succeeded by Mr. J. Wright.\n\nMr. Hopkins organized and developed a blacksmith Department, where a number of boys are receiving instruction in a regular course.\n\nThe following boys are commended for good work in the Boiler-room: Percy Barton, and Johnny Monette.\n\nSHOE REPAIRING DEPARTMENT\n\nDuring the season some seven hundred pairs of shoes have been repaired by Mr. Fordred and his assistants. These boys, Harry Castle, Charlie Howard, and David Mason, passed their Boy Scout tests for Proficiency certificates and badges in connection with this Department. Special mention is made of David Mason (a most excellent shoemaker), and Allan Brooks.\n\nAGRICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE\nMr. P. F. Price, O.A.C.\n\nFARM\nMr. L. R. Stewart\n\nThe regular farm work has been delayed considerably this year by a cold, backward spring. In spite of this, however, there is a fine stand of growing grain, and a very promising crop of hay.\n\nThe cows have been doing well. Four excellent heifers have been recently added to the herd, purchased from the Chilliwack Cow Testing Association.\n\nIn our well-run pigsty two recent litters of little pigs have brought considerable amusement and pleasure to everyone.\n\nHenry Castle has distinguished himself as a Teamster and all-round Farmer. Percy Barton, Willie Lemon, and David Mason have been the most dependable hands on the farm. Small crops of vegetables are also worthy of mention. We have not had such large boys this year as last, yet our farm work throughout has shown great improvement.\n\nGARDEN\n\nWe have had an intensely busy spring with our Landscape Gardening, fruit and vegetables. Our fruit trees are in very good condition, and the boys have been very attentive to the care of the apple trees. The apple and pear crops will be light, but there is a considerable showing of cherries and plums, and the boys are very intent among the raspberry and loganberry blossoms. We have extended the orchard and garden somewhat, and our vegetables look very promising.\n\nDavid Mason is the outstanding gardener. Charlie Howard, George Brown, and Johnny Thomas are worth mentioning. A great deal of work has been accomplished. In spite of the fact that the garden, as on other Farms, the boys are much smaller than last year, the result of their work far exceeds that of last year.\n\nYARDS AND GROUND\n\nThe grounds have been well kept by many \"silver broochers\" under the supervision of Monitors, James Collinson being the best Yard Monitor. The general conduct of the boys, with a very few exceptions, has been good although occasionally some get over the boundary lines. Yet they have adhered to school regulations above the average this year.\nAnnual Track Meet\n\n25th and 27th June, 1927\n\nTHE \"HENEGE\" CHAMPIONSHIP SHIELD (SENIOR BOYS)\nWinners\u20141915, Ed.

TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE EDUCATION; MEDAL IS WON BY COQUALEETZA GIRL\n\nSARDIS, February 25.\u2014The demand for education in every branch of learning is wonderfully increasing among the native Indian population of British Columbia,\" states Principal Raley of the Coqualeetza residential school which is located at Sardis.\n\nAs a striking example of this Mr. Raley mentioned that Miss Minnie Wesley, 18-year-old pupil of this school has brought honor to herself, her people and the Coqualeetza school by winning the gold medal recently awarded her by the National Council of Canada for her essay on \"The Place of Confederation in the History of Canada.\"\n\nThis competition was open to all Indian schools in the Dominion and there were fifteen thousand competitors. Miss Wesley also won the prize for the highest average marks.\n\nPrincipal Raley further stated that there are 74 residents and 250 Indian children in the Dominion of Coqualeetza ranking highest in the number of resident pupils and the chiefest in B.C. coastal districts from the Straits of San Juan to the border of Alaska.\n\nThe Coqualeetza buildings are modern in every respect and though not yet completed, including the paved highway, have a site of about 90 acres, most of which is under cultivation. The produce is utilized on the premises. The total pupil roll at the present time stands at over 220, with a staff of eighteen. During the winter months a course of religious lectures are given at the school to the pupils by various professors from the University of British Columbia and other places. The general public is admitted.\n\nLast Tuesday Rev. P. R.

C.\n\nPrincipal Coqualeetza Residential School urges annual vacation be extended to two months -STOP- Please let me have recommendation.\n\nA. F. MacKENZIE\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 2)\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI am writing you for authority to extend the holidays for the pupils of Coqualeetza for two weeks.\n\nI gather from a circular letter sent out from the Alert Bay School that a two months holiday is being authorized there this year, and when I was up the Northwest Coast two weeks ago I was besieged with requests to let the children have the same holidays at Coqualeetza as at Alert Bay. In a number of homes there are children attending both schools, and you can readily see that a difficult situation arises out of the unfavorable discrimination, one school having two months holidays and another six weeks. Do not think, however, that I am complaining in any sense whatever of the extension allowed at Alert Bay, where doubtless, it is as necessary as it is at Coqualeetza, for the various reasons outlined below.\n\nFirst, I feel that ten and a half months is a very long period for Indian children to be confined in residence. The Indian child, more than any other, requires all the holiday it is possible to give him. There is no doubt but that they become exceedingly restless with a long period of routine. I know it is urged that they have a break at Christmas and Easter, but in the case of our school this does not take them away from the building, nor does it confer much benefit, owing to climatic conditions, weather vagaries, which make it impossible to spend fifty percent of the time out of doors.\n\nThe beneficial effect of a fortnight's extension at this time of the year on the health of the Indian child is beyond question, especially if they are fortunate enough to be favoured with plenty of sunshine, the real force and vitalizer. It will result in a greater resistance to disease, greater physical fitness, and consequent greater mental activity, benefits which would certainly repay the extra holiday. The children can spend practically all their time out-of-doors in the sunshine and fresh air. We have to remember the winter is coming on and the body wants building up to withstand the rigours of the winter and the routine of the long term. Further, the high temperature of the classroom in August in British Columbia does not conserve the physical well being of the child, nor help to stimulate concentrated effort. This year the extension would be particularly grateful, on account of the severe epidemic of measles through which we passed - but in any case the gain physically would be unquestionable, and deserves to be considered on its merits.\n\nLooked at from the academic standpoint there would be no real loss, as we have adopted the provincial system largely, the classrooms not opening till the last September, with the result that pupils are in residence for two weeks without academic work. As you know, we are getting tangible results, and gradually leading the Indians of the villages from which the pupils are recruited to a higher plane of living. We do not feel that an extra two weeks holidays would in any way hinder these results, but would, on the contrary, help to secure greater\nefficiency in the education of these children during the coming year.\n\nA further point is that the parents are anxious to have their children earn a little money, and remain till the end of August at the cemeteries. Last year the fishing was a complete failure in the north, and the Indian people suffered severely financially in consequence.\n\nThus, as you see, the doctor's, teacher's, and parents' viewpoints are all in agreement as to the desirability of a lengthened summer holiday, and I might say I have talked the matter over with Mr. Indian Agent Collison of the Skeena River Agency, and also is heartily in sympathy with the idea for this year.\n\nWe cannot afford the extension unless granted by the Indian Department. Last year I extended holidays for a number and lost so much per capita that to do so again would make financing a burden that should hardly be expected.\n\nI am not asking this to be a precedent, but to meet a present condition on its merits, and should it be granted it would be without prejudice to any future changes or decisions deemed wise by the Department.\n\nIf my suggestion appeals to you, would you kindly let me know your decision at the earliest opportunity.\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. G. H. Raley,\nPrincipal\nOttawa, March 4, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, requesting information regarding the Coqualeetsa Indian Residential School.

The fare would be $2.85, the lesson probably $2.00; in addition there would be lunch and carfare. If he could have a six months trial beginning the first of January it will be excellent, the cost would be approximately $150.00\n\nThe boy has talent above the ordinary, he practices well and faithfully and the training would not be lost.\n\nTrusting it might be possible to give favorable consideration to this request, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.

The next lowest is from the Tait, Pipe & Foundry Co., Ltd., Vancouver.

In the letter I mentioned the fact of my conversation with you as above stated. Dr. Scott in reply, letter No. 153-0-1 dated \"Ottawa July 22nd, 1929,\" wrote as follows, \"when Commissioner Ditchburn forwards the statement of incidental expenses to which you refer we shall be pleased to make payment.\"\n\nI did not want if possible to take advantage of this offer and met part of the expenses from the Coqualeetza Scout Association and privately. This represents the balance and so I hasten to forward before the close of the year.\n\nWith kind regards and thanking you for your interest,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"G.H. Raley\"\nPrincipal.\nA.

RALEY\nPrincipal of Capuiletza Residential School\nFOREWORD\n\nCOQUALEETZA Institute for forty years has been a unit in the educational work of the Province of British Columbia.\n\nThe present economic requirements of all people demand that schools provide instruction along eminently practical lines. The Indian Department of Canada, in conjunction with the Church, with commendable foresight and enthusiasm is providing a system of modern training institutions or residential schools, with an essentially vocational foundation which will fit the Indian youth of both sexes as fully as possible for the life of their immediate future and the changing conditions which may affect their more remote future.\n\nThe highest aim is to make christian citizens of the pupils, and so they are taught to \"Fear God,\" and \"Honor the King.\" We seek to give the girls a clear idea of what true womanhood means. This embraces a study of the virtues and graces which go to make happy homes. For the boys we crave a conception of true manliness, a love for honest labor and an intelligent interest in the affairs of the state.\n\nIn all, we seek to instill a reverence for sacred things and respect for the rights of others. We have visions of leadership for some and a healthy atmosphere of usefulness for many, and the following lines seem to express what we desire all shall learn:\n\n\"We are not here to play, to dream, to drift,\nWe have hard work to do, and loads to lift,\nShun not the struggle, face it, 'tis God's gift.\nBe strong, be strong!\"\n\nSardis, B. C., October 21st, 1924.\n\nPrincipal.\n\"I was going further, but when I came to the place and beheld the thing, I stopped.\" \u2014 Bunyan\n\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSEARCH British Columbia over, no happier choice of location could have been selected for Coqualeetza Institute than that which it occupies. The Institute is planted in the heart of the Fraser Valley, two miles distant from the banks of the Fraser River. The valley itself is luxuriant with verdure, trees and flowers and its level fields are hemmed in by great mountain ranges, the sentinels of which are Mt. Cheam and Mt. Tamahai, lofty peaks, the source of the rivulets which run hither and thither through the country.\n\nThere is no doubt that unconsciously the beauty of the landscape, with its majesty and coloring, has an uplifting effect on the impressionable minds of the young.\n\nThe comfortable homes in the peaceful valley also tend to teach happiness and contentment, and the fact that many persons of culture and refinement are interested in the education and development of the native children, is a stimulus to our efforts.\n\nIn short, Coqualeetza Training Institute owes not a little to its advantageous location, in its manifold development work, which includes academic, prevocational, social and athletic lines, all necessary to the making of well-rounded, independent and self-supporting citizens such as the native boys and girls must learn to be in this land of Canada.\n\nAt present the school plant consists of a new, modern residence for 200 students with class rooms and assembly hall. It is comfortable and commodious, equipped with new furniture.\n\nA principal's residence and one school officer's cottage are the other dwelling houses.\n\nAn up-to-date new farm completes the list.\nHISTORICAL\n\n1880\u2014First Indian Day School organized by Rev. and Mrs. C.

Miss Elderkin was placed in charge.\n\n1891\u2014The Coqualeetza Home was destroyed by fire, half of the pupils were sent to their homes, those remaining with their teachers were sheltered in the Mission House.\n\n1893\u2014A new building was erected. The edifice was completed in brick, three stories high, and a basement under the whole building, with accommodation for one hundred pupils. This was called the Coqualeetza Industrial Institute. Rev. C. M. Tate was made formal Governor.\n\n1920\u2014Dr. Duncan C. Scott, after consultation with Rev. T. Ferrier and Principal Raley, decided the 1893 building had served its day and arranged for plans to be drawn up for a new building. The same year R. Guerney Orr, Esq., Architect for the Indian Department, visited Coqualeetza, obtained data and commenced plans.\n\n1921\u2014The first unit of the new educational plant was commenced.\n\n1922\u2014The Assembly Hall with the boiler room completed.\n\n1923\u2014(May 27th) The Rev.

It will be necessary to have a survey of the property before a proper description can be made. I should like to know the name of a surveyor who may be employed. Chilliwack, New Westminster and Vancouver are the nearest centres of population. As an appraisal by an independent valuator will be necessary, the surveyor employed might also be asked to make a valuation; if this is done it would mean a saving in the fees to be paid. Later the Department of Justice will be asked to search the title and the authority of His Excellency in Council for the purchase will be requested.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, I know that most principals drive cars.\n\nYou know how the official mind dislikes a precedent, and at the moment I am at a loss to know how your wishes could be met. If you have in mind a moderate priced car and can work out some plan so that purchase could be made with a little help from the Department, you might let me have another letter, giving the details of your proposal.\n\nWith kindest regards to you all,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Are you aware that the Department has never given \"equivalent\" a day? We are completing our sixteenth year; then we had been here ten years, we felt we could no longer carry on without a car, so we purchased a second hand DeSoto model of the 1926 model. It has given good service and carried all sorts of burdens during the six years.\nhow \"Helena\" looks like an decayed gentle woman of pioneer days. She is absolutely pathetic as she passes by and her ancient modern card. Another thing, her frailties demands a good deal of expensive treatment and her appetite for gasoline is appalling.\nDon't you think we should have a new car? (But not a Ford) and don't you think that the Department could grant us one? You will readily understand that in this age a car is a necessity. There is scarcely a day that...\nSome one does not have\nto come into Chilivack\non various errands.\nEdith is quite the best\nchauffeur around the\nplace, there fore she is\nthe general errand boy.\nSpring has come\nsuddenly and the lawns\nare once more green.\n\nEsquimalt has absolutely\nbeautiful last\nfor dinner and before\nto have it quite again\nMrs. She grounds\nare so much improved,\nsince you were here.\nMcReynolds I felt kept\nwell and feel a charming\nvisiting - I do not know\nhow long it will last,\nbut perhaps a new car\nmight lengthen out my days.\nThis as a matter of fact\u2014a\ndrive is a real treat for I\ndo not get many.

Coming in to the school, our host and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. MacLeod and Mrs. A. Lead Coode were introduced, they being most anxious to have dinner with Their Excellencies. Later the party was joined by Major Robertson and the Scouts. Indicating the very kindly and democratic spirit of their reception, they were pleased to have introduced to them the three girls from the school, Misses Edith, Helen and Clarence Wesley and his companion, Miss D. Marion, the former student playing the violin during the luncheon hour.\n\nImmediately following the Governor-General and Lady Willingdon with their party were pleased to visit the school, being extended a hearty welcome along with an welcome in the best Guide and Scout style by the troops drawn up before the school.\n\nIn front of the school an address of welcome was read and presented by the Governor-General by Edna Tait, a student from the Upper Fraser Valley School, accompanied with characteristic totem poles painted by Frank Calder.

Their Excellencies each planting an elm tree in front of the main building.\n\nFollowing this Their Excellencies reviewed the Scouts, Guides and Brownies. They expressed much pleasure in reviewing the native troop of scouts and guides and commented on their neatness and smart appearance. The Brownies gave Her Excellency their grand salutes.\n\nThe party proceeded to the building which was inspected. They were pleased on the tidiness and cleanliness and well-kept appearance of the various departments as they passed through.\n\nVisiting the Infirmary, they met with King's Scout Robert Gray, whom His Excellency remembered having met previously. Robert was on his way to attend the Jamboree in England.\n\nReturning then to the main entrance of the building, the visitors book was signed and His Excellency addressed the school in a few masterful and inspiring sentences. He gave the students a message to take home to their people and told them he would take the greetings of the school to His Majesty King George V an assurance of their good-will and loyalty.\n\nThe party was led back by Mr. Peake, heartily bid good wishes to Their Excellencies as they left with that party for the city.\nIn 1879 Miss Knott was married to Rev. C. M. Tate, then in charge of the mission work on the Fraser River. This of course meant a great sacrifice on Mrs. Tate's part, but she took it in her stride and went on with the work. In 1880, Mrs. Tate started a school for Indian children in her own home. Later on, Mrs. Tate, with the encouragement of her devoted husband, took some children into her home to teach them the art of Christian living. This meant a great sacrifice of comfort and privacy in a small house near the mission's home, but it was done with joy as unto the Lord, and after some time by a grant from the Ladies' Missionary Society a separate building was erected in which to house these Indian children, and later still by help from the General Board and the Government the work has been enlarged until we have today the splendid Coqualeetza Industrial Institute at Sardis, which has served both Rev. and Mrs. Raley. The first Mission School building was dedicated in 1880, but it was destroyed by fire in 1891, but in March, 1894, a new school was completed and this some years later gave place to the present commodious and\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nSARDIS, B.C. August 13th, 1930\n\nDr. Duncan Campbell Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent-General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith some trepidation I am writing you regarding an increase in the per capita grant of Coqualeetza Residential School. We are receiving $170.00, and it is not sufficient for the work we are undertaking on behalf of the Department. For many years there has been no increase in our grant, while each year has seen a new development in the work, necessitated by the change of conditions, the changing times, and the progress of the native people of British Columbia generally.\n\nWe have highly qualified teachers and have to pay them well. We could get Old Country teachers at lower salaries than we have to pay for experienced teachers with Provincial certificates, but this would not meet the situation agreeable to the Department of Education or the Province, with whom, I understand, the Department of Indian Affairs wishes to work in harmony.\n\nWe have to pay very heavily for our water - more heavily, I believe, than nearly any other Residential School. Our water alone costs us nearly $1000. a year. In the old school we had a flat rate of $5.00 per month. In the new school we have been on a meter, and while the system is excellent and pressure is generally so good that we can throw a stream of water over the building from each standpipe, it is a great draft on our finances.\n\nWe endeavour to keep the school always in good repair. Strangers visiting here always carry away with them the impression that the Department of Indian Affairs is providing well for the wards of the country. However, to keep things going we know the Department would wish to have them cannot be done in our present circumstances without quite a struggle. There were a number of items last year that might legitimately have been attended to had we had more funds at our command.\n\nI am assured of the generosity of the Department, and its willingness to do all in its power to assist in legitimate ways the schools, hospitals and general welfare of the Indians, and I trust you will pardon this appeal which, as I say, I make with some trepidation. This is the first time I have personally asked for an increase in the per capita grant for the school. If it would be possible to raise our per capita to $200., retro-active to the beginning of this school year, it would still be a conservative amount, and the results of such increased expenditure would justify the action.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I might also say I am sure our local member, Mr. H. J. Barber, would heartily support the action. He knows the situation and the work we are doing thoroughly, and is entirely sympathetic.\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H.

Murphy -\n\nIt may be of interest to you to glance at the leaflet of a series of lectures to be given at the Coqualeetza Residential School at Sardis, B.C. This is one of our best schools; it is conducted by the United Church. You will notice that the lectures are given by professors in the University of British Columbia under the direction of the University Committee.\nVictoria, B.C., December 19, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to transmit herewith the inspection report of Inspector of Agencies G. S. Pragnell, dated December 15th instant, with respect to the New Westminster Agency, in which connection I desire to say that the several representations therein made have been reviewed.\n\nThe suggestion offered by the Inspector under the heading \"Schools-General\" to have the Coqualeetza Indian Residential school transferred to the Roman Catholic Church and to have a Protestant school established in Northern British Columbia instead of the replacement of a Roman Catholic School at St Mary's Mission, was recently discussed by me with the Deputy Superintendent General on his recent visit to the coast when he was of opinion that such a proposal could not possibly be carried out.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nKamloops, B.C., December 15, 1930.\n\nINSPECTION REPORT NEW WESTMINSTER AGENCY NO. 1.\n\nSCHOOLS GENERAL:\n\nWhilst on the subject of schools in this agency, it always seems to me a pity that Coqueleetza happens to be a Protestant school. It is situated right in Catholic territory, and there are possibly not twelve children there from the surrounding Agencies. Most of the children come from the Northwest coast and Queen Charlotte Islands, long and expensive journeys. Now, if a Protestant school is built in the neighbourhood of Prince Rupert, Coqueleetza will, I think, be nearly empty. Then, undoubtedly, a new school as got to be erected at Mission, a few miles away, for the Catholics. This means the cost of two new schools, when, apparently only one is required. I suppose it is impossible to arrange for a big, new Protestant school in the vicinity of Prince Rupert, and then have the Coqueleetza school renovated and done up, and handed over to the Catholics for administration, and not build at Mission.\n\nWhat few Protestants there are in the locality could well go to St George's at Lytton, which, so far, has never been overcrowded.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nAugust 30, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Raley:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to an increase in the per capita grant at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. Our scale of grants has been fixed with much care and to make a change in the case of one school would upset the entire scheme. Further, if an increase of $25 per pupil were made for all residential schools, it would require an additional appropriation of approximately half a million dollars.\n\nI may say that $170 per child is the maximum grant that is paid to the church authorities for any of the larger schools near a railroad. Some schools receive less, for one reason or another. If deficits occur, the church authorities are responsible.\n\nI am not unmindful of the good work that the Coqualeetza Institute is doing. For this reason, when special activities, as high school work and technical training, are undertaken, the Department makes special payments.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. G. H. Raley, F.R.G.S.,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Institute,\nSardis, B.C.\nCoqualeetza Residential School\nSardis, B.C.\n\nCommencement Annual\n\nJune, 1931\nForeword\n\nThe outstanding event of the school year has been the Inter-Residential School Athletic Meet or, as it is called amongst us, the inter-school Olympiad, made possible by the sympathy and support of the Department of Indian Affairs. It is quite natural my mind should center on that subject as a foreword.\n\nThe need for friendly competition in sports has been felt by Indian Residential Schools for many years and the Meet we have just consummated has broken the undesirable but unavoidable isolation which has prevailed.\n\nIt is now universally admitted that inter-school sports answer deep-seated needs essential to a boy's or a girl's fullest development and education. It is also evident that sports and inter-school sports are the prototypes of the great lines of human interest, endeavor and achievement represented in adult life and educational work today.\n\nRelating inter-school sports to their educational and social significance includes the universal passion and admiration of achievement in physical activity, bodily skill and prowess in sports. Athletics today have the same roots as those interests which once determined a race supremacy and inspired song and story. They are also essentially and fundamentally related to vigour and health and in the field of physical education are paramount in importance.\n\nLet me say also that inter-school sports give a stimulus to attainment in athletic ability. In friendly contest we are conscious of a desire to exert ourselves to the limit. There is an incentive to make a supreme effort. The spiritual value of competition in which our boys and girls are absolutely engrossed is the MAXIMUM OF EFFORT which it calls forth. In life, in the majority of cases, the chief difference between men in the presence of a crisis, lies in the capacity for supreme effort. This capacity is part of our character. Competition in sports is an essential in the moral training of boys and girls, insomuch as without it few, if any, will ever reach a maximum of development of the will and the capacity to try\u2014(I firmly believe \"Education needs play and play needs education\").\n\nCoqualeetzaans, I congratulate you with all my heart upon the distinction you have won for yourselves and the honour you have brought to your school. It is good and right that you should be congratulated, but it would be a sad day for you and for our school were it ever to come to pass that any of you, even the most disappointed of you, could not rejoice in your opponent's success. It is a noble quality to rejoice in another's success. Could you do it? I believe you could. You have always endeavored to\u2014what we have so often said to one another\u2014\"Play the game.\" Some of you will be leaving us so let us say, \"Play the Game\" in life's field of labour. To you all, \"Godspeed and Good Luck.\"\n\n\"Coqualeetza,\"\nSardin, B. C.,\nJune 20th, 1931.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\n\nThree\nThe First Indian School Olympiad\n\nWhen it became known that Coqualeetza was chosen by the Committee for the site for the first Indian School Olympiad more than a flutter of excitement ran through the school and immediately the members of the staff and students began to lay in plans for the event which was to be held for three days more.\n\nThe track for the quarter-mile dash involved the movement of hundreds of yards of gravel which was replaced by suitable material which made one of the best courses in B.C. Then the quarter-mile oval had to be regraded. This was accomplished chiefly through the good offices of the Rev. Mr. E. N. Wells, who obtained for us the services of a grader.\n\nA small playground had to be erected, a dining marquee, camp kitchen, tents, suitable meals had to be planned, satisfactory provision in case of rain for sleeping quarters, everything could be left to chance and, in fact, Coqualeetza had to make suitable arrangements for the entertainment of guests. Every one on our staff and students volunteered to help and all were willing and voluntary helpers, considering extra duty a pleasure. The desire was to have pleasant and happy arrangements made for the comfort and welfare and happiness of the visitors.\n\nThe details of most events were previously worked out by the Principals of the three schools competing\u2014St. George's, Lytton; St. Michael's, Alert Bay; Coqualeetza, Sardis. A program for the three days covered a complete and wide range of field and track events, including races, relays, hurdles and spectacles alike. The numbers and school contestants were 1-2-3 St. Georges; 2-6-9 St. Michael's; 5-1-75 Coqualeetza. The colors of the school were worn: St. George's, red and white; St. Michael's, blue and gold; Coqualeetza, black and gold. The contests, boxing matches and races were held in the Sardis Community Hall and the shooting competition in the Drill Hall at Chilliwack.\n\nIndian Schools' Olympiad Gets Away to Auspicious Start at Coqualeetza\n\n(Mrs. C. Barber, press correspondent to Chilliwack Progress and Vancouver Daily Province)\n\nWith flags flying, spirits high and hearts beating fast with excitement, Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, Sardis, is this week the centre of much interest and the venue of many. The occasion is the first annual Indian School Olympiad, Canada, sponsored by the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, and participated in by twenty-five representatives of the three Indian schools, St. George's, Lytton; St. Michael's, Alert Bay; and Coqualeetza, Sardis. Judging from the success and interest which has attended the event, there should be no difficulty in the recommending that the meet become an annual one, and one which will prove attractive to more and more schools as the years go by.\n\nMonday evening a reception was held in Coqualeetza hall, when Principal and Mrs. G. H. Riley and their staff welcomed very delightfully, visiting officials, the principals of the two visiting schools, Rev. A. R. Lett and Rev. E. F. Anfield, and their wives, and the boys and girls who would next day enter the ranks in friendly competition with each other.\n\nA short address to the children of the school at Coqualeetza was given by Principal Riley, after which Mayor E. Manuel and Rev. Mr. A. Wells extended a welcome to the visitors on behalf of the city and municipality. Reply was made by Rev. A. R. Lett, chairman of the Olympiad committee; Rev. E. F. Anfield, secretary, and Captain Barry, inspector of Indian schools in B.C. Each speaker emphasized the importance of playing games for the game's sake, of the need of good sportsmanship in all events, and making the meet a happy one for all competitors. They also voiced the hope that other schools would compete in Olympiads to be held in the future.\n\nFollowing the addresses, a social hour was spent, visitors and guests becoming acquainted with each other, and taking the opportunity of admiring the handsome shield and other trophies on exhibition, to be won in the coming three days.\n\nMusical numbers were excellently given by pupils of Coqualeetza, a two-piano duet being particularly enjoyable.\n\nPreceding over the prettily arranged tea tables were Mrs. J. H. White and Miss McGregor, boys' matron, and Mrs. R. E. W. Biddell and Miss Taylor, girls' matron at the school, Mrs. A. Charlton cut the ice and Miss Taylor serving were Miss Estel MacKay, lady superintendent, Miss Milson, Miss Kathleen Clark, Vancouver, and Miss Alice Smith, Chilliwack.\n\nTuesday morning was an ideal day on which to begin the extended program of sports and everything went off with a good \"bang\" throughout the day. Many visitors from town were present at 1 o'clock to attend the formal opening. A colourful parade of the boys and girls of St. George's, in their red and white uniforms; of St. Michael's, in their gold and black uniforms; and of Coqualeetza, in their black and gold, the girls with smart mantles of white with the colours of black and gold embroidered on the front of their middies, was marshalled by Sergt.-Major Bain of Victoria and presented colours before Commissioner W. E. Ditchburn of Victoria. Mr. Ditchburn briefly addressed the group, wishing them success in their first meet, calling to their attention the desire of his department that good sportsmanship should prevail throughout and the hope that more schools would take part in coming years. Mr. Ditchburn, in charge of Indian schools, took the promise, and bespoke on behalf of the department at Ottawa their interest and good wishes in the event.\nOlympiad May 26, 27, 28, 1931\n\nThe following is the official report of the Olympiad:\n\n**100 YARD RELAY, GIRLS (41 sec.)**\n1.

(RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 2)\nSchool Tradition\n\nTRADITION is that which is neither law nor regulation, but the persuasive influence of the high ideals of the school, handed down unconsciously by outgoing to incoming students, to be imitated and passed on in turn. No school can be great without tradition\u2014and no great school, or school with any pretence to worth or merit, can be without tradition. Some of the traditions Coqualeetzaans have striven to weave into the fabric of the school are:\n\nReverence for God's Word and all sacred institutions.\n\nLoyalty to Canada, the Empire and the King.\n\n\"Play the Game,\" in classroom, playground and home.\n\n\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\"\n\n\"Love Duty.\"\n\nAll necessary work is honourable.\n\nHonour our Highdays and Holidays with the observation of all the beautiful, time-worn customs.\n\nSchool Spirit\n\nMISS E. MACKAY, B.A., Lady Principal\n\nTHROUGHOUT the Coqualeetza school year many things must operate to draw the members of the student body together. This year the games and sports, the fun and frolic have been shared by all.\n\nThe Academic and Vocational work of the different departments, if not the same, have been done under the same conditions. All inherit the school traditions. The same ideals of life, the Academic and Vocational guidance and preparation are placed before each student. In short, they foster the school health, or better still, the school spirit. This year the school spirit manifested itself not only in the hour of victory on the public occasion of winning the Olympiad Shield, but let us hope it manifested itself more potently in the tedious hours of study and in the work of the day, for these hours of study, these hours of work in Coqualeetza should be steps toward a particular trade or a particular profession.\n\nIn this 20th Century one must be fully equipped. Your school is a place of opportunity and we know from previous records and present ones that many students have realized it. The fact that much was expected of them, put them on their mettle, called forth that unselfish, intangible thing called \"school spirit,\" which should be the stimulus to high endeavor.\n\nNine\nValedictory Address\n\nOUR school has been like \"Elfeland,\" joyous, happy. \"Gradusteland\" too, is interesting. As we look through a \"Mystery Window\" we glimpse \"Knowledge\" and \"Success\" standing quite aloof, while \"Opportunity\" knocks at the door. Over the cliff \"Sins,\" \"Temptation\" smiles winningly. We wonder, do we fall? Experience gives a squeeze of hand for encouragement; introduces us to his \"Light.\" A \"Star,\" \"Courage\" sings cheerfully near by. But \"Hope\" comes gently to greet us. As she takes us to the \"Alpine Path\" we joyfully recognize two beautiful stars. They are \"I live for the good that I can do\" and \"No backward step.\"\n\nWe've been called \"Elves\" at \"Elfeland.\" The memory of our schoolmates, teachers and Principal will always inspire us. We sense a deep gratitude and will try to live worthily, for we take with us the high ideals and beautiful traditions of our school.\n\nWe wish the Principal and Staff every success and hope all their ambitions for us will come true.\n\nWe will have to choose the friends of our later life. Perhaps wisdom will not always guide us, but we realize there is One whom we can always trust, One who will share our troubles and joys alike and whom we can always love and who will always love us; our trust friend\u2014God.\n\n(signed) RUTH CASTLE,\nValedictorian\nPresident, Class 1931.\n\nHistorical\n\n1886\u2014First Indian Day School organized by Rev. and Mrs. C.

The officers of the club elected for the season were:\n\nPresident: Mr. J. H. B. Smith\nFirst Vice-President: Mrs. P. E. Reid\nSecond Vice-President: Mrs. E. E. Mower\nSecretary: Cyril Macdonald\n\nSoccer, the major sport of the school, again came to the front, winning the Local District Senior League Cup and medals for the second successive year. The schedule and results were as follows:\n\n| Home          | Away          |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Coqualeetza   | High School  |\n| City          | Coqualeetza  |\n| Sirdis        | Coqualeetza  |\n| Coqualeetza   | Landing      |\n| Sumas         | Coqualeetza  |\n| Coqualeetza   | United       |\n| High School   | Coqualeetza  |\n| Coqualeetza   | City         |\n| Coqualeetza   | Sirdis       |\n| Landing       | Coqualeetza  |\n| Coqualeetza   | Sumas        |\n| United        | Coqualeetza  |\n\nCUP GAMES\n\n| Coqualeetza   | Kilgard      |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Coqualeetza   | High School  |\n| Coqualeetza   | Sirdis       |\n\nEXHIBITION GAMES\n\n| Coqualeetza   | Kilgard      |\n|---------------|--------------|\n\nLEAGUE TOTALS\n\nGoals for: 43\nGoals against: 18\nPoints for: 18\nPoints lost: 4\n\nThe team was comprised of T. Poole (captain), J. Smith, Cyril Mahone, S. Angus, P. Martin, F. Wilson, A. Wilson, G. Brown, C. Williams, O. Adams, P. MacKay, W. Leslie, G. Auckland, J. Barton. Mr. E. E. Mower managed the team and Mr. E. Poole again displayed his ability as a soccer coach.\n\nFour members of the team, T. Poole, G. Brown, Cyril Mahone were chosen for the all star team representing Chilliwack and attended an exhibition game at the University of B.C. Cyril Mahone's playing as full back was one of the outstanding features of the game.\n\nDuring the Basketball season many interesting and successful games were played; the senior team winning the District league and cup for the Fraser Valley with the junior team in third place.\n\nSome of the games played by the senior team were listed below:\n\n| Home          | Away          |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Coqualeetza   | High School  |\n| East Chilliwack | Coqualeetza |\n| Coqualeetza   | Rosedale     |\n| Chem          | Coqualeetza  |\n| Hendersons    | Coqualeetza  |\n| Coqualeetza   | Chilliwack Inter.

An Athletic Club was formed in order to organize their own program for the season. The officers of the club were:\n\nPresident: Principal G. H. R. Kelty, First Vice-President: Miss L. MacKay; Second Vice-President: Alice Sepasi; Chairman: Miss D. Milborn; Secretary: Ruth Castle.\n\nBasketball has proved one of the most interesting phases of their athletics and the team has shown very favorable progress during the season. Being the first year the team received regular training no league was entered but several practice matches were arranged.\n\nHOME\n\n| Lytton        | Coqualeetza  |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Sirdis        | Coqualeetza  |\n| Coqualeetza   | Sirdis       |\n| Coqualeetza   | Lytton       |\n\nAWAY\n\n| Coqualeetza   | Lytton       |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Coqualeetza   | Sirdis       |\n| Sirdis        | Coqualeetza  |\n| Lytton        | Coqualeetza  |\n\nA softball team which was organized later in the season created such popularity as to insure it a major place in the sport program of the school.\n\nThe basketball team has done extremely well this year. The members of the team are to be complimented on the faithful and enthusiastic manner in which they have undertaken their training.\n\nMiss Campbell in the earlier part of the season coached the girls in basketball. Mr. Williams in the latter part of the season, Mr. Williams was the girls' coach for general athletics.\n\nGIRLS' BASKETBALL\n\nThe basketball season is over now and looking back, it has been quite successful. Although the girls' success has not been apparent in actual scores, I believe they have made good progress in basketball ability. If they show as much improvement each year as they have this year, the future success of their team will be assured.\n\nWe began practices late and had just one when we received a challenge from St. George's School, Lytton, for the first game. Although this was our first real game, we had never played basketball before, while the Lytton girls had been playing for several years. We accepted the challenge and were able to say Lytton won the game with little effort, but our girls practiced hard for the return game in the spring.\n\nDuring the Olympiad, however, while not winning, Coqualeetza showed marked improvement. Now the girls are looking forward to tremendous and hard fought games with outside teams next year.\nMusic Department\n\nThis year has been one of outstanding progress in musical education, a line which has become a special feature of Coqualeetza's programme.\n\nFrom a first hesitant and inadequate beginning the Music Department has made great strides in advancement. This is due to the increasing interest shown by the parents and pupils, but to the untiring efforts of the Principal and Miss Milson. Besides the development of musical ability, the cultural value of music and music appreciation are goals towards which this department strives.\n\nThroughout the year the pupils have enjoyed musical functions and lecture evenings, with musical selections. These occasions have served in bringing out latent talent and in inspiring confidence in the performers.\n\nD. MILSON, Superior.\n\nThe following is a note from Mr. Frank Idle, F.R.A.M., which we are permitted to publish. From so noted a musician, it is kindly appreciated:\n\nSyrdo, June 17, 1931.\n\nI have today visited Coqualeetza school, and I should like to record my appreciation of the high standard of the music taught in the School. I have been particularly struck by the facility in sight-reading displayed by many of the music students. My best wishes are towards the School, its Principal and its Staff.\n\nFRANK IDLE,\nFather of the Royal Academy of Music,\nConductor, Composer, Organist, etc., of London, England.\n\n\"Beltran\"\nHarbour Hill Crescent,\nPoole,\nDorset, England.\n\nList of pupils preparing for the musical examinations of the Associated Board of the Royal Academy of Music and The Royal College of Music:\n\nRUTH CASTLE, Intermediate Pianoforte\nROSALIND WATSON, Higher Division Pianoforte\nEUGENIA TAYLOR, Higher Division Pianoforte\nMARY WILLIAMS, Lower Division Pianoforte\nGORDON WATSON, Preliminary Division Pianoforte\nMARGARET BROWN, Elementary Division Pianoforte\nRUTH CASTLE, Preliminary Division Pianoforte\nESTHER REID, Elementary Division Pianoforte\nEVA DICK, Primary Division Pianoforte\nDIANA HILL, Preliminary Division Pianoforte\nCYRIL MARSHALL, Preliminary Division Pianoforte\nANNIE DAVIES, Preliminary Division Pianoforte\nROSE HILL, Preliminary Division Pianoforte\nKATHLEEN MORGAN, Preliminary Division Pianoforte\nHELEN HARRIS, Preliminary Division Pianoforte\nCLARA JOHNSON, Preliminary Division Pianoforte\nALICE SESSA, Preliminary Division Pianoforte\nMAY MARKS, Preliminary Division Pianoforte\nANNIE DAVIES, Preliminary Division Violin\n\nThose preparing for the Young Composers' Association are:\nALICE SESSA, Elementary Pianoforte\nMARY WILLIAMS, Elementary Pianoforte\n\nNames of Teachers: Mrs. Edithon, Mrs. Orr, Miss N.

New anthem books of really good songs have been procured and slowly but surely development is taking place in the musical portion of the services.\n\n**Cadet Report**\n\nCAPT. P. F. PIKE\n\nThe year 1930 was a very eventful time for the Coqualeetza Cadet Corps. It was the first time that the Corps won the handsome L.O.D.E. Shield for the greatest attendance at the Indian Residential School in B.C.\n\nThe promotion was made to Capt. A. U. Defries as an officer of the Provincial Chapter, L.O.D.E. It so happens that Miss Defries was accompanied on this visit by her husband the Right Rev. Archbishop. His Grace very kindly gave a three-minute address to the Corps on a few wise and effective sentences.\n\nThe regular winter training was carried out in the usual manner and the excellent work of springtime training took place. The Corpshad made good progress by the 16th of April when Captain MacKay inspected the Corps. He mentioned that he was well pleased with the appearance of the Corps and said that they were doing very well.\n\nHe highly commended Platoon Sgt. Wilson for the way he handled the platoon on drill and was pleased with the way the section leader, Platoon Sgt. Adams handled his particular sections. In all, the Corps did very well this season. Although the Corps is not as large as last year, every Cadet took a keen interest in the Corps and played his part well.\n\nThe Corps had a turn in the annual match. Barton won the special medal for highest man in the match. Cadet Gladstone and Cadet Watson each won a Second Class medal in the junior team.\n\nA team was entered again this year in the Imperial Challenge Shield but the match has just been completed and the report will be sent to the Imperial Council.\n\nAt the last minute a team was entered in the R.M.C. Miniature Rifle match.\n\n**Scout Report**\n\nCAPTAIN PIKE, Scoutmaster\n\nThe Coqualeetza Troop started out very well this year with a new group of boys.\n\nWe hope another year may bring us more success. We have a new scoutmaster L. Beaz of the Chilliwack troop has been appointed a Commissioner for Chilliwack district so we will be a little closer to Headquarters.\n\nScouting meetings were held throughout the winter and good progress was made on tenderfoot and 2nd class work but there was no hike arranged due to the snow. \"Scouting\" was not there.\n\nThe Coqualeetza troop went to Vancouver for the Stampede. They visited Chilliwack and Chilliwack where they attended a jamboree picture showing scenes from the World Jamboree held at Birkenhead in 1929. The troop enjoyed it very much since the late troop leader, Robert Grey, represented Northern British Columbia at the jamboree. Robert Grey was Secretary of the Scouts there and it was the first opportunity the troop had the privilege of meeting him.\n\nEarly in the spring Coqualeetza was invited to a Scout display put on by the First Chilliwack Troop. We were very pleased and hope to have them as our guests next year.\n\nThe Annual Field Day, which is always a source of pleasure is to be held on Friday, June 26.\n\nTwenty-one\n\n---\n\nFirst Coqualeetza Wolf Cub Pack\n\nEdward F. Peake, C.M.\n\nA very keen desire to get back to cubbing was shown by many of the cubs on their return to school this year. Two new sites were formed to accommodate the number of new boys who wished to join.\n\nWork progressed very favorably and the majority soon passed their tenderfoot tests. Many have almost completed the tests for their first star.\n\nThe strength of the pack is as follows: Cub Master, Edward F. Peake; Assistant Cub Master, George Brown.\n\n| GREENS | CAB C.

As a School we have proven its worth.\n\nThe Girl Guide Company has made good progress. Many of the Guides have become proficient in dog handling and all have worked assiduously towards efficiency badges.\n\nWe have had the privilege of encouraging leadership of our Commissioner, Mrs. A. Charlton, who has been an active worker throughout, but whose chief interest is in the welfare of the Guides.\n\nWe also regret the resignation of our Captain, Miss K. Clarke, who returned to her home in Vancouver after four years as Senior teacher. Miss Clarke became Captain of the Coqualeetza Company when it was first formed and has been a constant supporter and encouragement of the Girl Guide movement at Coqualeetza. We are greatly indebted to her. Miss D. Milborn, who was Lieutenant last year, is now Captain.\n\nThis year we found it necessary to forego our Easter camp in lieu of other school activities but we hope that next year we shall pitch our tents once again by the shores of Cultus Lake.\n\nBrownies\n\nBrown Owl - E. McKay\nBrown Leader - L. F. Scott\n\nOur good fairy Pinky Winky was quite late in coming to us this year and so the 16th L.O.D.E. Coqualeetza Brownie Pack was quite late in getting into uniform.\n\nMargaret Wilson, Rita Brown, Katie Moon, Laura Lewis, Edna Quackenbush, Josephine Williams, Evelyn Williams, Ernest Boland, Betty Murray, Doris Murray, Helen Murray, Barbara Murray, Betty Murray, Irene Murray, Doris Murray, Helen Murray, Dorothy Charles, Lily Lee, Sybil Modeste, Clara Reid, Agnes Modeste, Irene Williams and Wilma Matheson.\n\nPinky Winky, who has been away too long ago to tell us the truth, L.O.D.E. Brownie Pack, a Kamloops Brownie Pack, very much wanted to have a roadshow just like ours, so good fairies began work at once and in a Pinky Winky while off we went to visit them. We were glad to say it was even more beautiful than we thought it would be. In any case, you know, they make things better.\n\nBack came such a beautiful pink and gold letter of thanks from those Brownies far up North, and with it a year's subscription to \"The Canadian Girl Guide.\" We are very pleased to have them for the first time among us. What in the world will next year bring? Thanks to all those dear Brownies far up North.\n\nPinky Winky has some fine plans under way for the reunion next September and some better ones for the year's work to follow and so she hopes to see all her Brownies back again ready for a day of laughter, fun, frolic and work. Don't forget one word of her wish and back you come, one and all, big or small.\n\nThe Trip to Harrison Hot Springs\n\nThe events of the last day were hurried through as quickly as possible to allow time for the visiting tour to view the Fraser Valley and later to visit Harrison Hot Springs. The trip was made possible through the kind co-operation of the Chilliwack Board of Trade and other friends, who provided cars for the occasion. The tour was conducted through the city of Chilliwack, Chester Roadside and Abbotsford. Here the boys and girls visited the famous Grouse Mountain and the famous Keno Hill Mine exhibited its curious phase of the work. Continuing the trip they crossed the Fraser River on the new motor ferry and soon arrived at Harrison Lake. Of course everyone's first interest was to sample the waters from the famous Hot Springs. Then the party was conducted through the grounds and shown various places of interest. Boat rides on the Lake completed the trip and a tired, happy group returned to Coqualeetza to prepare for the banquet and presentations.\n\nTwenty-two\n\nTRIP TO LYTON\n\nThe Lytton Trip\n\nPerhaps one of the most thrilling experiences of the year was the trip over the new Fraser Canyon Highway when the girls' and boys' basketball teams went to Lytton to play a return game with St. George's Residential School.\n\nWe left Coqualeetza at the early hours, everybody wide awake and keen for the day ahead. The experience was unique and that we made, we believe, the first bus trip over the new highway.\n\nNever shall we forget the thrill of riding over a road that wound its way up and up until it became a mere thread along a mountain skyline. It amazes one to think how the Indians used to travel with horse and wagon, years ago, along the old Cariboo Highway which now remains here and there a mere trail clinging to the face of the mountain. To us the new road, which is very much wider and safer, offered supreme joy. When at last we reached a level stretch and breathed more freely a very real danger possessed itself.\n\nA tree fell directly in the path of the bus. Seeing it fall the driver applied the brakes and just in time. It caught the front lamps of the bus, otherwise no serious damage was done and fortunately no one injured. So grateful for this averted disaster, we came to the famous Alexandra bridge. Our joy in crossing a new bridge was somewhat modified when we found that it was a toll bridge and our finances were depleted six dollars each way.\n\nWhen we reached St. George's School we were welcomed by Principal and Mrs. Lett and after partaking of refreshments we went to the gymnasium where the games were played. Coqualeetza won the boys' games; Lytton won the girls'.\n\nThe bus returned at approximately 5:30 p.m., being on the \"outside\" of the road this time we were glad that it was soon dark so that we could not see the precipitous sides which fell away to the Fraser River 2000 feet below. Mile after mile we swung around the hairpin turns of the mountain range of which there are twenty-two to the mile. We all voted Mr. Cunningham a careful and skilful driver. By twelve o'clock that night we were all tired and happy and safely back at school.\n\nTwenty-three\nCINDERELLA\n\nDainty Operetta Is Staged at Coqualeetza School\n\nBy J. H. BARKER\n\nIt has become a custom during the last few years at this season for the senior students at the Coqualeetza School to prepare and present a musical play or operetta for the entertainment and amusement of their juniors, who with a number of interested spectators, attend in order to appreciate the fare on offer.\n\nOn Tuesday evening a very dainty operetta was offered entitled, \"The Maid and the Golden Slipper,\" by C. D. Richardson, based on the story of Cinderella, so well known and loved by young people all over the world.\n\nThe scenery, staging, costumes and makeup were admirable, the costumes especially being chosen with great care and attention to spectacular effect. The grouping together with the acting and singing of the different numbers would have done credit to any company having a much older experience.\n\nGwenne Watson deserves special mention for her sophistication and interpretation of the role of Godmother, as well as her charming singing and graceful deportment.\n\nThe step-mothers, Rosalind Watson and Doris McKeown displayed a very acceptable conception of their characters, and their performances were in their contemporaries' references to the difference between their own elegance and the poverty-stricken appearance of their step-daughter, Cinderella, who in the person of Edna Tate, gave an outstanding performance. The music was played by Misses Adams and Murray, doing the accompanying music with enthusiasm and applause of the audience.\n\nThe character of the Prince was enacted by Mr. Matheson with great nonchalance, his appearance on the stage being greeted with enthusiasm by the band of all the ladies at the ball, who on their part artfully endeavored to capture his attention.\n\nThe trying on and the departure of those who could not squeeze a foot into the tiny shoe, made a very amusing scene, and when Cinderella, unwillingly produced by the step-mother was found to be the possessor of the fortunate foot, and was ordered by the fairy godmother to go to the splendid ball dressed in the most magnificent costume, but with the stipulation that ever after happiness was considered complete. This, with the final chorus by the whole company brought the operetta to a triumphant conclusion.\n\nMention must be made of the characters of the stepmothers, adequately interpreted by Mercy Wesley, and the very captivating impersonation of Cinderella by the charming Miss Matheson, aged 9 years, whose bright little smile and quaint antics throughout were delightful.\n\nThe dancing and singing of the fairies and the lords and ladies, added considerably to the success of the evening, and the entire cast, including the pupils who attended, will have a number of pleasant memories to treasure in the days to come when they are far away from Coqualeetza.\n\nThe Rev. G. H. Riley, as principal is making a fine gesture in encouraging these young disciples to take part in such entertainments.\n\nThe songs were directed by Miss R. Clarke, Miss F. McKeown, Miss N. Campbell, with Miss D. Millson as accompanist, to whose untiring efforts the success of the musical portion is due. Miss F. Adams was responsible for the music of the ball. William on the stage was accompanied by Miss D. Millson accompanying with a pulsation of rhythm which carried the glee along with a nerve altogether refreshing.\n\nTwenty-four\n\nCoqualeetza School Winner of Silver Shield and Cups\n\nMrs. C. Barber\nPress correspondent, Chilliwack Progress and Vancouver Daily Province.\n\nThe three-day Indian school Olympiad held at Coqualeetza last week came to a happy conclusion on Thursday evening with the holding of a banquet in the large auditorium of the school. The gathering was attended by other guests and seventy-five Olympiad competitors and proved a fine finish to the three days' interesting and varied events.\n\nThe prizes were received by Principal and Mrs. G. H. Riley and Miss Ethel MacKay, lady superintendent of Coqualeetza, and all were delighted with the artistic arrangement of the tables, done in the three school colors and with pansies carrying out the gold and black of Coqualeetza.\n\nInterest naturally centred round the announcement by Capt. Barry, inspector of Indian schools for the province, of the highest point winners. Coqualeetza proved to have distinguished herself in no uncertain manner by the winning of the coveted silver shield awarded to the school with the highest aggregate points. Affairs, Okanagan, and Comox Valley were the school winners the highest aggregate points, their number being 179; Lytton came second with 73\u00bd points, and Alert Bay third with 59\u00bd points. The result is particularly gratifying to the Sardis school as the training of the students is a part of the work done by the regular teaching staff.\n\nThe boys' cup for the greatest number of points was won by George Brown, Coqualeetza, and the girls' cup by Alice Strutt, Coqualeetza. The other first winners in the various events were given medals.\n\nThe presentation of prizes was made by Commissioner E. W. Ditchburn of Victoria, on behalf of the department. Mr. Ditchburn warmly congratulating the winners and remarking on the splendid sportsmanship exhibited throughout by all contestants.\n\nThree toasts were proposed and responded to during the evening. \"Our Guests\" was proposed in an impressive address by Principal Riley, Rev. A. R. Lett, as chairman made an appropriate and congratulatory response. \"The Department of Indian Affairs\" was proposed by Rev. Anfield and was ably responded to by Commissioner Ditchburn. \"The Municipality, City of Chilliwack and the Chilliwack Board of Trade\" were grouped together in a toast proposed by Capt. Barry and spoken to by Mayor E. McIntyre.\n\nA very pleasing gesture at the close of the banquet was the gift of a leather bound presentation copy by the boys and girls of the visiting teams to Principal Riley. In a few well-chosen words, Miss Margaret McIntyre of St. George's School, Lytton, made the presentation.\n\nMr. Riley thanked them, saying that all he had done had been a pleasure. He had enjoyed their presence every minute of the visit and he hoped the splendid feeling and the friendships formed amongst the students of the three schools would continue through life.\n\nFounders Day\n\nOctober 21st, as usual, was held in remembrance by the annual tree planting, sports and tea shop.\n\nAfter seven years one might think Coqualeetza would be reforested but our \"small boy\" vandals manage to spoil or check the growth of a certain number of trees each year.\n\nHowever, campus and lawns will soon have adequate shade and as long as Coqualeetza lasts it will be in a tower of beauty.\n\nWe return thanks for the spared life of the aged founder, the Rev. C. M. Tate of Vancouver.\n\nTwenty-five\nThe Moderator's Visit\n\nOn January 28, Coqualeetza was honoured by a visit from the Right Reverend Dr. Oliver, Moderator of the United Church of Canada, with whom was Mrs. Oliver.\n\nThe distinguished guests were received by Principal and Mrs. Riley and Miss MacKay, Lady Superintendent.\n\nThe first item of the afternoon program was the planting of a \"memory tree\" on the site near where the future Chapel will stand. In the morning the Staff and pupils had gathered in the Assembly Hall. The Rev. J. H. Smith, D.D., who came on to conduct the service, expressed his pleasure in being there, congratulated the children on having such a fine school and urged them to study the highest things in life.\n\nDr. Oliver was then the recipient of an address of welcome from the staff and pupils of the school. The address was on parchment decorated with Indian designs. Mrs. Oliver was then presented with a bouquet of flowers and a silver bracelet of Indian design.\n\nA reception followed when the guests were joined by several local Ministers and their wives together with Mayor Mrs. MacKenzie Ross and Mrs. Wells, Mr. J. Barber, M.P., and Mrs. Barber, Mr. and Mrs. C. Barber and Capt. and Mrs. Logan.\n\nItems of Interest\n\nCoqualeetza's Assembly Hall is rather popular with the Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire. It has been loaned to them through the kindness of the Principal on three different occasions during the year.\n\nIn August Miss A. B. Cooke, Provincial Educational Secretary, was a guest of the Chilliwack Municipal Chapter, L.O.D.E., and gave a report of the National Chapter meeting to a well attended audience.\n\nOn the third of December under the auspices of the Chilliwack Chapter, L.O.D.E., Mrs. A. U. DePauw gave a most interesting talk on the subject \"The Church by Motorcar.\" This was altogether enjoyable. The Senior students were invited to be present.\n\nThe Chilliwack Municipal Chapter, L.O.D.E., chose Coqualeetza for its Annual Meeting in March for the second time.\n\nIn February Coqualeetza was favored with visits from Capt. and Mrs. Murray, appointed Inspector for Indians Affairs in B.C.\n\nOn the evening of the 24th of February by previous arrangement the \"Mass Appreciation in an Indian School,\" with a great deal of humor and much enthusiasm, was given at high standard of his lecture. It was given in the inimitable style of an Irishman. Any society or organization would be edified and entertained by this lecture on music.\n\nOn May 24 we had a visit from Dr. Large, Port Simpson. He examined the school with selections of song delightfully rendered.\n\nWe received a number of L.O.D.E. calendars through the kindness of Secretary Mrs. Barton, for which we are very grateful. Those calendars grace the classrooms and the office of the school.\n\nWe have also been in receipt for several years of the \"Indian Affairs News Service,\" published by the Department of the Interior, Ottawa. The articles on the more prominent cases of Indians are written by Dr. Duncan C. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of the Affairs of Indians, are helpful and enlightening.\n\nAn exhibit was held at Prince Rupert, not for competition but to give the parents who live in the North an opportunity of seeing the work of our children.\n\nAbout twenty-five pounds of sweet peas seeds were sent to the Coqualeetza co-educators this spring.\n\nIf they were judiciously planted these flowers will help to make homes more beautiful and a more attractive environment for the children. Flowers improve and beautify any place and add value to any house or village. The seeds are carefully selected from the best plants and will be sent free to any except on receipt of a letter.\n\nChief Mathias and his son Buffalo Bill visited the school September 23 and lectured on the legends of Vancouver.\n\nCommissioner Solway of the B.C. Scout Association visited Coqualeetza, May 9, and was much interested in the large collection of Indian curios.\n\nDuring the lecture course, several of B.C.'s Professors were accompanied by their wives and some very pleasant social hours were enjoyed.\n\nPrincipal Riley's Secretaries seem to be rather popular, for in one year three have deserted him to be married.\n\nCoqualeetza was again successful in the Vancouver Exhibition in obtaining the gold seal diploma for the best educational exhibit from any Indian Reserve. We also won the gold seal also the first prize for a special Maternal Training exhibit. A special and first prize for a group of paintings by the pupils of the school in the folklore and industrial arts Coqualeetza was very fortunate in obtaining prizes.\n\nWe wish to express our pleasure in having had with us Mr. Frank Iddis, F.R.A.M., Examiner of the Associated Board of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music, London, England.\n\nOfficer Adams of Coqualeetza was successful in winning the medal for highest points in the junior division at the annual track meet of the Chilliwack High School.\n\nWe are indebted to Mr. E. Mower, Sirdar, for showing his appreciation of the school by writing a letter of commendation to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, by treating the school to a picture show.\n\nInter-School Sports\n\nThe beginning of any enterprise is always interesting. The principals of three Indian Residential Schools, namely, Rev. A. R. Lett, St. George's, Lytton, appointed chairman; Mr. F. E. Antfield, Sr., Michael's, Alert Bay, appointed secretary, and Rev. G. H. Riley, Coqualeetza, appointed treasurer met at the Indian Office at Vancouver, on November 16th, and discussed the advisability of inter-school sports. They decided to send a deputation of Indian affairs in Ottawa for consent to such a proposed meet of the schools at Coqualeetza, Sirdar. After receiving the approval of the government to the schools, Mr. E. Mower, Sirdar, and Mr. W. S. Smith, Coqualeetza, the principals being present. Details were arranged, plans formulated and invitations sent to other schools to unite in the undertaking.\n\nAfter considerable correspondence the meet was called for the 26th, 27th and 28th of May. The weather was perfect. In every sense it was a success. The whole purpose was accomplished. The pupils got a broader view of affairs, a larger outlook was instilled, friendship and fellowship was promoted, and sport as a character-building factor was emphasized.\n\nThe meet records its indebtedness to Capt. McIlroyne for his deep interest in this first meet and his influence in securing for us tents, marquees and kitchen outfit, etc., for the occasion.\nAlexander G. Jamieson\n\nWith deep regret we record the passing of Mr. Alexander G. Jamieson, who for ten years was Manual Training instructor at Coqualeetza. He put this Department of the school's activity on a most satisfactory footing. As an instructor he was easily in the front rank and excelled in his work. His practical skill was admired by all who knew him and he was loved by his pupils. His genial noble soul and few are the boys of his classes who have not been impressed by the nobleness of his mind and heart. He was an artist as well as an artisan. He was a naturalist and few lectures have been Extented to such wide pleasure as his popular talks on these subjects.\n\nDepartmental Reports\n\nHIGH SCHOOL (Chilliwack): Miss M. W.

Pate\n\nAGRICULTURAL operations have been progressing very favorably this year at Coqualeetza. The hay crop is unusually heavy, although weather conditions have not been entirely favorable for harvesting. Our potato crop is in splendid condition and our grain crops are doing well except for the exception. Our dairy herd is in excellent condition and have done well so far. The Cow Testing Association has placed our dairy herd in the 400-lb. class which shows very good progress. We are now using our own creamery for making butter and cheese and also selling our whole milk. Our orchards and small fruits are developing from year to year. We have two acres of raspberries and about two of loganberries, which promise a good crop next year. The tree fruits will be an average crop. There are several apple trees and trees, mostly of a bearing age.\n\nThe following boys have proved themselves proficient as teamsters: James Barton, Felix Paul and Arnold Raymond.\n\nSome of the boys have done very well managing and taking care of the stock: George Brown, Sandy Angus and Charlie Williams.\n\nAnthony Calder, Peter Martin, Allen Young, have become quite dependable on farm work.\n\nGarden Report\n\nEdward F. Pate\n\nI WONDER if anyone passes Coqualeetza without casting an eye over the low stone wall across the driveway into its great building draped with green vines and which presently will be enlivened by the rambling roses.\n\nThe flower gardens on either side are now a blaze of color; these gardens have been gradually enlarged each summer and will see a still further addition set out in manifold gladness to be backed later by a special selection of named dahlias, kindly donated by Mr. G. Ketchum and Valentine and Mrs. P. F. Pate of Chilliwack. Several new varieties of flowers grace our grounds this year which have already attracted special attention.\n\nThe vegetable garden West of the boys' camp has been extensive than last year and demands much time and attention.\n\nPosts have made much musical noise about gardens and rightly so, but before the gleeful concert the perceptive eye of Mr. Edward Pate, Coqualeetza's son, have learned something of this. One of them, Earl Mahone, an intermediate lad, has been dubbed \"Mr. Pate's head gardener\" because of his activities. Other boys shown keen interest and capability are George Brown, Cyril Mahone, Sandy Angus, Harvey Sykes, Charlie Clifford and Jackson Stott.\n\nGood work has been done by George Auckland, Alex Wilson, Raymond Modeste, Herbert Dodson, Frank Calder, Gordon Angus, Placid Jack, Norman Brown, Walter Siskin and Herman Quackenbush.\n\nTwenty-nine\nManual Training\n\nG. Williams\n\nThere has been a division of the Manual Training work this year into Elementary and Advanced classes; the Elementary being subdivided into a Junior A and Junior B. In the Advanced division departments have been divided into Woodworking and Lathe Work; classes in each of these divisions have been further subdivided into Junior and Senior.\n\nIn the Junior division the course followed was similar to that endorsed by the Provincial Board of Technical Education. In this course was studied rudimentary drawing, basic mechanics, tools and their use, Drawing of machines and structures, and scale drawing. The various elevations has been an interesting part of the work and the practical application acquired in the building of models has been productive of a development of the mind that will work down the line. The juniors displayed a great aptitude for drawing and design, linked with an exciting interest.\n\nThe ranking of the Junior Classes is as follows:\n\nCLASS A\u2014Sixteen Pupils\nDRAWING\u2014(1) C. Clifford; (2) T. Jones; (3) W. Marks; Honorable mention, H. Sepas, W. Stokar.\nWOODWORK\u2014(1) H. Sepas; (2) A. Ferre; (3) C. Clifford; Honorable mention, H. Dodson, R. Modate.\n\nCLASS B\u2014Seventeen Pupils\nDRAWING\u2014(1) C. Mathews; (2) W. Green; (3) W. Marks; Honorable mention, P. Brown, J. Campbell.\nWOODWORK\u2014(1) W. Green; (2) C. Mathews; (3) A. Chilike; Honorable mention, G. Anderson, W. Quickhills.\n\nThe Senior Class followed the higher course of training as approved by the Provincial Curriculum. Some of the more advanced senior students took a special course in elementary shopwork, blue print reading, panel construction, door construction, drafting construction, table and desk construction formed the basis of their study. Building work coupled with the care, operation, and safety of machinery formed an interesting part of the course. Honorable mention for the best work in the class in the above category was awarded to C. Mathews, second place, W. Hall; third, Peter Martin. Honorable Mention includes C. Wilson, J. Tait, G. Brown and A. Davidson. An elementary course in the art of wood turning was taken by C. Mahone who proved himself to be a capable and efficient student.\n\nNatural wood carving together with modern design has been carefully treated both in the making of totem poles and reproductions of Indian design as a decorative agent for modern furniture. Of the Elementary Classes, H. Sepas and of the Advanced Classes, J. Starr, have shown special aptitude in this branch of training.\n\nMechanics Class\n\nMr. F. Edwards\n\nGood progress has been made during the past year in both mechanics classes. The engines and tools provided by the Department have made instructing by Mr. Edwards much more interesting for the pupils, and shows distinctly that the impression made is of a more permanent nature than purely technical exposure.\n\nFour engines were completely overhauled, valves ground, new babbin bearings poured and fitted and piston rings installed.\n\nConsiderable time was spent on various methods of wiring the electrical fittings of different types of ignition systems.\n\nDemonstrations were given by Mr. Edwards of the most modern systems of cylinder reboiling and valve seating on equipment loaned by the school.\n\nIt is hoped that some Diesel engines will be provided for the third year pupils to enable them to follow up their instruction which will be invaluable to those boys who follow mechanical work after leaving school.\n\nParticularly good work has been done by F. Wilson, G. Douglas, and J. Tait of the first year class and A. Caldwell has gained credit for the improvement he has shown over last year. Second year pupils have given good attention and missed very few lectures; the work of M. Leeson, W. Hall and C. Mahone being particularly good.\n\nExaminations for both classes will be held on June 24 when a better idea of the pupils' standing will be obtained.\n\nThirty\n\nBlacksmithing Department\n\nIn this technical department, several of the boys taking the course have shown increased interest and increased ability. In addition to the number of smaller blacksmith articles there has been considerable room work to turn equipment and other heavy pieces. A prominent for skilled workmanship\u2014a fancy framework stand.\n\nMany of those who are going through the Blacksmithing department find their experience helpful when they are enrolled in the Auto Mechanics class. The pupils seem to have a natural adaptability to the forge and working in iron.\n\nMoses Leeson, Anthony Caliber and Sandy Angus are very apt pupils and rank in the above order.\n\nShoe Repairing\n\nFortune\n\nThe introduction of shoe making may be new but the steady repair work is rather monotonous. However, Moses Leeson deserves great credit for his faithful and skilful workmanship during the year. Peter Martin and Allan Prentice are finding interest in this vocation.\n\nBoiler Room\n\nG. Hammond\n\nThe Boiler Room work has little variation from year to year only in the change of assistants. It is rather a privilege to be assigned to this important post, to study the first laws of steam heating, general electric work and plumbing. Willie Hall deserves special mention while Harvey Sepas and Peter Martin have also taken a keen interest.\n\nGarment Department\n\nMiss F. Atwood\n\nIn the garment department this term the girls have had a wide experience in the making of twenty-eight distinctly different garments and articles, each girl being given instruction and practice in garment construction and care. During the year 1,500 garments have been made since the school opened, including 62 boys' shirts and 47 girls' dresses; these have been made from materials supplied by the school.\n\nOur banner month this term was May, during which 348 garments and household articles were made.\n\nCostumes were made for the girls taking part in the Operetta given during the Christmas holidays, also appearance costumes for the New Year's Eve party.\n\nEach member of the girls' Graduation Class is responsible for the making of her own graduation dress and accessories.\n\nThe garment construction and fancy work for the Coqualeetza exhibit at the Vancouver Exhibition is also done in this Department. In addition to the regular work, the girls have been engaged in exhibit work, redesigning the dress, etc., which has been used to buy new material in preparation for the 1931 exhibit. A sewing class has been in organization since the first of the year for this purpose, both Junior and Senior girls taking part.\n\nAll of the twenty-five girls passing through this Department during the term have taken a keen and active interest in the work done, and the following are mentioned as having given the greatest amount of time and attention: Misses Mary Mabel Martin for punctuality and thoroughness; Agnes Roberts, Stella Cooper and Alice Perceval for good work; Amelia MacMillan as first-class shirtnamer and Charlotte Prentice for steady application and advancement.\n\nCulinary Department\n\nMiss E. Baverstock\n\nMotto: The Hungry Must Be Fed\n\nWe have come to the end of another very busy year in this Department. Though it takes a lot of time preparing the vegetables, fruits, pies and cakes for so many, it has all been done cheerfully. Besides the daily routine there is fruit canning, and marinating, jam filling and preserving, etc.\n\nGirls of the class of 1931 have made very good work, faithfully and cheerfully done, are Kate Morgan, Mabel Martin, Annie Arnot and Jennie Peters.\n\nMany showed marked improvement, among them Susan Charlie, Flora Thomas, Evelyn Habland and Hazel James.\n\nThirty-one\nBakery\n\nThe work in this Department is done by the boys, tons of flour being used monthly to make bread and buns to supply the hungry multitude.\n\nThose worthy of special mention are Peter Martin, George Brown, Felix Paul and Jackson Starr.\n\nThose showing improvement: Herman Quickstall, Philip Watson, Lawrence Allard and Charlie Williams.\n\nThe Laundry\n\nMiss B. Smith\n\nThere has been exceedingly good work done this year in the laundry division. All have taken a great pride in their work of laundry, including the table linen which has been a great credit to them. Every week over 2,000 garments are put through the machine. A large number of these are ironed by hand. There are three ironers in constant use every day and we have an electric iron which is used for dressing table linen. The girls are taught how to iron by hand including the starching, mending and setting dress, thus giving the girls the necessary experience in this method of washing. In addition each girl is given a period of hand ironing and takes her turn assisting at the machines sorting, washing and ironing.\n\nFifty-six girls have entered this Department during the year. It is difficult to choose when all have been doing good work. Those who stand out and should be mentioned are Jane Payne, coming from Ontario, receiving special praise; Alice Sepas, Agnes Roberts, Violet Wright for good work, and Charlotte Prevost for being an expert ironer.\n\nThe Infirmary Report, 1931\n\nDr. J. Butler, B.N.\n\nThe health of the school has been exceedingly good this year.\n\nThe usual number of operations for tonsils, etc., have been performed with very good results.\n\nThe usual number of cases of minor remedies have been treated by Dr. B. A. Hopkins, of New Westminster.\n\nThe teeth have been examined and treated by Dr. Hallman.\n\nThe work in the Infirmary has given great satisfaction. Those showing improvement are Katie Morgan, Mary Williams, May Marks, Alice Sepas, and Mary Wallace.\n\nKatie Morgan, May Marks, Alice Sepas, Ella Duff, Anna Hill, Alma Alexander and Ellen Marks, Charlotte Prevost decorated the wards, making them cheerful for Christmas, in her own happy way, so as an interior decorator, she ranks first.\n\nThe Dining Room\n\nMiss A. Beaton\n\nAll school dining halls are a bit problematical as to make them attractive and how to keep them clean are two questions to be answered daily.\n\nA coat of kerosene and new linoleum has brightened the pupils' dining room very much and Olive Munro has been responsible for keeping the tables cherry with flowers.\n\nThe girls generally are to be commended for their faithfulness and willingness in the daily routine but Susan Murray, Alice Sepas, and Ellen Marks helped Miss Marie Underwood and Olive Munro have not spared themselves in the matter of extra polishing.\n\nThe children's dining room has been decorated by picture Margaret Brown as a plump matron fattening small cherubs on the same brand of peanut butter as used at Coqualeetza.\n\nThe girls who have graduated from the children's service into the Staff dining room have worked well and have been appreciated. This year we have had a case of typhoid pneumonia.\n\nFor all-round efficiency and cheerfulness Alice Sepas merits special mention, and Charlotte Prevost has spread laughter and sunshine freely, in her happy-go-lucky way.\n\nThe Sewing Room\n\nMiss M. E. Taylor\n\nOne and a half hours per day theory. Twenty-two hours per week practical.\n\nMortor: A Stitch in Time Saves Nine.\n\nThis Department is a house of industry where the girls learn to mend torn overalls, shirts and dresses, sweaters, jackets and coats, and hundreds of stockings and socks to be overhauled each week. Underwear, bed linen and towels are washed there and distributed to the various departments. Quilts and blankets each spring are made by their industrious hands and stored away in the linen closet and store-room.\n\nThere are two classes held daily, a junior and a senior class.\n\nThose worthy of special mention are: Phyllis Parker, May Marks, Myrtle Angus, Edith Williams, Philomena Lee, and Catherine MacMillan.\n\nThirty-two\n\nCoqualeetza Chapel Fund\n\n\"The Chapel\"\u2014as sketched from imagination by one of the Students, Percy Barton.\n\nThe above sketch by Percy Barton was made hurriedly. It is not to be taken as an exact picture of Coqualeetza's prospective Chapel, but to bring before us in a vivid manner the fact that the time has arrived when we should commence a campaign to raise the funds necessary for its erection. The objective is $110,000.\n\nSixteen years ago the Principal received $250 to be applied to some object for the benefit of the school. As there had been talk of the need of a Chapel, he opened a savings account in the First National Bank, and each month since then has added to it for a chapel service once a year on Graduation Sunday an offering has been taken for this purpose. The manual training class made an offertory box. This stands in the entrance hall of the school. Any who amongst viewers, the sick and pupils feel disposed to give in this charitable spirit. The Chapel is expected at last and each year we add to our deposit to the bank. The Chapel Fund now stands at $14,067.96. We have received a few voluntary subscriptions. For these we are grateful. Now the time is ripe for a campaign to raise funds. We urgently appeal to the graduates and ex-pupils for donations. We appeal to the Board of Directors to make this case the subject of an appeal. We appeal to the parents of the children attending Coqualeetza, and receive the real heart of the undertaking. We appeal to former members of the staff whose interest in the school has not waned. We appeal to friends of the native people.\n\nDuring the year we were surprised to receive a gift of $100 from Miss Young of Cobourg, former boy's monitor, the deed of a building lot in South Vancouver overlooking the harbour, on which we are asked to realize, devoting the proceeds to the Chapel Fund. Miss Young's devotion and loyalty to her old school has always been a source of pleasure. I am sure, living here and there in the North, men who were under her care when they were boys, who remember her kind sympathy and splendid example with gratitude.\n\nNotice of Gratification\n\nIt is very gratifying that at head quarters in Ottawa the authorities are alive not only to the mental welfare of the native boys and girls, but to their need for recreation. Mr. Russell T. Ferrier, the Superintendent of Education, who has always been an advocate of good athletics, has himself approved and interested the Deputy Minister in the Olympiad to such an extent that it was made possible, and we extend, as a school to the Department, our heartfelt thanks.\n\nThirty-three\nEleventh Annual Lecture Course\n\nIt was again our privilege to enjoy a splendid series of lectures through the months of February, March and April. Ten of these lectures were by Professors of the University of British Columbia, under the direction of the University Extension Committee. These were supplemented by specialists in various themes.\n\nThe course comprised the undermentioned:\n\nFebruary 13th\u2014\n    Thursday 12th\u2014\n        \"Milk and the Feeding of Children\"\u2014Prof. N.

He thought it a very comprehensive record of the school work and recreation and he was much interested in the school. The Minister expressed the hope of visiting the school at some future time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. G. H.

McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMarch 28th,\n1933.\n\nMy dear Dr. McGill:\n\nThe Board of Home Missions of The United Church of Canada, at its annual meeting last week, passed the following resolution:\n\n\"Moved by Rev. K. J. Beaton,\nSeconded by Rev. E. D. Braden,\n\n\"That we nominate to the Indian Department for the office of Principal-elect of Coqualeetza Residential School the Rev. R. C. Scott, B.A.\"\n\nRev. G. H. Raley, the Principal of Coqualeetza is reaching the age of retirement, and has intimated his intention of resigning in June, 1934. We felt that in such a large institution his successor should be with him for an academic year in order to learn the details of the work. It is our idea that Mr. Scott will be associated with Mr. Raley as Assistant Principal beginning with September of this year.\n\nRobert Clyde Scott, B.A., whose name we submit in nomination for this important position, was born at Paisley, Ontario, in 1891. He is a graduate in Arts of the University of Toronto and in Theology of Victoria University. He has given seventeen years of distinguished service to the Church as the Commodore of our marine fleet on the coast of British Columbia, and is well and favorably known to all the Indian tribes between Cape Mudge and Alaska. His first appointment after ordination was to an Indian Mission and he has been intensely interested in their advancement ever since.\n\nBy temperament and training Mr. Scott is peculiarly fitted for dealing with the Indian people and his long association with them as the Captain of the \"Thomas Crosby\" has given him a very intimate knowledge of their psychology. He knows hundreds of the graduates of Coqualeetza personally, and in the recruitment of new pupils will undoubtedly have the loyal support of every graduate of this great school.\n\nMr. Scott is personally known to Hon. T. G. Murphy, the Minister of the Interior, and before bringing his name before our Board, I discussed informally with Mr. Murphy the fact that I intended to nominate him. I have known him\nmyself since we were class-mates in college and have no hesitation in saying that the appointment will be received with universal satisfaction throughout the United Church.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your approval of this nomination, so that I may communicate it to Mr. Scott and to our British Columbia Conference.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, June 21, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, under whose auspices the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School is conducted, have nominated the Reverend R. C. Scott, B.A., as principal, to succeed the Rev. G. H. Raley, who will retire in June, 1934.

His extended experience and his association with the Indians on the coast of British Columbia should prove of great value to him in the work at Coqualeetza. I am pleased to approve of Mr. Scott's appointment. I also note the arrangement whereby he will be associated with Mr. Raley as Assistant Principal from the beginning of September, this year, until the resignation of Mr. Raley in June, 1934, in order to become familiar with the many details in the management of the work.\n\nThe Department will look forward to the continued success in the work at this school under the principalship of Mr. Scott.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

R.G. Scott, B.A., is to be appointed as Principal to succeed Rev. G.H. Raley who will retire in 1934, as Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. I have advised the Inspector of Indian Schools of the Department's letter.\n\nIt is my view that if Rev. Mr. Scott is half as good a man as Mr. Raley he will still be a first-class man. I doubt if anyone will do more or better work for the Indians than Rev. Mr. Raley has done during the past forty years as Missionary and Principal of the School, respectively. If it were possible I would like to see some fitting recognition given Mr. Raley upon his retirement but I do not know just how far the Department can go in such a matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP/KD.\n\nChas.

I.A.\nAre We Doing Enough To Help the Indians?\n\nBy J. W. W.\n\nBefore the white man came to bother them, the original people of this province had a simple life, almost primitive. It was a simple life, but problems of the culture had grown, but problems of the spirit had grown, too. The white man had come, and what added even beyond these complications was the fact that the Indians were not the objects of praise or the water as they came out to meet us, but we were setting our feet upon their land.\n\nWe looked graciously on their innocence, the principle which prompted consistently in all our contacts has led to most of the troubles which have arisen.\n\nThe Indian was self-supporting. That \"Support\" may have been meager, comfortless, but it was there. For one thing, he fought only when he was strong enough, and because no one dared. For another, he was able to take care for himself; there was no need.\n\nTaking from his soil his valuable assets, he became dependent. It was not long before the white man began to realize that the Indians were not merely a problem, but a threat. They were a threat to the white man's way of life. They were a threat to the white man's way of life.\n\nThe future of the Indian south is a serious problem for both educationalist and statesman. It is facing from many quarters today, and the late Dr. G. H. Bailey, late principal of the Columbia Indian School at Skeetch, where he has been developing a system of education and training in the country on the sound principles of the Christian religion.\n\nDr. Bailey was particularly fitted for this work. Born in Yorkshire of good family, his father being a prominent member of the Christian gentleman, he came to Canada in his teens with the record of an athletic, sporting youth. He was educated at Toronto in 1865, married in 1869 a lady who became his wife for life, and entered the ministry then undertaken, for he volunteered for missionary work among the Indians of the northern coast of British Columbia, the first mission being established at Skeetch.\n\nIn this isolated place, Dr. and Mrs. Bailey spent thirteen years. The young minister became a friend to the Indians, and Indians, to be known as \"The Eldest Son,\" became a great friend to the Indians. He visited a small mission school there, organized the first fair held on the north-west coast of B.C.,\n\nHe died while still engaged in missionary work, and his death was a great loss to the Indians of the north-west coast.\n\nIndian Affairs, Vol. 23, No. 1, p. 3\nOttawa, April 9, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, and we are pleased to know that you have received such splendid cooperation during the past year from Rev. R. C. Scott, Principal of the Coqualeetza Residential School, and Rev. A. M. D. Gillen, Principal of the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSIR:-\n\nNow that the Fiscal Year has closed, and all matters pertaining to it have been cleared up, I would like to mention to the Department my appreciation of the co-operation received throughout the year from the two Residential School Principals, viz: The Reverend R.C. Scott of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, and the Reverend A.M.D. Gillen of St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School.\n\nBoth these gentlemen have gone out of their way to help us out on many occasions and their relationship has not only been cordial with this office, but also with each other.\n\nIt will readily be understood that this latter attitude is of enormous advantage in a mixed Indian population, and I trust that the Agency will long have the benefit of their presence within its boundaries.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O*N. Daunt.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nLETTER NO. 44\n\nCOQUALSETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nNovember, 1935\n\nTo Our Graduates and Friends:\n\nIt is a pleasure to write you once more and bring to you news of the school, as well as to assure you of our deep interest in you.\n\nSchool has settled down nicely for the short pull that remains to put studies and games and all across before Christmas. Of course we are not really at home until after Halloween, for, from the time the boys and girls get back, they look forward with great anticipation to that wonderful evening. This year, it seemed as though all past celebrations were undone. Four parties in all were held, the Primaries, Juniors, Intermediates and Seniors. How we did wish that you folks back home could have looked in upon us! In the afternoons the younger children enjoyed games in the Assembly Hall and then went to the dining room for their feast of good things. In the evening, softly shaded lights cast their spell over everything, through festoons of drapery in black and gold. Upon the walls, black cats played hide and seek among the big yellow pumpkins. Party dresses were the order of the day for the girls and they looked their best this year, so everyone said. The boys were on hand, neat and fit looking and one and all thoroughly enjoyed themselves. \"Three Jolly Fishermen,\" \"Crows and Cranes,\" and \"Hares and Hounds\" brought everyone into the spirit of the evening, and \"The Ace of Diamonds\" was, as usual, most popular of the Folk Dances. Musical Chairs, Apples on a String and Relay Races completed a fine evening's fun. In the Dining Room, special tables carried all sorts of good things to eat and big pumpkins grinned a welcome when the lights were turned low. Mr. Peake is \"some carver\"; ask the Intermediates and Seniors if he does not know how to cut a man's face in a pumpkin!\n\nFounder's Day brought happiness too. Dr. White, ever welcome friend of the School, spoke of the early days and brought a message of cheer and encouragement on Sunday evening. On Monday evening the School enjoyed a real good picture show, and for supper beforehand, sat down to a very fine birthday supper. In the centre aisle, upon a table, stood the Birthday Cake, with its forty-six candles. These were set alight by Dolly Dick and Jean Little and these girls also extinguished them later, and then the cake was cut by Principal Scott. Miss Bailey has distinguished herself in preparation of these fine Birthday and Halloween suppers. Uniform kindliness, a motherly heart, efficiency in her work and experience make her just indispensable upon these happy occasions.\n\nSports are well under way, and although we miss Oliver Adams and others on the Football teams, still the boys are taking hold well. They have won one game and lost one so far, and the one they lost was to the best team in the League. We were proud of them, even at that, for they never quit playing right to the very last, and we look for a good return game with this team, when we are sure the boys of Coqualeetza will show them something. We have no Basket Ball team this year, but have a good one in the making for next year. We hope, this year to start Badminton for the girls.\n\nA new departure has been the setting up of a Home Economics Kitchen, with Mrs. Morrison in charge. Through the interest of the Department of Indian Affairs, a grant sufficient to buy the stove and other equipment was secured. The room has been remodelled, an extra\nCOQUALEETZA\nRESIDENTIAL\nSCHOOL\n\nSARDIS, B. C.\nJUNE, 1935.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFOREWORD\n\nThe year has come and gone, and the school that echoed and resounded with laughter and song, and at times just plain noise, stands silent and empty, save for the farm and garden workers and one or two others. How quiet it is in the hallways where the boys did their work but a short time ago, to the class rooms and to morning and evening prayers. And the days will soon pass and bring the time September the Third\u2014when school will be back for another year.\n\nExaminations are over. Of our High School Class of fifteen, five received first class honors, six passed with second and two with third. In these honors the Algonquin led easily with Fraser Valley pupils well behind, with Nass River and Bella Coola close up for third place; then came Queen Charlotte Island and Port Simpson. The results are significant awards and have given hope to both our candidates. Examinations in Public School Grades were very satisfactory.\n\nOur Boat Building Department has been re-organized with Mr. Hadfieldstone in charge. He has proved himself a capable and successful teacher. Twelve boys have received an excellent training in boat and metal work. One 28 feet complete gill net and trolling boat and three row boats were built since Christmas. All work has been done with care and thoroughness. The boats are of good design, strong and durable, staunch, seaworthy and serviceable. The boys have shown good interest and have been given instruction covering all phases of boat work from building to outfitting and rigging. Two classes of boys have been registered with Mr. Frank Edwards in Motor Mechanics. The Principal and others who have \"picked up\" some of these classes have often wished that they might have had the opportunity which these boys are receiving. They get a good working knowledge of gas engines, starters, dynamos and generators, with practice on the same oil that goes with up-to-date boat and car equipment.\n\nIn Manual Training the boys under Mr. George Wilson have received valuable instruction in carpentry, boat building and in practical work. We fully expect our Manual Training Department to carry off the major share of the prizes at the Vancouver Exhibition again this year. Through the able hands of the teachers it is being conglomerated by having such capable instructors, and is indebted also to the Department of Indian Affairs for tools and equipment for this work, as well as for other tokens of loyal support.\n\nIn the Girls' Section Miss O. Ainslie and Mrs. Prest have given instruction in carding, spinning and weaving and have given training in the use of various machines. Embroidering and needlework on linens and upon blanket cloths of symbolic Native designs, have produced some really beautiful purses, runners, rugs, hangings, radio mats and throws. Three of these girls, who are proficient in this art, the girls and bearing Native designs, when displayed in Regina, encountered sale farther East, were promptly purchased there. This department is now open for native handiwork and the market is growing every year. Coqualeetza is strongly supporting this movement. Rev. Dr. Ralph and other traders have also become interested in opening new avenues of exchange for genuine native articles and it is hoped that real help will be afforded to pupils in making a living when they return to their homes.\n\nThrough the kindness of Mrs. Scott and the instruction of Miss Kay Mathers a special Home Economics Class was started. The Principal's residence was used each month, and the pupils covered twenty hours instruction in baking and cooking as done in a family of average size. At the close of each lesson, the recipes used were written out and given to the pupils for use at home when school was over. Plans are being laid for an extension of this work during the coming year and the work covered will be of great value to the girls in their future homes.\n\nCoqualeetza has been fortunate also in having Mrs. Price as instructor in Music. Singing was taught regularly in the class rooms. It was a great treat to the children to go to sleep and then \"wake up\" and guess what their little friends had been singing. They thus learned to sing while playing a game. Individual students were tested, passed and encouraged. Miss Dolly Dick, passed the introductory examination in the Toronto Conservatory of Music. A recital was given in the Assembly Room by these students, and was much enjoyed by all present.\n\nBest of all, the pupils have shown real interest in the religious life of the school. Eighteen boys and girls accepted Christ as their Savior and nineteen others re-dedicated their lives to God. We hope to keep in touch with the graduates who have left school this year as we do with the children who are now on holidays. Over thirty children are in our fine new camp near White Rock and join in activities according to parent and friend's wishes from the boy who spends his summer and friends at home. We look forward to the coming year with much anticipation.\n\nREV. R. C. SCOTT, B.A.,\nprincipal.\nCircular Letter #3\n\nCOQUELEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nMay, 1935.\n\nTo Parents, Graduates and Friends:\n\nEaster has come and gone and the school year is rapidly hastening to a close. We are sure that the parents and friends of the School would like to hear just how we have been getting along since the winter left us eagerly awaiting the coming of the Springtime. Although long delayed, it has come - green grass and lovely flowers, with tree foliage almost cut complete, are the order of the day. In School games, football is over and soft ball and track events have taken its place. We have 4 soft ball teams organized among the girls and 4 among the boys. On Accession Day the girls turned down a very chivalrous offer on the part of the boys to play them \"left handed\" and said they would not accept any challenge until they were able to play the boys right handed, or any other way they might wish. A fine spirit indeed, and hence hoping the girls make the progress they look for. Athletics play a big part in School life and make for health and wholesome spirit among the children, as well as forming a very real part of the training for actual life when School is over.\n\nBut we have not forgotten the more important things either. It was a glad sight to see the boys and girls who came to the Assembly Hall, following a series of talks by the Principal, upon the Life of Christ, leading up to the sacrifice upon Calvary, for the sins of the earth; love overcoming evil in the sheer power and beauty of that Divine life, which gave itself freely and for us all, upon the Cross. Without urging and quite freely, of their own accord, 32 boys and girls handed in cards signifying their wish to become members of the Church upon profession of their faith in Christ, 18 others also signed cards, saying that they wished to rededicate themselves to His service. As the Principal was absent upon Conference work in the East, the reception of these boys and girls into Membership in the Church will take place a little later. Arrangements will be made for the pupils who wish to join the Anglican Church to do so and they shall attend classes conducted by the Rev. R.M. Searles of St. John's at Sardis. But whether it be the Anglican Church or the United Church, the emphasis is placed on the fact that it is THE CHURCH OF CHRIST which these pupils are joining. Our hearts are glad, indeed, at this response upon the part of our boys and girls. In the absence of the Principal in the East, on Easter Sunday Evening, all the senior boys and girls attended German United Church in Sardis, where a very beautiful Easter Cantata \"The Resurrection\" was given by the Church Choir and was much enjoyed by everyone present.\n\nAccession Day has just passed and what a day it was! In the morning at 7:15, the entire School gathered about the flag pole and as the Union Jack floated out when two of our \"Cub\" Scouts pulled the halyard, broke out into the National Anthem. This was followed by prayer by the Principal, then, before marching back to the dining room for breakfast, three rousing cheers were given for the King and for Queen Mary. At 10:15, after finishing morning chores, everyone gathered in the Assembly Hall and listened in, to the Empire Broadcast. How wonderful it was to hear the King's voice and to hear him\nCircular Letter #3.\n\nMay, 1935.\n\nsay to the children of the Empire, \"THE KING IS SPEAKING TO YOU!\" Every word was heard distinctly, as was each item of the wonderful program, when, one after another of the places in the far-flung Empire contributed its part. After lunch Soft Ball games held the interest of all. The first game was between the girls and the Staff. It was won by the girls by some two runs, but it was hard fought from the start. Later the senior boys played and after supper another game was played between two boys teams. But we nearly forgot the Jubilee cake, ornamented in its icing and trailing ribbons of red, white and blue, and resting 25 birthday candles, which, during supper, were set alight, with the cheers of the children. When they had burned down, the two boys who had baked it and the two girls who had iced it had the fun of blowing them out. One blast and every candle was extinguished. After the senior boys and girls proceeded to the back farm, where a big bonfire was set alight and around it arose the merry glee and song loud and clear. Under the capable leadership of Mr. Poole, and so it would have gone far into the night, but bed time was approaching and after ice cream had been served, all joined in singing around the dying fire, the appropriate words of the hymn \"Abide with Me\" fast falls the eveningside. Back through the moonlight we went to the school, where tired, but happy children were soon in dreamland, after a most wonderful day, which will live long in their memories.\n\nAnd now in closing, let us say that Holidays are fast approaching, holiday agreements are coming in with every mail, but many are still out. Parents must let us know, when and where they wish their children to be sent for holidays, and fare money must be provided by them, best of all, now, for our School supply cannot pay the number of fares necessary to send all pupils home and the Department of Indian Affairs will not do so. If not sent now, then it must be sent later. Residential schools are doing their own, in the esteem of our parents, and those who have children whom they wish to send, should notify the Principal right away, or they may be disappointed and not be able to get them in. Ask your Indian Agent for the form of Application, have the children examined by your Doctor and ask the Indian Agent to notify the Principal also.\n\nBright sunshine, blue skies, singing birds, green lawns and lovely flowers are with us once more and will all help to make our last weeks of school enjoyable. All children who remain at school for the Holiday, will be taken to the Camp at White Rock for two months at the Seaside, where boating swimming, hikes, games and all that goes with a real Holiday, will be enjoyed by the children, under careful supervision.\n\nWith every good wish to all back home in the villages, from the pupils and members of Staff, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. Scott\n\nPrincipal\nLETTER NO.2. JANUARY 1935.\n\nTo Parents, Graduates and Friends:\n\nLet it be well on in January, but not too late to wish all our friends a very HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR.\n\nSchool life is settling down into its usual course after the many happy occasions of holiday time. If you could only have seen the School and the children! Parents and friends would have been delighted and many a Graduate would have liked to be back once again as a pupil. As a matter of fact we had ONE Graduate, Charlie Williams of Duncan, B.C., for a few days at Christmas time and other friends from Duncan and Kokiliah. For a week before Christmas our big Buick car, which some of the boys named \"Very Ann\" made from three to four round trips every day between the School and Chilliwack so that the pupils could do their Christmas Shopping. This was great improvement on going in on the Tram, and it was thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nAs Christmas approached the School became a hive of activity. The main corridor was adorned with long garlands of greenery among which nestled red berries which might well have grown there, so real did they look. In the main hall, on the one side a Post Office had been set up, with all the regular post office signs, \"Mail Xmas Cards here\", etc etc and in this were placed all parcels coming into the School for the Children. The afternoon of Xmas day they were all given out to the ones for whom they were intended by parents and friends. Across from the Post Office was a woodland scene. Two cottages nestled at the foot of what looked like tall fir trees. Bits of cotton wool upon the branches gave an appearance of a snow storm, and from the windows of the two bungalows came beams of light bringing at once the suggestion of warmth and Christmas cheer. In the foreground was a rink with what looked like a sheet of real ice, and upon it figures of the well known Maple Leaf Hockey Team playing another team\u2014was it Coqualeetza? Stretching from the forest to the Post Office was an overhead illuminated sign wishing one and all who entered a Merry Xmas. One caught the spirit of Xmas as soon as he entered the building. Xmas Eve stockings were hung in long lines in the corridors upstairs. Outside of the dormitory of the little boys was a chair upon which was placed a glass of milk and a biscuit to refresh Santa on his way about the school. Believe it or not there were only a few crumbs of the biscuit left in the dormitory when the wee men got up and the glass of milk was empty. Puzzle\u2014Who drank it? But the biggest joke of all was when the big boys all got up and made their beds and got dressed ready to come downstairs Miss MacGregor, watchful mother of them all, had to shoo them all back to bed saying it was only TWO O'CLOCK.\n\nBright and early everyone was astir and the wonderful day began. At Nine Thirty the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was dispensed in the Assembly Hall and over one hundred of the Staff and Pupils partook with thanksgiving for the Heavenly Father's \"Unspeakeable Gift\". Noon brought a wonderful Xmas dinner, roast goose with plum pudding and all the trimmings. At 4 P.M. Santa Claus arrived in a sleigh drawn by four prancing steeds recruited from the \"Cubs\". Jolly and fat, and full of fun as ever, Santa soon made every child happy. With quick intuition one wee laddie said as Santa was giving out\nthe gifts: \"It looks like Santa but it sounds like Mr. Peake\", and he was dead right.\n\nSupper time saw a big Christmas Cake\u2014well over a hundred and fifty pounds\u2014ready to be cut up and served among the children. By nine thirty at night all was quiet and tired but happy children snuggled down under the bed clothes and soon were off to the Land of Dreams.\n\nOn the Sunday evening before Christmas a very beautiful Pageant was staged under the direction of Mrs. McKenzie, Assistant Boy's Matron. It was called the \"Bethlehem Manger\", and one by one the different groups\u2014the Wise Men, the Shepherds, and later those representing Learning and Youth and Motherhood\u2014came to offer their gifts to the Infant Christ, and to acknowledge the debt each one owed to Him. It was all very beautiful and impressive. One was delighted with the naturalness with which the children took their parts.\n\nFriday evening between Christmas and the New Year's, the High School boys put on a very fine concert. It was well carried out, and gave a lot of pleasure to the audience.\n\nOn New Year's Eve the Senior pupils gathered with the Staff in a Watch Night Service. A short address was given by the Principal stressing God's goodness during the past year, and in the period of silent prayer preceding the coming of the New Year, hearts were bowed before the Lord Jesus, and petitions for guidance ascended from every heart.\n\nLater on the Seniors assembled in the kitchen and much noise with improvised cymbals of pot lids and big spoons finally gave way to the murmur of subdued voices as one and all enjoyed cake and cocoa.\n\nNew Year's afternoon the Primary children enjoyed themselves in a party at which games were played, and in the evening the Seniors held their usual Masquerade Party, any and varied were the costumes:\n\nMarjorie Wilson gained the prize for the School Colors as \"Belle of the Nineties\": Carline Wilson was judged to have the best Comic costume Josephine Williams in a Scotch dress gained the prize for the most original make up. Harry Amos and Billy Young as \"Mr. and Mrs. Sambo\" gained great praise as a Negro Couple. Livingstone Adams distinguished himself in portraying a Chinaman, eyes and facial lines being well nigh perfectly done, and Gordon Robinson as a Diver showed well up in the list of well thought out costumes.\n\nThe day following in the afternoon the juniors had their party and in the evening the Intermediates\u2014\"Three Jolly Fishermen\", \"The Farmers in his Dell\", The Grand old Duke of York\", and a folk dance\u2014always very popular\u2014\"The Ace of Diamonds\" gave opportunity for lots of noise and song and romping jollity.\n\nAs the New Year draws upon us in earnest, let us give ourselves heartily to our work, so that the New Year may hold for us each one abundant cause for happiness and satisfaction. In School we are whether at Coqualeetza or having graduated and entered the School of Life in the village. Let us resolve each one this year to:\n\nBuild it well whate'er you do,\nBuild it straight and strong and true;\nBuild it clean and high and broad,\nBuild it for the eye of God.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 3)\nGenerally speaking, the little improvement which might result from a change of curriculum would scarcely compensate for the expense and trouble involved. It is better to follow the curriculum as provided by the various provinces. Even if there were a change, a curriculum suitable for British Columbia would not necessarily be satisfactory for the prairies, and it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to get one satisfactory to so many diverse native peoples such as is found in Canada.\n\nThe Commission has commended the start made in the preparation of books for Primary Grades in Indian Schools, and has recommended that this work be extended to cover the work of the first two years. If we are to accept the aim of the Commission, that of training the Indian pupils to Christian citizenship, and of raising them to our own culture, it would seem advisable at the very beginning to place before them books essentially ours in content.\n\nAlthough a great number of children are \"stalled\" at Grade VI, it is evident that gradually but surely the standard of achievement is being raised; more pupils are completing higher grades and at a younger age. They have come to the stage when they might even resent a curriculum specially prepared for them, thus tending to widen the breach between them and the white child, and to augment the already existing inferiority complex. Even in Geography and History they show considerable interest, and it is rather a good thing to broaden their vision, for it is only by understanding the laws of cause, of cause and effect, and of geographical environment that they will come to understand the world in which they live, and thus outgrow their inferiority complex. We are of the opinion that the curriculum as laid down by the provinces is basically sound and broad, and that in general it should be followed.\n\nWe recommend that Receiving Classes and Grade I be kept in school all day, provision being made for suitable recreation periods.\n\nThe art of learning to speak the English language is acquired more in the departments than in the classroom. In the classroom there is invariably a restraint and self-consciousness owing to the presence of the other sex, and they find this ideal situation in the departments. The same thing applies to the teaching of the rules of health and cleanliness. The theory may come in the classroom, but the practice and checking up must be done in the department.\n\nRegarding Composition, it is true that they make their own peculiar mistakes quite different from those of the white child, and these errors must be remedied by corrective exercises as the teacher sees fit. It may be one case in which a text, or work book of corrective exercises might profitably be undertaken, as the Indian child's mistakes and difficulties in composition are not identical with those of a white child.\n\nTeachers should be sent books and material ordered from the Department on the requisitions, provided they have first been ratified by the Inspector. Even substitutes are a handicap.\n\nAll graduate pupils should be given a good self-containing dictionary.\n\nThere should be a similar recognition for school achievements as for sports. Too often Sports Day holds a very spectacular place with suitable awards, quite in contrast with the lack of recognition for scholastic achievements.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 3)\n1. Is the aim of Indian Education as stated on Page 5 of the Report of the Commission satisfactory?\n\n2. Are we prepared to endorse a combined day and residential school policy for the next ten years, as indicated on Page 13 of the Commission's Report?\n\n3. What changes would it involve in plant and personnel?\n\n4. Do the Staff Members from their experience consider the suggestions on Pages 17-20 practicable?\n\n5. What group should be asked to work out a curriculum in harmony with these suggestions?\n\n6. In view of the unemployment situation in the country should the attempt be made to divorce any pupils in Ontario and or the Prairies from farming?\n\n7. Does the experience of the Schools since the issuing of the Commission's Report indicate the value of pursuing further the recommendations concerning Indian arts and handicrafts?\n\n8. Are Refresher Courses for Graduates practicable?\n\n9. As the Department is not at present interested, would the Church be justified in financing Placement Officers for the Prairies and for British Columbia?\nThere are many arguments for both sides of this question, but it appears that it might be about as expensive to properly equip a day school as to send pupils to the Residential School. There is also much training to be had in a Residential School which could not be obtained while living at home, and after all, the early years are the habit-forming years. Then too, the pupils going to return to the Residential School until eighteen, do will many of them want to graduate and be working before that age? In this case, Residential Schools would be depleted at both ends. If there is any assurance that they can and will remain at school until eighteen, the day school might prove satisfactory, but otherwise it would mean very limited training in Residential Schools.\n\nThe strongest argument for retaining the younger pupils in day schools seems to be that parents could have their children at home for a longer time, which in some instances would be detrimental than beneficial. Most of the children get away for the summer holidays and in many instances the effect of the home and village is only too apparent in a short time.\n\nThe outlay of plant, other than such things as a residence setting, etc. But in many cases it would be better standard in qualifications of the personnel, there would have to be more specialization.\n\nThe staff remains as it is, answered in teachers\n\nIf members are away during the summer, the teachers. But is a very good idea if the school had something\n\nRevival of native crafts is universal, and the revival of native crafts should only be considered as a phase of education, as a hobby, or for employing leisure time. Although earning some money, handicrafts are important to a livelihood, they seem to be impracticalities. It is not necessary to know less and less. Who is going to teach the children do not know it themselves. Teachers understand it. Very important in the schools is genuine Indian material, or workmanship.\n\nIn a similar place in the world today there is a generation, and should be taught whether as Indian curriculum, whether as Indian work should, however, be a discipline. Only native work should be preserved, and such crafts as useful and useful.\nIt is scarcely for us to dictate regarding the value of handicrafts, or industrial arts, when the best educational authorities in the world are strongly advocating the teaching of this branch of education. \"The making of things\" which are beautiful and useful develops character and resource; it also provides the individual with an outlet for creative ability in his leisure hours and is the important modern trend in all juvenile and adult education.\"\n\nAnd let me quote from a Report by a Committee of Inspectors on Handicraft in Elementary Schools, London, England.\n\n\"Handicraft is a manual occupation that has been proposed for the schools is in itself to hold fast to certain basic principles of selection. To begin with, we should reject everything that is not a genuine craft or does not lead up to a genuine craft. The following crafts which we recommend as specially suitable for school purposes are in accordance with the principles we have laid down: (1) Needlework; (2) book craft, including paper and cardboard work leading up to book-binding; (3) weaving, including raffia-work and basketry; (4) woodwork; (5) metal work; (6) leatherwork; (7) pottery; (8) gardening.\"\n\nOur task is evidently then only to make the selection according to these standards.\n\nTo sum up, whatever is still being made by the Indians should be preserved as a living art and taught, as well as handicrafts other than native; but on the whole, the more Indian handicrafts are commercialized the less Indian they will become, and less worthy the name of handicraft.\nSUGGESTIONS FOR AN IMPROVED CURRICULUM\n\nThe Indian youths are naturally capable with their hands and a greater opportunity is presented for them along vocational lines than academic. I am basing this on the six years I have been at Coqualeetza Residential School, during which time numerous students have been in the high school grades, but not one of them has succeeded in the final stage or is able to derive a livelihood from this knowledge.\n\nI would therefore, suggest that the work of the classrooms be more closely related. Education to grade 8 being essential to cover thoroughly technical work. Subject matter such as measuring, areas, volume of cubes and cylinders, mathematics geometry etc., should be explained in the classroom. At present boys even to grade six come to manual and cannot use a ruler or know the divisions of it. A standard form of writing be taught as it present the classrooms used only for oral and the Technical classes use another which is confusing to the pupil.\n\nThat all technical work be compulsory unless exempt by doctor's orders. At present the boys are allowed to pick their courses for themselves. Technical courses have been established and have proven their worth. The pupil may not see the need for certain subjects at present and yet later in life will be sorry that he did not avail himself of his opportunities. Human nature changes in seven year cycles and what today is distasteful may prove of interest later.\n\nThat manual training in an elementary form commence for all boys from grade three.\n\nThat technical training for all boys commence at grade six in the following branches; Manual Training, Boat building, Motor Mechanics, Electricity, Audio, Sheetmetal, Plumbing, Farm Garden, Navigation. This technical work to be along similar lines as employed in Junior High Schools. That no student till grade eight is passed until the age of sixteen is reached. Upon which time a complete report of the student's progress, attitude, likes, etc., be given to the principal from each instructor in each class of work. It be then left to the Principal to decide from the reports the best occupation for that student to follow.\n\nThat the student be then allowed to follow a special course in the line decided; to be complete in the form of an apprenticeship system. Up to the age of at least sixteen it is hard for the boy to realize what he is up against, and until he realizes this and his interest is thus formed, and until he has attained grade 8 it is impossible to give a boy a training so that when he graduates he is capable of applying for a job.\n\nThat each department thus chosen form a definite course of studies suitable that can be standardized.\n\nThat each special student must furnish a small kit of tools for himself. These do be bought through the School at a minimum cost.\n\nThat each special student furnish a bond of $10 to cover any willful damage to property or school equipment, which would be returned at graduation.\n\nThat a certain time be allotted to repairs, or if a suitable nature, be left to a class of special students in carpentry, as at present odd jobs continually break the continuity of the classes, making it difficult to keep to any curriculum and maintain interest.\n\nThat classes be organized as soon as possible in the fall.\n\nThat consideration be given the instructor as time is needed to prepare materials, prepare lesson, sharpen tools and carry in shape and sharpened.\n\nThat all Indian handicraft work be recognized as a special subject and time allotted as such.\n\nThat the Indian self be the main source of decoration for the school is desirable.\n\nThat efforts be made to keep in touch with the graduates and that a list be compiled towards this end.\n\nIn the villages there is a great deal of need for repair and modernization. The graduates might be assisted to carry out these through a building and loan fund system, sponsored by the government.\nGraduates who have proven themselves not only in utility, but in character as well, might be given an opportunity or helped start up a shop and equipment. Electrical and sanitary plumbing open a field for the graduate as well as fill a need at the present time.\n\nThat a regular twice a year inspection or visit by a capable inspector be given to all schools and villages where graduates have started, in order to give help to any difficulties that might arise, as well as to report on the building and care of equipment etc.\n\nThat a central marketing depot be made to enable the Indian handicrafts to sell totems and novelties for the Indians. The idea being that the depot would be in touch with all graduates or those who have shown an aptitude in carving etc., and place orders with them to compete on a commercial basis.\n\nThat some system of promotion or advancement be given to all instructors as an incentive to specialize in the Indian Department as a life work.\n\nOTHER SUGGESTIONS\n\nThat a house master be appointed to take care of all duties line-up, discipline etc., and that he be trained in physical education and therefore be prepared to form classes in Physical Training, drills etc.\n\nThat all sports be divided into classes with a teacher in charge, thus spreading the time evenly among the teachers. Students would benefit by specialized instruction.\n\nINDIAN ARTS AND HANDICRAFTS\n\nIt is suggested that a special department be formed to hold regular classes along the lines of Indian art and handicrafts, and that it be recognized in the curriculum, a grant being made for this subject. Regular research work is necessary to gather authentic materials, designs, and carvings.\n\nThere are few boys who actually like carving totems and printing Indian designs and who are capable of turning out a product that is of commercial value. The carving work must be done on a commercial scale in order to pay any dividends. A market must be found for all work.\n\nIt is suggested that boys in this class be specialists after they have graduated, if in the opinion of the instructors and the Principal they so warrant. All graduates returning to their homes should be kept in touch with the department by a monthly letter, any order coming in should be shared evenly among the graduates, and an effort be made to sell all their work. On large commercial orders of five hundred or so small ones, bandsawed blanks might be distributed, and the finished product labeled as in the manner of Cogwheeler's Residential School, which uses \"Genuine Indian Crafts\" made at Cogwheeler's Residential School, Sandis, B.C. The Genuine Indian Crafts would be a trade name and must be used as the address of the maker.\n\nTo retail totems etc., a small roadside stand could be erected on the school property to attract tourist trade. These would be in charge of a special student in Indian carvings, and under supervision of the instructor.\nDear Parents and Friends:\n\nThis is to bring you greetings from the Camp by the sea. For more than three weeks school halls have been silent, and the main activity has been out in the fields where Mr. Pirie and his staff of farm workers have been busy saving the precious increase of the field. Repairs are also the order of the day, with fruit canning also in full swing to provide pleasure and health for the days after School has re-opened.\n\nBut down at Camp on Semiahmoo Bay, what a busy time there has been! Three new cabins have been built, and the dining room and kitchen have been enlarged. A well has been dug too, which promises an abundance of good water, and nearly 4 month of camp life has gone by. It would be wonderful if you could look in upon us as the day breaks and the sun comes slowly up over the trees behind the camp nestling snugly in its crescent shaped clearing at their feet. Out in front, away across the Straits of Georgia, the morning light bathes the distant islands in rose and gold. Silence wraps the camp for long enough after this, and it is not until nearly eight o'clock that Mr. Peake's whistle warns one and all that:\n\n\"Its time to get up, it's time to get up,\n\nIts time to get up in the morning.\"\n\nImmediately, believe it or not, action is everywhere as boys and girls tumble out of their berths and begin the round of work and play which makes Camp such an enjoyable place. After scoursing face and hands in clear cold water, one and all line up before the dining room door for morning prayers. This done, all file in for breakfast, and after that the various Patrols go about their work, some in the kitchen and dining room, some clearing up the grounds, some getting wood and water until the work of the day is well in hand. Swimming out in front of camp for the younger children, and at the diving pool for the older ones provides healthy enjoyment. Saturday afternoon brings a picnic at Lincoln Park in Blaine, Washington, and every evening the boys and girls sit about the camp fire and sing or listen to engaging stories, until once again night comes down, and a vesper hymn is sung followed by \"Taps\":\n\n\"Day is done, gone the sun,\nFrom the sea, from the hills, from the sky,\nAll is well, safely rest, God is nigh.\"\n\nAfter a cup of cocoa and a biscuit, everyone retires and soon quiet reigns once more. Last evening after all had gone to bed the writer went out to the edge of the little bench of land on which the camp is built. Two seine boats lay at anchor under the point far across the bay, darkly outlined against the shimmering light upon the sea. One could readily imagine the life aboard when the first flint streaks of dawn roused the crew to the chances of making a \"set\", and farther and farther went the imagination, until we could see disappointed fishermen plying their way back to home village, disappointed because of the strike and its consequent loss.\nLet us say to all who have suffered in this way, Coqualeetza stands ready to help bring the children back to School. Do not be discouraged, write and let us know.\n\nWe have good news from the School. OUR ENTIRE ENTRANCE CLASS PASSED! Think of that! A one hundred per cent performance! Hearty congratulations to Miss Lockin our Senior Teacher, and to each of the Candidates: Gordon Angus, John Walker, Josephine Wilson, Julia Adams, and Laura Lewis. Ninety nine per cent of our High School pupils also passed successfully. So we have had a great year; let us look forward to a still better one beginning September the first. Let us be encouraged and work together for the good of the children.\n\nNorthern pupils will return on the \"Caribou\" leaving Prince Rupert on August the 26th; Nass River pupils will return on the \"Catlin\" leaving there on August the 31st; Queen Charlotte Island pupils on the C.V. boat leaving August the 29th. But come on any boat and we will meet you if you wire your date of arrival in Vancouver. We expect to be filled to capacity this Fall so do not delay getting your children back on time.\n\nIn closing, let us keep faith IN God, and Faith WITH God, and He will overrule all the disappointment of this year's fishing with its strikes and its loss. Remember it is still true that He over rules evil for good and He still:\n\n\"makes all things to work together for good, to them that love Him, to them that are the called according to His purpose.\"\n\nBut we have to do our part. Was any attempt made by those who organized the strike on Rivers Inlet to get in touch with the Cannery operators L.F.O.G going to the Inlet to fish? If not, then why not a Native Fishermen Association along the entire Coast who will organize and know before they leave home what the price of fish will be, and who when they reach the fishing grounds will go to work and fish despite all comers. God stands ready to help us, let us work and pray for better things another season.\n\nYours in His Service,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

I presume you have a copy of this report in your office. At any rate, I thought you might be interested in reading some results of our deliberations. I am also enclosing an article by Mr. M.B.

This I trust will be interesting as presenting another phase of this question.\n\nI am also enclosing a copy of a series of suggestions by Mr. George Williams our Manual Training Instructor. I shall sometime in the near future have suggestions to make along the line of improvements to the Technical training offered in this School, which I trust may find favor with the Department.\n\nIn any case I can assure you a real interest in the work in which I find myself, and greatly appreciate the attitude of the Department which I feel stands by the work with loyalty and wisdom.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nI have added the Report of our Class Room Teachers on Curriculum, and also answers to questions regarding the Report of the above Commission.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, December 9th, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the staff at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nThe engagement and dismissal of staff of residential schools rests in the hands of the Principal and, as far as the Department is concerned, you are at liberty to make any changes you consider necessary. Of course, it is understood that it is preferable to only make changes at such period of the year as will least interfere with the work of the school. The work of all staff members is subject to inspection by departmental officials at any time and, if our officers have any complaints about the manner in which staff members handle their duties, you will be advised and requested to immediately remedy the condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nRev. R. C. Scott,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Indian Res. School,\nSardis, B. C.\nAt the end of last School year, I felt it wise to give Miss E. MacKay, who had been Lady Superintendent of this School, the usual one month's notice that her services were no longer required. I did not say anything to anyone about the matter until one day I happened in to Mr. Daunt's Office in New Westminster, and found Miss MacKay there. She was evidently giving Mr. Daunt her version of what had transpired. I said to Mr. Daunt, that she was free to say anything she wished. He replied that it was none of his business unless it interfered with the discipline of the School. I simply said, \"that remains to be seen\".\n\nThinking that she had also likely written to the Home Mission Offices in Toronto, I wrote to Rev. K.J. Beaton, and gave him the facts.\n\nUpon the occasion of the visit of Inspector Barry two weeks ago he gave me to understand that I ought to write and give you the facts as well. Hence this letter.\n\nMonths before the end of the term, I spoke to Miss MacKay saying that I felt she was not very happy in her work, and that as she had not been well, it would be in her interest to take a full six months right away from the School. She replied that she was feeling fine, and was very happy. In other words, she gave me no chance at all to discuss this matter with her.\n\nI knew that things were not going so smoothly in the School as was made to appear. Miss MacKay came to me one evening with her eyes fairly blazing, and said she hoped I \"would feel free to discuss her position with her.\" I could not understand what she meant at the time, but later she told me she had heard in the School that I was going to discontinue her position as \"Lady Superintendent\" and put her in the sewing room. Needless to say I had never discussed any such thing with any member of Staff.\n\nSome months before this, I had discussed the financial situation with Mr. Scott, Vice Principal, and the oldest member of Staff, and said that I did not wish to cut salaries unless it were necessary. He said at once \"why don't you. I'll take it out\". When I mentioned the same thing to Miss MacKay about the same time, she said \"I know I am not doing enough work, Mr. Scott, I could take over the girls' side as well as doing my present work.\" It flashed through my mind instantly that it was a pretty selfish and rather cold blooded statement. She realized that, and in a moment said, \"Oh, I suppose it is not for me to be putting other staff members out of their positions.\" I said nothing. Later again she offered to take the position of Primary Teacher and keep the Girls' side as well, another evidence of a lack of consideration for others. This will, I hope, go to show that Miss MacKay was never in the mood to allow any real discussion of her position. The only thing I could have done would have been to capitulate and to have kept her upon her own terms.\n\nWhen I gave her notice the first of June, she was at no pains to conceal the fact that she felt she had been badly treated. I gave her right off, two and a half months salary, to be paid month by month, but she said at the time she ought to have had three or four months salary. Later, she wrote to me saying that she ought...\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nto have had at least six months notice, and that failing that she \"would have to seek other advice\". I made it my business to see Dr Raley to ask if he had ever had a contract with her as \"Lady Superintendent\". He said at first, \"No\", and then later, \"Yes, there must have been a contract\". I replied that there was no contract to be found except the one she signed as Primary Teacher when she first came to the School in which it was definitely stated that \"one month's notice, or one month's salary was all that was necessary in the event of the discontinuance of the agreement\". Later, Dr Raley wrote me and said that \"as the position of Lady Superintendent had been in the nature of an employment\" it was only right that Miss Mackay should be protected, and that he had promised her six months notice in the event of the position being discontinued. I at once wrote Miss Mackay and told her I had heard from Dr Raley, and agreed to pay her the six months salary. Even before this, I had offered her four months salary, so that she might see that there was no personal feeling on my part, and that I was willing to be fair. Even then she made no mention of any agreement between Dr Raley and herself, and I feel sure, had she known of such an agreement, she would have mentioned it to me at once, and in the very beginning. To be frank I feel that she got legal advice and found that, even though she were paid by the month, being hired by the year, she could collect six months salary whether I were willing or not. This, I may say has been her attitude and spirit ever since I gave her notice. Neither before, nor since, has there been any chance for a discussion of the situation except on her own terms.\n\nMiss Mackay was an excellent executive, but she has become nervous and has used me to make about the danger of boy and girl affairs, that the tendency was to suggest the very thing she was trying to avoid. Again, she had necessarily had so much authority during the first year I was at Coqualeetza, necessarily so, that I think she found it hard to relinquish it in the least. When I was away on a recruiting trip to Massett, she gave an order to a carpenter outside the school, for tables and chairs for the Girls' side, at a cost of over $60.00, without my consent. Earlier, she had asked what I thought of furnishing the girls' playroom, in such and such a fashion, but I had no idea she was intending to go ahead and give a contract for the work on her own initiative, and without my even having any knowledge of her intention. That did not make me feel very happy in view of the financial situation in which the School was placed owing to our depleted pupilage. No one is more sorry than I, that events took such a turn regarding Miss Mackay, but there seems no alternative. Had she been disposed to have taken my suggestion of getting away for six months, a reshuffling of the time could have been arranged, and it would have been possible for me to have got hold of the business of the School in the meantime, and then perhaps Miss Mackay could have fitted in happily. However, the threat to sue the School for the six months salary expresses very well what I feel was the spirit of her mind.\n\nThere is another angle to the case, and one of which, Miss Mackay will make much if she has written to you, namely that she was dismissed for purely personal reasons, in which Mrs Scott would be made to figure largely. I beg to say, that there has been nothing personal whatever in my action, and there was nothing but regret on my part, until the action she has taken since my giving her notice, and particularly, that of forcing my hand in the matter of the six months salary, has, I admit, made me feel a bit keenly about it all.\nTheangle mentioned, concerned Miss Nicholls, who was our School Nurse last year. There was a time when, owing to severe illness, Mrs Scott felt things which at other times would not likely have bothered her very much. I spoke to Miss Nicholls about it. She said little to me, but as events turned out, went and began to line up the lady members of staff even to the point of calling an \"Indignation meeting\" in one of their rooms. I knew nothing of this until a couple of weeks ago. It may be you have heard from her also. I think her action just mentioned is sufficient comment upon her usefulness in a Residential School. When I gave her, her months notice, she said, \"Well, there are at least three members of staff who will not agree with you.\" I took no notice of it at the time.\n\nI think I have covered the ground, perhaps with too much detail, but at least you will be able to come to a more intelligent conclusion about it all.\n\nI have a letter from Miss MacKay today, enclosing receipts for cheques received, for which I asked her. She also says there are one or two aspects of the case which she would like to talk over with me, and asks that I go to see her in Vancouver. I do not know what is in her mind. She was here visiting her sister who is Nurse in our Preventorium, but although she was here for about two days, she never came near to see me. I felt it somehow, it certainly was not good for Staff members to know that she was there within fifty yards of the School and never coming near. I think I shall let her come to me.\n\nI may say too, that the presence of her sister in the Preventorium has not been very conducive to co-operation in the School. Not that Miss MacKay has ever done anything to warrant my saying so, but the grass is well worn off the path from the School to the Preventorium, and one or two members of Staff have not co-operated at all freely or happily with Mrs Peterson, Girls' Matron, who has absorbed some of Miss MacKay's duties as Lady Superintendent. I may say that until this feeling was made apparent, I never mentioned any of the facts in my letting Miss MacKay go to anyone. About two weeks ago, I felt I ought to let Mrs Peterson know, and gave her some of the facts, so that she would not be tempted to believe there could be any foundation for criticism of her assuming these duties. I may say that Mrs Peterson has worked willingly, and acceptably, and at no increase in her salary, something which merits my appreciation. One of the other discontented, or sympathizers with Miss MacKay is our Primary Teacher, who if Miss MacKay had had her way, would have been out of a job nearly a year ago. It might change her attitude if I told her. However, I have kept it all to myself.\n\nI have tried to be fair in what has been a difficult situation. I feel at times that some such situation would have faced any man who might have been called upon to assume the Principalship when I did. However, I may be wrong, and I am willing to submit to the ruling of the Department. I have never sought the position, and came to it because the \"call\" of the Church has been right along to me, the \"call\" of God, and I have tried to face up to my responsibility in that spirit.\n\nI appreciated very much the visit of Captain Berry this month. He not only gave us very decided help with Class Rooms and Curriculum, but he seemed to give me a personal touch with the Department which has been helpful.\n\nIn closing, I beg to say that before the School will run as smoothly as it ought, there may have to be other Staff changes. I would appreciate knowing the mind of the Department to any extent you may feel led to state. The School is all that matters. Awaiting your reply,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 3)\nDear Friends:\n\nI am really at the moment, away up the Coast, aboard the mission boat, \"Thomas Crosby\" enroute to the villages from which our pupils come. Once a year at least, it is necessary to see parents and guardians, who hold the children dear to their hearts, and are always glad to get first hand news of them. This year, I am able by means of moving pictures, to give a glimpse of School life, so that friends will see the children at work and play, in School and out.\n\nSince Christmas and New Years, School life has gone along very happily. The health of the School never was better. Class room work has been steady and very satisfactory. Work in the Departments has also gone along without interruption. Some fine rugs have been made by the girls, affording a chance to learn various types of rug making which can be put to good use later on in their homes. The girls of the Graduating Class will be hard at work very soon making up a complete outfit of clothes for their Graduation; happy thoughts fill their minds as they work, but with a touch of sadness too, for School life, though hum drum at times, draws upon the heart strings as the end of it comes in sight. The HOME NURSING Class has just completed a successful term's work under Miss Anderson. In the Home Economics Kitchen, good progress has been made, and most of the girls in the class can plan and prepare a full course meal of nourishing food, and serve it properly. A plan is being considered whereby our Senior girls will be given the chance to see some of the good homes near the School, and become familiar with equipment and customs in a well furnished home. This will help them if they wish to take a place in household service after their Graduation, and at the same time give them ideas, many of which they will be able to use in their own homes later.\n\nAmong the boys, Farm and Garden work has gone along well. Seeding is complete with the exception of some barley and mixed grain, which will be sown later. This year we expect an increase in small fruits, and so far the outlook for Cherries and other tree fruit is good. The trees are a mass of bloom and bees hum merrily as they gather the nectar from the blossoms. Manual Training Classes, Junior and Senior, have made good progress under Mr. Lythgoe. Continued effort is made to give a practical training, and articles of real use on the farm and for the home are being turned out. Motor mechanics received a very practical turn when it was decided to recondition one of our old engines, and fit it up to be installed in a boat which is being built in our Boat Building shop. This is very practical, as 75% of our boys are fishermen for longer or shorter periods each year. Junior and Senior Navigation Classes have been conducted through the year. Much time has been spent upon the \"Rule of the Road at Sea\" and Chart and Compass work will be started very soon. This will help the boys to know the right procedure at sea, and is more\nAnd more important for safe navigation because of the increasing number of boats using Coastal waters. One 35 ft. boat has been built, and a 33 footer is now on the ways in our Boatbuilding Shop. This is splendid training for our boys.\n\nOnce again we would like to say how successful our Preventorium has been in building up the health of pupils whom the X-ray has shown to be in danger of becoming ill. We are looking forward with every hope that our final X-ray Clinic for the year will see several more boys and girls discharged into the School as cured of any tendency to tubercular disease. Lentime School lessons have been given to those who were able to take them, and every boy and girl has, in addition, done some form of handicraft work. The boys have made a large number of excellent Totem Poles and drawings and the girls have produced a fine lot of knitting and embroidery work. We are hoping to make a special display at the Knights of Columbus Handicraft Exhibition in Vancouver next month.\n\nOn Good Friday, two of our graduates were married at the School. It is a fine thing to have these young people returning to the School for these great occasions in their lives. The wedding ceremony took place in the Assembly Hall before the entire student body, and afterwards, friends and staff members offered their congratulations to the happy couple in the Reception Rooms. Refreshments were served to all, and the wedding cake after being started by the bride, was cut up and served to guests and friends.\n\nRev. Arthur Turner, D.D., of Vancouver, for so long Superintendent of Indian Missions in our Church, was with us again this year in a series of Pre-Master services. Meetings were held before breakfast, and again at the time of Evening Prayers. After further instruction, thirty-one girls and boys expressed their wish to become members of the Church of Christ upon profession of faith.\n\nMaster Sunday morning, the Senior Girls put on an Easter Pageant entitled, \"Her Master Choice\", in which it was shown that the appeal of pure pleasure, or worldly success was not greater than that of Christianity. At the close of the Pageant, one of our girls received the Sacrament of Baptism, showing her choice of Christ as her Saviour. It was all very beautiful. In the evening Dr. Turner preached the sermon and at the close thirty-one boys and girls were received as members of the Church of Christ. Eighty-Seven took part in the Communion Service at the close of the regular service, thus keeping once more Christ's instruction - \"This do in remembrance of Me\". Easter this year seemed to stand for more than ever in the life of the School. We are most thankful, and ask your prayers that each of these boys and girls may grow up to become active members of the Church of Christ, and be a blessing in their own homes and villages when they return.\n\nAnd now, Holidays will soon be upon us. All boys and girls who do not go home, will spend the two months in Camp down by the sea near White Rock. Please let us know your wishes for your boys and girls at once, but before holidays and Camp, there will be examinations, and we are hoping for good reports to send home.\n\nIn deep gratitude to God for His blessing throughout the year, and best wishes to you each one, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.G. Scott,\nPRINCIPAL\nOttawa, January 26, 1938.\n\nDear Captain Scott:\n\nI am highly pleased to have a copy of your letter to parents and graduates of January 14th and to see therein your reference to the Preventorium. When Dr. McQuarrie was here at the conference last summer, his story of the accomplishments of your unit was one of the best features we were able to produce. I live in hopes that this unit may yet become a Preventorium, pure and simple, and not have Sanatorium functions such as it has had to assume in the past. At two schools in the East, we have been able to put all our new candidates through the Provincial Clinic before letting them come to the school. I know how hard this would be to do in the area from which you draw your pupils and look upon it as something for the future, rather than the immediate present.\n\nI suppose you are financing the unit without more than ordinary difficulty. We are anxiously awaiting final information as to what money we shall have for tuberculosis next year and are rather backward at the moment about making commitments which we are not sure we would have money to carry on. Parliament meets this week and we should be able to make our plans fairly soon. I do not suppose there will be any special extension at your place.\n\nA week ago I had almost made up my mind to go West very soon, but do not now know whether this will be possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.L. Stone, M.B.,\nSupt. of Medical Services.\n\nRev. R.C. Scott,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Indian Res. School,\nSardis, B.C.\nTo our Parents, Graduates and Friends:\n\nIt is not too late to bring to you very best wishes for the New Year upon which we have recently entered. Pupils and Staff join in heartiest good wishes for the days to come.\n\nChristmas and New Year's festivities are once more a memory, but what a happy one! Truly we have had reason for happiness this Christmas, for the health and welfare of the School was never better. This is the greater cause for thankfulness in view of the large number of those who had cases in October and November. It is largely due to the constant medical attention and good nursing, and the blessing of God that we came out of the ordeal so favorably. The sincere thanks of the School, student body and staff alike is due to the Department of Indian Affairs, to Dr. Henderson, Mr. Atkinson, Mr. Quarrrie and the School Nursing Staff, as well as the extra nurses who came to our aid during that trying time. It is beyond praise that the very best medical skill and hospital care was made available by the Department to every pupil who needed it. We are thankful to all these and wish to say so, and we know that the parents and friends will agree heartily.\n\nWe had taken \"Co-operation\" as our watchword for the year, and how wonderfully the measles epidemic gave the opportunity to put it into practice. Staff members, and Senior Boys and girls who had had cases previously rallied to the call for aid. The spirit in which their work was done for those who were ill was the finest possible. Truly we were one big family. We are particularly thankful that no case of measles developed in our Preventorium, and that every one of our boys and girls who had been discharged from there into the School, made excellent recoveries from the illness. The only note of sadness as we write, arises from the passing of the wee ladie from the East Coast, who slipped away from us in spite of the best that medical care could do because of complications due to an old trouble following an operation for astroid infection. The deep sympathy of all goes out to the mother and other loved ones whom he has left behind.\n\nWhile we are speaking of the Preventorium, I am sure you will be delighted to know that six of our boys and girls who took the \"Best Cure\" treatment provided there, have been discharged back to School with such comments from Dr. Lamb as: \"No evidence of tubercular disease\"; \"The old lesion is completely healed\"; \"My lead a normal life\". What a thrill these reports brought to us! Parents and Indian Agents will be advised of the particular cases in the near future. Again our hearty thanks, and those of parents and friends of these pupils is due to the Department for making possible this splendid educational and health unit at Coqualeetza.\n\nChristmas found the corridors and Dining Rooms and Assembly Hall hung with festoons and decorated with colored lights. An arch led from the main hall to the Assembly Hall, and glimpses of the Christmas Tree, resplendent in light and tinsel added to the anticipation of everyone. Christmas morning found boys and girls early astir, and the contents of stocking were soon being eagerly enjoyed; toys, nuts and candy, oranges and apples were all there for \"Good little girls and boys\", and of course we never have any other kind at Coqualeetza, especially just before Christmas.\nAt 10:30 A.M., everyone came to the Assembly Hall for a short Christmas Service of praise and worship. Soon found the tables loaded with good things to eat, Christmas Goose being the main item. At supper time the big School Christmas Cake was cut and distributed among the boys and girls. To the Principal was given the honor of cutting the first slice. At 3 P.M., Santa Claus arrived with his pack and ruddy face, and gave to each child a present from the School, and also such parcels as had come for any child from parents and friends. In addition each pupil received a bag of nuts and candy with an orange for good measure. Hallways and dormitories echoed and re-echoed with the laughter of children, and the scampering of feet as each showed the other what 'Santa' had brought. Our Christmas Concert again delighted all who attended, and gave those parents who were able to come, a chance to see how well the pupils were able to take their place before others; songs, dialogue and marches were ably performed. A snow storm which blocked the roads for a day or two prevented the play from being given at Carman United Church in Berdies, but we shall hope for better luck another year.\n\nThe usual parties were held at New Years, the Primary and Intermediate on January 30th, and the Junior and Senior on the 31st. The Senior party again delighted all who attended; costumes were a credit to the pupils who designed them. Those taking prizes were:\n\nFor Best Costume - Boys\nLorne Adams - Indian Chief\nFor Best Original Costume\nLawrence Smith - The Chinaman\nFor Best Comic Costume\nElmer Pollard - The Trump\n\nFor Best Costume - Girls\nElizabeth Hodgson - The Witch\nFor Best Original Costume\nHyllis Shaw - The Waitress\nFor Best Comic Costume\nTrudy Grant as \"Grandma\"\n\nGames and folk dancing were enjoyed until ten-thirty, after which all repaired to the Dining Room where the tables were laid with good things to eat; Christmas Crackers provided jokes and caps, which placed jauntily upon the heads of girls and boys, gave color and brightness to the party.\n\nAt 11:30 everyone was found in place ready for the Watch-night Service. \"To God Our Help in Ages Past\" and \"Standing at the Portals\" were sung, a short exhortation was given by Rev. R. Nixon, of Carman United Church, and then the last two minutes of the old year were spent in silent prayer. On the stroke of Twelve Midnight good wishes were exchanged all around. \"Should old acquaintance be forgot\" was sung with hearty shaking of hands, and the New Year was ushered in.\n\nJanuary 4th found everyone busy again in Class Room and in Departments, and we are happy to say that the remainder of the year promises well in every way. This year, after being quarantined for measles, everyone felt it a wonderful privilege to be \"out\". Every child in the School got a ride into Chillicothe before Christmas, visited the Stores, and bought the things dear to their hearts. It was a joy to see how most of the girls and boys remembered others, carrying out the field teaching. It is more blessed to give than to receive. Basket Ball and Soccer among the boys, and Badminton among the girls are now being played, and being enjoyed by all. Until our next letter, we bid you such \"good-bye\" and may every blessing be yours during the year.\n\n[Signature]\nPRINCIPAL\nJANUARY 15, 1937\n\nTo Our Parents, Graduates and Friends:\n\nGreetings and all good wishes for the year upon which we have just entered.\n\nChristmas and New Years have come and gone, but what a joyous time we have had at the School! Festoons of greenery and an illuminated Christmas greeting in the main hall expressed the spirit which was everywhere apparent.\n\nOur Christmas Entertainment was the best yet. Santa this year followed the modern tendency and \"Incorporated.\" He and Mrs. Santa appeared in person on our Stage the Friday evening before Christmas. At Mrs. Santa's suggestion he got his big book and from it picked out the names of five good boys and five good girls to help him. Santa also had twelve \"Trixies\" in his company. These little people in their elfish suits of green and white, by wishing real hard brought the five boys and girls sliding down from their beds right on to the middle of the stage. Soon all were busy packing toys and getting old Santa off on his Christmas journey. The singing was good, and all agreed that \"Santa Incorporated\" was one of the best Cantatas we have ever had.\n\nChristmas Day was great! The younger children had hung up their stockings in long rows upon the wall of the corridor outside their dormitories the night before and great was the delight in the morning when the bulging contents were emptied out. Santa evidently enjoyed the glass of milk and biscuit which the children left in the corridor for him the night before. At least it disappeared. He was very wise too, for one of the bigger girls who hung up her stocking along with the others thinking to get some extra presents, found only one lonely peanut hidden away in the toe.\n\nChristmas goose and plum pudding made Christmas Dinner a delight and at 2 P.M., from the Christmas Post Office, parcels were distributed from parents and friends. Promptly at 4 O'Clock Santa arrived on the roof of the Assembly Hall and after a good deal of talk through a ventilator in the gable, was told how to get down to the Laundry roof and through one of the windows to the Assembly Hall to distribute presents from the Tree.\n\nNew Year's Parties, so long looked forward to, were another source of delight. The Primaries enjoyed themselves in the afternoon of December 31st and the Juniors and Intermediates on New Year's Day. On New Year's Eve the Senior boys and girls paraded in one of the finest displays of masquerade costumes we have ever seen. The ingenuity shown with the limited means open to them was most impressive. All were limited to what they could find around the School. Around the Assembly Hall and through\nthe corridors between lanes of happy children, the procession wound its way. Both boys' and girls' sides visited to the great delight of the younger pupils. Prizes were won as follows:\n\nFor the best dressed girl - Laura Lewis as a basket of fruit.\nFor the best dressed boy - Magnus Henry as a Graduate Nurse.\nFor the most original costume among the girls - Isabel Lewis as a Christmas Cracker.\nFor the most original costume among the boys - Jacob Brown Smith as Tarzan.\nFor the most comic costume among the girls - Yenta Matthews as a \"Stop, Look and Listen\" sign.\nFor the most comic costume among the boys - Fred Bolton and Gerald Thorne, who as Ace and Andy dragged along their little \"Fresh Air\" Taxi.\n\nAfter games and folk dancing had been enjoyed, supper was served in the Students' Dining Room which was very prettily decorated. After a happy and most satisfying time had been spent there, everyone returned to the Assembly Hall. Community singing led the way to the music of the grand old Church Hymns and all hearts were touched as the last half hour of the Old Year was spent in worship and in prayer. A two minute silence in which hearts were lifted to God in prayer, ushered in the New Year. After good wishes had been sent from one to another, everyone joined hands and sang \"And old acquaintances be forgot\" and 1937 had begun for all at Coqualeetza.\n\nOnce again school life has returned to normal, Christmas decorations have disappeared and work in Class Room and in Departments is in full swing.\n\nWe are so thankful for the good health we have had this year. We have had only a couple of serious cases, and both of these have made a good recovery. Aside from \"humps\" we have had little or no sickness up to now, and we hope and pray that the same good fortune will follow us for the remainder of the year.\n\nWith Christmas once more a memory we wish to say to you all at home that we thought of you very often during those happy days. We want to thank you for the love and care shown in the letters and the gifts which came to our boys and girls. We shall all try to be true in the days to come, and pray that God's blessing may be with you during the year through all the days.\n\nYours on behalf of Children and Staff,\n\nR. C.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nRe: Accident to Josephine Edgar,\ndaughter of Joe Edgar, Pella Coola.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI have made strict enquiry into this accident, but I am unable to learn very much about it. Josephine is one of the regular Laundry girls and she was scrubbing off a chair near the end of the big washing machine. Another girl was working alongside her. There is all kinds of room where they were working without their being near the Laundry machine at all. This machine has a guard right across the end of it. Josephine does not know how it happened or what she did. She says she thought she heard the Laundry Matron, who was farther up in the Laundry, call her. She looked up and at the same time laid her right hand with her wash cloth over towards the end of the machine. In some way her hand went either over the top and down into the gears, or between the bars of the guard and into them. She made no outcry, and the girl working beside her did not see anything, as did neither of the other two girls in the Laundry. Mrs. Edgar, Josephine did not seem to feel the accident and did not realize what had happened until she says she felt her arm hurt her above the elbow. Then she went out of the Laundry to the Kitchen Matron who on seeing her hand, took her at once to the Nurse where it was dressed. She was then taken to Dr. McCaffrey who took her to the Hospital. The fingers were so crushed that he had to amputate the first and second fingers at the second joint and the third finger at the first joint.\n\nIt is most regrettable, and I feel very upset about it. It is the first accident of its kind that has happened during my Principalship. As I have said, the machine has a guard over it, the same that has been there ever since I came, and one would need to have put his or her hand deliberately through it or over it before touching the gears. Josephine says she does not know what she did, that she just raised her hand and laid it over on what I suppose she thought was the guard of the machine. None of the girls are allowed to touch the machinery in the Laundry at any time, and there was no need for this girl being close to the washing machine at the time. She says it was her own fault, and that she does not know how she did it. I have made careful enquiry from the Laundry Matron and the other three girls, but as not one of them saw it and there was no outcry, I have only Josephine's word and my own observations to go on. I have advised Mr. Indian Agent Gillett and the girl's father Mr. Joe Edgar by this mail. Josephine is coming home from the Hospital this morning, and apart from the loss of her finger tips, she is alright.\n\nRegretting to have to report this accident, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nREV. R.C. SCOTT, B.A.\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 3)\nDear Friends:\n\nThings do not just \"happen\", at least not worthwhile things such as Residential Schools. Cowichan is a good example of how Schools come into being, and of how they grow. Fifty-one years ago, Rev. C.M. and Mrs. Fato, Missionaries to the Indian people along the Lower Fraser, and who at that time lived near the center of what is now the village of Sardis, organized a Day School for Indian children. They soon found that this was not enough, as the parents moved around so much that the children were not able to attend School regularly. Not finding any other way, they opened their own home, took down a partition, and thus made a room large enough for a Class Room. Eight boys and girls were given a home there by these devoted people, and that one room served as Class Room and Dining Room through the day, and then as bed-room for the boys at night.\n\nNext year, by means of a grant from the Women's Missionary Society of the then Methodist Church, a larger home was built and soon there were twenty-eight children at School. Unfortunately this Home was burned in 1891 through the upsetting of a lamp, but right away plans were laid for a much larger building, and through the cooperation of the General Board of Home Missions and the Dominion Government, a building to house one hundred children was built. This was opened in 1894, the Commissioner for Indian Affairs in the Province taking a prominent part in the ceremonies.\n\nBut meanwhile what happened to the children who had been in the building which was burned? Well, they began life in the homes of devoted people found a way, and twenty children and three teachers found a temporary home in the Mission House, home of Mr. and Mrs. Fato. A temporary building was erected for a Class Room, but both teachers and pupils alike were glad to be there. The Home, the Building opened in 1894, was an old red brick School so familiar to many of the folk of that day, and it did duty right down until the year 1926, when it was torn down and the present fine white brick building was opened with appropriate ceremonies, the corner stone having been laid the previous year by the late Duncan C. Scott, D.D., Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. What a change from the day when eight children were taken in to the first School fifty years ago, to the two hundred and seventy-nine pupils who are comfortably housed in this fine new building. But through all the years were men and women whose hearts were set upon the securing for the Indian children, the opportunity of an education, and their faith and work bore an abundant harvest.\n\nFriday, October 21st, was a great day in the history of the School. It was Founder's Day, but this year it was also the day upon which we celebrated our Golden Jubilee. All afternoon the corridors were filled with interested friends who had come to visit the School. Decorations of autumn leaves and chrysanthemums in all shades of brown and gold, added their beauty to the hearty welcome given by Staff and pupils. Class Rooms, Girls' Handicrafts, Kitchens, Laundry and Dining Rooms were all visited, and many people were surprised at the provision made for the training of the boys and girls who are fortunate...\nwill do all in your power to carry out in your lives, the ideals and teachings of the School.\n\nOn the Saturday following, the pupils had a great day with football matches between the Red Wings and the Maple Leaves in all divisions of the School. Points were even for the day on each side, and a Picture Show in the Assembly Hall ended a most happy day for every boy and girl.\n\nAnd what of the next fifty years! Who can tell what they will bring! We are sure it can be only good if we follow faithfully in the steps of those who have laid the foundations of this great School, and are loyal and true to the duties and opportunities which are ours. We salute you all wherever you may be; in city or town, and in the villages which are home to so many of the graduates and friends. May God bless the years to come as He has blessed those that have passed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/BW\n\nPRINCIPAL\nStatement showing the number of pupils from each Agency attending Coqualeetza Residential School\n\n| Agency            | Number |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Kwawkewlth        | 26     |\n| Skeena River      | 34     |\n| West Coast        | 8      |\n| New Westminster   | 17     |\n| Cowichan          | 61     |\n| Queen Charlotte   | 45     |\n| Vancouver         | 10     |\n| Lytton            | 1      |\n| Bella Coola       | 30     |\n\nTotal - 232\n\nAllowed - 225\n\n15/9/38\nOttawa, May 26, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, enclosing report from Reverend R.

Branch 4\n\nChristmas Tree\nA Sensible Suggestion\n\nIt was rather a unique appeal earlier in the month, soliciting advertising expense, made to 76 newspapermen at a meeting held last night. It was the appearance of Mr. Hearst which interested me in the relationship of farming to industry. When the farmer goes to market, it is apparent there is a market for a tremendous number of persons engaged in producing those needed by the industries\u2014or even for those who produce the commodities required by them.\n\nWhen so much effort is made to solve the problem of the agriculturalist, freedom should be extended to all, so that the potential energies which are latent within him may be released. Rather, however, than see the solution achieved by the efforts of those who are interested, the removal will be met by those who are opposed to any change whatever in the present condition of affairs.\n\nThere are several real possibilities that should be explored, especially by those who have been working toward the achievement of such a result. The two most effective types of those involved in these ventures are those whose actions are characterized by enthusiasm and those who are not, but who may possess some degree of enthusiasm in their behavior.\nOttawa, February 21, 1939.\n\nDear Dr. Cochrane:\n\nIt is my intention to discuss with my colleagues, when the supplementary estimates are under consideration, the desirability of including an appropriation for the rebuilding of the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nIf funds are available, I should like to recommend the construction of a fully modern fireproof structure with accommodation for at least 200 pupils. The construction of this building would be undertaken on the understanding that the Ahousaht School, with an enrolment at this date of 65 pupils, would be closed. The Ahousaht School, I understand, is in a somewhat dilapidated condition and is rapidly becoming, if it has not already become, a great fire hazard.\n\nI have been informed that an Indian day school established at Ahousaht would provide instruction for the local Indians at that point. Provision could be made for the construction of this school in the estimates of next year.\n\nYou are aware that we organized about a year ago a programme designed to limit and ultimately to eradicate the ravages of T.B. amongst the Indian population. There is an amount of approximately $300,000.00 in the estimates of this year for the promotion of this programme. The officials have already -\n\nReverend R. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n298 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\nalready learned that a large portion of this amount must be spent in providing sanatorium care for active T.B. cases. I am particularly anxious that this care should be provided for young Indians, many of whom are now enrolled at residential schools. It so happens that in the province of British Columbia no sanatorium beds are available for Indian patients or in fact for patients of any kind. In view of this condition, the suggestion has been made that the Cocualseetza Residential School be equipped as a sanatorium for active T.B. cases. This school, I am informed, is easily reached from Vancouver and could be easily visited by specialists from time to time. In addition to this, the farm at the school is small and admirably adapted for use by a hospital.\n\nThere is at present an enrolment at the Cocualseetza School of 225 pupils for whom per capita grant is paid, with 7 additional pupils in residence for whom no grant is allowed. Of these pupils only 17 come from the district in which the school is located. In other words, an overwhelming majority of the pupils are brought from far away coast reserves to the Cocualseetza institution. I am enclosing for your information a statement indicating the reserves from which these pupils are recruited and the number of pupils in the case of each reserve.\n\nThe last departmental census indicates that there are 1354 Indians in the New Westminster agency. Of these 98 are listed as belonging to the United Church and 1256 to the Catholic Church. In the Vancouver agency the population is 1246. Of these 20 are listed as Anglicans, 21 United Church and 1084 Roman Catholic. It is not at all likely that these Indians will change their religious affiliations at any time in the immediate future. In my judgment therefore it would be sound educational policy to provide Indian day schools for a majority of the pupils now enrolled at Cocualseetza. These day schools should be established on the reserves from which the pupils come and should be fully equipped to provide vocational instruction and designed -\nand designed to meet the peculiar needs of the Indian population. It is altogether likely that a survey of these districts will have to be undertaken by our officials. I should like however to have an expression of opinion from you with respect to the districts in which additional provision should be made for the education of Indian pupils. I have been informed that the day schools already established in the coast agencies of northern British Columbia are equipped to provide accommodation for a number of the pupils now enrolled at Coqualeetza.\n\nI am anxious to know if the Church would be prepared to allow the Department to take over the Cocualeetza School and operate it as a sanatorium.\n\nIt is my intention to bring this matter to the attention of the Government just as soon as I can conveniently do so. May I therefore express the hope that you will be in a position to let me have your views at an early date. It is scarcely necessary to add that no decision with regard to the matters dealt with herein will be reached until I hear from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.\n\nRAH.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nSardis, B.C.,\nJanuary 12, 1939\n\nDear Friends:\n\nOnce again it is my pleasant duty to bring to you the story of our Christmas and New Years doings.\n\nFor five days in the week before Christmas, groups of children were taken into Chilliwack for their Christmas Shopping. It would have done the hearts of parents and friends who had sent gifts of money to their children, good could they have heard the expressions of delight as the shop windows came into view; one after another draped in greenery and brilliant tinsel interspersed with glowing red, and filled with all those things which at Christmas bring such delight to the little ones. Of course, when the Senior pupils went in by bus, the Fifteen Cent Store could not in any way provide what they felt were the right sort of presents, so many another store came in for a share of the trade from Coqualeetza. But how the children fairly glowed with delight, especially the younger ones, is beyond my powers of description. You may well imagine the spirit it all created in them, when rumour had it that one of those mornings the small boys in No.5, as we describe their dormitory wakened the Senior Teacher, who sleeps next door, by singing \"God Save The King\" at 5 A.M. These same boys said the next night, \"We don't need to say our prayers tonight, we sang \"God Save The King\". So you see we have most interesting children down here.\n\nAs Christmas approached, two Christmas Trees, fairly blazing with light from strings of colored lamps, shed a warm welcome to all visiting friends, and spread the message of Christmas and its Good Cheer in the hearts of all who passed by.\n\nInside, \"Merry Christmas\" in an illuminated sign, greeted all who entered. To one side was an imitation of a small village, featuring buildings familiar to all - Carman Church from just across the road; the School itself and many snug little cottages which peeped from the drifts of white cotton \"snow\". Between them, and around and around, ran the tracks of an electric train which when operating, slowed up the advance of the lines of children as they passed through the main corridor enroute to and from the Assembly Hall. One of these same little chaps in No.5 wanted to know, why the track was an \"eight\", for sure enough the track ran in the figure eight. Like many another childish question, it was not easily answered.\n\nAll the main corridor was draped with festoons as was the corridor leading to the Assembly Hall, which was beautiful in its greenery and its tinsel shaded lights. A large illuminated Star hung in front of the Christmas Tree which occupied the centre of the platform, shedding soft radiance and cheer from its small twinkling lights. Upstairs on the Boys' Side, a smaller tree beamed with gladness and cheer, and in each side of the Infirmary were Christmas Trees and more festoons, and on the Girls' Side, Santa himself, in a small sleigh, was furiously driving across a pond of \"ice\" created by a sheet of looking glass, bordered with filmy white cotton. In fact nothing more could be done to welcome the visit of Santa Claus and all visiting friends.\nOn Wednesday evening, December 21st, a very colorful Cantata was staged in the Assembly Hall, which with its homelike stage, bright music, visiting fairies and Santa Claus himself, who came down through the fireplace, actually delighted all who listened. This Cantata was so well received, that it was repeated on January 4th to the people of Sardis and Community, and won favorable comment from all who attended.\n\nChristmas Sunday found all pupils and Staff gathered in the Assembly Hall for an open session of the Sunday School. Christmas Carols were heartily sung, and a Christmas message delivered. Again on Sunday evening, the Assembly Hall was the scene of our Christmas Service, when once more Carols and hymns were sung, and the Choir rendered special Christmas Music.\n\nOn Christmas Monday, everyone was up bright and early, and the younger pupils eagerly searched the depths of long stockings, which bulged with the presents which Santa had put into them. And somehow or other the crafty old fellow had again made away with the biscuit and the glass of milk so thoughtfully left out for him by the little boys and girls.\n\nAt noon, the tables of the dining room groaned beneath the weight of Christmas turkey, cranberry sauce, plum pudding and other good things. In the centre aisle, a large Christmas Cake reminded the boys and girls that there would be other good things to come for supper. Members of the Staff assisted in serving the children, and when they were through, Staff and visiting friends gathered in the Staff Dining Room for their own Christmas Dinner.\n\nAt 4 P.M., Santa arrived for the School Christmas Tree, and for once the boys and girls could not guess who he was. At 10 in the morning, he had paid a visit to our Preventorium, and there and in the School, he distributed the presents addressed to each boy or girl. Everyone received something, and one fine feature was the number of presents which were sent from one pupil to another within the School. The Christmas Spirit possessed the hearts of our boys and girls in truth.\n\nOn December the 30th and 31st, the usual New Year's Parties were held, culminating in the Senior Party on New Year's Eve. As usual, this was a masquerade party. Many and varied were the costumes; it would do the friends good were they able to look in upon this party and see how clever are the boys and girls at making up their disguises. What fun the younger children had! as the procession, with Principal and Mrs. Scott at the head, wended its way through the corridors, then upstairs where at the doorway of each dormitory were the little children and younger pupils who were not able to attend the party. These, many of them in their nighties, squealed with delight as Old Grandma hobbled along, or \"Old Dutch\" swept imaginary dirt out of the road, and Amos an' Andy ambled along, and \"Herr Hitler\" swept past, unmindful of the eyes of the joyful mob who pressed in upon every side.\nUpon returning to the Assembly Hall, the judges gave their verdict as follows:\n\n1st Prize for Best Girl's Costume - Phyllis Shaw as a Gipsy\n1st Prize for Best Boy's Costume - Ross Modeste as \"Herr Hitler\"\n1st Prize for Best Boy's Comic Costume - Henry Pahl as \"Dog Patch News\"\n1st Prize for Best Girl's Comic Costume - Beatrice Stewart as Grandma\n1st Prize for Most Original Costume-Girl's-Madeline Saunders as \"Old Dutch\"\n1st Prize for Most Original Costume-Boy's-Raymond Smith as \"Athletics\"\n\nSupper was served at ten o'clock and then the party was resumed in the Assembly Hall until 11.15 P.M., when some of the old time songs were sung, and at 11.30 we began a Watch Night Service. Some of the grand old hymns of the Church were sung; \"O God our Help in Ages Past\"; \"Guide Me O Thou Great Jehovah\"; \"All the way My Saviour Leads Me\"; and a talk was given upon the 23rd Psalm, as the hour of midnight drew near, heads were bowed in silence and prayer ascended from many a heart; thanksgiving for mercies past and petition for guidance in the year to come. As the Hall Clock finished the hour of Twelve O'Clock, all present extended mutual good wishes for the New Year, and with the strains of \"Should Old Acquaintance be Forgot\", the New Year at Coqualeetza was ushered in.\n\nThe excitement has gone, and classrooms are in full swing once again. There is lots of work to be done during this new term, and we are looking forward to more pleasant times here at School.\n\nBefore we say good-bye until our next letter, I would like to wish each and all of you a very Happy New Year. Trusting that the coming days will hold much of Happiness and Success for one and all;\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.C.

A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Crerar:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 21st. Its contents are not entirely new, as my colleague, Dr. Dorey, was in Ottawa this week, in conversation with some of the officials of your Department, reference was made to the matters which you discuss.\n\nFirst of all, let me say that I am very glad to learn that you are hopeful that in the supplementary estimates there will be made available money for the construction of a fully modern, fireproof residential school at Alberni, to accommodate at least 200 pupils.\n\nWe are also fully aware of the condition of the building at Ahousaht, and we agree that when the new residential school at Alberni is constructed, an improved day school would make provision for the local children in and near Ahousaht.\n\nMy colleagues and I are very much interested in the proposal of your Department which looks toward the eradication of T. B. among the Indian population, and I assure you that we should like to help in any way possible with this programme.\n\nAs far as your proposal in regard to Coqualeetza is concerned, we feel that, before giving a definite answer in regard to it, there is further information which we should have, namely;-\n\n1.- We should have from you concrete suggestions as to how your Department proposes to provide for the 225 pupils now at Coqualeetza, plus the 115 who were in the Alberni Residential School at the time of the fire, and the 50 at Ahousaht - a total of approximately 400 children.\n\n2.- We should have a statement which will show us not only the Agency from which the students at Coqualeetza Residential School come, but the exact community which is their home.\n\nBesides -\nBesides this, we must have time to consult our local representatives in British Columbia in regard to the proposal. I leave at the end of next week for British Columbia and shall endeavour to talk the matter over with them during my stay there.\n\nOf course, the final decision of the United Church in regard to the matter of permitting the present Coqualeetza Residential School to be used as a T.B. sanatorium must be made by the Board of Home Missions, which holds its annual meeting on March 29th.\n\nI am sorry to have to delay in giving you our answer, and I hope that it will not inconvenience either you or the Department to wait until then. I assure you that we will write you definitely at the earliest possible moment.\n\nI have only to add that we hope that the appropriation for the new school at Alberni will not be held up until this other matter is settled. Our opinion is that already too much time has been lost in making a decision in regard to the rebuilding of this school.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(sgd.) R. Coshrane.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nRev. R.C. Scott, B.A.\nPrincipal\n\nSCHOOL\u2014CHILLIWACK 4602\nRESIDENCE\u2014CHILLIWACK 4607\n\nDear H.W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa - Canada.\n\nI must apologize for not coming to see you before leaving Ottawa Tuesday night, especially after your kind inquiry. I fully intended doing so but was detained so long with the Toronto members of the Committee after lunch, that by the time I got through with school business with the boys and the women, employees were going home and heads of departments were busy getting the days work completed. I felt it would be unfair to try to see you after that hour\u2014five P.M., and as I had received very discouraging news from the School by air mail just as I left Toronto, I determined to return home as quickly as possible.\n\nThe news concerned the results of an X-Ray examination which had been planned for the week I left home. Some two active cases...\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nhave been added to our list of tubercular patients\nand one more Preventorium case. Mr. Macdonald\nand Mr. Kincaid are conferring with Mr. Henderson\nand they are waiting for my advice before deciding\non a definite course of action.\n\nThis all goes to show the definite need for some\nsuch institution as is planned for Coqualeetza\nunder Departmental direction. We hope that\ndue consideration will be given to my suggestion\nregarding the operation of the two Preventoria\nin connection with the proposed Sanatorium.\n\nIt seems to me it would be invaluable as a\n\"clearing station\" to the Residential Schools or Home\nSchools and might point the way out of the\ndifficulty regarding academic instruction in\nthese Reserves.\n\nI regret being unable to see you and appreciate\nvery much the attitude you took during the\ncorrespondence with the minister and the committee\nregarding the future of the School. If the above\nsuggestion appeals to you I would be glad if\nyou would give it your support. I shall be glad\nto cooperate with the Department in its plans\nfor Indian betterment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I told him that I could travel on my Clergyman's Half Fare Permit, which would be much less expense. He said he would take it up with the Commissioner.\n\nHe informed me later that he had done so, and the Commissioner advised that I pay the expense and then take it up with the Department upon my arrival at Ottawa.\n\nThis will be quite satisfactory, and I shall come with the delegation from the Board of Home Missions, and trust that we may be able to arrive at some solution mutually satisfactory in connection with the advance in work for Tubercular Indians.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nOttawa, April 28, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYou may remember, during the discussion we had at the office of the Minister, I intimated that our officials in British Columbia were of the opinion that a residential school erected at Ucluelet would be in a position to accommodate a certain number of pupils from the Alert Bay district.\n\nI have been checking over the reports submitted by these officials and find that the territory they had in mind was not the Alert Bay territory but the territory now served by the Ahousaht Residential School. I have made a study of the geographical boundaries of the district and feel convinced that I had reached a mistaken conclusion with respect to the matter. What I said, of course, has no bearing on the erection of the school at Alberni, but I felt that in justice to our officials in British Columbia I should attempt to correct any impression made in your mind by my comments on the situation.\n\nIt is my hope that you had a pleasant return journey. Your presence here and the opinions you expressed were very helpful.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend R. C.

Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nI have just had a telephone message from Mr. Hoey, asking if it would be possible for Dr. Cochrane and myself to meet you in Ottawa on Friday morning, next, April 14th. I understand that this is in reply to a letter, addressed by Dr. Cochrane to yourself yesterday. If you will refer to this letter again, I think you will find that Dr. Cochrane has made it clear that we shall find it necessary to have Captain Scott, Principal of the Coqualeetza Residential School, and a representative of the Woman's Missionary Society as part of the Committee to meet with you and discuss the matter.\n\nYou will realize that it is quite impossible for us to get Captain Scott here on forty-eight hours' notice. I think that the earliest possible date at which Captain Scott could be here would be some time the week beginning April 23rd, provided a date during that week could be arranged when we could meet you. Would you give the matter further consideration and advise us by wire on what date and at what hour during that week it would suit your convenience to have us meet with you? We can then wire Captain Scott and try to have arrangements made for his coming East at that time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nGeo. Dorey\n\nGD.MLT\nBOARD OF HOME MISSIONS\n\nThe United Church of Canada\n\n299 Queen St. West\nToronto 2, Ontario.\n\nApril 11th,\n1939.\n\nThe Honorable T.A. Crear,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Crear:\n\nIn further reference to your letters of February 21st and March 2nd, I should like to say that on a recent trip to British Columbia, I discussed in Vancouver with the representatives of the British Columbia Conference the suggestion of your Department that we might consent to the use of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School as a sanatorium for active tuberculosis cases. I also had the privilege, along with our two Superintendents of Missions and Captain R.C. Scott, of meeting with Major MacKey and Captain Barrie to discuss the same matter. Subsequently, the British Columbia Conference Home Mission Committee appointed a special sub-committee to consider your suggestion, and their report I submitted to the Board of Home Missions, which met the week before last.\n\nThe Board referred the whole matter to the Executive, and appointed a committee consisting of my colleagues and myself, Captain Scott, Principal of the Coqualeetza School, and a representative of the Woman's Missionary Society, to meet with you and further discuss the matter. In the light of these facts, it would seem that the next step is to arrange a date, in the near future, when this committee could meet with you and other officials of your Department, to go into the matter further. There are a good many questions which have been asked by the British Columbia Committee which we shall have to discuss with you before our Board can give a definite answer to your proposal.\n\nIf you could give me two or three alternative dates when you could meet with us, we could get in touch with Captain Scott and see which one would suit him best.\nYou will understand that before he can leave the School for even a few days, he will have to make a re-adjustment of duties among the members of the staff.\n\nAwaiting your reply, and with kindest regards, believe me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nR.B. Cochrane\n\nRBC.MLT\nEX.D.\n\nOttawa, March 31, 1939.\n\nRe: Coqualeetza Residential School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIt is my understanding that the desirability of transferring the Coqualeetza school to the Department for use as a sanatorium will come up for discussion at the annual meeting of the Home Mission Board of the United Church, which meeting I understand is being held on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of this week. It is not at all likely that a report of the decision reached will be forwarded to the Department for a week or so at least. Indeed, it is possible that Dr. Cochrane and Dr. Dorey may come down to Ottawa in the course of a week or two and discuss the whole matter with the Minister. In view of this fact, I do not think that it would be at all advisable to keep Inspector Barry at Vancouver or to have him investigate the home conditions of the pupils now enrolled at Coqualeetza. I am convinced that we have on file here sufficient evidence for the church authorities and the Minister to reach a decision. It would not be at all necessary, of course, to close the Coqualeetza school immediately or to close it until full provision had been made for the pupils at Indian day schools or at the new school to be established at Alberni.\n\nWhen Dr. Cochrane states that he must have full information with respect to the provision the Department can make for the pupils now enrolled at Coqualeetza, he is in my judgment to some extent at least evading the issue. The\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nMinister -\nMinister has assured him that provision will be made for these pupils. In addition to this, the Department has for a number of years accepted full responsibility for the education of Indian pupils.\n\nI was somewhat hopeful that the United Church authorities in British Columbia would be somewhat sympathetic toward our suggestion. Your letter, however, would suggest that such is not the case, and if they are not, it is not at all likely that the members of the Home Mission Board will agree to the change. This means that there will be little, if any, accommodation in British Columbia for pupils suffering from tuberculosis. In other words, it is likely that we shall continue to do in the future what we have been doing in the past, namely: educating Indian children for a number of years at residential schools and burying them a year or two after they are discharged from these institutions. This matter has been placed very fairly, in my judgment, before the church authorities and they will have to accept the major share of the responsibility for whatever action is taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMarch 27, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 3rd with enclosures relating to the rebuilding of the Alberni Indian Residential School and the proposal to operate the Coqualeetza school building as a T.B. sanatorium, I thought it advisable to make some observation on the matters brought out at the conference with the representatives of the United Church of Canada held on March 11th in this office. There were present the following:\n\nReverend R. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nReverend G.A. Wilson, D.D.,\nReverend S.S. Osterhout, D.D.,\nReverend R.S. Scott, B.A.,\nThe Inspector of Indian Schools, and\nThe Indian Commissioner.\n\nWith the possible exception of Dr. Cochrane, I should say that in general the Church officials, although admitting improvement in Indian Day Schools, did not consider that they supplied the place of Residential Schools such as Coqualeetza. Reference was made to the advantage of the Day School and also the fact that children in Residential Schools are inclined to grow away from the life of the Indian Band and are unable therefore to take their part later in the work of their parents. It was pointed out that where the Department wished to educate children in the Day Schools that the mere saving of money was not the most important factor considered.\n\nThe argument was advanced by the Church officials that the children now at Coqualeetza could not be accommodated in the existing Day Schools. In reply I explained that the Department would be prepared to erect new Day Schools and add to the existing accommodation of some schools to take care of the children not\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\notherwise provided for, should Coqualeetza cease to be a Residential School. Perhaps I should add that Dr. Cochrane considered it unfair of the Hon. Mr. Crerar to offer the proposed new Residential School at Alberni only on condition that the Ahousaht and Coqualeetza Residential Schools be discontinued as such. It was pointed out here that the United Church would have two small Residential Schools in the Skeena River and Bella Coola Agencies, but Dr. Cochrane considered that should the proposal under review go into effect, the United Church would only have one large Residential School in British Columbia, which contention of course is admittedly sound, but it does not follow that one large new Residential School with the existing schools at Port Simpson and Kitimat would not provide sufficient boarding school accommodation for the Indian pupilage of the United Church in this Province. My own opinion is that they would do so.\n\nDr. Cochrane explained that before a decision could be made by the Church committee to surrender Coqualeetza on the establishment of a new Residential School, definite information regarding how the children now at Coqualeetza would be provided for and where additional school rooms or new schools would be erected should be made available to the committee. Following the return of Capt. Barry from recent inspection duties, I asked him where such schools, as might have to be provided, should be erected and in what instances additions would be necessary to existing schools. The Inspector replied as follows:\n\n\"(a) We have no records in Vancouver with regard to the home villages of the children now at Coqualeetza. The Department in Ottawa has copies of all admission forms for children at Coqualeetza and these would I believe show the village from which the child comes.\n\n(b) Neither the officials at Ottawa or I know which of the children now at Coqualeetza is fit for day school education as distinct from those who must have residential school treatment, as orphans or because they come from poor homes or overcrowded ones.\n\n(c)\n\nBefore ....\n(c) Before I could recommend the exact disposal of each child now at Coqualeetza it would be necessary to carry out an extensive survey, first of the children at the school, and then of the whole area from which the children are recruited to determine the condition of the homes. I am of course prepared to carry out such a survey should the Department so instruct me. It would take in the neighbourhood of four months and completely upset the ordinary routine of school inspection. The area involved includes parts of the Cowichan, New Westminster, Kwawkewlth, West Coast, Bella Coola, Skeena River and Queen Charlotte Agencies.\n\n(d) Should the Department not be able to extract from the Ottawa files all the required information, or not be able to obtain it from the various Indian Agents, I can see nothing else possible than the very extensive survey suggested in the last paragraph.\"\n\nThough the Department might be able to obtain from its records much of the information Dr. Cochrane requests, I do not consider it reasonable for him to expect more than the Honourable Minister's promise that all the children not accommodated in the proposed new Residential School will be provided for gradually in one or other of the existing Day Schools or in new schools or in additions to existing Day Schools.\n\nIf the Department decides to have Inspector Barry undertake the extensive survey necessary to furnish the information requested by Dr. Cochrane, instructions to this effect should be issued at an early date to enable the Inspector to do the preliminary work at Coqualeetza before leaving for the north.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes\n\nOttawa April 15 1939\n\nReverend R C Scott\nPrincipal\nIndian Residential School\nSardis via Chilliwack B C\n\nYOU ARE AUTHORIZED BY DEPARTMENT TO VISIT\nOTTAWA NOTIFY AGENT\n\nR A HOEY\n\nChg Indian Affairs Branch\nMines & Resources\nOttawa, March 9, 1938.\n\nDear Dr. Cochrane:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 25, in which you seek information with respect to the provision that might be made for the pupils now enrolled at the Ahousaht and Coqualeetza Residential Schools and the pupils enrolled at the Alberni School prior to the destruction of the building by fire.\n\nIn discussing the adjustments that may be necessary, should we decide to operate the school at Coqualeetza as a sanatorium, it is important to remember that the patients assigned to this institution will be almost wholly boys and girls suffering from tuberculosis who are at present in attendance at Indian day or residential schools. It is estimated that almost from the outset there will be a patient list of approximately 150 boys and girls, including the 15 pupils now receiving treatment at the Coqualeetza preventorium.\n\nIn view of the existence of preventoria at the St. Mary's Mission Residential School (R.C.) and the Alert Bay Residential School (C.E.), I am disposed to think that the majority of the children who might receive treatment at Coqualeetza would be members or adherents of the United Church.\n\nThe Medical Superintendent estimates that 5% of the children enrolled at residential schools in the province of British Columbia are suffering from tuberculosis.\n\nReverend Robert B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto Ont.\nin an active sense and should be sent to sanatoria for treatment.\n\nIt is our thought that the Alberni Residential School, if constructed, should be designed to serve the West Coast, Cowichan, Kwawkewlth, Vancouver and New Westminster agencies. An overwhelming majority of the Indians of these agencies are usually described as coast Indians and depend for a living almost wholly on fishing. Our records indicate that there are 152 pupils from these agencies now in attendance at Coqualeetza. With an improved day school at Ahousaht and a day school in operation at Alberni, in addition to the residential school, it should be possible to provide for a larger number of pupils in the residential school from Kwawkewlth than 26, the number at present enrolled at Coqualeetza. It should be possible also to organize at the new residential school a really worthwhile vocational course designed to meet the peculiar needs of the coast Indians.\n\nYou may recall to mind that, immediately following the destruction of the Alberni School by fire (February 21, 1927), 22 of the pupils were enrolled at the Alberni Day School, which is still in operation; 17 are in attendance at the Ucluelet Day School; and 8 were placed in the residential school at Ahousaht.\n\nThis proposal has not been submitted to our officials in British Columbia. I hesitate, therefore, to state definitely the exact provision that will be made until these officials have had an opportunity to review the educational needs of the Indians concerned. In a general way, however, I can state, in reply to the sixth paragraph of your communication, that provision will be made for 200 pupils at Alberni; 40 at the improved -\nimproved day school at Ahousaht; 25 at the day school at Ucluelet and 30 at the Indian day school at Alberni, if it is considered advisable to keep this school in operation. In addition to this, it is estimated that approximately 50 active or non-active T.B. pupils will be accommodated at Coqualeetza. This makes a total of 345. I feel confident no difficulty will be experienced in providing accommodation for the remaining pupils who have been recruited from the northern agencies. Our officials have protested very vigorously during the last two or three years against the attempts that have been made to recruit pupils for Coqualeetza in communities where Indian day school accommodation is available.\n\nI regret that it is not possible for me to state definitely at this time if the appropriation necessary for the construction of the Alberni school will be approved, until I can submit to my colleagues a definite educational and T.B. programme for the section of British Columbia now under review. If, as has been stated, no sanatorium beds are available in British Columbia, it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for us to proceed with our T.B. programme in that province unless space can be secured at Coqualeetza. I am not prepared to recommend the amount necessary for the construction of a new sanatorium out of the limited amount at my disposal for the actual care and treatment of T.B. patients.\n\nIt was not my intention that you should decide this matter until you had an opportunity of submitting it for final decision to the Board of Home Missions. I appreciate your assurance, however, that you will let me have the decision of the Board at the earliest possible date.\n\nIn response to your request contained in the seventh paragraph of your communication, I am enclosing herewith -\nherewith statement showing the pupils enrolled at the Coqualeetsa school and the communities from which these pupils have been recruited. This statement, I think, you will find self-explanatory. I am enclosing also, for your information, copy of the last departmental Census of the Indians in Canada.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRAH\n\n3/2/29\nOttawa, March 3, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copies of certain correspondence relating to the rebuilding of the Alberni Indian Residential School and the operation of the Coqualeetza School as a T.B. sanatorium. It is my opinion that you will find this correspondence self-explanatory.\n\nDr. Cochrane, Secretary of the Home Mission Board of the United Church, will visit Vancouver in the course of a few days, and it is just possible that during his stay in the province he will call upon you and discuss these matters with you. It might be helpful if Inspector Barry were present at this interview. However, this may not be possible. In any event, I am sending forward this correspondence in the hope that it may serve to guide you in the discussions.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnch.\n\nR. A.

I feel confident Major MacKay's views on the rebuilding of the Alberni Residential School and the operation of Coqualeetza as a sanatorium would prove very valuable to you in reaching a decision. Major MacKay's office is in the new Federal Building in Vancouver.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hody,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend R. B.

A. Crerar,  \nMinister of Mines and Resources,  \nOttawa, Ontario.  \n\nMy dear Mr. Crerar:  \n\nRe: The Rebuilding of the Alberni School and the Utilization of the Coqualeetza School as a T.B. Sanatorium.  \n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of May 8th, in answer to my letter to you of April 28th, in which I enclosed a summary of what my colleagues and I understood were the decisions reached in the conference held in your office on April 25th, 1939. I am glad to know that the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch are of the opinion that the Memorandum which we submitted contained an accurate summary of the discussions which took place and the tentative agreement reached at that time.\n\nI may say that your reply is quite satisfactory to us, with the exception of what you have to say in reference to our request for a definite statement that the policy of the Department will be to operate the proposed Sanatorium at Coqualeetza on a purely non-sectarian basis, giving equal privileges to all religious bodies, both Catholic and non-Catholic. My colleagues and myself are of the opinion that your letter does not give us at all in explicit terms the guarantee we must have if we are to carry with us our United Church constituency in British Columbia, and if we are to get approval of the whole idea from our Executive when it meets on June 12th.\n\nIt is hardly sufficient for you to tell us that in the operation of the Sanatorium you are going to cooperate with the Provincial Health authorities and that it will be conducted in the same way as the hospital now in operation at Qu'Appelle. Quite frankly, we have had reports that some of our people in Saskatchewan have not been satisfied that the administration of the Qu'Appelle institution has been entirely free from sectarian bias. To be perfectly candid, I am already receiving letters from United Church people around Coqualeetza to the effect that, since the Coqualeetza School has been under Protestant auspices for so long, the\nappointment at any time of a Roman Catholic medical superintendent or matron would cause trouble, and would give the impression that the whole institution had been turned over to that Church.\n\nIn view of all these circumstances, we feel that we are not unreasonable in asking that an assurance very much more definite and explicit than that contained in your letter of May 8th should be given us in writing.\n\nSince I wrote you on April 28th, another point on which we want assurance was raised by my colleague, Dr. Dorey, in his letter of May 3rd to Dr. McGill. It had to do with the effect which the establishment of a large T.B. Sanatorium like Coqualeetza would have upon the number of Indian patients which are now being treated in our United Church hospitals in the northern part of the Province of British Columbia, at Hazelton, Fort Simpson and Bella Bella. Two of these hospitals had additions made to them in recent years, to the cost of which the Government contributed, with the understanding that a certain number of beds would be reserved for Indian tuberculosis patients. Since there seems to be some doubt about the future policy in this matter, we must have it cleared before any final consent is given by the United Church to the use of Coqualeetza as a sanatorium.\n\nWe are very anxious, indeed, to have these matters cleared up before the meeting of our Executive early in June, so that, if possible, we may give you a definite answer at that time.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you in the near future,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(sgd.) R. B. Cochrane.\nOttawa, May 8, 1939\n\nRe - The rebuilding of the Alberni School and the utilization of the Coqualeetza School as a T.B. Sanatorium.\n\nDear Dr. Cochrane:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 28 and also a summary of certain decisions reached at the conference held at my office on April 25, 1939, attached thereto.\n\nThis memorandum has been carefully reviewed by the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch, and it is our opinion that you have submitted in the memorandum an accurate summary of the discussions that took place and the tentative agreement reached at that time.\n\nI may state that it is our intention to proceed with the construction of the Alberni residential school just as soon as plans for the building can be prepared. It is my understanding that this building will consist of two units and will provide accommodation for 300 pupils. I will also recommend that provision be made in the 1940-41 estimates for the construction of an improved day school at Ahousaht.\n\nI am asking the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch to send forward to Commissioner MacKay a copy of your memorandum, with the object of having Inspector Barry and Captain Scott review at the earliest convenient date the educational needs of the Indian pupils of British -\n\nReverend R.B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nTORONTO 2, Ontario.\nof British Columbia who are adherents of the United Church. In the meantime I can assure you that if it is necessary to provide additional accommodation at Bella Coola, Cape Mudge and Kitamaat, this provision will be made at the earliest possible date. I agree with you also that for a year or two, at least, it may be necessary to send a number of British Columbia pupils to the residential school at Edmonton.\n\nIt seems to me that it will be necessary to exercise a great deal of care and patience during the transition period between Cocoualeetza and Alberni. I am convinced, however, that by working in close cooperation the Secretaries of the Home Mission Board and the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch can follow a policy that will be satisfactory to all parties concerned.\n\nI note with interest, in the penultimate paragraph of your letter, the reference to the desirability of operating the sanatorium at Cocoualeetza on a purely non-sectarian basis. A great deal of thought has been given to what I might term the Indian tuberculosis problem. This subject has been discussed very thoroughly on a number of occasions with specialists who have been engaged in T.B. sanatorium work in the provinces over a period of years. The policy of the Government is to work in the closest possible cooperation with these agencies. In this way it is my hope that unnecessary expense, overlapping and duplication of effort in undertaking surveys, etc., can be avoided. In respect to Cocoualeetza, the intention is to have the operation of the sanatorium discussed with the provincial health authorities and, if possible, reach an agreement with them whereby the experience and skill of their specialists would be placed at our disposal from time to time. The policy is that this sanatorium should be conducted as a government institution in the sense that the hospital now in operation at Cu'Appelle is operated. The superintendent and members of the staff would be\ngovernment employees and provision would be made in the estimates from year to year for the amount necessary to maintain the institution.\n\nI note that it is your intention to submit this statement to the Executive of the Board of Home Missions and to the Woman's Missionary Society and, if possible, secure from them an agreement with respect to these proposals. Should the information contained in this communication be insufficient for the purpose you have in mind, I want you to feel free to communicate with me again.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that I appreciate very fully the cooperation extended by Dr. Dorey and yourself to the officials of the Department and to myself throughout these negotiations.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRAH\nOttawa, May 8, 1939,\n\nRe - The rebuilding of the Alberni School and the utilization of the Coqualeetza School as a T. B. Sanatorium.\n\nDear Dr. Cochrane:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 26 and also a summary of certain decisions reached at the conference held at my office on April 25, 1939, attached thereto.\n\nThis memorandum has been carefully reviewed by the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch, and it is our opinion that you have submitted in the memorandum an accurate summary of the discussions that took place and the tentative agreement reached at that time.\n\nI may state that it is our intention to proceed with the construction of the Alberni Residential School just as soon as plans for the building can be prepared.

B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMay 3rd, 1939.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nSince leaving Ottawa yesterday afternoon, I have been turning over in my mind certain questions which arose during the course of our conversation yesterday morning.\n\nYou will remember that Dr. Moore discussed a policy for dealing with tuberculosis, which had in mind isolation rather than treatment of a considerable number of people who might not be considered eligible for treatment in a sanatorium. I got the impression from him that this rather large group of people constituted a menace to the success of any campaign for the eradication of tuberculosis amongst the Indian people. As I understand it, Dr. Moore has in mind the placing of this group of people in some institution where they would not get the medical care and attention that they would receive in a sanatorium. I presume that this would be on the basis that cases were more or less quiescent or possibly pretty nearly hopeless. In any event, you will remember that he raised the question of the cost per day of the care of these people, pointing out that $2.75 was altogether too high for that type of care.\n\nYou will, I am sure, realize that I am not presuming to offer any opinion as to the advisability or otherwise of the plan proposed by Dr. Moore - that, after all, is a matter for the medical profession; neither am I making any criticism of Dr. Moore's suggestion that the cost ought to be brought down from $2.75. As I said at the time, we ought to study whether we can cut down the cost of hospitalization per patient per day. However, in the course of the conversation, Dr. Moore outlined - or seemed to outline - his proposal as something like this:\n\nHe would take all T.B. cases that offer any hope of cure and place them in the proposed new Sanatorium at Coqualeetza, and in this institution he would make provision for as many of these cases as it is likely the Government can pay for. This would leave for care by our Hospitals at Fort Simpson and Hazelton only those cases which ought to be segregated and for which Dr. Moore thinks care should be provided at a rate considerably below the $2.75 which is at present paid.\nMay I repeat that I am not in a position either to judge of the practicability or feasibility of this plan, nor am I offering any criticism, but I feel I ought to write to you and say that, in view of the fact that this may seriously affect the revenues of the two hospitals mentioned, and may indeed very seriously impair their usefulness, we feel that, before we can recommend to our Executive that we acquiesce in the plan already outlined for Coqualeetza, this phase of the matter, which is rather new, should receive consideration; and that we feel that, not only should it receive consideration, but that unless we can come together on this in some way, there will be very grave doubt in the minds of the members of the Executive of the Board of Home Missions as to the wisdom of going any further with the negotiations regarding Coqualeetza.\n\nPerhaps you will be good enough to discuss this with Dr. Moore and let us have your considered judgment in the matter. To my mind it is very important that this aspect of the whole matter be cleared up, as it may seriously affect the amount of money which we shall have to put into the operation of our hospitals. You will realize that we want to co-operate in every way possible with your Department, that we have every sympathy with the campaign which you are waging against tuberculosis, but that naturally we must look ahead some distance in such matters as these.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the agency for the month of April 1939.\n\nI regret to have to report that Mr. Allen, Engineer at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential school, was killed in an automobile accident on April 30th.\n\nA.O'N.

This summary contains a number of decisions reached by the officials and the representatives of the United Church at that time. The memorandum I am sending forward to the Commissioner is a copy of the summary supplied us by the Secretaries of the Home Mission Board, so that there is no likelihood of a misunderstanding arising with respect to the decisions reached.\n\nI am suggesting to Commissioner MacKay that Captain Barry interview you just as soon as he can conveniently do so, with respect to certain additional re-adjustments that will have to take place before Coqualeetza can be used as a T.B. sanatorium. I have intimated to Major MacKay that you are in a position to state rather definitely the number of pupils for whom residential school accommodation should be provided. If there is any disagreement between you and Captain Barry on this point, specific cases might be referred to the local Indian agents. I feel confident, however, that you and the Inspector will be able to agree on the main outlines, at least, of a worthwhile educational programme and the additional buildings necessary to meet the needs of the Indians.\n\nIt is our intention to proceed with the construction of the school at Alberni at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend R. C. Scott, B. A.,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Residential School,\nSardis, B. C.\nOttawa, May 4, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a memorandum received by the Minister from the Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church.\n\nYou will note that this memorandum contains a summary of a discussion that took place at the Minister's office on the forenoon of April 25, 1939. The Minister has acknowledged receipt of this memorandum and intimated to the United Church authorities that he is in substantial agreement with the conclusions outlined in the communication.\n\nThe opinion was expressed at the conference that Inspector Barry and Captain Scott could, if they got together, reach certain definite conclusions with respect to the classroom accommodation that should be provided in addition to the new school at Alberni, consisting of two units with accommodation for 200 pupils, and an improved day school at Ahousaht. It was intimated that Mr. Scott had a rather intimate knowledge of Indian homes in the northern districts of the province and would be in a position to state definitely the approximate number of Indian children for whom accommodation at residential schools should be provided. It is just possible, of course, that in certain cases there may be lack of agreement between him and Captain Barry. Such cases might be referred to the Indian agent for his opinion.\n\nIt has been decided to proceed with the construction of the Alberni Residential School just as soon as plans can be prepared and tenders advertised. This building will consist of two distinct units - a dormitory unit and an educational unit with four classrooms, to provide for 200 pupils, and full basement accommodation. In the meantime and until certain adjustments are made the Ahousaht and Coqualeetza Residential Schools will be kept open and in operation. It is the intention of the Minister, however, that the Coqualeetza School should be equipped and used as a sanatorium at the earliest possible date.\n\nEncl.\n\nIt is not my intention to overload Inspector Barry with additional work, and I certainly hesitate to interrupt him in his regular inspectorial duties. I would like, however, to have him comment upon the following suggestions -\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nsuggestions:\n\n1. Does he consider it would be practical and worth while to continue the Alberni Day School after the residential school is in operation, on the understanding that the children attending the day school would be provided with a noonday meal?\n\n2. I should like to have a definite recommendation from you with respect to the dimensions of the new school at Ahousaht and the number of pupils for whom provision should be made.\n\n3. Will the erection of the four room consolidated school at Cowichan have a tendency to reduce the United Church enrolment at Koksilah and thus provide additional accommodation for United Church pupils in that district?\n\n4. It is my understanding that there are a number of local pupils in attendance at the residential schools at Kitamaat and Port Simpson. If such is the case, would it be advisable to make provision for them in the day schools and thus create accommodation at the residential schools for pupils such as orphans and pupils with unsatisfactory home life?\n\nIt is just possible that the re-adjustments suggested in British Columbia may extend to us an opportunity to lay the foundations for a really worthwhile educational policy for Indians in the province. I want you and your officials to feel perfectly free to state very definitely the accommodation which in your judgment should be provided. We may not have at our disposal the funds necessary to carry out the full programme at any time in the immediate future. We should have before us from the outset a full outline of the programme you and your officials may believe is necessary to meet in a satisfactory sense the educational needs of the Indians.\n\nI have intimated to Mr. Scott that Captain Barry would call upon him and discuss this matter with him just as soon as he could conveniently do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM ON CONFERENCE RE COQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nA delegation consisting of Dr. Cochrane, Dr. Dorey, Captain Scott, and Mrs. Loveys met with the Minister and the following officials,- Dr. Camsell, Dr. McGill, Mr. Hoey, Dr. P. E. Moore, and Mr. C. W. Jackson, on April 25, 1939. The delegation presented the Memorandum which had been prepared and left copies with the officials. After a lengthy discussion, the delegation from the United Church understood that the following tentative agreement was reached:\n\n1.- That the Department would proceed immediately with the building of a school to provide for 200 pupils,- this school to be in two units; (a) A residential unit, to provide dormitory, dining room and other accommodation for the 200 resident pupils; and (b) a second unit to consist of four classrooms; together with full basement - basement to be used for manual training, and possibly a gymnasium; and the four class-rooms to provide for the educational needs of the children housed in the dormitory.\n\n2.- The erection of this building is to proceed as soon as possible, but, in the meantime, children will be accommodated at Coqualeetza. The Department officials agree to give careful study to the figures presented in the Memorandum, at the earliest possible moment, and are to satisfy the officials of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church that the Department will make adequate provision for the education of our children -\n\n(a) In a new school at Alberni.\n\n(b) In an improved day school at Ahousaht, to provide for fifty children at that point; the appropriation for this new improved day school to be included in the estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\n(c) In additions to other day schools at Bella Coola, Cape Mudge and other points.\n\n(d) By the erection, also, of an improved day school at Kitamaat.\n\n3.- If, while the erection of the new Alberni School is being proceeded with, it is impossible to make provision for the full number of United Church children as suggested, the Department will transfer as many pupils as may be necessary to Edmonton,- this accommodation at Edmonton to be temporary.\n\n4.- The Department will, on taking over Coqualeetza, operate it as a Sanatorium - that is, free from control -\ncontrol or supervision by any of the churches or denominations; but provision will be made for chaplain service or religious services by Roman Catholic and non-Catholic Churches on an equal footing.\n\n5.- That during the time of transition between Coqualeetza and Alberni, the Department will keep closely in touch with the Secretaries of the Board of Home Missions and will not take any step with regard to the transfer of pupils without consultation with the United Church representatives.\n\n6.- That, if the Department furnishes the delegation with a written statement, agreeing substantially with this statement now submitted, the Committee will ask the Executive of the Board of Home Missions, at its next meeting, and the Woman's Missionary Society, to agree to the proposal.\nOttawa, May 3, 1939.\n\nRe - The rebuilding of the Alberni School and the utilization of the Coqualeetza School as a T. B. Sanatorium.\n\nDear Dr. Cochrane:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 28 and also a summary of certain decisions reached at the conference held at my office on April 25, 1939, attached thereto.\n\nThis memorandum has been carefully reviewed by the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch, and it is our opinion that you have submitted in the memorandum an accurate summary of the discussions that took place and the tentative agreement reached at that time.\n\nI may state that it is our intention to proceed with the construction of the Alberni Residential School just as soon as plans for the building can be prepared. It is my understanding that this building will consist of two units and will provide accommodation for 200 pupils. Provision will be made also in the 1940-41 estimates for the construction of an improved day school at Ahousaht.\n\nI am asking the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch to send forward to Commissioner MacKay a copy of your memorandum, with the object of having Inspector Barry and Captain Scott review at the earliest convenient date the educational needs of the Indian pupils.\n\nReverend R.

In the meantime I can assure you that if it is necessary to provide additional accommodation at Bella Coola, Cape Mudge and Kitamaat, this provision will be made at the earliest possible date. I agree with you also that for a year or two, at least, it may be necessary to send a number of British Columbia pupils to the residential school at Edmonton.\n\nIt seems to me that it will be necessary to exercise a great deal of care and patience during the transition period between Coculaletza and Alberta. I am convinced, however, that by working in close cooperation the Secretaries of the Home Mission Board and the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch can follow a policy that will be satisfactory to all parties concerned.\n\nI note with interest, in the penultimate paragraph of your letter, the reference to the desirability of operating the sanatorium at Coculaletza on a purely non-sectarian basis. A great deal of thought has been given to what I might term the Indian tuberculosis problem. This subject has been discussed very thoroughly on a number of occasions with specialists who have been engaged in T.B. sanatorium work in the provinces over a period of years. The policy of the Government is to work in the closest possible cooperation with these agencies. In this way it is my hope that unnecessary expense, overlapping and duplication of effort in undertaking surveys, etc., can be avoided. In respect to Coculaletza, the intention is to have the operation of the sanatorium discussed with the provincial health authorities and, if possible, reach an agreement with them whereby the experience and skill of their specialists would be placed at our disposal from time to time. The policy is that this sanatorium should be conducted as a government institution in the sense that the hospital now in operation at Qu'Appelle is operated. The superintendent and members of the staff would be\ngovernment employees and provision would be made in the estimates from year to year for the amount necessary to maintain the institution.\n\nI note that it is your intention to submit this statement to the Executive of the Board of Home Missions and to the Woman's Missionary Society and, if possible, secure from them an agreement with respect to these proposals. Should the information contained in this communication be insufficient for the purpose you have in mind, I want you to feel free to communicate with me again.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that I appreciate very fully the cooperation extended by Dr. Dorey and yourself to the officials of the Department and to myself throughout these negotiations.\n\nYours sincerely,\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nProposed to use Coqualeetza Indian Residential School as Sanatorium for tubercular patients.\n\n---\n\nYou will recall that a delegation representing the Board of Missions of the United Church of Canada waited upon the Minister recently in the above matter.\n\nThe attached correspondence is now received, addressed to the Minister, from the Rev. Robert B.

Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Crerar:\n\nOn our return from Ottawa, Dr. Dorsey and I prepared the enclosed Memorandum in regard to the conversation which we had with you and the officials of your Department in reference to the proposal to use the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School as a Sanatorium for tubercular patients. I feel sure that it sets forth our understanding of the tentative agreement which was reached at the conference. We should be glad if you and your officials would study this statement and let us know if it coincides with the understanding which you and the other representatives of the Government have. When we receive such a statement from you, we will, as soon as possible, bring the matter for approval to the Executive of our Board.\n\nIt would seem to us that, after the officials of the Department have had a chance to study the figures which we submitted in our Memorandum on Tuesday, we should have an opportunity of going over with them the whole situation with regard to the provision for the education of all the pupils which will be affected by the proposed changes. Besides, we hope that before the plans for the Alberni School have progressed very far, we shall have another chance of going over them and offering further suggestions.\n\nIt would strengthen our hands very materially if we had a letter from yourself, stating that it would be the policy of the Department to operate the Sanatorium at Coqualeetza on a purely non-sectarian basis, giving equal privileges for religious ministrations to all religious bodies, both Catholic and non-Catholic. As we explained, this is a point of primary importance from the standpoint of our United Church constituency in British Columbia.\n\nWe all appreciate the courtesy extended to us by yourself and the officials of the Department.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(sgd.)

Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nMy dear Mr. Crerar:\n\nA recent letter from Principal Scott, of the Coqualeetza Residential School, gives an example of the kind of think which makes the local United Church people around Coqualeetza very anxious about the influence of the Roman Catholics if the Coqualeetza School becomes a Sanatorium.\n\nMr. Scott, after talking about the proselytizing tendencies of the Roman Catholic Church in his area and mentioning the case of two or three children who were sent to St. Joseph's Hospital in Victoria for treatment, adds these few sentences, which I want to quote just as they came to me:\n\n\"It is interesting to note in this connection that Dr. McQuarrie informed me that this institution was not Catholic, but a Departmental one. He showed me the sheets which are sent to him to be forwarded to the Department for payment of hospitalization service, and they were not headed at all as being connected with St. Joseph's Hospital. I said to him, 'It is in connection with St. Joseph's Hospital' and he replied, 'Oh, the Sisters are running it for the Department'. Now this is a clear indication of what will happen at Coqualeetza.\"\n\nNow, I am not a bigoted Protestant and I do not sympathize very much with the anti-Roman Catholic feeling which seems to dominate the souls of many of our workers among the Indians. I am, however, sending this personal letter to you to explain what we are up against when we try to quiet the fears of our British Columbia people and get this matter settled in a way which will be helpful to\nthe Department and to the Indian children concerned. You see Scott fears that McQuarrie's statement to him means that if the Sisters are running the Sanatorium at St. Joseph's Hospital in Victoria \"for the Department\", it will not be long until they will be running the proposed Coqualeetza Sanatorium for the Department. His fears are doubtless groundless, but the words of Dr. McQuarrie and the situation in connection with the tuberculosis department of St. Joseph's Hospital do not help very much to allay the suspicions of Scott and his United Church friends in British Columbia.\n\nAs I told you in my last letter, I am satisfied with your assurance that the proposed Sanatorium although in an area where Roman Catholics are largely in the majority - will be entirely non-sectarian in its management and will give Protestants equal privileges with Roman Catholics. I might as well confess, however, that we are having a great deal of difficulty in convincing our British Columbia friends that this will be so, and if the situation at St. Joseph's Hospital is as Dr. McQuarrie informed Mr. Scott - well, it just makes it hard for us to persuade our friends on the Pacific coast that the Roman Catholic domination will be felt in the proposed new Sanatorium.\n\nI am still hopeful that our Executive, when it meets on the 13th of this month, will give its approval to the negotiations which we have been carrying on, but I want you to know that our task as executive officers has not been an easy one.\n\nWith very kind regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSigned: R. B. Cochrane\nOttawa, June 5, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of June 1 quoting from a letter from Rev. Robert B. Cochrane, with respect to the utilization of the Coqualeetza School as a tuberculosis sanatorium.\n\nDr. Cochrane refers to a statement contained in the Minister's letter to him of May 16 to the effect that a memorandum will be secured from the Superintendent of Medical Services regarding hospitals at Hazelton, Port Simpson and Bella Coola. I attach hereto memorandum prepared by the Superintendent of Medical Services which sets forth, so far as can be anticipated, the effect which the proposed taking over for tuberculosis work of the Coqualeetza School may have on the three hospitals referred to.\n\nThe last paragraph of Dr. Stone's memorandum deals with an entirely different matter \u2014 the St. Joseph's hospital at Victoria, British Columbia. This has been dealt with in a later letter from Dr. Cochrane to which a reply is being prepared.\n\nI return herewith Dr. Cochrane's letter of May 30.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnclosures.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJune 3, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDoctor McGill,\n\nMy attention has been drawn to a request, addressed by Reverend R. B. Cochrane, D.D., to the Honourable the Minister, for an assurance that the establishment of a sanatorium for Indians at the Coqualeetza School will not seriously embarrass the financial operation of the hospitals operated by the United Church at Hazelton and Bella Bella, and presumably, at Bella Coola and Fort Simpson.\n\nSo far as I can judge, such an assurance can be safely given. Of course, if the funds at our disposal for medical work should be drastically reduced again, as they were by 20% to 25% in 1932 and 1933, our tuberculosis work would have to be correspondingly curtailed, and, being more controllable than the treatment of more acute conditions, it would probably suffer more than its share of reduction. This is a possibility that cannot wholly be forgotten, but need not be unduly feared.\n\nOtherwise, it seems probable that the accommodation at Coqualeetza will all be required for the tuberculosis to be found in the southern part of the province, and in any case, I do not think anyone would seriously propose to move tuberculous Indians from northern to southern British Columbia, a distance of five hundred or six hundred miles from their homes. I would not advise it, from a professional point of view.\n\nI would...........\nI would like to suggest two reservations in respect to the future of these United Church hospitals, as tuberculosis treatment institutions. The Department has a greater or less capital investment in all, and their revenue is and will continue to be largely from the care of Indians.\n\nFirst. It might become necessary to request that the rates for the care of tuberculous or any sick Indians be adjusted to provide for operation at about actual, economical cost.\n\nSecond. It might become necessary to request that the Church provide medical and nursing staff with thorough training in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis, and otherwise to conduct the hospital on an effective sanatorium basis. That is to say, if the hospitals are to provide care for tuberculous Indians, the Department is entitled to ask that the care shall be of the best kind.\n\nMr. Jackson spoke on the telephone of a reported impression that Captain Scott had received from Doctor McQuarrie, to the effect that St. Joseph's Hospital at Victoria, B.C., was a Departmental hospital, or at least so regarded. There must be a misunderstanding somewhere. That hospital is a public institution, operated by a religious order. It accommodates Indian patients under exactly the same conditions as very many other hospitals in Canada do. The Department has no investment in it, no control over its management, and no preference for it over any other hospital in Victoria.\n\nE. L.

Sanatorium\n\nDear Dr. Cochrane:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 11, in which you ask from me a more definite and explicit assurance that the Cocualeetza school, if taken over by the Department, would be operated as a T.B. sanatorium on a strictly non-sectarian basis.\n\nIn my letter to you of May 8 I stated: \"The policy is that this sanatorium (Cocualeetza) should be conducted as a government institution in the sense that the hospital in operation at Cu'Appelle is conducted\". The institution at Cu'Appelle was built by the Government and is operated as a government institution. I have not at any time received a complaint with respect to either the sectarian bias or efficiency of the institution. In fact, I find it difficult to understand how sectarian bias could develop in an institution conducted in the sense that the Cu'Appelle hospital is conducted.\n\nThe school at Cocualeetza is a government-owned institution, and should it be decided to operate it as a sanatorium, provision would be made for its operation in the regular parliamentary estimates. Under existing legislation -\n\nReverend R. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\nlegislation, the position of superintendent would be advertised by the Civil Service Commission and the appointment made by that body. I have no hesitation, however, in assuring you that the institution, if taken over, would be operated by the Government on a basis that would aim at giving equal privileges to all religious bodies, both Catholic and non-Catholic. I have sufficient faith in the judgment of any Minister who may be in charge of the Department to give this assurance.\n\nThe ravages of tuberculosis are very much in evidence amongst the Indian population of British Columbia and this applies particularly to Indian children of school age. The leaders of the United Church in British Columbia have on more than one occasion in recent years reminded us that Indian reserves in that province are rapidly becoming a health menace to the white population. When, in response to these representations, a survey was made of the situation, we were advised by the provincial health authorities that no beds were available for Indian patients in the provincial institutions. It is a matter of urgent necessity, therefore, that sanatorium treatment be provided for Indians at the Pacific coast if a serious attempt is to be made to save the Indian children. If the Coculaetza school cannot be taken over, an attempt will have to be made to secure from the Government the funds necessary to build a sanatorium in the Vancouver area. The need for such an institution in this area is undoubtedly one of the most outstanding needs of the Indian service.\n\nIt is my intention to secure from the Superintendent of Medical Services his comments on your reference to the three hospitals - Hazelton, Port Simpson and Bella Coola - mentioned in your communication. These comments will reach me in due course. In the meantime I fail to see how the operation of the Coculaetza school as a sanatorium would differ in any sense, so far as the hospitals -\nhospitals you have in mind are concerned, from the operation of a sanatorium that might be built by the Government in the Vancouver district.\n\nI have attempted to keep in mind throughout these negotiations the plight of the Indian children afflicted with tuberculosis and the best ways and means of providing them at the earliest possible date with sanatorium treatment. I feel confident that, if this objective is kept in mind, a solution satisfactory to all parties concerned can be worked out with respect to the education of the Indian children of British Columbia on the one hand and the operation of the hospitals in the northern sections of the province on the other.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRAH\nCoqualeetza Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R.C SCOTT, B.A.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nReplying to your letter of April 28th,\n\nFile:153-0-1, with regard to a school site at Ucluelet being nearer to Alert Bay, I may say that I noticed at the time the statement was made, and was sure there was some mistake. With regard to a school at Ucluelet serving the area now served by the Ahousaht Residential School, the statement would of course have been correct. However, I had not commented upon it to anyone, for as you say, it had no bearing on the erection of a school at Alert Bay.\n\nI have been waiting to hear from the Commissioner with regard to our conference. Captain Barry informed me that he would be away from the office until the end of June, and was leaving the afternoon of the day upon which I saw him, and that it would be necessary for me to take up the matter of the eligibility of pupils to enter Coqualeetza School, with the Commissioner. I think I shall suggest to the Commissioner that he accept my list of pupils as submitted to our committee in Toronto and send it to the Indian Agents concerned and allow them to pass on the list, making any changes that they feel right. The Indian Agent is of course a man who has the final word, and I am quite agreeable to abiding by his recommendation in each case, or if he should differ, the matter would be then one for consultation with the Commissioner or with yourself. However, I do not anticipate any such action being necessary. Your Indian agents know the homes, and I am quite sure that we can come to satisfactory understanding in the case of these pupils.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\n\nIndian Affairs.

I realize, of course, that the amount of work you can do as a Department depends upon the annual amount made available by the Government.\n\nI am glad that Dr. Stone states that it would not be advisable from a professional standpoint to move tuberculosis patients from the North to the South in British Columbia, and that he would not, in any case, advise it.

A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe - Coqualeetza Residential School\n\nMy dear Mr. Crerar:\n\nThe Executive of the Board of Home Missions, at its meeting last week, dealt with the proposal that Coqualeetza Residential School be taken over by the Dominion Government for use as a Sanatorium for Indian tubercular patients. I am enclosing the resolution adopted by the Executive in regard to the matter. I think it requires very little comment.\n\nThe Secretaries cannot give a final answer until we get a report from Captain Scott in reference to the matter referred to in Clause (1) - that is, until Captain Scott and Captain Barry have been able to consider together, as they were directed to do, the placing, either at Alberni or Edmonton, or in improved day schools on the coast, of all the children who are now in Coqualeetza. I have a letter from Mr. Scott, saying he has not been able to get in touch with Captain Barry, because the latter has been visiting schools in the North. He thinks, however, that they ought to be able to have the conference the end of this month or early in July.\n\nAs far as Nos. (2) and (3) are concerned, you have already given us adequate assurance that you will meet our wishes in regard to these two matters.\n\nWe shall be glad to have your consent to the requests contained in Clauses (4) and (5).\n\nWe are just as anxious as the Department is to get this matter finally settled. I believe this is in the best interests of both the Government and the Church. You will see from what I have written that the final decision, as far as we are concerned, rests now with the Secretaries of our Board, and that we are waiting to be satisfied about Clauses (1), (4) and (5) before agreeing to the proposal in the name of The United Church of Canada.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(sgd.)

Cochrane\nOttawa,\nAugust 14, 1939.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nIn response to your request I am enclosing herewith, for your information, a report received by this Department from Commissioner MacKay in respect to the proposed distribution of pupils now enrolled at the Coqualeetza residential school.\n\nI regret to state that the limited time at my disposal has not enabled me to study, or even read, this report. I am sending it forward on the understanding that it will be returned here just as soon as you have had an opportunity to study and peruse it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 3)\nRe Coqualeetza Pupil Disposition\n\nDIGEST OF THE FOREGOING STATEMENT:\n\nOf the 228 pupils now enrolled at Coqualeetza Residential School, the following distribution is suggested as per the foregoing statements:\n\n1. To go to other Residential Schools:\n   - Lytton Agency, to St. George's Residential School \u2014 2\n   - Babine Agency, to go to Port Simpson Girls' Home \u2014 3\n   - Bella Coola Agency, to go to Kitimat Girls' Home \u2014 2\n   Total \u2014 7\n\n2. To go to Village Day Schools:\n   - Cariboo Agency: To Keselith Day School \u2014 4\n   - Tsarlip Day School \u2014 2\n   - Kaskawulth Agency: To Cape Mudge Day School \u2014 6\n   - To Campbell R. Day School \u2014 1\n   - Queen Charlotte Agency: To Skidgate Day School \u2014 2\n   - Massett Day School \u2014 5\n   - Bella Coola Agency: To go to Bella Coola Day School \u2014 8\n   - To go to Kitimat Day School \u2014 4\n   - To go to Klemtu Day School \u2014 1\n   - Skeena Agency: To go to Canyon City Day School \u2014 1\n   - To go to Kincolith Day School \u2014 11\n   - To go to Greenville Day School \u2014 4\n   - To go to Alyshah Day School \u2014 5\n   Total number pupils to go to Day Schools \u2014 55\n\nTotal number pupils to other Residential Schools and to Village Day Schools \u2014 62.\n\n3. Deducting these 62 pupils from the 228 in residence at Coqualeetza, there are left 166 to be cared for. It is suggested that this be done as follows:\n\n   - To remain in the Preventorium \u2014 17\n   - To be discharged as at Sept. 30th \u2014 6\n   - To be discharged June 30th to Sanatorium \u2014 26\n   - To be cared for by the Proposed new Residential School on the West Coast \u2014 140.\n\n4. To these must be added the following:\n   - From Ahousaht Residential School \u2014 32\n   - From Alberni \u2014 27\n   Total to be provided for apart from other West children as listed below \u2014 199.\n\n(Continued)\nFiscal Year 1942-43\n\nProject 18. The addition of a third classroom to the PORT SIMPSON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL to accommodate the increasing attendance and take some of the girls who will be discharged from the Crosby Girls' Home to make room for orphans and destitute cases from the North at that residential school. The third teacher could be accommodated at the school with little difficulty by making use of space above the suggested new room. The school is under United Church auspices and in the Skeena River Agency.\n\nProject 19. The addition of a second classroom at BELLA COOLA to accommodate the attendance which will by then be greatly increased at this point. No teacher's residence would be necessary. The school is under United Church auspices and in the Bella Coola Agency.\n\nProject 20. The erection of a new school on SEA BIRD ISLAND to take the place of the present school held in the council house. The school would not of necessity require a teacher's residence though this might be an advantage. It would be administered under the Roman Catholic Church and would be in the Lytton Agency.\n\nProject 21. The erection of a new school and teacher's residence at KOCHER DESOULLE to take the place of the present very old log building used as a schoolroom and for which rent is paid. This school is under the Roman Catholic Church auspices and in the Babine Agency.\n\nProject 22. The erection of a consolidated two or three room school with or without teachers' residence on the TSARTLIP Indian Reserve to absorb the present Tsartlip Indian Day School and accommodate the Roman Catholic and other children living on the Saanich Reserves. This school would be in the Cowichan Agency.\n\nOf the above projects those numbered 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 17, 18, and 19, are in a very definite way either the corollary of the absorption of Coqualeetza and Thomas and the late Alberni Indian Residential Schools into one new residential school, or their necessity has been greatly hastened by the changes contemplated by the Honorable Minister and Department.\n\nIn the case of the present small Indian Residential Schools at Kitamaat and Port Simpson, I consider that instructions might well be issued that deserving children and particularly orphans from the northern part of the Province who are not Catholic children should be given preference over local children who could very well attend the existing or proposed day schools.\n\nMuch care has been taken in making the above suggestions and many hours spent in thinking out the problems involved. It is hoped that this report may be of definite assistance to the officials of the Department. It is certainly submitted with respect and as a professional suggestion of what might well be done in the way of the erection of new schools and additional rooms during the next three or four years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

(RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir:-\n\nI enclose herewith report, in duplicate, received from Mr. Inspector Barry, relative to proposed distribution of pupils of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School and recommended school building programme for the next three years.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nJuly 6, 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have to refer to a Departmental letter from the Superintendent of Welfare and Training dated May 4th 1939 with reference to the future distribution of the pupils now attending Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, and in particular to the two final paragraphs of that letter.\n\nThe wishes of the Department were adhered to and conferences arranged with the Rev. R.C. Scott in my office on July 3rd and 6th, when the particulars surrounding the life of each child, home conditions, health etc., were discussed in detail.\n\nIt is with considerable pleasure that I am able to report that the Rev. R.C. Scott and I found little difficulty in reaching agreement on the suggested distribution of these Indian children. Our actual working papers are not being forwarded to the Department but placed on file in Vancouver should there be any need to consult these records in the future.\n\nI am forwarding herewith the Statement of Proposed Distribution of the children. Every child now at Coqualeetza has been dealt with and the disposal suggested in each case is the very best possible for the child. The statement is signed by the Reverend Principal, but I am of course in agreement with its contents, and suggest that such statement be considered the joint work of the Principal of Coqualeetza and myself.\n\nI would ask that the suggestions placed on Page 12 be considered in their relation to the below mentioned recommendations which include the needs of the various Agencies in British Columbia for the next four years, as such needs can be met by the erection of Indian day schools, or additions to existing day schools, or replacements.\n\nWhile I am well aware that it may not be found possible to carry out in its entirety the whole of the yearly building programme suggested here, my recommendations are made as a result of a fairly thorough knowledge of the conditions in the various villages and in direct response to Mr. Hey's own suggestion, so that the Honorable the Minister will be able to see at a glance the locations where new schools or additions to schools are considered necessary from a professional point of view.\nRecommended Building Programme\n\nThe educational needs of the Indians in B.C. would be met by the following Building Programme which has been spread over the present and three succeeding Fiscal Years.\n\nThe various projects have been arranged in their relative order of importance, as far as this may be determined at the moment, and such a relative order may be applied to the projects suggested for each Fiscal Year as well as the more general order suggested by the year itself.\n\nFiscal Year 1939-40 (Present Year)\n\nProject 1. The erection of a two room Indian Day School with teachers' residence at GILLIKANAX in the Skeena River Agency. This school would be administered under the Anglican Church.\n\nProject 2. The erection of a four room consolidated Indian Day School without teachers' residence near DUNCAN in the Cowichan Agency. This school would be administered under the auspices of the Catholic Church. Cowichan Indian Day School would be absorbed.\n\nProject 3. The erection of a one room Indian Day School, with teacher's residence at BOOTHROYD in the Lytton Agency. This school would replace the old Boothroyd Indian Day School, and be Anglican.\n\nProject 4. The addition of a second classroom to the present ALERT BAY Indian Day School to provide for the expected increased attendance to a total of about 80 in September-October 1939. This is an Anglican school. The second Division might be accommodated in a rented hall for the first year, Kwawkewlth Agency.\n\nProject 5. The authorization of the employment of a third teacher at the present MASSETT Indian Day School, where a room is available in the school building and could be fitted up at little cost. The school here operates on an eight months basis and is administered under Anglican auspices, Queen Charlotte Agency.\n\nFiscal Year 1940-41\n\nProject 6. The erection of a one room Indian Day School, without teacher's residence probably, at ALQUAHAH, in the West Coast Agency. This school would be administered under the auspices of the United Church of Canada.\n\nProject 7. The addition of a second classroom to the present Indian Day School at KINCOLITH where there will be about sixty pupils in the winter of 1939 and eighty or more the following year. This is an Anglican school in the Skeena River Agency. A temporary hall might be used at first.\n\nProject 8. The erection of a new Indian Day School with a teacher's residence at KITAMATA in the Bella Coola Agency. The present Indian Day School there is the property of the United Church of Canada and is crowded with the children from the Kitamaat Indian Residential School so that the village children do not get the attention they certainly deserve. The present school should be used exclusively for the children from the Kitamaat Indian Residential School of which it forms almost part by being located on the same property. The children suggested to be returned to Kitamaat from Coqualeetza make the provision of a village school at Kitamaat very necessary.\nProject 9. The erection of a one room Indian Day School with teacher's residence at CLO-OOSE in the West Coast Agency. There are between thirty and forty children of school age at this point for whom it will be difficult if not impossible to find accommodation in the proposed new Indian Residential School at or near Alberni. This school would be administered under United Church auspices.\n\nProject 10. The addition of a second classroom to the present Indian Day School at KISPIOK in the Babine Agency. This school is administered under the United Church of Canada. There are now far more children in attendance than can be taught at one time by the Missionary.\n\nProject 11. The erection of a new Indian Day School at HARTLEY BAY to provide increased accommodation and replace the very old school at that point. The present school is administered under the auspices of the United Church of Canada and the school is located in the Skeena River Agency. No residence would be required.\n\nProject 12. The erection of a new two room Indian Day School without teachers' residence at HAZELTON to replace the present overcrowded school conducted in an Anglican hall. This school should not be under the auspices of any one Church as Anglicans, Roman Catholics and Salvation Army children attend. The school is in the Babine Agency.\n\nFiscal Year 1941-42\n\nProject 13. The erection of a one room Indian Day School on one of the Ohlat Reserves on BARKLEY SOUND in the West Coast Agency. There would be some thirty to forty pupils if a suitable site was chosen for an eight month a year school. The people move mainly between two villages. Though most are members of the United Church of Canada there are some Roman Catholics and it is uncertain just which Church should suggest a teacher or administer the school. This could be decided later. There would not be sufficient room at the proposed Indian Residential School at Alberni for these people and they might not wish to attend such a school. They were much opposed to a school at Alberni when I made my survey of the Barkley Sound area. A teacher's residence would be required at this school.\n\nProject 14. The erection of a new Indian Day School at KITKATLA in the Skeena River Agency to replace a very old day school. No teacher's residence would be required. The teacher is the Anglican Missionary.\n\nProject 15. The erection on Indian Reserve of a new Indian Day School at Shalalth in the Lytton Agency to replace the very old log school, Seton Lake Indian Day School, at that point. This school would be under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. No teacher's residence would be needed.\n\nProject 16. The erection of a new Indian Day School, without teacher's residence at ENDEBEE to accommodate the twenty to twenty five children without education at that point. This school would be under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church and would be in the Okanagan agency.\n\nProject 17. The addition of a second classroom to the present Indian Day School at CAPE MUDGE in the Kwakwewlth Agency. The school is under the auspices of the United Church of Canada. There is a teacher's residence there now.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare\nand Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThanks very much for your kindness in sending me the material about Coqualeetza which I read with interest. I have had copies made for our file. I may say that I had already received a considerable amount of this material from Captain Scott.\n\nWe shall be glad to have the opportunity of discussing this in detail with the Department whenever you are ready.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGDBJ\nEICLS.\nOttawa, September 1, 1939.\n\nRe: Distribution of pupils now enrolled at Coqualeetza School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 18 and also a report, in duplicate, relating to the above noted subject, received by you from Inspector Barry.\n\nI have hesitated to reply to your letter until now, in the hope that I would have an opportunity to discuss Inspector Barry's report with representatives of the United Church and with them come to a definite decision in respect to the operation of the Coqualeetza school as a T.B. sanatorium. I regret to state, however, that it has not been possible to arrange for a conference of the church authorities, although a copy of the report was sent forward to them early in August. I am taking it for granted that the report is reasonably satisfactory to both Dr. Dorey and Dr. Cochrane. It is just possible, however, that they may be waiting to discuss it with the Executive of the Home Mission Board. I am taking it for granted, also, that Coqualeetza will be taken over by the Superintendent of Medical Services and operated as a sanatorium, although no official announcement to this effect can be made until we know definitely that Inspector Barry's recommendations with respect to the distribution of the pupils are acceptable to all parties concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Parents and Friends:\n\nAgain it is my pleasant duty to give an account of life at Coqualeetza during the first two months of the new term. By the end of the third week in September the school was filled so that class rooms and departments have gone on happily and satisfactorily in good time.\n\nThanksgiving was observed in due form. There were special delicacies in the dining room topped off with Pumpkin pie. On the Monday afternoon a picture show was given in the Assembly Hall and this was repeated in the evening for the girls and boys in the Preventorium. On Sunday we had as our special speaker, the Rev.J.H. White,D.D., who gave a fine message which was listened to with interest by each boy and girl.\n\nOn Saturday, October 21st, Founder's Day was observed with fitting ceremony. In the dining room the school Birthday Cake adorned with its fifty-one candles, was the centre of attraction. Little Doris and Betty Sepass, the youngest children in the school were too bashful to attempt to blow out the candles so Muriel Collinson and Myra Kelly were given the honor. After the Principal had set the knife into the cake, members of staff cut it up and served the boys and girls with generous pieces. Staff members too, received their piece, and staff and pupils alike voted it just right.\n\nOn Sunday evening, a unique service was held. Mrs.E.A.Wells, who was teacher and later Matron in the school, forty-six years ago, spoke to the boys and girls. With her on the platform were Mr.Wm.Newby, who fifty-one years ago remodelled the home of Rev. and Mrs.C.M. Tate to make room for a dozen Indian girls and boys who formed the first class in Coqualeetza, and Mrs.Harry Uslick and Dan Milo, who as children, were members of it. Other honored staff members and pupils of the school were Mr.C.M. Pearson, Farm Instructor forty-six years ago; Chief Albert and Mrs.Cooper and Mr.A. Lewis. It is doubtful if any other community in British Columbia can produce a like number of pupils and staff members who live within its boundaries after more than half a century. Mrs.Wells was very happy in her reminiscences. Just to show that boys were boys in those days, she told of a little chap coming to her one day crying and saying that the boys were teasing him. After a pause he said they had been calling him names. Well, surely that had not hurt him, but it evidently had, for he blurted out between sobs, \"they called me a Scotchman\" as we have several Scotch members of staff, the joke was enjoyed immensely. Mrs.Wells held the interest of young and old, and the service was clearly one which had definite influence for good upon all. The congregation of Carman United Church united with us for the occasion and the Rev.H.T. Allen, their pastor, and the Rev.J.H. White,D.D., took part in the service. Our fifty-first birthday will long remain a pleasant and helpful memory. None of those present will soon forget the impression which Mrs.Wells made as to the consecration of those pioneer workers, and their deep interest in the Indian people.\n\nOnce again we are indebted to the Department for an X-Ray Clinic. Dr.G.S. Kincaide, of the Provincial Chest Clinic, spent two days with us and all doubtful cases were either fluoroscoped or X-rayed. A splendid record of good health was shown in that out of 123 pupils examined, only one was found to have any active disease; one other had a touch of pleurisy and a third was simply in need of special care, but had no actual trouble of any kind. The fact that the Clinic was held so early in the term was much appreciated, and most fortunate in making possible proper treatment for the one case before any actual breakdown had taken place.\nhave discharged eight patients from the Preventorium this Fall. Two girls who had reached the age for discharge, went home and two girls and four boys came back again to school. These pupils are fit for normal life again, but will still receive extra care until they are back to vigorous health. In the \"Pre\" we have had for the past eight months, a teacher-nurse who lives each pupil instruction in classroom work so that they come back to school well up in their classes. She also teaches handicrafts and many interesting and useful articles are turned out, - caps, socks, sweaters, dresses, rugs and fancy work are made by the girls and the boys are becoming expert Totem Pole carvers. We greatly appreciate the honor which Coqualeetza has had in pioneering the work of healing boys and girls who had the beginnings of chest trouble, and feel that the money expended by the department has been a fine investment. Too much praise can not be given to the doctors who have advised this treatment and for the generous way the Indian Affairs Branch has co-operated with them. Miss Mackay who has been in charge of the \"Pre\" from the beginning, has made herself much beloved by the boys and girls who have been her patients. Not one of them but will be able to live in better health because of the training they have received. Mrs. Vance, who gives sewing instructions, has worked wonders with the children as a fitter helper with Miss Mackay in this very important work. A Graduate of the School is employed as assistant housekeeper and twenty girls each year receive practical training in the care of the sick. Thus in time, a force of intelligent trained young people will bring the good news of how to control and heal Tuberculosis to their home villages and show how it can be done.\n\nAnd now a word about Halloween. Who can think of Halloween without visions of black cats, witches, pumpkins with funny faces, yes and of pumpkins made into delicious pie? We had them all at Coqualeetza this year. In the assembly hall long ribbons of black and orange trailed from corner to corner and from light to light, and around the walls witches with peaked bonnets riding astride their broom sticks and black cats, looked down on happy boys and girls who filled the Hall with merry laughter for two days, afternoon and evening, as they carried through a programme of games and folk dances. The \"living alphabet\" was one of the best of the former. Girl and boy captains called out the \"letters\" to spell the words which were announced and the first side lined up to spell the word, correctly won.\n\nSoon it will be Remembrance Day when all the School will gather to pay tribute to the memory of those who laid down their lives in the Great War, and together we shall bow in silent prayer that God will help us to be worthy of their sacrifice, and He will overrule the present conflict to bring ever nearer His Kingdom, which is \"righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit\". Meantime, every one has settled down to work in earnest in Class Room and Departments, in Manual Training and Boat Building and in Navigation Classes, which begin this week in Junior and Senior divisions.\n\nWe often think of parents and friends, and do not forget to ask God's blessing upon them from day to day, as we gather for morning and evening prayers. As Staff and pupils, we shall do our best to work for all that is good and worthwhile in the opportunity which is ours in Coqualeetza.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C. Scott\nPRINCIPAL\n\nIndian Affairs.

C. Scott, B.A., for the principalship of the new Coqualeetza school at Alberni. I can see no objection whatever to the suggestion you make, that Mr. Scott be informed by you that the Government has accepted his nomination for the principalship of the new school.\n\nI am not in a position to state when the Minister is likely to arrive back from England.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nReverend R. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n298 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\nMy dear Dr. McGill:\n\nRe - Coqualeetza and Alberni\n\nThe Executive of the Board of Home Missions, at its meeting on Friday, November 24th, had before it once more the matter of the use of the buildings of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School for a tuberculosis sanatorium, together with the arrangements for rebuilding the school at Alberni and taking care of the children now in Coqualeetza at Alberni and in day schools up the British Columbia coast. After considerable discussion, the following resolution was unanimously adopted:\n\n\"Whereas The Indian Affairs Branch of The Department of Mines and Resources, in a letter from the Minister, Honorable T. A. Crear, dated February 21st, 1939, expressed a desire to take over the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, to be used as a tuberculosis sanatorium; and\n\n\"Whereas the Secretaries have reported that, as a result of interviews and correspondence with the officials of the Department, all the matters under discussion have been settled and the interests of the United Church safeguarded; and\n\n\"Whereas the Department is now erecting a new residential school at Alberni, which on completion is to be administered by the Board of Home Missions;\n\n\"The Executive resolves:\n\n(1) To give formal approval to the proposal of the Government;\n\n(2) To give the Secretaries power to carry on any further negotiations necessary with the Government in regard to the date of the closing of the Coqualeetza Residential School and the opening of the new school at Alberni, and any other questions in connection with the whole matter.\n\n(3) To nominate for the principalship of the Alberni Residential School the Rev. R. C. Scott, B.A., now Principal of Coqualeetza.\"\n\nMy colleagues and I are still of the opinion that it would be in the interests of all parties concerned that the first publicity given to these changes should be through a joint\nstatement from the Indian Affairs Branch of The Department of Mines and Resources and the Board of Home Missions of the United Church. We should be glad to have you consult with the Minister in regard to this as soon as he returns from Great Britain. If he should think that a joint statement is not wise, we would suggest as second best that a statement from both offices should be issued simultaneously - on the same date, if possible.\n\nWhile there is no immediate need of a statement such as I have suggested, we do not think it should be delayed too long. It would be fairer to Mr. Scott, and everyone else, if in the not too distant future we could inform him that the Government has accepted his nomination as Principal of the Alberni School. It would give him a chance to make plans, to consult with the Government officials and to visit Alberni in connection with the farm lands, the administration of which we are taking over from The Woman's Missionary Society.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nREG.MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nNo funds are provided in the main estimates for reconstruction and equipment of Squaleetza until suitable financial provision made. It is not certain that the project will be carried out. So far as I can see, any public statement would be premature, unless it should be considered as an undertaking that funds would be made available.\nOttawa,\nDecember 26, 1939.\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nRe: Coqualeetza and Alberni Residential Schools\n\nDr. McGill, to whom your letter of December 9 was addressed, is absent from his office and is not likely to return for a couple of weeks. May I, in his absence, acknowledge receipt of your communication and inform you that the Minister returned from England on December 24.

Deducting these 62 pupils from the 228 in Residence at Coqualeetza, there are left 166 to be cared for:\n   It is suggested that this be done as follows: ------\n   - To remain in the Preventorium --------------------- 17\n   - To be discharged as at Sept. 30th --------------- 6\n   - To be discharged June 30th to Sanatorium ----- 3 26\n   To be cared for by the Proposed new Residential School on the West Coast ------------------------ 140.\n\n4. To these must be added the following:\n   - From Ahousaht Residential School ----------------- 32\n   - From Albarni ------------------------------------ 27\n   Total to be provided for apart from other West children as listed below: ------------------------ 109.\n\n(Continued)\nProject 9. The erection of a one room Indian Day School with teacher's residence at CLO-005E in the West Coast Agency. There are between thirty and forty children of school age at this point for whom it will be difficult if not impossible to find accommodation in the proposed new Indian Residential School at or near Alberni. This school would be administered under United Church auspices.\n\nProject 10. The addition of a second classroom to the present Indian Day School at KISPIOX in the Babine Agency. This school is administered under the United Church of Canada. There are now far more children in attendance than can be taught at one time by the Missionary.\n\nProject 11. The erection of a new Indian Day School at HARTLEY BAY to provide increased accommodation and replace the very old school at that point. The present school is administered under the auspices of the United Church of Canada and the school is located in the Skeena River Agency. No residence would be required.\n\nProject 12. The erection of a new two room Indian Day School without teachers' residence at HAZELTON to replace the present overcrowded school conducted in an Anglican hall. This school should not be under the auspices of any one Church as Anglicans, Roman Catholics and Salvation Army children attend. The school is in the Babine Agency.\n\nFiscal Year 1941-42\n\nProject 13. The erection of a one room Indian Day School on one of the Ohist Reserves on BARKLEY SOUND in the West Coast Agency. There would be some thirty to forty pupils if a suitable site was chosen for an eight month a year school. The people move mainly between two villages. Though most are members of the United Church of Canada there are some Roman Catholics and it is uncertain just which Church should suggest a teacher or administer the school. This could be decided later. There would not be sufficient room at the proposed Indian Residential School at Alberni for these people and they might not wish to attend such a school. They were much opposed to a school at Alberni when I made my survey of the Barkley Sound area. A teacher's residence would be required at this school.\n\nProject 14. The erection of a new Indian Day School at KITKATLA in the Skeena River Agency to replace a very old day school. No teacher's residence would be required. The teacher is the Anglican Missionary.\n\nProject 15. The erection on Indian Reserve of a new Indian Day School at Shalalth in the Lytton Agency to replace the very old log school, Seton Lake Indian Day School, at that point. This school would be under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. No teacher's residence would be needed.\n\nProject 16. The erection of a new Indian Day School, without teacher's residence at ENDERBY to accommodate the twenty to twenty five children without education at that point. This school would be under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church and would be in the Okanagan Agency.\n\nProject 17. The addition of a second classroom to the present Indian Day School at CAPE MUDGE in the Kwawkewlth Agency. The school is under the auspices of the United Church of Canada. There is a teacher's residence there now.\nFiscal Year 1942-43\n\nProject 18. The addition of a third classroom to the PORT SIMPSON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL to accommodate the increasing attendance and take some of the girls who will be discharged from the Crosby Girls' Home to make room for orphans and destitute cases from the North at that residential school. The third teacher could be accommodated at the school with little difficulty by making use of space above the suggested new room. The school is under United Church auspices and in the Skeena River Agency.\n\nProject 19. The addition of a second classroom at BELLA COOLA to accommodate the attendance which will by then be greatly increased at this point. No teacher's residence would be necessary. The school is under United Church auspices and in the Bella Coola Agency.\n\nProject 20. The erection of a new school on SEA BIRD ISLAND to take the place of the present school held in the council house. The school would not of necessity require a teacher's residence though this might be an advantage. It would be administered under the Roman Catholic Church and would be in the Lytton Agency.\n\nProject 21. The erection of a new school and teacher's residence at ROCHER DESGOULE to take the place of the present very old log building used as a schoolroom and for which rent is paid. This school is under the Roman Catholic Church auspices and in the Babine Agency.\n\nProject 22. The erection of a consolidated two or three room school with or without teachers' residence on the TSARTLIP Indian Reserve to absorb the present Tsartlip Indian Day School and accommodate the Roman Catholic and other children living on the Saanich Reserves. This school would be in the Cowichan Agency.\n\nOf the above projects those numbered 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 17, 18, and 19, are in a very definite way either the corollary of the absorption of Coqualeetza and Ahousaht and the late Alberni Indian Residential Schools into one new residential school, or their necessity has been greatly hastened by the changes contemplated by the Honorable Minister and Department.\n\nIn the case of the present small Indian Residential Schools at Kitamaat and Port Simpson, I consider that instructions might well be issued that deserving children and particularly orphans from the northern part of the Province who are not Catholic children should be given preference over local children who could very well attend the existing or proposed day schools.\n\nMuch care has been taken in making the above suggestions and many hours spent in thinking out the problems involved. It is hoped that this report may be of definite assistance to the officials of the Department. It is certainly submitted with respect and as a professional suggestion of what might well be done in the way of the erection of new schools and additional rooms during the next three or four years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have to refer to a Departmental letter from the Superintendent of Welfare and Training dated May 4th 1939 with reference to the future distribution of the pupils now attending Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, and in particular to the two final paragraphs of that letter.\n\nThe wishes of the Department were adhered to and conferences arranged with the Rev. R.C. Scott in my office on July 3rd and 6th, when the particulars surrounding the life of each child, home conditions, health etc., were discussed in detail.\n\nIt is with considerable pleasure that I am able to report that the Rev. R.C. Scott and I found little difficulty in reaching agreement on the suggested distribution of these Indian children. Our actual working papers are not being forwarded to the Department but placed on file in Vancouver should there be any need to consult these records in the future.\n\nI am forwarding herewith the Statement of Proposed Distribution of the children. Every child now at Coqualeetza has been dealt with and the disposal suggested in each case is the very best possible for the child. The statement is signed by the Reverend Principal, but I am of course in agreement with its contents, and suggest that such statement be considered the joint work of the Principal of Coqualeetza and myself.\n\nI would ask that the suggestions placed on Page 12 be considered in their relation to the below mentioned recommendations which include the needs of the various Agencies in British Columbia for the next four years, as such needs can be met by the erection of Indian day schools, or additions to existing day schools, or replacements.\n\nWhile I am well aware that it may not be found possible to carry out in its entirety the whole of the yearly building programme suggested here, my recommendations are made as a result of a fairly thorough knowledge of the conditions in the various villages and in direct response to Mr. Hoey's own suggestion, so that the Honorable the Minister will be able to see at a glance the locations where new schools or additions to schools are considered necessary from a professional point of view.\nRecommended Building Programme\n\nThe educational needs of the Indians in B.C. would be met by the following Building Programme which has been spread over the present and three succeeding Fiscal Years.\n\nThe various projects have been arranged in their relative order of importance, as far as this may be determined at the moment, and such a relative order may be applied to the projects suggested for each Fiscal Year as well as the more general order suggested by the year itself.\n\nFiscal Year 1939-40 (Present Year)\n\nProject 1. The erection of a two room Indian Day School with teachers' residence at GITLAKDAMIX in the Skeena River Agency. This school would be administered under the Anglican Church.\n\nProject 2. The erection of a four room consolidated Indian Day School without teachers' residence near DUNCAN in the Cowichan Agency. This school would be administered under the auspices of the Catholic Church. Cowichan Indian Day School would be absorbed.\n\nProject 3. The erection of a one room Indian Day School, with teacher's residence at BOOTROYD in the Lytton Agency. This school would replace the old Boothroyd Indian Day School, and be Anglican.\n\nProject 4. The addition of a second classroom to the present ALERT BAY Indian Day School to provide for the expected increased attendance to a total of about 80 in September-October 1939. This is an Anglican school. The second Division might be accommodated in a rented hall for the first year. Kwawkewlth Agency.\n\nProject 5. The authorization of the employment of a third teacher at the present MASSETT Indian Day School, where a room is available in the school building and could be fitted up at little cost. The school here operates on an eight months basis and is administered under Anglican auspices. Queen Charlotte Agency.\n\nFiscal Year 1940-41\n\nProject 6. The erection of a one room Indian Day School, without teacher's residence probably, at AHOUASHT, in the West Coast Agency. This school would be administered under the auspices of the United Church of Canada.\n\nProject 7. The addition of a second classroom to the present Indian Day School at KINCOLITH where there will be about sixty pupils in the winter of 1939 and eighty or more the following year. This is an Anglican school in the Skeena River Agency. A temporary hall might be used at first.\n\nProject 8. The erection of a new Indian Day School with a teacher's residence at KITAMAAT in the Bella Coola Agency. The present Indian Day School there is the property of the United Church of Canada and is crowded with the children from the Kitamaat Indian Residential School so that the village children do not get the attention they certainly deserve. The present school should be used exclusively for the children from the Kitamaat Indian Residential School of which it forms almost a part by being located on the same property. The children suggested to be returned to Kitamaat from Coqualeetza make the provision of a village school at Kitamaat very necessary.\nJanuary 12th,\n1940.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nYesterday we received a cheque from the Treasury Department, covering the grant to the Coqualeetza Residential School for the December quarter. This is the first amount received by us on account of grants to Indian residential schools for the quarter ended December 31st, 1939; and, as we have already advanced amounts totalling $25,000 to these schools for the year 1939, for which we have not been reimbursed by the Government, we should be grateful for anything you can do to hasten payment of the grants for the December quarter to all the schools under The United Church of Canada. This would facilitate bookkeeping on the part of the Treasurer, who will very shortly be closing his books for 1939.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have noted the contents of your letter and have directed that the payments due for the schools conducted under the auspices of the United Church be made as promptly as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDear Parents and Friends:\n\nOnce again it is time for our Mid-Winter letter telling of the school and its life since we last wrote. We began our Christmas activities early this year - December 13th - when 187 children were taken to Chilliwack in school buses and private cars to a special matinee showing \"The Wizard of Oz\", that great children's story. It was a wonderful experience for most of the girls and boys, and helped to create the spirit of Christmas. Just how well they remember what they saw was apparent to staff members for many a day afterwards, and came out at the time of our senior party later on.\n\nTerm examinations this year were pleasing to both teachers and pupils, and showed that the boys and girls were doing real work in their class rooms.\n\nChristmas decorations were, if anything, the best yet. Wall plaques made by the Manual Training class, gave interest and tone amid the long festoons of greenery which adorned the walls. At the front of the Assembly Hall stood a large Christmas tree resplendent in lights and ornaments. Over at the Preventorium, a smaller, but equally lovely tree awaited the coming of Santa Claus.\n\nIn the midst of such stimulating and cheery environment, the School Christmas Concert was given on December 19th. A cantata entitled \"When Santa forgot the South\" was presented, and the way in which the boys and girls took their respective parts gave great credit to the staff members who had spent time and energy in training them. In fact, the concert this year was declared by common consent to be the \"best yet\" and that is saying something, for Coquitlam concerts have always been good. The theme of the play made clear what fun and happiness there is in forgetting self and helping others less fortunate.\n\nDuring all the time, from Monday the 16th until Saturday the 23rd groups of pupils were taken by car into Chilliwack to see the Christmas windows, and to do a bit of shopping - a privilege long awaited. It was very gratifying to see how so many of the girls and boys thought of others in spending their money.\n\nAnd so the days passed until Christmas Eve, when long rows of stockings were hung on each side of the corridors outside the dormitories of the younger pupils. And strangely enough, some rather large and equally long stockings appeared, which rumour had it, were for staff members who still found delight in that fondly remembered act of Christmas Eve. Or was it the boys and girls who played tricks on them. Anyway, these stockings were there, let the truth be told, and it was a happy lot of boys and girls and their overlords who emptied their stockings with delight on Christmas morning, along with many an expression of happiness - and of course much that was just plain noise, but the sort that goes at Christmas and helps to make it what it is. This done presents were for the time being laid aside, or carried along secretly and the entire School gathered in the Assembly Hall at 7.30 for a short Christmas Service. The old Christmas hymns were sung with heartiness and the story of the first Christmas was read. A very brief address on the meaning of Christmas, especially in view of the war, laid emphasis on the Angel Song which has kept ringing on in spite of war and trouble and its music would still be gladdening the hearts of men when the guns had ceased their thunder and the nations would accept the Prince of Peace and lay the Government upon His shoulder\" who had redeemed them all. Prayer for our own King and Queen, our people and for all peoples, and especially for boys and girls away from home or who had lost their parents and homes owing to war, led all hearts in joint supplication for God's blessing and made a bit more real the meaning of Christmas.\n\nChristmas dinner was served at noon on Christmas Day. Every boy and girl sat down to the tables, and staff members waited upon them. Through a very well organized effort, heaping plates of turkey, vegetables and later of plum pudding were served, hot and lots of it. This is the first time I ever knew an Indian lad to say, with a rather sleepy sort of smile, \"No thanks, I've had enough\" when asked if he would have more turkey. After the children were finished, the staff sat down to their own dinner, and here again there was an abundance of good things for Christmas, and again more smiles and \"No thank you's\".\nAt 4 P.M., Santa Claus arrived, and this year was in a particularly happy mood. He walked up and down the laundry roof, just outside the Assembly Hall, so that every boy and girl could see that he had just \"arrived.\" After coming in, he gave a very nice little talk and distributed with the help of staff members, the many presents sent in by parents and friends, or given by the school, so that each boy and girl had something with which to remember his visit. Before he left he had the smaller boys and girls sing \"Away in a Manger\" for him, and now they did sing! I did wish that the parents could have heard them.\n\nAs New Years Day this year came on Monday, and the week previous had been a rather strenuous one, it was decided to hold the New Years parties on the 26th and 29th of December, leaving the week following New Years free for the resumption of classes.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon the Primaries had their party followed by the Intermediates the same evening. Next day, in the afternoon the Juniors had a good time together and then in the evening the Senior Party, always a masquerade at New Years, was held. The winners this year were voted to be better than those of the last, and the judges had a hard time deciding as to who were the winners in each class.\n\nAfter parading before the judges in the Assembly Hall, the entire party led by Principal and Mrs. Scott wound its way through corridors and up the stairs to the first floor. Here through delighted lines of children row upon row in nighties and pyjamas, the procession passed, first through the Girls' Side and then through the Boys' and down stairs again to the Assembly Hall. The judges, after further watching of the characters and their costumes, finally decided as follows.\n\nJob Paul as Stanley Livingstone, won first prize for the best dressed boy. Job had seen the picture, \"Stanley and Livingstone\" a few days before and he turned out in cap with gold braid, frock coat gray trousers, wing collar and bow tie, moustache and side burns, heavy eyebrows and with face wrinkles like Mr. Livingstone had, and in his hand a Bible held in the exact way the picture showed Livingstone to have held it when reading. From the picture Job had gleamed such sentences as \"I shall remain until my work is done; I shall remain if necessary until I die.\" Velma Pearson as the \"Outdoor Girl\" won first prize for the best dressed girl. Attired in skiing costume, she was easily a leader among the girls. To Chester Benson went first prize for the best comic costume. He reproduced the \"Scarecrow\" from the \"Wizard of Oz\" to perfection, even to the wobbly legs which refused to carry him at times; with straw sticking through his cap and from here and there in his clothing he well deserved the prize. Myrtle Gray, after a close race, was awarded the prize for the best comic costume among the girls. She appeared as a \"Chimney Sweep\" and particularly, as a girl from a place where they have no really big chimneys, she deserved credit for the correctness of her attire, even to the soot. In the most original class, Henry Paul as \"Carpenter\" drew first prize among the boys. Doubtless the greatest number of tools and the complete facial disguise helped a lot. Pauline Jones' attire, in a costume made from advertising, skirt, blouse, top hat and all, won general approval as first among the girls.\n\nThe remainder of the evening was spent in games and folk dances, and ended up with the usual fine supper at 10.30 P.M., after which \"Many thanks and good night\" was wished their host and hostess by each girl and boy before retiring.\n\nSunday evening, fitting New Years services were held, and the choir rendered appropriate selections. On Monday a grand New Years dinner was served at noon, and basket ball games enjoyed in the afternoon. A good picture show in the Assembly Hall brought the happy day to a close, and now for nearly two weeks, classes and departments have been under way. The health of the school is excellent, and the entire school is organized into four teams, the Ramblers, Royals, Rovers and Rangers, each one under captain and vice-captain intent on winning highest place.\n\nStaff and pupils join in wishing you each one, a very Happy New Year, and may much blessing attend you through all the days.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/TW\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 3)\nSo many letters are coming to hand, and there is so much uncertainty in the minds of many people about the change which will take place for Coqualeetza next September, that I feel a statement should be made about it.\n\nIn March, a year ago, the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources at Ottawa, which is responsible in all matters affecting the welfare of the Indian people, wrote to our Board of Home Missions, through its General Secretary, the Rev.R.B. Cochrane, D.D., asking that the School be given over to the Department for use as a Sanatorium for the care of Tuberculous Indians. This request was placed before the Home Missions Committee of the British Columbia Conference, of the United Church of Canada, by Dr.Cochrane that same month. A Committee was appointed, representing the Conference, the Presbytery, the Board of Home Missions, and the School through the Principal. A statement was prepared which was placed before the Board of Home Missions at its next meeting. The Home Missions Board appointed a Committee consisting of the Rev.Dr.Cochrane, the Rev.Dr.Dorey and Mrs.Loveys who represented the Woman's Missionary Society, and the Principal of the School. This Committee went to Ottawa and interviewed the Officials of the Department with regard to the proposal. During a very frank and earnest conversation between this Committee and the Departmental officers, answers were given to four leading questions which were proposed by our Committee, namely:\n\n1. Who was behind the request for the School for use as a Sanatorium?\n   To this the direct answer was made, that Dr.Stone, Director of Medical Services for the Department, was the one who was planning the change. Now everyone who knows anything at all about Dr.Stone, knows that he is heart and soul given up to planning and working for the betterment of the health of the Indian people, and that he is competent in every way to do this. Consequently our Committee felt that the proposal was genuinely directed to accomplish that much to be desired end and deserved serious consideration.\n\n2. Was it to be a bona fide Sanatorium, giving up to date scientific treatment, surgical and otherwise?\n   Here again the answer was a decided \"yes\".\n\n3. Who was to control the Institution?\n   The answer was that the Department would control it. This point has been further discussed in greater detail and the answer of the officials at Ottawa has been\nvery satisfactory. In other words, Coqualeetza will become a Government Sanitorium. Patients of every denomination will be admitted and will be given the best possible scientific medical care.\n\n4. What was to be done with the pupils now at Coqualeetza? As a result of the discussion of this point, the Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, Captain G.H. Barry, and the Principal of the School, were asked to go over the School Roll and make suggestions as to the disposal of the pupils now in school. A statement was prepared and submitted to the Board of Home Missions, the British Columbia Committee and to the Department at Ottawa. This report it was understood, was suggestive and would likely have to be gone over again by the time any change in the School might take place, as the pupilage was always changing from year to year. On the whole, the basis suggested was satisfactory both to the Church and to the Department.

Pupils now at Coqualeetza who have no Day School in their home village should be allowed to go to the new school at Alberni.\n\n3. Pupils now in Coqualeetza who had lost one or both parents or who had not good homes to go to, would, on the recommendation of their Indian Agent, be allowed to attend the new school, or some such residential school as might be agreed upon.\n\nWill all parents and guardians of pupils now in Coqualeetza, or who have children whom they think should be allowed to go to the new school at Alberni, please see their Indian Agent AT ONCE. Give him all the facts about your children and why you think they should be allowed to attend this school. This is the only way to get them in.\n\nFrom the foregoing I am sure it will be plain that our Church could not rightfully hinder the Department's desire to do something badly needed for the health of the Native people. Good health is the foundation of all that is worthwhile, and without it, education and natural ability are badly handicapped.

The committee felt, as did many\nIndividuals, the writer among them, that while it was a great sacrifice to give up a school with such a glorious history, and about which tender memories cling in hundreds of hearts, still progress could only be made through sacrifice. Consequently, our Church is glad to co-operate with the Department so that a larger benefit may come to the Native people. This move means too, that the Native people must do their share. There can be no more sending of children to residential schools just to be rid of the responsibility of caring for them at home. All parents who can do so, must see that their children attend the Day School regularly. Far too much indifference and easy going habits are to be found among our Native people in this respect. When the matter of attending school is concerned, many parents say, \"Oh, it is just whatever they want to do.\" That is utterly wrong, and very harmful to the children. It is the parent's duty to guide children and to enforce what is best for them. The Committee of the Church took great pains to tell the Department that Day Schools were not yet one hundred per cent effective, but it realized that further progress could only come where the Native people really got behind their Day School, and saw that the children got to school. Laziness and failure to get up in the morning in time to get the children off to school on the part of the parents is a rotten foundation on which to try to build a better village life.\n\nIn all cases where parents really cannot take care of their children, and where a child really needs the care of a residential school, it is felt the Department will make such care possible. The same is true where certain pupils show signs of being able to use higher education or where such pupils ought to have a chance at practical training which can best be given at a residential school. The writer has never been refused permission by the Department for such advanced training when he could set forth good reasons for its being provided. It should be said too, that the Department is planning more and better Day Schools as a part of this entire programme.\n\nIn the transfer from Coqualeetza to Alberni, the Principal and most of the staff will be included. Pupils will, in the new school, be under the care of the officials and teachers whom they have come to know and trust at Coqualeetza. The same care for them and the same interest in their welfare will continue at Alberni.\n\nLet each of us go forward in prayer and in loyalty to duty wherever the pathway may lead, knowing that any sacrifice made by the Church or by any person for another's good, will be used of God for much blessing. Coqualeetza has already shown what can be done to prevent and to cure Tuberculosis.

Cochrane, D.D., asking that the School be given over to the Department for use as a Sanitorium for the care of Tuberculous Indians. This request was placed before the Home Missions Committee of the British Columbia Conference, of the United Church of Canada, by Dr.Cochrane that same month. A Committee was appointed, representing the Conference, the Presbytery, the Board of Home Missions, and the School through the Principal. A statement was prepared which was placed before the Board of Home Missions at its next meeting. The Home Missions Board appointed a Committee consisting of the Rev.Dr.Cochrane, the Rev.Ir.Dorey and Mrs.Loveys who represented the Woman's Missionary Society, and the Principal of the School. This Committee went to Ottawa and interviewed the Officials of the Department with regard to the proposal. During a very frank and earnest conversation between this Committee and the Departmental officers, answers were given to four leading questions which were proposed by our Committee, namely:\n\n1. Who was behind the request for the School for use as a Sanitorium?\n   To this the direct answer was made, that Dr.Stone, Director of Medical Services for the Department, was the one who was planning the change. Now everyone who knows anything at all about Dr.Stone, knows that he is heart and soul given up to planning and working for the betterment of the health of the Indian people, and that he is competent in every way to do this. Consequently our Committee felt that the proposal was genuinely directed to accomplish that much to be desired end and deserved serious consideration.\n\n2. Was it to be a bona fide Sanitorium, giving up to date scientific treatment, surgical and otherwise?\n   Here again the answer was a decided \"yes\".\n\n3. Who was to control the Institution?\n   The answer was that the Department would control it. This point has been further discussed in greater detail and the answer of the officials at Ottawa has been\nvery satisfactory. In other words, Coqualeetza will become a Government Sanatorium. Patients of every denomination will be admitted and will be given the best possible scientific medical care.\n\n4. What was to be done with the pupils now at Coqualeetza? As a result of the discussion of this point, the Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, Captain G.H. Barry, and the Principal of the School, were asked to go over the School Roll and make suggestions as to the disposal of the pupils now in school.

The same is true where certain pupils show signs of being able to use higher education or where such pupils ought to have a chance at practical training which can best be given at a residential school. The writer has never been refused permission by the Department for such advanced training when he could set forth good reasons for its being provided. It should be said too, that the Department is planning more and better Day Schools as a part of this entire programme.\n\nIn the transfer from Coqualeetza to Alberni, the Principal and most of the staff will be included. Pupils will, in the new school, be under the care of the officials and teachers whom they have come to know and trust at Coqualeetza. The same care for them and the same interest in their welfare will continue at Alberni.\n\nLet each of us go forward in prayer and in loyalty to duty wherever the pathway may lead, knowing that any sacrifice made by the Church or by any person for another's good, will be used of God for much blessing. Coqualeetza has already shown what can be done to prevent and to cure Tuberculosis. Will you, as parents and friends, follow her now in this bigger attack upon this terrible foe of both Native and White peoples.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/BW\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nThank you for your kind enquiry as to my health in the last paragraph of your letter of April 29th last. In reply I am pleased to say that I got a good report from Dr. New the specialist at Mayo Clinic who has been in charge of my case. I told him that folks in our part of the country thought that when a man had to go Mayos, it meant he was about done for, just as folk generally thought of having to go to a Hospital in the early days. I explained that it was not fair either to the church or to the Department to allow some statement on my prospects of health, to be delayed too long.\n\nDr. New then said in answer to three definite questions which I put before him in writing:\n\n1. There was nothing malignant about the throat condition which has been troubling me, and never had been.\n2. That my voice would, in the end be as good as before, \"if not better.\"\n3. That the condition was a most persistent one, comparable to some extent to \"twitch grass\" in a field. He said that there was \"not half, no not one quarter the trouble there this time that there was the last time\" but added immediately after saying that he thought \"this time was going to fix me up\", that he wanted to see it again in a month's time.\n\nThat is disappointing, but I see nothing else but go through with it especially after getting such an encouraging report, and after having gone to expense of time and means thus far. I do hope that this will be the finish of indicated treatment, and that I shall, by the end of the school term or before, be able to talk again somewhat normally.\n\nI shall ....\nI shall lay plans from now on, to go down about May 24th, and shall be back before Sports Day, the main event before School Closing. Last time I was eight days in Hospital and 5 days in the hotel before he would allow me to come back. This time I was only 5 days in Hospital, and only one day in the hotel after discharge. Thus, I hope to be down and back with a minimum of time this next time. Conditions at the school are very good, and I trust that it will be alright for me to go down once more in accordance with the wishes of my Physician.\n\nRegretting very much the loss of time, and thanking you again for your interest and assistance, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\"R. C. Scott\"\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nP.S. I am today notifying Mr. Hoey as in this letter re my health etc.\n\"R.C.S.\"\nOttawa, May 6, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the first instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIt was to me and to the officials here very gratifying to learn that your throat condition is gradually improving and that it would appear at this date that you are well on your way to complete recovery again. It is regrettable, of course, that you have to visit Rochester again. I am personally of the opinion, however, that you should visit the clinic again and have the specialist in charge of your case pass final judgment upon your condition. You will of course communicate with Inspector MacKay and the Indian Agent, informing them that you have secured departmental approval for another visit to Rochester.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend R. C. Scott,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Residential School,\nSardis, B.C.\nCoqualeetza Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R.C SCOTT, B.A.\n\nSardis, B.C., May 1st, 1940.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI returned from Rochester Minn. yesterday morning and have been hard at work trying to get correspondence caught up.\n\nI am glad to say that I was only 5 days in Hospital this time and 1 day in the Hotel, as compared with 8 days in Hospital and five days in Hotel last time.\n\nI also brought away a good report. I told Dr. New that when a man had to go to Mayo's, up in our country he was thought to be done for; very much the same as folk used to think of the reason one went to Hospital, when Hospitals were first opened.\n\nI told him it was unfair both to the church and to the Department of Indian Affairs to go much longer without a definite decision on the condition of my throat.\n\nHe said, in answer to three definite questions which I wrote down for him:\n\n1. There definitely was no malignancy, and never was, but a very stubborn sort of inflammation of the chords.\n\nHe also said that there was not \"one half, no not one quarter of the trouble there this time as compared with the first time\" I went down.\n\n2. He said that my voice \"would be as good as ever, if not better\", and that I would be able to talk again.\n\n3. He also said that he wanted to see me the middle of this month again, or in one month after this last time.\n\nThis latter was a disappointment, but since they have no equipment for handling such cases in Vancouver, what else can I do?\n\nConsequently, I shall prepare from now on for another trip, which I trust will be the last one, and try to be back in good time before our annual Sports Day, which will be toward the end of the first week in June.\n\nI make all arrangements ahead for financial and other oversight, and things have gone very well. I am deeply indebted to members of Staff who have stepped into the breach nobly. Mr. Peake has been a member of staff for over 13 years, and knows the work and is thoroughly reliable. He takes over for me.\n\nI trust this will be agreeable to you. I have already written\nCommissioner MacKay, and am writing Mr Daunt today also.\n\nDr New told me the morning after the second operation that he thought \"this time\" was going to fix me up. He added immediately \"but I want to see you in a month's time\".\n\nIt was the difficulty, being a mere layman, in reconciling these two statements, along with the number of cancer of the Larynx cases, which made me feel I simply must get a decision on my case. I had three such cancer cases in the same room with me in the five days I was in Hospital, and it rather got on my nerves.\n\nDr New said that the condition might be likened to \"twitch grass\" in a field, stubborn but definitely not malignant. He had said the very first time, that there was \"nothing bad\" found when they operated, but the presence of these cases in such apparent numbers made me wish for a plain statement.\n\nI appreciate greatly the willingness of the Department and the Board of Home Missions to allow me these unavoidable leaves of absence. My general health has improved vastly since the first operation, and I am feeling fit apart from my voice. This however, I shall not use until I am given permission by Dr New. I explained the need for being able to talk if I am to assume the duties of the new school, and carry this one to a successful conclusion, and he gave me to understand that I would be well able to do so. Consequently I shall hope to make a final trip, leaving here about the 24th of the month, and getting back just as fast as physically possible.\n\nThe diagnosis this time was \"Contact ulcer\" instead of \"Laryngeal Tumor\" as it was the last time. This in itself showed an improvement.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nSo many letters are coming to hand, and there is so much uncertainty in the minds of many people about the change which will take place for Coqualeetza next September, that I feel a statement should be made about it.\n\nIn March, a year ago, the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources at Ottawa, which is responsible in all matters affecting the welfare of the Indian people, wrote to our Board of Home Missions, through its General Secretary, the Rev.R.B. Cochrane, D.D., asking that the School be given over to the Department for use as a Sanitorium for the care of Tuberculous Indians. This request was placed before the Home Missions Committee of the British Columbia Conference, of the United Church of Canada, by Dr.Cochrane that same month. A Committee was appointed, representing the Conference, the Presbytery, the Board of Home Missions, and the School through the Principal. A statement was prepared which was placed before the Board of Home Missions at its next meeting. The Home Missions Board appointed a Committee consisting of the Rev.Dr.Cochrane, the Rev.Dr.Dorey and Mrs.Loveys who represented the Woman's Missionary Society, and the Principal of the School. This Committee went to Ottawa and interviewed the officials of the Department with regard to the proposal. During a very frank and earnest conversation between this Committee and the Departmental officers, answers were given to four leading questions which were proposed by our Committee, namely:\n\n1. Who was behind the request for the School for use as a Sanitorium?\n   To this the direct answer was made, that Dr.Stone, Director of Medical Services for the Department, was the one who was planning the change. Now everyone who knows anything at all about Dr.Stone, knows that he is heart and soul given up to planning and working for the betterment of the health of the Indian people, and that he is competent in every way to do this. Consequently our Committee felt that the proposal was genuinely directed to accomplish that much to be desired end and deserved serious consideration.\n\n2. Was it to be a bona fide Sanitorium, giving up to date scientific treatment, surgical and otherwise?\n   Here again the answer was a decided \"yes\".\n\n3. Who was to control the Institution?\n   The answer was that the Department would control it. This point has been further discussed in greater detail and the answer of the officials at Ottawa has been\nvery satisfactory. In other words, Coqualeetza will become a Government Sanatorium. Patients of every denomination will be admitted and will be given the best possible scientific medical care.\n\n4. What was to be done with the pupils now at Coqualeetza? As a result of the discussion of this point, the Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, Captain G.H. Barry, and the Principal of the School, were asked to go over the School Roll and make suggestions as to the disposal of the pupils now in school. A statement was prepared and submitted to the Board of Home Missions, the British Columbia Committee and to the Department at Ottawa. This report it was understood, was suggestive and would likely have to be gone over again by the time any change in the School might take place, as the pupilage was always changing from year to year. On the whole, the basis suggested was satisfactory both to the Church and to the Department. Further, the Department agreed that if our Church would give them Coqualeetza for use as a Sanatorium, a school for 200 pupils would be built at Alberni. This School is now in process of erection.\n\nWho would be allowed to go to the new school? The main features of the proposed settlement of pupils now in Coqualeetza were as follows.\n\n1. Pupils having good homes and who have a Day School in their home village, should go home and attend Day School.\n\n2. Pupils now at Coqualeetza who have no Day School in their home village should be allowed to go to the new school at Alberni.\n\n3. Pupils now in Coqualeetza who had lost one or both parents or who had not good homes to go to, would, on the recommendation of their Indian Agent, be allowed to attend the new school, or some such residential school as might be agreed upon.\n\nWill all parents and guardians of pupils now in Coqualeetza, or who have children whom they think should be allowed to go to the new school at Alberni, please see their Indian Agent AT ONCE. Give him all the facts about your children and why you think they should be allowed to attend this school. This is the only way to get them in.\n\nFrom the foregoing I am sure it will be plain that our Church could not rightfully hinder the Department's desire to do something badly needed for the health of the Native people. Good health is the foundation of all that is worthwhile, and without it, education and natural ability are badly handicapped. Authorities state that the death rate from Tuberculosis among the Native people can be cut in half within a very few years by proper methods and cure. The committee felt, as did many\nIndividuals, the writer among them, that while it was a great sacrifice to give up a school with such a glorious history, and about which tender memories cling in hundreds of hearts, still progress could only be made through sacrifice. Consequently, our Church is glad to co-operate with the Department so that a larger benefit may come to the Native people. This move means too, that the Native people must do their share. There can be no more sending of children to residential schools just to be rid of the responsibility of caring for them at home. All parents who can do so, must see that their children attend the Day School regularly. Far too much indifference and easy going habits are to be found among our Native people in this respect. When the matter of attending school is concerned, many parents say, \"Oh, it is just whatever they want to do.\" That is utterly wrong, and very harmful to the children. It is the parent's duty to guide children and to enforce what is best for them. The Committee of the Church took great pains to tell the Department that Day Schools were not yet one hundred per cent effective, but it realized that further progress could only come where the Native people really got behind their Day School, and saw that the children got to school. Laziness and failure to get up in the morning in time to get the children off to school on the part of the parents is a rotten foundation on which to try to build a better village life.\n\nIn all cases where parents really cannot take care of their children, and where a child really needs the care of a residential school, it is felt the Department will make such care possible. The same is true where certain pupils show signs of being able to use higher education or where such pupils ought to have a chance at practical training which can best be given at a residential school. The writer has never been refused permission by the Department for such advanced training when he could set forth good reasons for its being provided. It should be said too, that the Department is planning more and better Day Schools as a part of this entire programme.\n\nIn the transfer from Coqualeetza to Alberni, the Principal and most of the staff will be included. Pupils will, in the new school, be under the care of the officials and teachers whom they have come to know and trust at Coqualeetza. The same care for them and the same interest in their welfare will continue at Alberni.\n\nLet each of us go forward in prayer and in loyalty to duty wherever the pathway may lead, knowing that any sacrifice made by the Church or by any person for another's good, will be used of God for much blessing. Coqualeetza has already shown what can be done to prevent and to cure Tuberculosis.

He assures me that if they decide to take it off, it will be a simple operation compared with the first one, and that they may decide that nothing further is required, but he wishes me to go in order to be sure.\nDr. New, the Throat Specialist at Mayos told me before I left that it was possible a \"knob\" might be left which would have to come off and that he would like to see me about the 15th of April.\nIn looking over the letter from Dr. Cochrane in this connection I note that he said I was to go back again if it proved necessary. I presume that you will be agreeable to this. I shall make the same arrangements for the conduct of the school as before, and am sure everything will go along alright.\nI am hoping to get clear of this trouble so as to be ready for the extra work which always begins to come in connection with the school as 24th of May and final closing time draws near. Hence, I would like to leave on Monday night next, and shall be back just as soon as I can possibly do so.\nEverything is going well at school just now, apart from some sore throats which seem this year to have hit the Staff. The health of the children has been remarkably good.\nTaking you in anticipation, and advising you that I have already informed Commissioner MacKay, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The general belief here amongst the officials is that the Alberni school should be completed and ready for operation in September and that sufficient funds will be secured from the 1940-41 estimates to undertake the necessary repairs and alterations at Coqualeetza. These are simply our thoughts, of course. We have received no definite assurances from the Minister along these lines, and, in view of the dissolution of Parliament, even the Minister himself is not in a position to make any definite promises at this date. In any event, I think you would be well advised to send a man over to Alberni, with the object of having him start a reasonably well balanced farm program for the year. If by any chance the school does not open in September, I am of the opinion that you could dispose of the farm products at a price that would enable you to escape any loss on the transaction. You might communicate with me again later in respect to having this man superintend the levelling and terracing of the grounds, immediately adjoining the school itself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn conversation with Major MacKay, Commissioner for Indian Affairs for B.C., yesterday when on a visit to the School, I mentioned the fact that I was planning to send a farmer over to Alberni at the end of this month, and asked him if he thought I were wise in doing so. He said that he could not advise me definitely that the new school would be completed, and asked me to write you saying that he had advised my doing so.\n\nI know perfectly well that much hinges upon the attitude of the new Parliament toward the entire scheme, but as one school, at least will have to be run, it would be a matter of choice as to which one would be conducted. Of course, if funds are not forthcoming for both the \"San\" and the School, it might be less expense just to allow the new school to wait, and keep on operating this building as a School. Doubtless all this is within the purview of the Department officials.\n\nYou will see, however, that if a decision is made rather suddenly to open up over at Alberni, and I have made no provision for hay, grain, or supplies (garden), it would be a bit awkward, not to say expensive, to have to buy everything of that kind, or even to have to freight it over from here, which would be next best.\n\nI could, of course, send a man over anyway, and all that was raised would be to the good, especially in view of war necessities. I did not like to do this without informing you of my intention.\n\nWhile not in the least intending this letter as even a suggestion that the Department take any responsibility in such a venture, still if you could give me any lead as to the chances of our moving or not, it would be helpful to me in deciding what ought to be done.\n\nThe whole question of the farm here, and the produce from same, will have to be taken up later. Meantime as we are all organized here for work, I am going ahead and shall crop this place, but leave off such items as tomatoes, for instance, which would not be harvested until after the student body returned, in September, and they might not be here. Grain and potatoes will be put in as usual, also garden stuff.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention to this, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nOttawa, February 19, 1940.\n\nRe: Cocualeetza and Alberni Indian Residential Schools.\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 16th instant and also a statement submitted by you to the Press, attached thereto.\n\nThis statement appears to be a very satisfactory Press notice of the changes contemplated at Cocualeetza and Alberni and, as such, is satisfactory to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 3)\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nAnnouncement was made today by Rev. Dr. R. B. Cochrane, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, that the Coqualeetza Residential school at Sardis, B.C., will be turned back to the government to be used in the future as a sanitarium for tuberculosis patients. The building has been used by the United Church of Canada as a school for 200 Indian children. The change was made at the request of the government who are seeking to eradicate tuberculosis from Indians.\n\nAssurance has been given by the Canadian Indians Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources that accommodation for the majority of children now being educated at Coqualeetza would be provided in a new enlarged Government school at Alberni (to take the place of the school burned there two years ago.) This new school is now under construction.\n\nThe Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, after consultation with church officials and other interested parties in B.C., and after prolonged negotiations with the Department of Mines and Resources, has accepted the proposal of the government, whose approval has been given to the issuing of this statement.\n\nRev. R. C. Scott, B.A., now principal at Coqualeetza, who for many years was in charge of the mission boat \"Thomas Crosby\", has been appointed to the principalship of the new Alberni school.\nNEW WESTMINSTER, B.C.\nFebruary 13th, 1940.\n\nSIR:-\n\nThe Reverend R.C. Scott, Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, has had an affection of the throat for some time, and which does not respond to local medical treatment.\n\nHe has been ordered to Mayo Brothers, Rochester, for examination and treatment, which is expected to take about two weeks.\n\nMr. Scott requests permission to proceed as indicated, leaving on the 16th, and to be absent until approximately the 3rd of March. He proposes leaving Mr. Peake, of the School Staff, in charge, during his absence.\n\nMr. Scott has taken the matter up with the Indian Commissioner and myself, and I am instructed by Major MacKay that he is satisfied Mr. Scott should go for this treatment. I would also recommend this action.\n\nIf you concur, will you be good enough to telegraph your permission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMAJOR D M MACKAY\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER\nVANCOUVER B C\n\nPLEASE ADVISE REVEREND R C SCOTT THAT HE MAY HAVE THE SICK LEAVE WHICH HE REQUIRES\n\nR A HOEY\n\nPhoned to: 6 Time: 12.30\nPhoned by: Indian Affairs\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nI am writing from Vancouver and I have had a bit of a shock.\n\nFor some months I have been taking throat treatments from Dr Gordon Large of this city. The first time he operated was last July, when he removed what he called a Singer's \"Node\" from my larynx. It healed pretty well, but left what he called rough edges, which he took off two weeks ago last Saturday.\n\nI saw him again last evening, and he told me that if he were I, he would go at once to the Mayo Clinic. He said that although the \"node\" was not \"malignant,\" still \"something\" was keeping the chord from healing. He said that none of the throat men in Vancouver had the instruments to do more than he had done, and that the only thing was for to go as soon as possible, to the above clinic. He said he would write the doctor whom he wished me to see, and that he would ask that I be \"put through\" as quickly as possible. He said, I would not need to be away for more than \"a couple of weeks.\"\n\nConsequently I came in this afternoon and have seen both Mr Daunt and the Commissioner. Commissioner McKay said he had no authority to grant me leave, but that he strongly recommended it be granted and asked me to write you as I am doing and ask that you wire me permission to be absent from the School for two, or if necessary three weeks.\n\nIt is quite a shock to be advised as above, especially now when I wanted to be able to carry on during the proposed change in the status of the School. Dr Large seemed to think that if I had the proper attention right away, it would be possible for me to do so. Hence my letter.\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you would wire Mr Daunt permission for me to go, as I would like to leave on Friday night.\n\nI shall place Mr Peake, our Boys' Overseer, in charge. He has been at the school for more than ten years, and is thoroughly competent to carry on. Miss Wilson will co-operate in the office, and things will go on well I am sure. I have been away as long as the time proposed, several times, when visiting reserves in the interest of the School and of graduates.\n\nHoping you will grant the permission, and thanking you in anticipation,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nOttawa, February 8, 1940.\n\nRe: Cocualeetza and Alberni Indian Residential Schools\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you discuss the advisability of issuing a statement to the Press with respect to the operation of the above noted institutions.\n\nI may state by way of explanation that, immediately following your visit to the Department a few weeks ago, a statement was prepared by Doctor Stone and myself and sent forward to the office of the Minister for review by the officials there. I understand the statement was read by the Minister but that before a decision was reached Parliament dissolved and the Minister himself was called upon to leave hurriedly for the West. This morning, however, I have been in touch with Mr. Jackson and read to him the statement prepared by you and enclosed with your communication. Mr. Jackson can see no objection whatever to the issuance of this statement. I am myself of the opinion that the statement covers the policy of both the Government and the United Church with respect to the institutions very fully and should be entirely satisfactory for the purpose we have in mind.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend Robert B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\nFebruary 3rd,\n1940.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYou will remember that when I was in Ottawa a few weeks ago, I discussed with you, and also with Mr. Crerar, the desirability of an announcement being made simultaneously by the Government and by The Board of Home Missions of The United Church of Canada in regard to the Coqualeetza and Alberni situation. I understood both Mr. Crerar and yourself to agree that my proposal was a reasonable one. I have, however, heard nothing from either of you since in regard to the matter.\n\nI am enclosing a draft of what I think might be the kind of brief statement to be issued. I should be glad if you would let me know what the Department thinks about issuing something of this kind at the same time as it is given to the press by our office.\n\nI suppose it might meet the situation - and perhaps it is the quickest way to get action - if your Department were to send me a letter, authorizing us to make such a statement as I am sending with this letter. I might then add a sentence to the effect that the statement is issued after authorization has been secured from the Department.\n\nWill you be good enough to give your personal attention to this at the earliest possible moment. The Board of Home Missions has taken over, as you know, the administration of the Alberni property, and also of the School, from The Woman's Missionary Society, and Mr. Scott will have to visit Alberni in the very near future. We think that this statement ought to be given publicity before he goes, so that everyone will understand that he is there as the new Principal.\n\nThanking you for your co-operation in this and all other matters in connection with Indian education,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC.MLT\n\nEnc.\nSUGGESTED STATEMENT RE COQUALEETZA\nto be issued simultaneously by the Government\nand The Board of Home Missions of The United\nChurch of Canada\n\nIn connection with its fight against tuberculosis, The Indian Affairs Branch of The Department of Mines and Resources more than a year ago approached The Board of Home Missions of The United Church of Canada, with the request that the Coqualeetza Residential School at Sardis, B.C., be turned over to the Government, to be used in the future as a sanitarium. Assurance was given that accommodation for the majority of the children now being educated at Coqualeetza would be provided in a new, enlarged residential school at Alberni (to take the place of the one which was burned there two years ago), and that the rest could be placed in improved day schools or additions to existing schools at various points up the Pacific coast.\n\nAfter consultation with church officials and other interested parties in British Columbia, and after prolonged negotiations with the Department, the Board of Home Missions of the United Church has recently accepted the proposal of the Government.\n\nThe Alberni School is now in course of erection and will be ready for use at the opening of the fall term. The Government, on the nomination of the United Church, has appointed to the principalship of the new Alberni School the Rev. R. C. Scott, B.A., now the Principal at Coqualeetza, who was for many years in charge of the mission boat, \"Thomas Crosby.\"\nSTATEMENT by Mr. R.H. Carter, Farm Instructor, Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nInspector Barry. I have been instructed to investigate certain reports with reference to the alleged ill-treatment of children at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nI wish to warn you that your statements will be taken down in writing. They will then be read to you, and you will be given the opportunity to satisfy yourself that what has been written is what you said. You will then be asked to sign the statement. Is that satisfactory?\n\nMr. Carter. Yes.\n\nQuestion. (Inspector Barry) What is your name?\nAnswer. (Mr. Carter) Raymond Henry Carter.\n\nQues. What is your address?\nAns. Sardis, B.C.\n\nInspector Barry. One matter to be investigated is your alleged treatment of an Indian boy, Joe Hans.\n\nQues. Do you remember a certain night in March when there was some trouble with Joe?\n\nAns. Yes.\n\nQues. Were you on duty that night?\nAns. Yes.\n\nQues. What did your duty consist of?\nAns. The general control of the boys before prayers.\n\nQues. What happened that night?\nAns. I was trying to line the boys up to go into prayers. The custom is to line the boys up in two rows. I gave the order for them to fall in two deep. They were slow. I tried to hustle them into place. While I was doing this practically everything that I said was mimicked by Joe Hans and Henry Paul, two senior boys. I asked\nthem to be quiet, several times. They paid no attention to me at all, so I told Joe that if he would not keep quiet, I should have to take measures to make him keep quiet. He said, \"Do you think you can do it?\" I said, \"Yes\", and then I slapped at him.\n\nQues. Did you tell Joe that you would make him hit the dust?\nAns. No.\n\nQues. Did Joe dodge your slap?\nAns. Yes.\n\nQues. Did you fall on the ground?\nAns. Yes, I lost my balance and fell on my hands.\n\nQues. What did Joe do?\nAns. He ran upstairs.\n\nQues. When did you next see Joe?\nAns. I saw Joe after prayers, sitting in the window of the Senior Teacher's class-room.\n\nQues. What did you do next?\nAns. I was outside on the fire-escape, and Joe slammed the window shut and put the night latch on. Mr. McLaughlin, the Senior Teacher, told Joe to open the window, which he did. I then told Joe to come up to Mr. Peake's, (the Boys' Supervisor) office.\n\nQues. Did Joe follow you?\nAns. Yes.\n\nQues. What happened then?\nAns. I reasoned with him, and Joe admitted that he was wrong and that he deserved a strapping. I gave him six straps on his seat.\n\nQues. Did you have Joe remove his pants?\nAns. Yes.\n\nQues. Did you strap Joe on his bare seat?\nAns. No. He was wearing underclothes.\n\nQues. With what did you strap Joe?\nAns. I used a strap that is kept in Mr. Peake's office.\n\nQues. Was this strap a piece of harness or trace?\nAns. It might be. I could not swear to it. I do not know where it came from.\nQues. Is the punishment you describe the common form of punishment administered in the School towards the boys?\nAns. I do not know what the other members of the staff do, but that is what I used.\n\nQues. (Captain Scott) Is that the only form of punishment given to the boys in the School?\nAns. No.\n\nQues. (Captain Scott) Are other forms of punishment used before strapping is resorted to?\nAns. Yes.\n\nQues. (Inspector Barry) Have you given corporal punishment to the boys of the School on other occasions?\nAns. Yes.\n\nQues. Have you made the boys take their pants down when you strapped them?\nAns. Only on one other occasion.\n\nQues. How long have you been employed as Farm Instructor at the School?\nAns. I have been in charge of the Farm department for some two years. Before that I was Assistant to Captain Peary, Farm Instructor, for about a year and a half.\n\nQues. Since you have been in charge of the farm, how many times have you punished boys in the way you describe?\nAns. Just twice.\n\nQues. Are you permitted to give corporal punishment to the boys without first referring the case to the Principal?\nAns. No.\n\nQues. Did you refer this case of Joe Hans to the Principal?\nAns. No. The Principal was not here.\n\nQues. Did you refer the case to the Acting Principal and Boys' Supervisor, Mr. Peake?\nAns. Yes.\n\nQues. Did Mr. Peake give you permission to punish Joe Hans?\nAns. Yes. He added, \"Now is a good time to do it.\"\n\nQues. Have you ever punished boys by having them eat soap?\n\nAns. No.\n\nQues. From your knowledge have you ever known the eating of soap to be used as a punishment in the School?\n\nAns. No.\n\nInspector Barry. Mr. Carter, it is only fair to you to permit you to make any statement you wish. This will, of course, be taken down and added to the record.\n\nQues. Was Cecil Perkins, Assistant Farm Instructor, at Coqualeetza from about February 1st to the end of March, 1940?\n\nAns. No. He was here only during the month of February.\n\nQues. Was Mr. Perkins in the Coqualeetza boys' basement playroom at the time of the Joe Hans incident?\n\nAns. No.\n\nQues. Are you quite sure that Mr. Perkins was not present?\n\nAns. No. He was not present.\n\nStatement from Mr. Carter.\n\nI consider Mr. Cecil Perkins was a highly unsatisfactory farm assistant. He neither did his work properly nor did he attend to his team. He often told the boys stories during hours of work, and thereby interfered with the progress of the farm work. Mr. Perkins told me that he would have to get a strap for the boys up in the dormitory over the Manual Training shop, of which dormitory he was in charge. A few days later he told me that he had a good one.\n\nQues. Do you wish to add anything with regard to your own treatment of the boy Joe Hans?\n\nAns. Yes.\nStatement. Joe Hans had previous to the incident mentioned threatened to give me a licking. He is a big boy of about sixteen years of age, and has been very annoying all the year.\n\nI feel that I should not have attempted to slap Joe on that occasion in the basement.\n\nR.H. Carter\n\nWitness.\nSTATEMENT by Mr. E. Peake, Boys' Supervisor, Cequmleetza Indian Residential School.\n\nInspector Barry. I have been instructed to investigate certain reports with reference to the alleged ill-treatment of children at the Cequmleetza Indian Residential School.\n\nI wish to warn you that your statements will be taken down in writing. They will then be read to you, and you will be given an opportunity of satisfying yourself that what has been written is what you said. You will then be asked to sign the statement. Is that satisfactory?\n\nMr. Peake. Yes.\n\nQues. What is your name?\nAns. Edward Peake.\n\nQues. What is your address?\nAns. Sardis, B.C.\n\nQues. What are your duties?\nAns. I am the Boys' Supervisor. I have held this position for five years. Previously I was in charge of the gardens.\n\nQues. Do you remember trouble occurring between Mr. Carter and Joe Hans one evening last March?\nAns. Yes, but I do not remember the date.\n\nQues. On that occasion were you in charge of the School?\nAns. I do not remember. I was in charge of the School during the absence of Mr. Scott, but I do not remember the date of the incident.\n\nQues. Did you give Mr. Carter permission to administer corporal punishment to Joe Hans?\nAns. I do not remember. If this was the incident that happened at prayer time, I did not give any permission, as I was out.\n\nQues. Did Mr. Carter ask you for permission to punish Joe Hans on that occasion?\nAns. No.\n\nQues. Are you quite sure he did not ask you for permission?\nAns. Yes. I am quite sure he did not.\n\nQues. Is it part of your duty to administer corporal punishment to the boys?\n\nAns. Yes.\n\nQues. Have you on occasion administered corporal punishment to a boy without first obtaining permission from the Principal?\n\nAns. Yes.\n\nQues. If corporal punishment is administered to a boy, what instrument is used?\n\nAns. A strap which has been used at the School for many years.\n\nQues. Is the strap mentioned by you a regular rubber school strap?\n\nAns. No. It is a leather strap, about 18 inches long, about 1\u00bd inches wide and not more than half an inch thick.\n\nQues. Is this strap a harness strap or part of a trace?\n\nAns. No.\n\nQues. Have you ever punished boys by having them eat soap?\n\nAns. No.\n\nQues. To your knowledge has such a punishment ever been given at Cequaleetza?\n\nAns. No.\n\nQues. Are you quite sure that such a punishment has not been given?\n\nAns. Quite sure. It has, however, been the custom for many years to require boys who use foul language to wash out their mouths with soap and water. There was an occasion early this year, when certain boys had been instructed to wash their mouths out. Among these boys was one new boy. The others, as a joke, suggested to him that he would have to bite a piece of soap off and chew it. He came to me with the soap in his mouth. I immediately told him to spit it out, and assured him that the boys had been playing a joke on him and that, of course, he did not have to eat it. He did not eat it.\nQues. Did you ever warn Cecil Perkins against making statements to Departmental officials, with regard to matters at the School?\nAns. No. When Mr. Perkins' time was up, during the absence of the Principal, Mr. Scott, and while I was acting as Principal, I received permission to re-hire him for another month. When I asked him if he would stay, he requested an increase in salary, which I declined, as I had no authority. Mr. Perkins told me that he could cause a lot of trouble by talking. I told him that only a person with a small mind would think of such a thing, and that the Departmental officials would be too broad-minded to consider such things. He did not state what he proposed to say to them. Our conversation was quite friendly throughout.\n\nQues. Did you tell Mr. Perkins that those who carry tales to the Departmental officials make more trouble for themselves?\nAns. No.\n\nQues. Did you tell Mr. Perkins that the Department realized that they were producing results and were satisfied to continue?\nAns. No.\n\nQues. Was Mr. Perkins' work satisfactory when he was on duty in charge of the boys?\nAns. No. He did not maintain the dignity of a member of the Coqualeetza staff.\n\nQues. How many times during the present academic year have you found it necessary to use corporal punishment in the case of the boys?\nAns. Several times. During the last five years we have hardly ever used the strap in the punishment of boys, because we did not believe in corporal punishment. The policy of the School has been to avoid corporal punishment except when such is absolutely essential. In place of corporal punishment, the children lost certain privileges. This year we have had a number of serious offenses committed by the boys, such as theft and the breaking into of locked rooms and premises around the school, and a recent case in which two boys entered a girls' dormitory. A number of boys\nwere involved in each of several cases of unlocking doors and suitcases. In these cases each boy was strapped.\n\nQues. Who administered these corporal punishments?\nAns. I did on most occasions, but the Principal has first given his permission and in fact been present.\n\nQues. Were the boys' pants taken down?\nAns. They slipped them down themselves, but the strap was not given on their bare seats, except in possibly one case.\n\nQues. How old are you?\nAns. I am thirty-seven years of age, and have been about twelve years at Coqualeetza, and was previously in charge of Boy Scouts and Troop packs, in fact, ever since I was a school boy.\n\nEdward Peake\n\nWitness.\nSTATEMENT of Mr. C.E.

Have you any knowledge of any boys receiving excessive punishment at Cequaleetza during the past year?\nAns. No.\n\nQues. Have you had occasion to administer corporal punishment to any boy?\nAns. Yes.\n\nQues. How many times have you administered corporal punishment to boys during the past academic year?\nAns. Not more than three times.\n\nQues. Did you previously obtain permission from the Principal before administering corporal punishment?\nAns. No.\n\nQues. What form did your punishment take?\nAns. I gave three slaps on each hand with a leather strap, usually made use of in this school.\n\nQues. Have you ever made a statement to Mr. Perkins that if it had not been for the Inspector of Indian Schools you would have been dismissed long ago?\nAns. No.\nQues.

No.\n\n(Captain Scott stated that it has been the policy of the School in the event of any serious case of corporal punishment to send the child to the nurse so that no question of cruelty could later arise.)\n\nQues. To your knowledge have children ever been forced to eat soap as a punishment?\nAns. No.\n\nStatement. I have been School Nurse at Ceqwaleetza for three years and during this time I am quite certain that there have been no cases of\nexcessive punishment.\n\nEvelyn Anderson\n\nWitness.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 3)\nCoqualeetza Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R.C. SCOTT, B.A.\n\nSardis, B.C. June 24th, 1940.\n\nRe Joseph Hans, Pupil of this School, and Ray Carter, Farm Instructor:\n\nI. I beg to say that Mr. Perkins who was for two months Assistant Farm Instructor, as from February the 1st last, told me about Mr. Carter having \"made a pass\" at Joe Hans in the Senior playroom; I sent for Mr. Carter, and found that he had, after great provocation, made a \"slap\" at Joe Hans, that Joe had dodged the blow, and had gone off upstairs. I made it very clear to Mr. Carter, that he done a most unwise thing, and that such actions were not conducive to discipline. I gave him to understand that there should be no more such occurrences. He admitted that he had been wrong, and was sorry for it.\n\nMr. Perkins did not tell me of the occurrence until after friction had been occasioned between him and Mr. Carter. Perkins was quite inefficient in his work with the horses and on the farm, and Mr. Carter, who is a good farmer, presented both the example he set the boys, and in particular, the poor care he gave the horses.\n\n2. There is absolutely no truth in the statement that boys are forced to \"eat\" soap as a punishment. On a very few occasions boys have been advised, after using bad language, that they ought to \"wash out their mouths\".\n\n3. No boys running away: only one boy actually ran away from the School. He was Claude Davidson, and his case was reported to the Indian Agent and to the Commissioner. He was afterwards expelled. Two other boys were out overnight, but came back of their own accord when they found they were hurting only themselves.\n\n4. The use of the word \"Penance\" in describing what Mr. Perkins found when he came to the School, is quite wrong. It is not customary to use corporal punishment in the school. For five years there has been practically none of it. Instead, we have punished boys by the taking away of privileges such as not being allowed to go to Picture Shows, or for walks on Saturday afternoons. Even these instances were for rather serious disobedience. There has been such an instance before Mr. Perkins came, and the boys were still under loss of privileges for having pilfered fruit from store rooms in the school, and from the basement of the Principal's Residence. In this case, I also made certain of the boys who were ring-leaders, work on Saturday afternoons. I state this to show that we used other methods of dealing with these boys, rather than corporal punishment. There was no \"trying to escape\" from the school as Mr. Perkins would try to insinuate.\n\n5. No punishment, corporal or otherwise was administered in such a way as to cause even minor harm to any boy. One boy was asked to report to the nurse, in order to see if he needed any treatment after being strapped, but this was found to be unnecessary. His hands were red, and a bit swollen, but were already beginning to mend, with no treatment at all. Corporal punishment is used only for such misdemeanours as stealing, or for conduct toward girls which was wrong. The boy above mentioned, (in this paragraph) had gone into a Girls' dormitory, and while he had not done further wrong, still it was a serious thing and had to be punished.\nCoqualeetza Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R. C. SCOTT, B.A.\n\nHarris, B.C.\n\nRe: Joe Hans\n\n6. Even before Inspector Barry came, and following my conversation with Mr Carter about having tried to \"Slap\" Joe Hans, I gave Mr Carter to understand that such conduct would not be tolerated. I also informed him that I felt it would be better for him not to come to the new school. Since talking with Captain Barry, I shall make that quite clear, and I shall not take Mr Carter to Alberni as a member of the staff of the new school. He lost his temper, and that is something which a staff member must not do, even under provocation.\n\n7. I would like to say, that the conduct on the part of the boys which has necessitated corporal punishment was due to two things:\n\n(I) because of the fact that I was away so much in getting treatment for the throat trouble which has afflicted me this last six months. While Mr Peake gave good service, still the knowledge that I was away was not conducive to good conduct on the part of a few boys who took advantage of the situation.\n\n(2) Because of the attitude of Mr Perkins. This I feel was one of the big factors. He had no idea of discipline, nor of his responsibility to other staff members for co-operation in his work as Farm Assistant, and while in charge of the boys. Within a week of the time he came he brought in a poem he had written about the boys' successes, \"this is our task\" etc etc. I explained as judiciously as possible, that his responsibility was not the writing or poetry, but the carrying out of his duty to me and to the boys in the light of the school rules. Indian boys and girls do not need to be told a thing outright, and they vividly sensed that Mr Perkins was \"befriending\" them, and that the rules of the school were strict. Consequently, while previous to his coming no criticism had been directed against the school, or any member of staff, the attitude of Perkins undermined authority. He would tell the stories when he ought to have been directing their work in the fields, and neglected his work in other ways, in order to show them that the Prairie Indians had made him a \"chief\" in recognition of his contribution to their welfare. In fact he knew nothing at all about Indian boys and girls, and seemed to set himself up as being quite above doing the ordinary work of a Staff member. I had to allow him to stay on for another month, even after giving him notice at the end of his first month, that his services were no longer required simply because I found I had to make another trip to Moyes, and could not on the spur of the moment bring in a completely new staff member. At the same time I warned Mr Peake, that we would be \"lucky\" if I got off without rather serious undermining of discipline, as I felt that Perkins was not suited to the work of having charge of boys. I had, however, taken him off the farm work proper, and had given him work in the orchard, and hoped that he would get along there without making trouble. This unfortunately, to my mind, was without avail.\n\n8. I have listened to the evidence given before Captain Barry and believe it was given in a straightforward manner, and was true.\n\nSIGNED:\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major McKay:\n\nIn accordance with the instructions contained in your letter 15/19/6266 of the 21st instant, I held a preliminary enquiry at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, where the complaints contained in a letter from Mr. Cecil Perkins to you, dated June 20th, were thoroughly investigated.\n\nA list of members of the present Coqualeetza staff whom Captain Scott intends to employ in connection with the operation of the new school at Alert Bay was first obtained. This has been attached to the proceedings.\n\nThe contents of Mr. Perkins' letter mentioned above, were carefully outlined to Captain Scott, who was also informed that you had instructed me to enquire into the charges made.\n\nCaptain Scott arranged for the necessary members of his staff to appear before me for interrogation, and the services of Miss Talbot, stenographer, Coqualeetza, were placed at my disposal. All persons examined were warned that their statements would be taken down in writing, and that they would be later requested to sign such statements on verification of same. Captain Scott was present throughout the whole of this preliminary enquiry and was of considerable assistance to me.\n\nA signed statement by Captain Scott, as Principal of the Coqualeetza School, is also attached to the proceedings.\n\nI am perfectly satisfied that there has been no ill-treatment whatever of the boys as alleged. The statements of Mr. Cecil Perkins are, in my opinion, a very highly exaggerated account of two or three instances that undoubtedly happened during the time he was at the Coqualeetza School. In my opinion there is no need whatever for any further investigation or enquiry into this matter.\n\nI have advised the Reverend Principal that it would be well in future to limit the infliction of corporal punishment by requiring that definite permission must first be obtained, either from him as Principal or in\nhis absence from the Acting Principal of the School.\n\nI would further advise that in future any such corporal punishment be given with a regulation school strap made of rubber. The actual strap used for years at this School was specially made for the purpose; is not part of a harness trace as suggested, but is, in my opinion, rather too thick, especially for the punishment of the smaller boys.\n\nI trust that the results of the investigation carried out today will be satisfactory to you, and that there will be no need for the Department to take any further action in the matter; particularly so as Captain Scott has given me his assurance in writing (see his statement attached) that Mr. Carter, against whom the main charges were made, will not be employed as a member of the new Alberni School staff.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\n3357 Irvine St.\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nJune 20.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner\nVancouver.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the interests of better treatment of Indian Children I wish to report the following incidents which happened while I was employed at Indian Residential School at Sardis.\n\nIt is part of the duties of the Farmer, Engineer and Assistant Farmer on alternate nights to line the boys up in the basement for roll call previous to them marching into the assembly hall for prayers. On the night in question which was in the latter part of March, Mr. Carter the farmer had that office or duty to perform. The boys were slow in taking their places and at last Mr. Carter addressing one of the older pupils Joe Hans with the remark that he (Mr. Carter) would make Joe hit the dust. At the same time striking at the pupil with his fist. The boy dodged the blow and the momentum caused Mr. Carter to fall on the floor of the basement. Had the blow landed it could easily have seriously injured the boy. Joe left the line up and hid on one of the fire-escapes. After prayers Mr. Carter discovered Joe in the Senior Teachers room and proceeded to administer a severe thrashing. This was done with a section or piece of a harness trade after the boy had been made to take down his pants. This is the common form of punishment employed in the school towards the boys.\n\nI informed Mr. Scott of this incident and registered my disapproval of such action. In the following days the boys used the phrase \"I'll make you hit the dust\" incessantly and it did much to disrupt the discipline.\n\nI also protested to Mr. Scott that Mr. Carter was not a fit person to supervise the boys as he was antagonizing them and causing them to attempt run-aways. In the first few weeks on one occasion two boys left the school and were away the most of the night. Cold foggy weather forced them to return. When I arrived at the school many boys were still working out penance for attempted breaks for escapes.\n\nOn...........\nOn another occasion one evening in March when I was about to tell stories to the children in one of the younger dormitories I found a number in the lavatory eating toilet soap. This soap is the same color as Lifebuoy and is used extensively by the school. They had each been ordered to eat half a cake as a punishment for swearing. I made them stop and go back to their dormitory.\n\nDuring the course of a conversation with Mr. Peake about the end of February, he warned me against carrying tales to the department as he said others had tried it and only made more trouble for themselves. The department realized he said that they were producing results and were satisfied to continue.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Cecil Perkins\"\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter dated June 20, 1940, Mr. Cecil Perkins of 3357 Irvine St., New Westminster, B.C., made certain charges with reference to ill-treatment of children at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. A copy of his letter is attached.\n\nIn my letter 15/9/6340, dated June 21, 1940, I instructed Inspector Barry to carry out at Coqualeetza a preliminary investigation in connection with the charges made by Mr. Perkins. A copy of my letter of instructions to Captain Barry is also attached. The necessary investigation was carried out at Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, Sardis, on June 24th last and I am forwarding for the information of the Department the complete file of the evidence, etc., placed before Inspector Barry.\n\nIt would appear that there has been no ill-treatment of children at the Coqualeetza school as was suggested in Mr. Perkins' letter of the 20th instant to me. I have, however, in my letter of today's date to the Rev. R.G. Scott, principal of the school, instructed him to limit the use of corporal punishment as much as possible and further, to make certain that when such punishment is absolutely necessary, it be administered in a suitable manner.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJune 21, 1940.\n\nDear Capt. Barry:\n\nWith reference to our conversation yesterday regarding the information contained in the attached letter from Mr. Cecil Perkins, I have decided, in view of the character of the charges made, that a preliminary investigation should be carried out, and would therefore request that you arrange to proceed to Cogusleetza for this purpose as soon as it is convenient for you to do so.\n\nI should like to suggest that you proceed with your investigation along the following lines:\n\n(1) Ascertain from Mr. Scott what members of the present staff it is intended to employ in connection with the operation of the new school at Alberni.\n\n(2) Outline carefully the contents of Mr. Perkins' letter.\n\n(3) Inform Mr. Scott that you have been instructed by the Commissioner to inquire into the charges made.\n\n(4) Request Mr. Scott to bring the members of the staff involved before you for interrogation.\n\n(5) Warn members of the staff examined that their statements are to be taken down in writing, which record they will be requested to sign on verification by them.\n\n(6) Principal Scott should be present during this preliminary investigation.\n\nShould the inquiry produce information definitely indicating illtreatment of the children as charged, assurance of\n\nCapt. G.H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nthe.......\nthe Principal that the services of those of his staff involved would be dispensed with at the close of the current term, would likely be considered as meeting the situation and render unnecessary any further investigation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. McKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nCoqualeetza Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R.C SCOTT B.A.\n\nAlberni,\nBritish B.C., November 13, 1940\n\nMr. P.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Canada\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nEnclosed please find itemized statement of the proceeds of the sale held on October 29th at Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nAfter conversation with Major MacKay with regard to the two furrow riding plough which had been purchased by the Department, I arranged to have the plough bought in so that it would remain without cost at the school pending disposition of the same, and this has been done. The other farm implements I assumed were bought out of school funds, as was the case with the disc harrow which I bought myself, second hand. The houses referred to were Colony Pig Houses, small buildings constructed by our Manual Training boys as projects. I am not sure about the hogs, but presume they were bought out of school funds, as was the case with the horses, three of which I purchased myself. We brought the best set of harness over here and the wagon and such other farm equipment as we could use. The forges were all in poor repair with parts missing. We brought the only one that was intact over here for use in our Motor Mechanics department. The cattle belonged originally to the Church. Only a pure bred bull was bought out of school funds as a calf and he was brought over with the rest of the stock.\n\nDr. Cochrane, Superintendent of Home Missions, suggests that I consult you as to the disposition of this money. Meantime I am keeping it in a special account at the Bank of Montreal at Port Alberni. I may say that we have been oversaid by the Home Missions Board.\nMr. R.A. Hoey\n\nNovember 12, 1940\n\non our per capita earnings, something over one thousand dollars, and this will have to be paid back some time throughout the school year. There is also the need for increased revenue due to the many items of expense for equipment which I have paid out of school funds. These were items for which I could not wait to submit to the Department and in spite of the generosity of the Department in everything, these expenditures have been considerable. The amount, $1081.80, might well go into general school funds, but I shall be glad to abide by your wishes in the matter.\n\nThanking you for your assistance in all these things, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\n\nRCS/BW\nEncl.\n| Item                  | Price |\n|----------------------|-------|\n| 8 forks               | $5.70 |\n| 2 bars                | .95   |\n|

Dr. New, at Mayo, asked me to report to Dr. Paton in Vancouver, as Dr. Large had been called out for Military service. I did so, upon my return from the last operation at Rochester, and was delighted to be told that I might talk.\n\nI think that Dr. New's decision, that my voice would be as good, if not better than ever, is likely to be fulfilled. I have no sense of strain when speaking in ordinary conversation, and am sure I shall be able to speak in public again, as soon as the chords have got back into training, as it were.\n\nHowever, I shall exercise great care, and again wish to thank you for the way in which I was allowed to go for treatment when necessary.\n\nAlthough it will be a big task, I am looking forward to doing my best at Alberni, and feel glad of the opportunity to be of service.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Apparently very few suitable teachers are available, and it seems that Captain Barry has not yet been officially asked by the Department to take steps to look for anyone who could be used here. I gathered from him too, that the salary which had been mentioned might not be very attractive.\n\nIn order then, to enable action to be taken, might I suggest that letters be written to the Commissioner and to Captain Barry, indicating the wishes of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.S.

The Department is now in receipt of a letter from Dr. Barclay, in which he expresses the hope that the Department will be in a position to secure teachers immediately for work at the hospital.\n\nIn view of the acute shortage of teachers existing at the moment, you may experience difficulty in securing suitable teachers for hospital work. It is my hope, however, that you will find time to discuss this matter with Inspector Barry and with him do all you possibly can to secure one or two teachers suitable for this institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, January 2, 1942.\n\nDear Doctor Barclay:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of December 12, in which you suggest that the Department discuss with the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia the desirability of employing teachers at the Coqualeetza Hospital.\n\nI may state that immediately following my letter to you dated October 21, 1941, I communicated with Major MacKay in respect to this matter. I am enclosing a copy of this letter for your information.\n\nThere is, as you know, an acute shortage of qualified teachers at this time throughout the Dominion. I would be surprised indeed if our officials did not experience the utmost difficulty in securing teachers for your institution. There is no reason, however, why a sincere attempt should not be made to secure teachers, if suitable teachers are at all available. It is my understanding that Miss MacKay might be persuaded to take over teaching duties for the time being at least. I am today communicating again with Commissioner MacKay and asking him to do all he possibly can to secure one or two teachers for your hospital.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. S. Barclay, Esq., M.D.,\nMedical Superintendent,\nCoqualeetza Indian Hospital,\nSardis, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter 51-153-1 of January 28th last dealing with the appointment of two qualified teachers for the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital.\n\nI am forwarding herewith copies of my letters of the 4th instant addressed to:\n\nMost Rev. W. M. Duke, Archbishop of Vancouver.\nRt. Rev. Sib Francis Heathcote, Bart., D.D., Bishop of New Westminster, and\nRev. W.F. Bunt, B.D., Supt. of United Church Missions,\nwhich will be self explanatory.\n\nBoth the Bishop of New Westminster and the Superintendent of United Church Missions have, I understand, been in communication with one another and both agreed to nominate Mrs. Lylyan Wilson of 1256 A, Davie Street, Vancouver, as the Protestant Teacher at the Coqualeetza Hospital, copies of their letters of recommendation are attached for the information of the Department, and also a copy of Mrs. Wilson's letter of application.\n\nThe whole matter has, of course, been discussed with Inspector Barry who had, in the first instance, a lengthy interview with Mrs. Wilson and advised her to apply to both the Anglican and United Church authorities with a view to obtaining the nominations referred to above.\n\nInspector Barry considers that Mrs. Wilson is an extremely well qualified candidate for the position of Protestant Teacher at the Coqualeetza Hospital and that we would be very fortunate to secure her services.\n\nIt was only possible for me to see Mrs. Wilson for a few moments, but I may say that I am in complete agreement with the views expressed by Inspector Barry and would, therefore, recommend that Mrs. Lylyan Wilson be appointed\n\nThe Secretary:\nThe Secretary- February 11, 1942.\n\nas one of the two teachers authorized for the staff of the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital.\n\nIt is assumed that she will be allowed salary at the rate of $75.00 per month on the understanding that her meals would be supplied at the Hospital. It will be noted from Mrs. Wilson's application that she is prepared to provide suitable uniforms for use while engaged in the Hospital and I would suggest, that the laundering of such uniforms be done for her free of cost at the Hospital.\n\nThe Department's decision is requested by Air Mail, if possible, as we are anxious to have the educational work started at Coqualeetza Hospital at the earliest possible date.\n\nI am asking Inspector Barry to call on His Excellency Archbishop W.

M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe No. 10749/6385.\n\nYours of the 24th of Feb. to hand. I would be glad to nominate for the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital Mrs. L. Wilson of 1256 A Davie Street. I am telling her to give you full information as to age, qualifications, and so forth.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"F. C. G. Heathcote.\"\nBishop of New Westminster.\nVancouver B.C.\nFebruary 9th 1942.\n\nMajor D. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70-\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major Mackay,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th inst I wish to nominate Mrs. Llylan Wilson, 1256 A Davie Street, Vancouver. Mrs. Wilson is a widow, without children, and was born on November 7th 1904. Her academic standing is that of a First Class Certificate in the Province of Saskatchewan, with Specialization Courses in Home Economics and Physical Education. She has also had eighteen months hospital training, and seven years teaching experience.\n\nI told Mrs. Wilson that you would probably like to interview her and in that event, her telephone number is Marine 6080. If calling her on the phone will you do so before 9.30 in the morning, as she is temporarily employed, and leaves home about that time each morning.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nW. P. Bunt.\n\nWPB/AM.\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner of B. C.\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major McKay:\n\nI understand you are in need of a protestant teacher for Coqualeetza Hospital, Sardis, B. C. I hereby submit this my application.\n\nAm 38 years of age, widow, unencumbered, with a 1st class teaching certificate, Saskatchewan. Have seven years teaching experience.\n\nHave 18 months hospital training, which I took in the Regina General Hospital, but could not finish my training due to illness.\n\nDuring my Normal School training I observed teaching methods in the QUAppelle Sanitorium for T. R. so I have some knowledge as to the method which the teaching in Coqualeetza Hospital would be carried on.\n\nI am a member of the United Church of Canada.\n\nThe salary for this position, I understand, is $75.00 per month plus meals. This is satisfactory to me.\n\nI would in all probability be required to wear uniforms suitable for Hospitals, these I can supply, and the laundering would, I expect, be done in the institution.\n\nShould you consider my application favourable you may contact me by phoning Marine 6050 any morning before 10.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMrs. L. Wilson.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 9th instant, regarding the employment of teachers at the Coqualeetza Hospital, has recently been brought to my attention.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter. I have discussed the matter with Dr. Moore and he intimates that it is doubtful if accommodation can be provided for the teachers in the hospital. However, he cannot see any reason why the hospital could not provide meals. The Department would, therefore, be prepared to allow salary of $75.00 a month on the understanding that the meals would be supplied at the hospital.\n\nI trust that you will continue your endeavours to secure two qualified teachers for this institution.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter 51-153-1 of the 2nd instant with reference to the employment of teachers at the Coqualeetza Hospital.\n\nThis matter had already been discussed by me with Doctor W. S. Barclay and Inspector Barry. It was our understanding, when the matter was discussed with Doctor Moore, that no funds were available for the payment of salaries to teachers at the Coqualeetza Hospital until after April 1st, 1942, as stated in Departmental letter 51-153-1 of October 21st, 1941, but that Doctor Moore on his return to Ottawa would endeavor to have funds made available through the Medical Branch for the payment of two teachers at the Coqualeetza Hospital until the end of the present fiscal year, and as no further communication was received from the Department in this matter, the nomination of suitable teachers was not sought from either the Protestant or Roman Catholic authorities.\n\nThe matter has again been discussed with Inspector Barry and I am informed by him, that if salaries for the teachers mentioned above be only authorized at the rate of $60.00 per month, mentioned in Departmental letter 51-153-1 of October 21st, addressed to Doctor Barclay, it will be quite impossible to secure qualified candidates. Captain Barry suggests that as Doctor Barclay would find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to arrange for the full maintenance of two teachers, and as such teachers in any case need to be well qualified for the special work to be undertaken, it is highly doubtful that suitable candidates could be found at a salary at less than $100.00 per month non-resident or $60.00 per month with full maintenance, including board, room, laundry etc., in this regard it is suggested by Inspector Barry that these teachers may be required to wear a white uniform.\nJanuary 9, 1942.\n\nI should be glad to know, in due course, if the Department would sanction the somewhat higher salary suggested by Inspector Barry, and on receipt of this advice, I would endeavor to secure the nomination of one Roman Catholic and one Protestant teach for these positions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI understand that the Churches are asked to nominate a teacher for the Hospital. I beg to submit the name of Mrs. Lylyan Wilson. Mrs. Wilson is a widow, presently residing in Vancouver. She is thirty-seven years of age; holds a First Class Teaching Certificate from Saskatchewan, with specialization course in Home Economics; and has had eighteen months' hospital training as well.\n\nWe shall be glad to know whether this nomination meets with your approval.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.D.M.T\n\nFebruary 20th,\n1942.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 16, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Establishment of an Indian day school at the Coqualeetza Hospital, Sardis, B.C.\n\nIn view of the number of children of school age that will be receiving treatment at the Coqualeetza Hospital, it is considered advisable to provide two teachers for their instruction. This practically amounts to establishing a new day school and consequently I believe it will be necessary to secure an Order-in-Council in order to comply with Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act. I, therefore, attach Memorandum to Council.\n\nWhen the Acting Superintendent of Medical Services visited British Columbia recently the question of engaging teachers was fully discussed with all interested and it was decided that such action was extremely desirable. Dr. Moore included a recommendation to this effect in the report which he submitted following his visit to Coqualeetza.\n\nWith the exception of the salaries of the teachers and the supplying of the necessary text books and other small school supplies, it is not anticipated that there will be any heavy expenditure as most of the teaching will be done in the wards in which the children are located, thus obviating the necessity of setting up classrooms equipped with desks etc.\n\nIt is proposed to pay a salary of $75.00 a month to each of the two teachers.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA\n\nFRIDAY, the 27th day of FEBRUARY, 1942.\n\nPRESENT:\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nWHEREAS, the Minister of Mines and Resources reports that there will be approximately 35 children of school age receiving treatment in the Coqualeetza Hospital and that it is necessary to provide educational facilities for them; and\n\nThat funds are available in Vote 165, 1941-42, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for the establishment of a day school at the Coqualeetza Hospital.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 98, 1927, is pleased to order that a day school be and it is hereby established in the Coqualeetza Hospital, New Westminster Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, to be known as \"The Coqualeetza Indian Day School\".\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Minister of Mines & Resources.\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. M. Duke, Archbishop of Vancouver, in which Miss Mary Scarabelli of 4001 West 32nd Avenue, Vancouver, B.C. is nominated as a junior teacher at the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital.\n\nMiss Scarabelli's letter of application for this position dated March 2nd, is also attached.\n\nInspector Barry informs me that neither Archbishop Duke nor he can find a Roman Catholic certificated teacher for the vacant position at the Coqualeetza Hospital and, that it is for this reason that Miss Scarabelli has been nominated by the Archbishop of Vancouver.\n\nThis girl has passed the Provincial Junior Matriculation examination and taken several of the subjects of the Senior Matriculation class. Captain Barry considers that while she has had no Normal School training and, therefore, is not in possession of a teacher's certificate, she might do quite well as a Junior teacher at the Coqualeetza.\n\nPending the Department's decision Inspector Barry arranged for Miss Scarabelli to visit his office for some three hours instruction on the afternoon of the 3rd instant, at which time Mrs. Wilson, the newly appointed Protestant teacher was also being instructed in the outlines of educational work to be undertaken at the Coqualeetza Hospital.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nCaptain Barry considers Miss Scarabelli a very bright girl and very sincere in her desire to become a teacher. Miss Scarabelli has stated to the Inspector that she is quite willing to follow his instructions and those of Mrs. Wilson, in fact, as junior teacher under Mrs. Wilson's direction. For these reasons he suggests that the Department might be well advised to consider favourably this girl's application under the following conditions:\n\nThat she be given only a temporary appointment as a junior teacher until the end of the present academic year in June 1942, and that she be required to supply, at her own expense, appropriate uniforms, and that while her meals and laundry work should be supplied free by the Hospital, the salary allowed, in her case, should be at the rate of only $65.00 a month.\n\nAs no fully qualified Roman Catholic teachers appear to be available, at the present time, I am forwarding Miss Scarabelli's application for the consideration of the Department. In doing so, I believe, that Inspector Barry's suggestion should receive favourable consideration and that, under the circumstances, Miss Scarabelli be given the temporary appointment suggested by him.\n\nThe Department's decision by air mail would be appreciated and, if favourable, I should be glad to know the salary that will be allowed to this girl.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the Air Mail letter 51-153-1 of February 26th, I have the honour of forwarding herewith a letter of the Right Reverend Mgr. Excellency, The Most Rev. R. M. Sciarabelli, D.D., Bishop of Vancouver, B.C., in which Miss Mary Sciarabelli, aged 19 years, of Vancouver, B.C., is nominated as a junior teacher for the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital.\n\nMiss Sciarabelli's letter of application for the position dated March 2nd, is also attached.\n\nInspector Barry informs me that neither Duke nor he can find a Roman Catholic certificate for Miss Sciarabelli to fill the vacant position at the Coqualeetza Hospital.

In duplicate with his employer. Upon receipt of Form N.D.T. from the employee, the employer is to forward one copy thereof to the Inspector of Income Tax for his district. The other copy is to be retained by the employer until the time of making his first remittance for National Defence Tax. The other copy of Form N.D.T.1 is to be retained on file by the employer when available at any time for inspection by officers of this Division.\n\nIf Form N.D.T.1 is not completed by the employee, the employee is to be regarded for tax purposes as a single person without dependents. It will accordingly be apparent that it is unnecessary for single persons without dependents to complete and file Form N.D.T.1.\n\nWhere an employee becomes married, householder, widow or widower status, or entitled to a tax credit in respect of dependents, the employee must complete and file Form N.D.T.1.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6422, file 869-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa,\nJune 1, 1942.\n\nEX'D\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo and I am arranging to have the salary of Miss Scarabelli, for the months of April and May, paid immediately.\n\nIn connection with this school, I desire to refer you to my letter of April 28.

Barclay, dated the 9th instant, in which he expresses the opinion that the two teachers should be employed for a period of eleven months and arrangements for leave in such a way that one of them will be on duty during the period that the other one is absent, in order to keep the younger patients occupied with vocational work, it being understood that the ordinary academic subjects would not be dealt with during this vacation period. As it is likely that the young patients would be happier, their minds being occupied with such vocational work, I concur with the Doctor's opinion and would recommend that authorization be given to make the necessary arrangements to alternate such leave for the teachers.\n\nIt is intended to recommend the release of Miss Mary Scarabelli at the close of the present school term as she is not considered suitable for teaching at this school. A further recommendation in this matter of her replacement will be made in the near future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe.: Teachers' Vacations.\n(Your File 107-9-7961.)\n\nI have discussed this matter again with Mrs. Wilson. She agrees with me that teaching should not be carried out during July or August, but that one of the two teachers should remain on duty during July and the other during August, in order to supervise vocational work and give some help with keeping the younger patients occupied. It would definitely aid in the work of the nurses.\n\nAs far as arrangements for the coming summer are concerned, I do not think it would make very much difference whether Mrs. Wilson took July or August for her vacation. I believe further, that most school teachers are paid on a ten months basis. I would suggest that our teachers be paid for eleven months, but do not consider that the Department should be responsible for paying them for their vacation periods.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.S.

She receives a salary of $90.00 direct from the Department of Education. She resides at the Sanatorium and Board and room are provided for her without charge. Her employment is for the same months as the ordinary school year; that is, from about the first of September to the end of June. She is responsible only to the Medical Superintendent, and of course, to the Department of Education.\n\nAt the present time we are inaugurating a rehabilitation programme in Manitoba and I think that the resident school teacher will be linked up to some extent with this programme but it will not have any effect on the above details.\n\nAt the present time the duties of the teacher are determined by the Medical Superintendent, the patients or pupils that she instructs being under medical authority.\n\nUnder separate cover I am sending you a copy of our 1941 Annual Report which devotes a paragraph or section on the Sanatorium School.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nMedical Superintendent.\nMay 2, 1942\n\nAir Mail\n\nDear Doctor Ross:\n\nWe plan on employing two teachers on our staff at the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital.

I have made inquiries regarding the practice followed at other T.B. hospitals and I find that 10 months is the proper term. This would mean that these two teachers would not teach during the months of July and August. However, you might discuss further with Dr. Barclay the advisability of having one of the teachers on duty all year. If he considers this is necessary, the Department will be prepared to consider a recommendation from you regarding the two months during which each of them should be absent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I consider the months of July and August would be the most suitable for the teachers to take their months holiday without pay. This plan would leave one of the teachers on duty and enable her to supervise any vocational work that may be on hand at the time. Dr. Barclay concurs with this suggestion and I enclose his letter of the 24th ultimo.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe.: Miss Mary Scarabelli.\n\nI have your letter of March 16th regarding the appointment of the above named as Junior Teacher at the Hospital.\n\nI do not believe that the children in a Tuberculosis Hospital receive school instruction for the full twelve months each year. As a matter of fact, I would think interest would lag during the hot summer months. I would like to suggest that the teachers be employed for eleven months only, each year, and that one teacher overlap the month that the other is not on duty, mostly to supervise and encourage any vocational work that may be going on.\n\nI do not believe I am in a position to pass judgment on the matter of a vacation on full pay, but, off-hand, I do not see why these teachers should be paid on a basis different to that obtaining in the regular schools in the province.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.S.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to filling the vacancy for a teacher at Coqualeetza Indian Hospital, created by the retirement of Mrs. L. Wilson, I would advise that considerable difficulty has been experienced in securing another teacher possessing the qualifications needed for this somewhat specialized position.\n\nRecently Mr. Commissioner MacKay and Dr. Barclay interviewed a Miss Mary Nixon of Chilliwack, an Anglican, with First Class B.C. Certificate and handicraft experience, and the Commissioner expressed himself to the writer as being very satisfied with her fitness for the position. However, I am now informed by Dr. Barclay that she is now receiving a salary of $40.00 for a ten month term and is practically certain to receive $900.00 on her return to duty, owing to recent general increases in teachers' salaries in this Province. I would also point out that the demand for women in industry and government employment at higher rates than is prevalent in the teaching profession is already beginning to bring resignations among our teaching staff, their higher standard of education evidently making them desirable employees.\n\nThe problem is now that in order to secure Miss Nixon's services we must ensure her of a salary practically equivalent to that likely to be received by her if she remains with her present school. Discussing this with Dr. Barclay, he suggests that she could be allowed $5.00 per month in lieu of one meal at the hospital, which is their usual allowance. It is suggested by Dr. Barclay that the salary could be adjusted so that salary, allowance in lieu of meals, and cost of living\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nThe Secretary,\n\nJuly 15, 1942.\n\nbonus approximate $90.00, in which case she will be satisfied. It is not known whether she receives cost of living bonus in addition to her present salary.\n\nI am prepared to recommend such adjustment in view of the high qualifications of this teacher and general conditions. I enclose copies of her application, Inspector's report, and character reference by the Reverend H. B. Barrett.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise me of the Department's decision by air mail as it would be necessary for Miss Nixon to sever her present connections by the end of the month.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M.

B. Hospitals, while Dr. Barclay is inclined to favor a term of eleven months as this would ensure that one teacher would be available during June and July to supervise vocational work and give some assistance in keeping the younger patients occupied. I should like to suggest that this matter be allowed to stand over until Mrs. Wilson returns to duty in August and a second teacher replacing Miss Scarabelli appointed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

The Department was aware, from previous correspondence, that this girl did not possess any qualifications as a teacher and consequently your action in discontinuing her services at the end of June is approved.\n\nYou should immediately consult His Grace Archbishop Duke and have him nominate a qualified Catholic teacher to begin duties on September 1, 1942.\n\nI am also in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you advise that Mrs. Wilson will take her holidays during the months of June and July. No salary will be paid to her during those two months but payment of salary to Mrs. Wilson will be resumed from August 1 next.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Unless further advised, payment of salary to Mrs. Wilson should be resumed from August 1, 1948.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter addressed to Miss Mary Scarabelli advising her that her temporary employment as Teacher at the Coqualeetza Hospital will terminate with the close of the academic year on June 30th next, and that no assurance could be given that she would be reengaged by the Department for the coming school year.\n\nYou will probably recall that I intimated in my letter of May 15th that it was intended to recommend the release of this Teacher at the close of the current school term.\n\nMiss Scarabelli's work has not been satisfactory. She lacks both the training and experience required for our work at Coqualeetza which is, of course, of a special character, and does not appear to possess the tactful approach necessary to successfully instruct Indian children and especially those in ill health.\n\nI regret that I am unable for the reasons stated to recommend the employment of Miss Scarabelli beyond the end of the current term on June 30th. I trust that the action taken in advising Miss Scarabelli as I have done meets with the Department's approval.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nMiss Mary Scarabelli,\nCoqualeetza Indian Hospital,\nSardis, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of February 24, 1942, approving the appointment of Mrs. Lylyn Wilson as one of the Teachers at the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital and to advise that Mrs. Wilson will not be on duty during the months of June and July and should, therefore, not be paid salary for this period. Mrs. Wilson explained that the circumstances were such, that it would be much better for her to take her holidays now than later. She also explained that she felt by the time she returned to duty on August 1st, the stationery requisitioned for some time ago and which had not arrived would no doubt be available, and, moreover, that conditions generally for the instruction of the children might be better then than at present.\n\nThe whole matter was discussed with Dr. Barclay at the Hospital on Monday evening last, and it was agreed that under the circumstances the proposals suggested by Mrs. Wilson were in the best interests of all concerned. I would, therefore, recommend that these arrangements be approved.\n\nMrs. Wilson is regarded as a highly capable Teacher, has taken a deep interest in her work, co-operates wholeheartedly with the Hospital Staff, and is very well liked by the Indian children.\n\nThe Department's decision by air mail will be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nRe: Teachers' salaries, Coqualeetza Hospital\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 25th instant, in which you seek additional information in respect to the salaries to be paid by the Department at the Coqualeetza Hospital.\n\nIn this connection may I refer you to your air mail letter of July 15, 1942, and Mr. Phelan's reply thereto dated July 18. In the last paragraph of Mr. Phelan's communication he stated -- \"In securing a teacher to succeed Miss Scarabelli, you may offer the same salary. It is understood that the hospital will supply meals and laundry work free\".\n\nMr. Phelan is now overseas and when Miss Cole's appointment was under consideration I was influenced by the fact that we had already decided to pay $85.00 a month to the non-Catholic teacher at the hospital and that it would be very unwise to pay salary less than this to the Catholic teacher. The correspondence on file suggests, however, that the non-Catholic teacher is particularly well qualified and that Miss Cole has had little, if any, professional training. If, in your judgment, it would be advisable to pay Miss Cole $75.00 rather than $85.00 a month, I would be glad to abide by your recommendation. These, as you know, are very delicate matters and matters that require us to exercise the utmost care in dealing with them from time to time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M.

Surges, employed as teacher at the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital.\n\nIn this connection I am enclosing for your information a copy of a letter received from Dr. Barclay on the subject.\n\nI should say the information available indicates that Miss Surges is a citizen of the United States. As she, however, desires to become a citizen of this country and as her work at Coqualeetza to date has been highly satisfactory, and in view of the difficulties in securing qualified teachers, I should like to suggest that she be permitted to continue at Coqualeetza on the understanding that she will take the necessary steps without undue delay to have her status clarified, and, if necessary, become a British subject.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Her grandfather was \"brought up in the United States,\" although she is unable to state whether or not he was born there. Her father is an American Citizen, at present living in Seattle.\n\nHer maternal grandfather was German-born, but became a naturalized American Citizen. Her mother is American-born, but is now a naturalized British Subject, residing in Vancouver.\n\nMiss Surges was born in Vancouver, but for a few years lived in the United States. This, I believe, was when she was a teen-age girl. On one of her trips to the States she says that the American Immigration authorities accepted her as an American Citizen, but when she came to return to Vancouver, the Canadian authorities accepted her as a Canadian Citizen. She is rather upset over the situation that has arisen in connection with her status and has expressed the intention that, if legally she is an American Citizen, she would like to take out British naturalization papers.\n\nMiss Surges appears very interested in her work here and, pending the settlement of this matter, I would ask that the Department permit her to carry on this work.\n\nIf there is any further information needed that I can obtain I will be glad to hear from you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nMedical Superintendent.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe.: Cheque D093236 in favour of M. Nixon, for $85.59.\n\nAs far as can be determined this cheque cannot be meant for Mrs. Marie Nixon, one of our Ward Aides, who has received her salary up to the end of September.\n\nNo salary cheques have as yet been received for Mrs. Lemley, who commenced Aug. 11th., Miss Cartlidge, who started here Aug. 28th., or Miss Tompson, who joined our staff on Sep. 1st., and, of course, for any who have been registered since that date.

It is true that in your letter of February 20, 1942, you nominated Mrs. Lilian Wilson. However, Mrs. Wilson gave up duties very suddenly and Indian Commissioner MacKay and Dr. Barclay secured the services of another teacher. The latter teacher did not report for duty on October 1 and consequently we are still looking for a teacher.

In this letter you stated that Dr. Barclay and yourself had interviewed her. The Department approved of her appointment in official letter of July 18 and in that letter it was stated that we understood she would begin duties on September 1. You have not written us to the contrary and consequently her cheque was issued at the end of September and forwarded to Coqualeetza. This cheque has now been returned by Dr. Barclay and he states that he does not know Miss Nixon. It is difficult to reconcile this statement with the information given in your letter of July 15.

If this can not be supplied out of Welfare Vote I expect we can pay for it out of our vocational fund.\n\nIn connection with the latter it is still difficult for us to keep our finances in a very fluid state and in this mail I am writing to the Department asking about more detailed information as to the operation of \"a revolving fund\" such as you mentioned to me.\n\nSince I returned and showed your samples to our teachers I have persuaded them to secure an additional quantity of the scrap leather and I hope that genuine effort will be made to produce some of this work since we are still unable to secure hides for moccasins, gauntlets, etc. I explained to the teachers that you felt we were paying our patients too much for the individual articles that had been made but their feeling is that our Indians in B.C. are so used to higher wages than probably had been attainable in the East that it would be detrimental move if we tried to reduce the amount we now pay them. However, since beads are getting a little harder to locate perhaps we can switch into some other lines such as you showed me where turnover is faster. It will take a while to work this out especially since the teachers vacation period is now at hand. One of the teachers will be with us for an additional month this summer but there will be a month when we will have no supervision whatever.\n\nThank you very much for your kindly assistance when I was in Ottawa.\n\nW. S. Barclay, M.D.,\nMedical Superintendent.\nCoqualeetza Indian Hospital,\nSardis, B. C.,\nJune 28, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nWhile in Ottawa recently I had a very interesting discussion with Miss Moody regarding our vocational work. I mentioned to her that although the amount of work seems to be gradually increasing we are still finding it very difficult to keep our finances in a fluid state. We have tried to extend our retail outlets but returns from these are sometimes a bit slow coming in and we are also up against the necessity of carrying a certain amount of stock on hand until it can be sold, which stock has already been paid for to the patients.\n\nSince at times we have had as much as $250 or $300 tied up in stock or in outstanding accounts there seems no doubt in my mind that we require additional aid to properly finance this department of our hospital work. Miss Moody suggested that a \"revolving fund\" might be provided for us and I would like to have further information regarding how this is operated. I would suggest that probably another $400 would probably be required in such a fund. Would it be confined to each fiscal year or would it be a continuing arrangement until such time as we have increased our small profits to a suitable amount that we could carry on by ourselves?\n\nW. S. Barclay, M.D.,\nMedical Superintendent.\n\nWSB/iw\nIn closing I ask you to please look at my qualifications, my work, and my inspector's report; then compare my salary with the teacher's salary schedule for British Columbia.\n\n---\n\nMiss Flynn's Salary $110.00 Bonus $18.42 $128.42\nDeductions: Income Tax $20.30 Retirement $5.50 $25.80 Net $102.62\n\nMrs. C.J.

This has been going on of course for between two and three years and there has been a very wide sale in and around Vancouver and in smaller quantities farther afield. For quite a long time they proved very popular at Whitehorse while the Americans were in there in large numbers. At this time of year however, our markets seem to have dropped off and our small working capital is all tied up in stock. I am trying to place these articles in some new locations in Vancouver and Victoria also in the Hudson Bay Store in Edmonton and Saskatoon. I wrote to the General Purchasing Agent for the C.N.R. in Winnipeg some time ago but have had no reply from him.\n\nThe price we charge here, which in a sense is the \"wholesale price\" is shown on the sales slip enclosed with the articles. We have found that the mark-up on the gauntlets is usually 15\u00a2, on the chief's and squaws (which we sell at 90\u00a2 per pair) it amounts to 20\u00a2 or even 35\u00a2. The moccasins usually mark-up 15\u00a2 or 20\u00a2 depending on whether they have been fur trimmed or not.\nSince these are lapel novelties you can understand why we desire the brighter colours as they are intended to harmonize or contrast with women's garments. A certain number of the dark or paisley beads can be used when mixed with the brighter colours. Mrs. Robertson, the teacher, who is in charge of this work here has enclosed a pair of the dolls made with the dark colours and you can see that they are far from attractive. We can always use the white seed beads and also black for the head dress of the chiefs but we necessarily have to have reds for the faces. Red is one shade that we have the greatest difficulty in getting.\n\nYou mentioned pussy-willow and acorn designs and I expect you mean that these are on leather. We have had no experience with this here but perhaps you might draw a sketch of what you mean. Our dolls and moccasins are perhaps not original here at Sardis but as far as I know they are not being made in any quantity anywhere else in B.C. so that we have pretty well monopolized the market.\n\nWe would be very glad to have your impressions about the work and any suggestions you might care to make. I might say, incidentally that our patients receive all but 5\u00a2 or 10\u00a2 of the wholesale price shown besides which we supply the beads to them for nothing when they are given to us and at cost when we have to buy them.\n\nW.S.

The salary of Mrs. C. J. Robertson has been increased from $90.00 to $110.00 a teaching month and the salary of Miss Alice Flynn, from $95.00 to $110.00 a teaching month, both plus bonus. These increases are effective September 1, 1944.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nIn reply to Mr. Hoey's letter of April 19, file 153-29-1, I wish to submit a statement indicating something of the work done by our teachers during the past fiscal year.\n\nSchool instruction has been given to the following groups of children in the grades indicated:\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls |\n|-------|------|-------|\n| 1     | 32   | 20    |\n| 2     | 10   | 26    |\n| 3     | 8    | 4     |\n| 4     | 2    | 4     |\n| 5     | 4    | 3     |\n| 6     | 2    |       |\n| 7     | 1    |       |\n\nIt is to be remembered, of course, that in hospital work patients are changing so that the total number of children instructed cannot in any satisfactory way be reconciled with the total in the building at any one time.\nBesides the academic work shown above, occupational supervision has been given to 82 patients. Again it is difficult to arrive at any satisfactory estimate regarding the amount of time spent with such individuals as this varies greatly and is also affected by the turnover of patients. In some cases considerable attention is directed to this phase of the work and in fact the supervision of such diversional occupational work seems to be taking an increasing amount of the time of both teachers, but especially Mrs. Robertson.\n\nI trust that the information shown above is sufficient for the purposes of the Department.\n\nW.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nOttawa, October 1, 1945.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nYour letter dated the 23rd September, 1945, addressed to the Indian Affairs Branch, has been passed to this office for attention. For your information I wish to advise that during the period April 1st to June 30th, 1942, when you were employed by the Indian Affairs Branch you received a gross salary of $854.70, on which you paid $15.00 income tax. The amount of $11.25 was also deducted from this salary on account of Retirement Fund but was refunded to you on your retirement from the Service.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.W. McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nMiss Mary A. Scarrabelli,\n4001 West 33rd Avenue,\nVancouver, B.C.\nThe school grounds appeared in good condition, the school room very near and tidy. It looked as though someone was really caring for it.\n\nOrder and discipline were good during the time I was in the class room.\n\nI was very much pleased with the general standing of the pupils of your school. I observed their work in a number of the most important subjects, and in each case the result was good.\n\nMiss McGrand has been with you for a number of years, and I suppose you know her work as a teacher. You will do well to continue her services as long as possible. Your school ranks well.\n\nChas. A. Carow, Inspector.\n\nOrder is good, and relations existing between the teacher and pupils the very best.\n\nDuring the time I was in the room, I observed work in Arithmetic taken up by the teacher, and lessons in Literature and Reading with the different classes.\n\nPupils showed good interest in all the work. The lessons were exceptionally developed and the pupils showed by the way they expressed themselves, that they appreciated the work taken up. The Reading throughout the school is good, work done in Arithmetic is exceptionally good. The work in the exercise books is neat and tidy. The writing is good in nearly all cases.\n\nMiss McGrand is an outstanding teacher. You are indeed fortunate in being able to retain her services in your school.\n\nF.J. Rowan, Inspector.\n\nThe School is an up-to-date frame building, which is well lighted and ventilated. The class room is bright and attractive and clean.\n\nMiss McGrand is an efficient teacher, her methods being very satisfactory and the children making good progress. The teacher has evidently the good will of her pupils.\n\nHer classes were observed as follows:\n\nGrade 2, - The pupils have been in attendance for two months and are making satisfactory progress.\n\nGrades 4 & 5, - History pupils had a good knowledge of lesson. The written test in Arithmetic yields good results.\n\nGrade 6, - The Arithmetic in Vulgar Fractions and decimals good. Reading and Literature was taken in each grade. The subject matter of each lesson was appreciatively treated. The reading was quite good. The composition in higher grades was generally good. The writing throughout the school was very good.\n\nThe grading is satisfactory.\n\nA.E. Ross, Inspector.\nI found the pupils behaving in good form at this visit, the general tone of the school to be wholesome. Work habits are fairly steady and workmanship in written work shows care. Class exercises are of solid type. Your school is in safe hands.\n\nJ.R. Tealinson, Inspector.\n\nAndreashein, S.D. #976,\nOctober 22nd, 1939.\n\nDiscipline in the school seemed to be good. Relations between teacher and pupils were cordial. I do not hesitate to congratulate you on the standing of your school. Miss McCloud is an outstanding teacher who knows the work required in the school room, and whose methods of presenting the work are modern and effective. Pupils are interested in the work, and are making exceptionally good progress.\n\nDuring the morning classes taken by the teacher in Arithmetic and Literature, and Reading with all grades, were observed. In Arithmetic pupils from the different grades worked questions on the blackboard. Questions worked by all these pupils were most carefully posted and most accurately worked out. The work prescribed for each grade is being thoroughly covered.\n\nIn Literature the pupils showed interest, and appreciation of the selections taken up. They read with good expression. The writing throughout the school is good. The standing of your school is much above the average.\n\nF.W. Rowan, Inspector.\n\nAndreashein, S.D. #976,\nMay 23rd, 1930.\n\nThe pupils show an excellent attitude towards the work and apparently there is no question of discipline whatever.\n\nThe board is to be congratulated on being able to retain the services of such a capable teacher as Miss McCloud. The salary paid to her is good, but on the other hand the district gets value for the money paid.\n\nDuring the time I was in the room, I observed classes taken by the teacher in Literature and Reading, in Language work and Geography. I also took up work in Silent Reading tests, with grades 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8, and work with Grade 8 in Literature, Grammar and Civics.\n\nThe writing throughout the school is good. Pupils in Grade 8 respond well in all the work taken up. I would say that the four pupils in this grade should do well at the Departmental Exams, in June. Pupils in all the grades speak out with good expression.\n\nI would say the standing of the classes is good, and that the tone of the school is much above what we find in the majority of the rural schools.\n\nF.W. Rowan, Inspector.\nThe instruction in Reading for Grade 1 gave particular attention to a knowledge of words and fluency in Reading. There was an appeal to the imagination. Arithmetic was assigned seat work and then taken up in class.\n\nThe pupils need a lot of practice in Reading\u2014a certain measure of success has been achieved along the lines suggested. There are certain wrong habits in Arithmetic which the teacher is endeavoring to correct.\n\nThe teacher has an unusually happy method of dealing with all but more especially with the little ones. As more than two-thirds of the pupils are in Grades 1 and 2 this is fortunate. The teacher has the knack of appealing to the imagination of the pupils and inspiring them to put forth their best efforts.\n\nR.H. Ferris, Inspector.\n\nSuterham, S.D. #4689,\nDecember 8th, 1937.\n\nAbsence on the day of my visit was due to the weather roads and attendance at church. Written tests were given in Spelling, Arithmetic, Language and Citizenship and the results obtained were good. Grade 2 were tested orally in Reading and Number Work and were found to be good. Oral tests were given in Geography and Home Economics to several grades and the results were satisfactory.\n\nMiss McGrand seems to be doing conscientious work in this school and to have the co-operation of her pupils. The general tone of her class-room is good. I must say that I enjoyed very much my afternoon in your class-room. I was sorry to hear she was planning to leave your district.\n\nW.D. Brennan, Inspector.\n\nSuterham, S.D. #4689,\nMay 28th, 1938.\n\nIn Grade 1 writing was excellent; the number work was up to standard and the pupils showed a good grounding in reading. In Grade 2 writing, number work reading and spelling were all very satisfactory and the pupils examined will certainly be ready for promotion in June. In Grade 3 and 4 the pupils took high marks in Arithmetic but those in Grade 5 need a review in fractions. Grades 7 and 8 will have to do more thorough work.\n\nIn view of the conditions under which Miss McGrand has worked I feel that she has achieved wonderful results, and it must have meant a lot of hard conscientious labor on her part to put the school where it is at present. There is every evidence that she has given the district conscientious service and that her pupils have made progress.\n\nW.D. Brennan, Inspector.\nYour school is modern and has been well preserved. This shows that the teacher has trained the pupils to be careful of the premises.\n\nIn general I was well pleased with the condition of the classes. Good order is maintained. The teacher and pupils are working harmoniously together. The pupils show a real interest in their work.\n\nAs you have retained Miss McGrand for several years, I take it that both teacher and trustees are satisfied. You are getting fine service from Miss McGrand. No doubt you will retain her for years to come.\n\nJames Little, Inspector.\n\nMiss McGrand continues to do effective and satisfactory service.\n\nIn the subjects noted the pupils are making decided advance, and if they only remain in school you would soon bring your school up to be equal to the best.\n\nF.J. Bates, Inspector.\n\nI examined the Grade 2 orally and was well pleased with the progress they are making. Written tests were given in Language, Geography, Home Economics, History, Health Education and Spelling. I found one or two pupils weak in Spelling in junior grades, but on the whole the results were very gratifying. Miss McGrand has been doing faithful and efficient work and all subjects are receiving their fair quota of attention. On the whole I was quite favorably impressed with the results of this inspection.\n\nDiscipline was good and of the right kind.\n\nD.L. Hicks, Inspector.\n\nWork of good or excellent quality was done by the pupils during the afternoon. High quality is demanded in all written exercises and most books show this clearly. Recitation of memory verses was given in good style; there was good aim in expression. Language work in Grade 5 was clear and correct. This class also shows good progress in Geography. Lower grades are doing well in all their exercises.\n\nMiss McGrand is a strong, earnest and thoughtful teacher. The pupils are doing well under her guidance.\n\nC.E. Brown, Inspector.\nThe whole work of your school is progressing in a very satisfactory manner. The pupils seem to be enjoying their work, respond readily to the teacher's leading, and are acquiring habits of study and attention to work.\n\nThe reading in all grades is especially good and arithmetic is well up to standard. The school should make much progress under this teacher.\n\nF.W. Bates, Inspector.\nArchdiocese of Vancouver  \nArchbishop's Office  \n648 Richards Street  \nVancouver, B.C.  \nAugust 27, 1946\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay  \nIndian Commissioner for B. C.  \nP. O.

She has a certificate from Saskatchewan issued in 1941. In my letter to her on June 26th I mentioned that I would recommend her. I am glad to recommend her officially for the position at Sardis.\n\nI have received a good recommendation from Sister Reta of St. John, N.B., who recommends her as a good dependable woman.\n\nWe have a prospect for a school in the person of John J. O'Connor who, while not a teacher, is 37 years of age, married, and a graduate of St. Michael's University of Toronto, with B.A. and M.A. from the John Carroll University of Cleveland, in Sociology.\n\nI thought, due to the circumstances and the dire need of teachers, Mr. O'Connor might open one of the schools rather than leave it closed, and I was thinking of the Homalco Indian Day School.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nW.

Due to the incorporation of the bonus in the basic salary, Miss McGrand will be allowed salary at the rate of $137.00 a teaching month. This will be subject to a deduction of 5% for Retirement Fund and Income Tax, if applicable. You should have her complete and return the usual forms as soon as she begins duties.\n\nBernard F.

We cannot reconcile this deduction with the figure quoted on the table of Income Tax Deductions for 1947.\n\nIn the case of Mrs. Robertson, form TD1 (revised for 1947) was submitted in December and it is noted that Mrs. Robertson claims married status by virtue of supporting her husband, Charles James Robertson who is an invalid. We might say that Mrs. Robertson has always been granted married status since her employment here and we can find nothing on our file copy of the recently submitted TD1 form which would suggest that she might be deprived of this standing. If there is anything irregular in the form as submitted, would you be good enough to advise to enable us to have Mrs. Robertson prepare an amended document.\n\n(signed)\nW. S.

However, I might mention that ever since we have had teachers on our staff, the only desk arrangement which I was able to make, was the placing of two of the small drop-leaf writing desks which were originally placed in various of the staff living quarters. Proper teachers' desks have been requested on previous occasions and have not been forthcoming, but now that we have not only two teachers, but in addition, a vocational instructor, the matter of desk accommodation and work area is much more urgent. I wonder if you could take it on yourself to try and secure two \"teachers' desks\" at once?\n\nLest it be surmised that a purchase order for some office equipment which was placed this summer, I believe, on behalf of this hospital was to provide for the teachers' office, might I say that on the contrary, these particular items were to make up for shortages in our medical offices.\n\nW.

Perhaps it would be advisable for Miss Gerry to make arrangements for hotel or other accommodation for Miss Best for January 1st.\n\nI gather from your phone conversation the other day, that since the Department has authorized the placing of Miss Best at Kamloops or Lytton, they will be cognizant of the fact that she will be leaving our hospital staff and that change in pay arrangements would be made automatically. Probably I should add that Miss Best would be quite willing to go to Kamloops and since she had had little or no experience in driving, it might be better to have her working out of Kamloops than out of Lytton.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

According to Mrs. Robertson, Miss McGrand, evidently is finding her funds being steadily depleted and certain plans she had in mind for the Christmas Season have been modified. In fact, should she not receive some of her salary, I gather that she will not be able to do some visiting during Christmas vacation that she had planned.\n\nW. S.

Barclay's letter of November 27th. You will note that Dr. Barclay expresses considerable concern over the fact that under the present regulations Miss McGrand may not be employed, for the reason that she in good faith came all the way from New Brunswick at her own expense and has fitted well into the work at the Hospital, and together with Mrs. Robertson is contributing extensively to the satisfactory progress of the patients.\n\nI cannot agree with Dr. Barclay's statement with respect to the obligation of the Archbishop to check on this teacher before nominating her, as in reviewing our file it is noted that Dr. Barclay's office intimated that Miss McGrand was only 35 years of age and it was on this understanding that Archbishop Duke's nomination was recommended.\n\nThe Doctor's recommendation that Miss McGrand be employed on a casual basis is endorsed. I would appreciate further word from the Department as soon as possible as apparently Dr. Barclay has not yet notified Miss McGrand that her appointment has been rescinded.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nCoqualeetza Indian Hospital,\nSardis, B. C.\nNovember 27th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Miss McGrand.\n\nI was rather dismayed to note the contents of your letter of November 18th, file 107-3-5759, and I have tried to check the situation here.\n\nActually, it seems that we have practically no information on file on Miss McGrand either before she came or even since her arrival. Your file reference to her age as being 50, is probably the result of a verbal conversation with myself when I expect I quoted Mrs. Robertson as saying that she believed Miss McGrand would be about the same age as herself; namely, \"around 55\".\n\nI have enquired from Mrs. Robertson as to what she knows further about this matter and it appears that Miss McGrand retired on superannuation (in Saskatchewan I believe) some four years or so ago. Correspondence that developed between Mrs. Robertson and her own cousins or perhaps between Mrs. Robertson and Miss McGrand, evidently included a statement from Miss McGrand that she felt too active and energetic to wish to continue in retirement. One must naturally assume that the retiring age was 60, so that her official age as now reported is probably correct.\n\nIt seems to me that the Archbishop was under some obligation to check on this matter before her final nomination. Altogether the matter has now resolved itself into a most unfortunate situation. Miss McGrand came all the way from New Brunswick, I believe, at her own expense. Since no Catholic nomination was forthcoming from last Christmas until well after the school term began this fall, I think the Department can ill-afford to take the stand at this time that her services must be dispensed with.\nOttawa, 14 November 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 8th instant with reference to the appointment of Miss Ethel McGrand as teacher at the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital.\n\nFrom the information given on the Staff questionnaire, it appears that she was 65 years of age on Sept. 6th last. Present regulations require us to obtain special permission if any person continues in Government employ after reaching the age of 65. It is practically impossible to make a first appointment for any person who has already reached the age of 65.\n\nUnder the circumstances, we regret very much that we cannot engage Miss McGrand.\n\nBernard F.

A. Sutherland\nMethodist Mission Rooms\nToronto\n\nSECOY'S BRANCH,\nAPR 5 - 1892\nWRITTEN.\n\nRev Sir,\n\nI am directed by\nthe S.G. of go to seek the\nrect through Senator\nSanford of yr. letter of the\n29th ult. re. the\ndestruction by fire of the\nCoqualeetza Home at\nChilliwack B.C., & the\nintention of the Miss'ry\nDept. of the Methodist\nCh. to rebuild the same,\nalso in regard to the\npurchase of a site for\na new building, & the\ncost to which the\nMethodist Church will\nbe put in re-establishing\nthe institution.\n\nI am to inform\nIn that note has been taken of the statements made in your letter, & the S.G. has decided to include in the supplementary Estimates for the present year the sum of \u00a32500 to assist in the re-establishment of the old institution, & the Parliament vote that ain't, it will be available after the 1st July next in the usual evidence being filed in the Dept that work in the erection of the building has been done to at least the extent of the grant.\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to submit the following memorandum of matters connected with Indian Institute work at Chilliwack B.C. and respectfully recommend the same to the favorable consideration of the Superintendent-General.\n\nA few years ago an Institute for Indian Girls was erected at Chilliwack by the Canadian Missionary Society of the Methodist Church and was maintained by them until recently with very excellent results. As you are doubtless aware a grant was made by the government in aid of the building and also a subsequent annual grant in aid of maintenance. A few months ago the building was accidentally burned, but a number of the pupils were taken into the adjacent mission house.\nHouse, and since then a temporary building has been erected for school purposes, so that there has not been much interruption of the work of the Institute. The building was insured and the loss is but slightly aught on furniture and personal possessions of teachers.\n\nThe burning of the building (known as the Cogwaltza Home) raised the question of more extended efforts in the future. A conference was held between representatives of the General Missionary Society of the Methodist Church and the Canadian Missionary Society, the result being an agreement to carry on Institute work corporately for both boys and girls. A site of 20 acres has been purchased about a quarter of a mile south of the Sandis Post Office, being a portion of what is known as the Webb Farm, and instructions have been given.\ngiven to T. Cooper Esq., architect,\nVictoria B.C., to prepare preliminary\nsketches of the necessary buildings.\nThe proposal is to erect two separate\nbuildings, to accommodate 50 resident\npupils each, one for boys and the\nother for girls, and between these a\nbuilding for ordinary school purposes\ncommon to both Institutes. The general\nplan also includes the necessary barn\nand stable accommodation and\nalso workshops in which the boys may\nbe instructed in such trades as may be\njudged expedient. The cost of the site\nalone was $2000 and although we\nshall not know the cost of the buildings\nuntil the plans are complete and\ntenders received, yet it is estimated that\nby the time the Institute is ready for\noccupation an expenditure of some\n$15,000 will have been incurred. The\nresponsibility for this expenditure will be\nassumed.\nassumed for the present by the two previously mentioned societies in about the following proportions:\u2014The Woman's Missionary Society will assume the cost of say three acres of the site at $125 per acre. They will also assume the entire cost of the building for the Girls' department, with necessary surroundings, and one-half the cost of the building for school purposes. The remaining cost will be assumed for the present by the General Missionary Society of the Methodist Church. In the management of the Institute while each society will have control of its own department, that is, the General Society supporting and controlling the Boys' Institute and the Woman's Society discharging the same duties with regard to the Girls, yet in its scope and purpose the enterprise is one, and may be so regarded by the Government in any correspondence or dealings.\ndealings regarding it. I have been particular in giving this detailed information, having been informed that the Canadian Missionary Society have applied by petition for a grant in aid of their department, which, if granted, will have a bearing on the total amount of aid to the whole enterprise, which the government may be disposed to give.\n\nAs soon as the plans are ready, there will be a copy sent forward for the information of the Department; but in all probability they will not be ready before the adjournment of the House. In view of this circumstance I am instructed by the Missionary Committee to submit this memorandum at once to the Superintendent-General, so that it may be considered in connection with the supplementary estimates to be laid before the House at the present session.\nand to apply on the basis of the facts therein contained for a preliminary grant in aid of the contemplated buildings. Should this application be favorably entertained, as we trust it will be, the desired aid may be given either in a separate grant to each society or in one grant to both to be afterwards divided proportionately between the two departments of the work.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo the Honourable\n\nThe Superintendent General\n\nOf Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nRev. Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th September last I beg to state in reply to that portion thereof which deals with the question of providing a grant for the purpose of erecting a residence for the Principal of the Coqualeetsa Home, that the Department considers it desirable for the Principal or at least two or three male officers of the school to live in the building, as too much care cannot be exercised in guarding over the actions of pupils of the ages of those domiciled in the Coqualeetsa Institute, both by day and night, especially where the co-education of the sexes exists. For this reason, therefore, the Department should consider the grant applied for.\n\nWhile admitting that the Institute building is over-crowded, I would call your attention to the fact that it is owing to more pupils being received than there is accommodation for, or for whom provision is made. There are now 92 pupils in the school while the grant only provides for 80, which is 30 pupils in excess of the number provided for at any other Industrial school in British Columbia.\n\nShould, however, the Department ever consider itself able to further increase the number of pupils, the Department will be glad to provide for them.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland D.D.,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6423, file 869-5, part 1)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 2nd December, 1901\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nReferring to the application of the Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society for a grant of $2500.00 to provide for a residence for the Principal of the Coqualeetza Home, I beg to say that Mr Agent Devlin reports that there is no question of the necessity for more suitable quarters for the Principal and his family as the accommodation at present set apart for them is entirely inadequate.\n\nMr Sunt. Vowell, who reported on this application on the 17th Oct., last stated his reason for not approving the Principal's taking up his residence outside the building, which was that with pupils of the ages of those domiciled in the Coqualeetza Institute and other such institutions in the Province, too much care cannot be exercised by the Principal of the school in guarding over their actions both by day and night especially where the co-education of the sexes exists.\n\nThere are 92 pupils now in the school, including 57 boys who are between 15 and 18 years of age. There is only one male teacher living in the building besides the Principal, and he is the instructor in shoemaking and I think with Mr Vowell that if the Principal lives outside the building too much responsibility would be thrown on this officer. It seems to me that it would be better to enlarge the present building than to run the risk of the troubles that might arise through the Principal's living outside.\n\nPlans have been received through Mr Vowell from Rev. Mr Hall for this house which the architect\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary\nestimates would cost $2950.00 but which could be reduced by using the labor of the pupils to the amount originally asked for, $2500.00.

There is no question of the necessity for more suitable quarters for the Principal and his family, as the present accommodation already set apart for them is entirely inadequate. I enclose for your information a Plan furnished by Mr. Hall showing the building proposed to be erected and which is intended to be built only a few yards south of the present School Building. At the present time there are nearly two pupils in the School besides a staff of seven lady teachers and one Male teacher (Instructor in Blacksmithing) besides the Principal and his family, all residing under the one roof. You can easily understand how crowded they must be. Mr. Hall informs me that he has affected the health of certain members of his family, which I can readily believe.

Mr. Hooper's estimate of cost complete for occupancy is $2,950.00 which will nevertheless enable me to complete the structure for the amount suggested ($2,500.00) with the assistance which can be furnished by our Carpenter Mr. Pearson and the boys in attendance at the institution. Mr. Hooper planned our Institute building and knows well how inadequate are the accommodations in that building for a principal and his family, and how numerous and serious must have been the inconveniences we have had to endure in the past and he is kind enough to allude to this in his letter which accompanied the plans, and which I forward herewith.\n\nTrusting that the plans will meet your approval,\nI have the honor to remain,\nyours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Joe Hall\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, for a grant of $2500.00 to provide a residence for the Principal of the Coqualeetza Institute, I beg to say that Mr. Supt. Vowell, who was written to for a report on this matter, has replied that he considers that this school should at least make a determined effort to provide for its own requirements in the direction of increased accommodation for its pupils and staff and that even if money were available for the purpose he would be strongly inclined to deprecate the granting of aid in the direction requested as experience has proved that with pupils of the age domiciled in the Coqualeetza Institute and other such institutions in the Province too much care cannot be exercised by the Principal of the school in guarding over their actions both by day and night especially where the co-education of the sexes exists, and for this reason he considers it advisable for the Principal to reside under the same roof as his pupils.\n\nMr. Supt. Vowell forwards a copy of a letter from Mr. Hall, the Principal, urging his claim for a grant and also a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Agent Devlin for a special report on this application. Mr. Devlin's report has not yet reached the Department, but I think you should have Mr. Vowell's views before you.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6423, file 869-5, part 1)\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant informing me that Reverend Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, has applied for a grant of $2500.00 to provide a residence for the Principal of the Coqualeetza Institute.\n\nIn this connection I beg to state that a communication dated the 3rd of September last was received from the Reverend Joseph Hall, Principal of the Coqualeetza Institute, embodying a similar application, and the subject was brought to the attention of Mr. Agent Devlin in a letter to him from this office under date of the 6th ultimo, No. 179. V. 3. For your information I enclose a copy of the Principal's letter as well as a copy of the letter from this office addressed to Mr. Agent Devlin. So far Mr. Devlin has not replied to the letter sent him, and I am at a loss to account for his apparent inaction in the matter. I shall again write to the Agent requesting him to give the question his\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nhis early and close attention. So soon as Mr. Devlin is heard from you will be again communicated with.\n\nFor your information I may remark that the Coqualeetza Institute is in receipt of a large annual grant - based on the per capita attendance, as is the case with other such institutions in the superintendency - and having been in operation for many years should, by this time, be in a position to provide the labor, or the bulk of it, for the work of erection of the proposed structure. Many of the pupils of the school are no doubt competent to perform the work required in such an undertaking; and it is considered that no better practice could be found as an outlet for their mechanical skill. By dint of the observance of economy for a few years sufficient funds should be forthcoming for the purchase of the necessary material for the building.\n\nAs remarked in the letter to Mr. Agent Devlin the Coqualeetza Institute is most favorably situated as to the economical maintenance of such a large number of pupils as it has within its portals; and for this reason I consider that the school should, at least, make a determined effort to provide for its own requirements in the direction of increased accommodation for its pupils and staff.\n\nEven were the money available for the purpose for which application has been made for it I should be strongly inclined to deprecate the granting of aid in the direction requested, for experience has proved that with pupils of the age of those\nthose domiciled in the Coqualeetza Institute, and other such institutions in the province, that too much care cannot be exercised by the Principal of the school in guarding over their actions both by night and by day, especially where co-education of the sexes exists and for this reason it is considered advisable for the Principal to reside under the same roof as his pupils.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedt.

Sept. 3rd, 1901.\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\n\nIndian Superintendent,\n\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to advise you of a recent action of the advisory board of our institute, who on being made acquainted with the serious inconveniences to which myself as Principal, and my family have been subjected for the past five years for want of suitable accommodation, passed a resolution, addressed to the executive board of the Missionary Society and therein urged upon the attention of that body the urgent need which exists for the erection of a suitable residence for the principal, and requesting that the sum of $2500.00 be set apart by the Missionary Society for that purpose. The reason for the discomfort complained of arose out of the fact that when our Institute was planned no provision was made for a resident Principal and family. A reply has been received to the request, admitting the urgent need which exists for such a residence; but pointing out that already a very large amount of money has been expended in buildings, land and equipment for the Institute, amounting in all to more than $36000., besides considerable sums for maintenance; and that the society are unable in view of the great extent of the work in which they are engaged in carrying on, and the present state of their funds, to divert a further sum.\nsum in the direction of more fully equipping this Institute. They further intimate that as they have received but $5000. in the past towards the cost of Institute buildings and land, from the Indian Department, in their judgement highly proper for the Indian Department to make the grant asked for, for this purpose. They also inform me that they have already on more than one occasion made representations to the Government on this behalf; and assure our advisory board that in response to their representations on the subject they will again approach the Minister of the Interior in the matter, and trust to be able to make such representations as will result in securing the grant needed for this purpose. On receiving the above information, I at once conferred with A.C.Wells Esq., Reeve of Chilliwack and Chairman of our advisory board, and intimated the hope that he might be able shortly to accompany me to Victoria, with a view of calling upon you and trusting that we might set the matter before you and secure your recommendation to the Department that the sum above specified might be granted for the said purpose. To this Mr. Wells was quite agreeable, both because of his sense of the importance of the work to himself and family, and because he has so long enjoyed as one of the Pioneer of British Columbia, the honor and privilege of a personal acquaintance with yourself.\n\nThis morning I learned at an early hour that Mr. Wells was called suddenly to Victoria on a matter of business, and that as I could not arrange to accompany him on such short notice, he would take\nadvantage of his short stay in Victoria to seek the privilege of an interview with you for the purpose of laying the matter before you from his point of view. I may say that the other evening quite unexpectedly to myself, I was privileged to meet Aulay Morrison Esq., M.P., for our district, who had come up to Chilliwack in connection with his professional duties; and Mr. Wells also being in Chilliwack, we together called upon Mr. Morrison, and informed him of the present state of our case. Mr. Morrison assured me of his sympathy with us and also that he would certainly do all in his power to secure the grant required in the interests of our Institute.\n\nTrusting that you will in the goodness of your heart join with the others mentioned in securing or seeking to secure the so much needed residence for the Principal of Coqualeetza Institute,\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n(sgd) Joseph Hall.\n\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith for your information and report thereon an application made to this office by the Revd. Joseph Hall the Principal of the Coqualeetza Institute, for assistance in the way of a money grant by the Department of $2500.00 to erect a residence for the principal of the Coqualeetza Institute in proximity to the School buildings. I may remark that such applications are unusual, this being, I believe, the first one of the kind made in this Superintendency. In all other instances provision is generally made at the time of building the various schools for accommodation for the Principal in several of the rooms of the School building itself. You will please make a full report, based on your own knowledge, of the necessity or otherwise of providing such a structure; and when forwarding your report it will be necessary for you to obtain from the Principal a plan of the proposed residence. If the Principal consents to supplying the plan and Specifications the Institution will have to bear the cost thereof. In making your report the fact that the school is provided with a grant of $130.00 each per annum for 80 pupils should be borne in mind. It should also be remembered that this is the only\n\nFrank Devlin, Esq.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nInstitution in the Province drawing such a large grant ($10,400.00 a year) and it would seem that with the facilities for farming which the Institution possesses, and the consequent possibility of reducing expenditure, by the raising of cattle, crops of all kinds, and the production of eggs, milk, butter and other such valuable commodities, such a saving should be effected annually as to preclude the necessity of their requesting Departmental aid in the erection of the Principal's residence.\n\nThe School is situated in what might be termed the garden of British Columbia, where nature is most bounteous in the provision made for the sustenance of the inhabitants of that favored locality. Surely with the grant made by the Department and the possibilities of the district in the way of its agricultural capabilities it should not be a difficult matter for the management of the Institution to save in a few years what would be sufficient to erect a residence, when the fact is taken into consideration that many of the lads of the school are adepts in the use of tools of all kinds.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant.\n\n(sgd) A.W.

I do not know whether Mr. Aulay Morrison, M. P., has taken any action with regard to this matter or not but I would be glad to know if Mr. Vowell has done anything.\n\nDeputy Supt-General.\nHon Clifford Sifton,\nOttawa.\n\nMy Dear Mr Sifton,\n\nThere are one or two matters in connection with the Indian schools, &c., in British Columbia, to which I venture to call your attention. For a number of years we have asked for a grant of $500 for the Boys' Home at Port Simpson, but hitherto it has not been granted. It seems to us that it is a very reasonable request, and I sincerely hope you will see your way to include it in the estimates for next year.\n\nA still more urgent matter is the question of a residence for the Principal of the Coqualeetza Institute. You are aware that only a small amount was received from the Government for land and buildings, and that the greater portion of the cost has been borne by the Missionary Society, which is indirect contrast with the experience of all other Institutes in British Columbia. But there are other and yet stronger reasons for action in the present instance. In the building as originally planned no provision was made for the Principal's accommodation, and he and his family have been subjected to a great deal of inconvenience which, however, they have very patiently borne for the sake of the work; but new circumstances are such that it would seem imperative that something should be done. In a private letter received from\nthe Rev Mr Hall he details the reasons for pressing this request at the present time, and if you desire I will send you his letter. There is at the Coqualeetza Institute an Advisory Committee of persons in the neighborhood, and in considering the whole question they strongly recommend the immediate erection of a house for the Principal, and have mentioned the sum of $2,500 as the amount which in their judgment would be required. If anything can be done it is important it should be done at once, and if you can see your way to put the above, or some other, sum in the estimates for next year, we would in the meantime advance the money, if necessary, and take our chances of the item being voted by Parliament. I understand that the local member, Mr Morrison, has enquired into the matter and gives it his support.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nA. Sutherland\nIn further reference to my letter dated 7th instant relative to increasing the grant to the Coqualeetza School and more especially in respect to the increased accommodation required at that Institution should more pupils be admitted. I have the honour to transmit herewith plans and elevations of the buildings which will be required also a plan submitted by Mr. Principal Hogg of the Institute and Estimate of cost made by Mr. Hooper Architect. It is noted that Mr. Hooper has not furnished a specification of the items on which he bases his estimates but he promises to furnish such or any other information that may be required.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nFor\nYour obedient Servant\nA.

As the work is being pushed forward with all reasonable speed, the amount will soon be very considerably increased. Drafts have been forwarded from this office to our local agent in British Columbia to a larger amount than that stated in Mr. Hooper's certificate.\n\nI would request therefore that the first installment voted by Parliament, which I imagine will lapse on the 30th of June next, if not paid, be forwarded to this office so you will see that considerably more than that amount has already been expended on the work.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The plans have been approved of substantially in their present shape by our missionary committee and instructions have gone forward to the architect to prepare working plans with certain slight modifications that have been suggested and to ask for tenders for both brick and frame superstructure.\n\nMr. Hooper's estimate for the present building of frame with stone foundations is $1500 which includes heating, plumbing, water closets and water supply. Provision is not yet made for out-buildings or workshops which are deferred for the present.\npresent.\n\nLast year a grant of $2500. was made by the department which just represents the cost of the land\u2014namely, 20 acres. When that grant was applied for it was mentioned as being purely preliminary, as at that time we could not tell what the cost of the buildings would be. As the cost is now ascertained approximately at least I would respectfully ask that the matter be taken into consideration with a view to such a grant in the estimates of the coming year as may seem fair and equitable. The cost above stated, of course, does not include furnishings nor equipment of any kind and as this will amount to a considerable sum we earnestly hope that the Department will be able to grant any substantial aid.\n\nIt has occurred to me that the accompanying...\naccompanying sketch though not affording sufficient accommodation for the proposed new building at Munsey may nevertheless be useful as affording some indication of what can be done at moderate cost.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. Sutherland\n\nTo the Honorable\n\nThe Superintendent\n\nOf Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of December 9th, No 120292, referring to our request that provision be made to build a residence for the Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Institute, and intimating that the Department is unable to make a grant in the way suggested; but that if anything is done it might be satisfactory to put up an addition to the main building, to be used as a dwelling by the Principal, and have a passage connecting it with the school.\n\nIn order that the Department may be in possession of all necessary data, I am writing to the Principal requesting that a sketch plan of the grounds be forwarded, showing the location of the present buildings, and whether it would be practicable in any way to carry out the suggestion made by the Department. In the meantime permit me to say that it is not the number of pupils in the Institute which makes it necessary to provide separate quarters for the Principal, for even if the number was reduced it would only make a little more room in the dormitories, but would not leave vacant any room that could be occupied by the Principal and his family. In the event of the Principal occupying a separate building, it is not the intention to leave the main building.\nwithout the constant presence of a male teacher or other officer. On this point, also, I will ask for definite information from the Principal.\n\nRequesting that the matter be held in abeyance until further information is available,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, 17th December, 1907.\n\nRev.

A. Sutherland,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto,\nOnt.\nSpeaking further of this point, in another connection,\n\nMr Hall remarks:\n\n\"To erect an entire, or semi-detached residence, that would correspond with the main building in its general features, would involve an expense that the Government would hardly like to assume. I do not wish to be thought to press for any special idea of my own in the matter of the residence, so that the thing itself is provided. I feel sorry to put the Government to trouble for me. But the matter from one point of view is so urgent that I cannot refrain from pressing it; and I do sincerely hope that the relief will come, and as speedily as possible.\"\n\nThe last sentence contains the gist of the matter from Mr Hall's point of view. In a private issue to me the need of a residence for the Principal is urged on domestic grounds that I am sure would weigh strongly in deciding the case if I were at liberty to repeat them.\n\nHoping that it may be possible to make the necessary provision,\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nTo the Honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs:\nOTTAWA, 17th February, 1902\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nUnder date of the 27th January last Rev. Dr Sutherland forwarded a blue print showing the grounds and buildings of the Coqualeetza Industrial school in connection with a previous application for a residence for the Principal of that Institution.\n\nDr Sutherland's letter embodies extracts from correspondence from Rev. Mr Hall, the Principal of the school in which he claims that there is urgent necessity for the building applied for; and Dr Sutherland, while endorsing Mr Hall's statement says that in a private letter to him the need of a residence for the Principal is urged on domestic grounds that he is sure to weigh strongly in deciding the case if he were at liberty to repeat them.\n\nYour will see on reference to the draft letter prepared by the Deputy Minister on the 9th December last in reply to Dr Sutherland's previous application above referred to that one of the principal reasons for not acceding to the request was that the Department considered it advisable for the Principal or at least two or three male officers of the school to live in the building.\n\nThe census return for the Fraser River Agency shows that out of a total population of 2859 Indians, only 159 are Methodists, the remainder being nearly all Roman Catholics. This school is in receipt of a grant of $130 for each of 80 pupils while\nthe last return shows 92 to be in residence. Fifty pupils is the highest number allowed to the other six Industrial schools in the Province.\n\nThe proposed residence would cost about $2500.00 for which funds are asked.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This has since been drawn to scale, and I am sending you a \"Blue Print\" copy under separate cover. Mr Hall, speaking of the proposal for a separate building, says:\n\n\"I explained that our shoemaker, a fine young man who is doing well and likes the work, resides in the Institute, and will continue to do so. My thought, too, was to have telephone connection with the Institute, so that I might be called at any hour of the night when my presence might be desirable. I could be on hand as soon as if I were in the building, as the distance would not exceed a hundred feet. Mr Devlin's suggestion was to do away with the lane on the south side of the Principal's residence, to which there could be no objection. The two buildings might have the same frontage, with the exception of a low fence to separate the grounds of the Institute from those of the Principal's residence.\"\n\n\"It might be thought that the Principal's residence might be placed close to the Institute on the south side as there is a space of 44 feet and 3 inches between the main building and the lane, and the lane might be placed a little more distant so as to afford needed space. To my mind there are at least two objections to this. 1st. The new building would shade and darken what is now the bright side of the main building, but I suppose that is what happens every day in the cities. Still it is not desirable if it can be avoided, and in the country there is supposed to be room. 2nd. With the two buildings so close the contrast would be so marked as to detract from the favorable impression on the beholder which the present building now presents. Still I suppose that utilitarian considerations, if they are very important, ought to prevail. To make an addition to the present building would involve much larger expense, and I do not well see how it could be done.\"\nOTTAWA, 19th February, 1902\n\nRev.

You visited the Institute for the purpose of inquiring into the matter, and on ascertaining the facts, reported to the Department recommending the grant asked for. A plan of building which it was thought would be suitable was forwarded to the department but the government did not see fit to place a sum in the estimates for this purpose. Their objection was to a detached building, as removing the principal too far from the main building for the purposes of that oversight which a principal should maintain. To annexed apartments it was intimated there would not be the same objection. I would like to say that I have no objection to this suggestion. Anything would be an improvement upon the present inadequacy of accommodation for myself and family. It will be evident however that to annex apartments to the present structure would be to impair the symmetry of the main building, which would be regretable. The department might perhaps conclude, in view of this fact, that a detached building might be placed so near to the main building as to be connected by a covered and enclosed walk, and by an electric bell so that I might be called any time night or day if needed and thus answer practically the same purpose as annexed apartments. Besides if apartments were added on to the present building they would have to be of brick, (the same material as the present building) whereas a detached building might be of frame, costing less and not impairing symmetry.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6423, file 869-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe reasons are principally three on the grounds of which I would urge my request upon the favorable consideration of the department.\n\nFirst; the inadequacy and unsuitableness of the apartments at present occupied by the principal and his family. Upon this point I need not enlarge, as your attention has already been called to it, and you understand the situation. Besides this feature of the case has been brought to the notice of the department by the authorities of the Missionary Society from year to year for several years past, and ours is the only Institute in the Dominion, (as I believe) where provision has not been made specially for the principal's family.\n\nSecondly; for the sake of the private and family life of the principal's household. As it is we have none. Ours is hotel life. There is one dining room for the staff and the principal's family, and all dine together. Many reasons suggest themselves why this should not be the case, reasons which will at once suggest themselves to everyone before whom this request may come.\n\nThirdly; the last reason which I shall adduce is involved in the one just given, but I desire to draw special attention to it because of its bearing upon the discipline of the institution. It does not comport with the position of authority which the principal occupies that he should be placed in such relations of familiarity with the employees as to weaken the respect which is due to him. \"A prophet is not without honor save in his own country and among his own kindred\". Familiarity is abused by engendering a sense of equality.\n\nI trust that the government will kindly accede to this request and place the sum of $2,500 in the estimates of the present year for the purpose of a principal's residence.\n\nThis request may be thought to come rather late for this year. It might be brought in under the head of supplementary estimates.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\nIndian Office, Victoria, B.C.\n\nMarch 31st 1903.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith for the consideration of the Department letter dated 27th ultimo from Mr. Agent Dewlin, Fraser Agency, together with the enclosure therein referred to, being letter from the Principal of Coqualeetza Home, at Chilliwack, renewing a former request (which was sent Department under cover of letter from this office on 18th November 1901, No 363, W.S.) for a grant of the sum of $500, wherewith to build a residence for his use in connection with the School under his charge.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant.\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs:\nOTTAWA, 9th April, 1903.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe Principal of the Coqualeetza Industrial school under date of the 12th ultimo, writes Mr Agent Devlin requesting that the sum of $2500.00 be placed in next year's estimates for the purpose of providing a residence for him.\n\nSimilar applications have been before the Department for over two and a half years. In reply to the last application, Rev. Dr Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, was informed on the 19th Feb., 1902 that the Department could not undertake any further expenditure on account of this school at present.\n\nA great deal might be said both for and against the provision of a separate residence for the Principal, and this was thoroughly dealt with in my memorandum of the 2nd Dec., 1901 and Mr Smart's letter to Dr Sutherland of the 9th of that month.\n\nI do not know what family the Principal has but Mr Agent Devlin has stated that the accommodation afforded by his present quarters is quite insufficient. It may be stated that the school is carrying about 14 more pupils than there is provision for and it receives a grant for 30 more pupils than any other industrial school in British Columbia, so being allowed. When the building was put up it was not contemplated that more than 50 would be in residence.\nresidence. The extra 30 pupils allowed inadvertently and they have been carried ever since, creating jealousy on the part of the other schools.\n\nThere are no funds available and it might be well to let this matter stand another year until the whole school question has been thoroughly gone into.\n\nMr Hall has lived thirteen years in his present quarters and even if his family has outgrown them it is thought that he might manage for a while longer.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The papers relating to this question have been carefully examined; and I find that the only point upon which no information is forthcoming from them is the present location of the Principal's quarters within the building. I should be glad to receive from you sketches of a plan of the different floors of the Institution, showing the way in which the space is divided.\n\nI hope that you have material on file in your office in order that it may not be necessary to consume time in sending to the school for them.\n\nThe same objection which is held against the non-adjacency of the Principal is that proper discipline cannot be maintained. I cannot think that this objection is met by the residence of the Principal that the shoe-maker resides in the same building and will continue to do so.\n\nI should not care to submit to the Superintendent-General any scheme involving the expenditure of more money at this school without being convinced that this objection could be met by suitable quarters being provided within the walls of the present Institution for the Principal and his family. In the few instances in which the Department has erected separate buildings for the Principal, discipline in the main building is assured by the residence of competent and trust-worthy officials, but I may say that not of late has any grant been made for this purpose although the objections have not been few.\n\nRev.

Dr Sutherland has again applied for a grant for the erection of a private dwelling house for the Principal of the Coqualeetza school. This matter has been before the Department on two previous occasions, when it was decided not to make a grant for this purpose. The reason for arriving at this decision was that the Department considered the proper place for the Principal to live was in the school. I can see no good reason for any change of opinion in this respect.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6423, file 869-5, part 1)\nDuring the past year or two communication has been had with the Indian Department touching the necessity of erecting a dwelling for the Principal of the Cocolactes Institute. All the circumstances which made so strong a case will remain in undiminished force, and I most sincerely hope that the application will receive favorable consideration from the Superintendent General. The amount of accommodation in the present building for the Principal, his wife and daughters, is entirely inadequate and inconvenient, and there are circumstances which render it of the utmost importance that separate accommodation should be provided. In this connection I beg to remind the Superintendent General that the entire cost for land at Cocolactes, and the greater part of the cost of the building, has been borne by the Missionary Society, and this is something which has not been done in connection with any Indian Industrial Institute or Boarding School on the Coast. In all cases, excepted, site and buildings have been provided by the Department.

The reasons which justified the request made a couple of years ago for a Principal's residence remain with unabated force. Such a residence I regard as not only desirable but absolutely necessary.\n\nThe discomfort and annoyance to which the Principal and his family have been subjected for want of a separate dwelling have been very great, and ought to be obviated as soon as possible. I think that if the Department would grant $1500 to cover cost of material and skilled labor that is necessary, apart from the carpentering, all the rest of the work could be carried through by the carpenter who is employed in the Institute, with the assistance of those boys who are being trained to that trade.\n\nIt will be seen by the plans that Mr. Hall provides for an office in connection with the proposed dwelling. My judgment is that this would not be the best arrangement. The office should be in the main building if there is a room...\nto spare for that purpose, and Mr Hall should be found there during the day, and not in his own dwelling.\n\nIf the Department does not consider it necessary to keep these sketches, I will be glad to have them returned.\n\nSincerely hoping that this may receive prompt and favorable attention,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nOttawa, 9th September, 1904.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th April last, No. L-4, 120, and previous correspondence, I have to say that the Department is not in a position to make any grant to assist in the erection or a residence for the Principal of Coqualeetza Home.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nIndian Office Victoria B.C.\n\nApril 6th 1904.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further connection with the request contained in your letter of the 5th ultimo, No. 180,293, to the effect that I visit the Coqualeetza Industrial Institute and make a personal examination of the building and report as to the necessity for more accommodation for the Principal, etc., I have the honour to report that having had to proceed to Vancouver for the purpose of meeting the False Creek Indians on the 28th ultimo I deemed it advisable to extend my visitation to Chilliwack where I arrived on the 30th ultimo, visited the Institute and personally examined the building.\n\nAs the result of my observation I may state that there certainly is not adequate accommodation for the Principal and his family in the Institute, nor does it appear that such accommodation was contemplated when the Institute was designed.\n\nAlthough I presume a plan of the building is filed at Ottawa I take the liberty of forwarding a rough sketch showing floor plans of the Institute. By these it will be seen that such has been the case. The room used as a reception room is open to visitors on official business at all times and cannot be considered as an apartment affording any privacy or home comfort for the Principal or his family. The only accommodation really available consists of bed rooms each far removed from the other, being really a sort of makeshift, as they were originally intended for other uses; one of the three in use having been intended for a sick room.\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq., another\n\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6423, file 869-5, part 1)\nanother was provided by being partitioned off from a large pupils dormitory and as can be imagined such an arrangement was most inconvenient and uncomfortable.\n\nMr. Hall, the Principal, informed me that under present circumstances there is no home life for himself or family; no private dining room for his family, he and they being confined to the use of the dining room provided for the staff so that life is much as it would be in a hotel and that of not superior accommodation. On account of the bed rooms now occupied by the Principal and his family not being in accordance with original intention other rooms that were intended for hospital rooms are now occupied by the other members of the staff which were there many cases of sickness would seriously hamper the management. Mr. Hall informs me that with the exception of Mount Elgin he does not know of any Institute where the Principal and his family reside therein; touching the last named special provision was made for such accommodation and therefore no inconvenience. He further stated that he had visited several of the Institutes East of the Mountains, St. Paul's near Winnipeg, Brandon, Elkhorn, & Regina the Principal and family in each instance residing in detached residences which he believes were provided by the Department.\n\nAs I think will be seen from plans no readjustment of the rooms could well be made so as to provide a reasonable amount of privacy and accommodation. An attempt to supply the needed extension in the form of an annex I would not recommend as it would impair the general good effect of the present structure's appearance, besides depriving that section of it against which\nmight be\nthe addition built of light and air.\n\nThe Residence at present under construction for\nthe Principal and his family is in accordance with\nplans forwarded two or three years ago to the Depart-\nment by the Advisory Board which, in expectation of aid\nfrom the Department, recommended that a beginning be\nmade to save time; at present the foundation has been\nbuilt and studding, etc., put up; the building, on account\nof the inclemency of the winter season, not having been\ncarried on for some time.\n\nThe intention is to have the buildings connected\nby telephone or electric bell; they are not more than\nfifty yards apart, and arrangements will be made that\nall the male and female staff shall reside in the In-\nstitute.\n\nTouching the respective Institutes Mount Elgin and\nGogama, it may be remarked that the former cost\nnearly $25,000.00, whereas the latter was built for\n$18,500.00. Inclosed I forward an estimate of the bill\nof material for the Principal's Residence. From the\nappearance of the building so far as it has been con-\nstructed, it seems to me rather high.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nsir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent B.C.\nBILL OF MATERIAL FOR PROPOSED PRINCIPAL'S RESIDENCE IN CONNECTION WITH COQUALEETZA INSTITUTE.\n\nRough lumber - - - - - - - $130.00\nDressed Lumber - - - - - - - $270.00\nMouldings, Brackets, Stair Fixtures, - - $90.00\nWindows and Transoms --- --- --- --- $80.00\nDoors - - - - - - - - - - $70.00\nPlastering - - - - - - - - - - $190.00\nPainting - - - - - - - - - - $40.00\nHardware - - - - - - - - - - $48.00\nShingles - - - - - - - - - - $90.00\nCement --- --- --- --- --- --- $259.00\nPutting in Furnaces & Fixtures --- --- $250.00\nPlans & Specifications --- --- --- - $40.00\nAcetylene Gas Machine & pipes --- --- $100.00\nSuperintending Construction ------ ------ $63.50\nPlumbing ------ ------ ------ ------ $100.00\n\nTOTAL ------ $1819.50\n\nThe above shows that our estimate of cost of material and skilled work (plastering, etc.) which we should have to employ ($1500.00) was too low.

Upon inquiry I have since learned that the management commenced the work on its own responsibility, i.e. without having received authority for the expenditure either from the Methodist Missionary Society or the Indian Department. Should it be, under the circumstances reported, still considered advisable to grant assistance towards the building referred to I would suggest that only the cost of the material used in construction be allowed as with the aid of the Foreman and the pupils the greater part of the work could be performed.\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

It still agrees with you that the most suitable place for the Principal to reside is in the Main building if he can be properly housed, and if more space is required, it would much rather assist in putting up a separate building for class-rooms.\n\nThe amount of the grant now asked for by the Church authorities is $1500.00 and should the Department consent to assist them, the sum would be the limit.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.W.

This will show at a glance that there is positively no suitable accommodation for the Principal and his family, and will bear out the statement in his letter of the 11th ult., which I also enclose, that \"the disadvantage to which the Principal and his family have been subjected, are things that had better not be mentioned, if a remedy can be had, without exposing them to the light of day.\" I sincerely hope that during the present session of Parliament the necessary sum will be voted to provide a Principal's residence, and so put an end to a state of affairs that is not creditable to the Department or the Church.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\nGeneral-Secretary.\nRev A. Sutherland D.D.\n\nDear Bro:\n\nI am in receipt of your favor of the 1st Inst enclosing copy of a communication from the Indian Department in which information regarding the present location of the principal's quarters within the building is asked for. I have had the sketches of a plan of the different floors of the Institution, showing the way in which the space is divided, prepared by the carpenter, and forward them by this mail.\n\nThese sketches will show that we have absolutely no accommodation in the Institute but Bed rooms. We have no family room and the bed room accommodation is distributed, and found in whatever corner a room can be found, even if it has to be by partitioning off a corner from a pupils dormitory or by occupying a room which had previously been used for a hospital. By rights the room occupied by our little girl ought to be reserved still for Hospital purposes, as well as the neighboring rooms now occupied by the cooking and sewing teachers, for the reasons that one should be occupied by the nurse, and there might easily be more than one invalid at a time; and besides the sick ones occupying these rooms would be in quieter quarters and farther removed from...\nthe other pupils, rendering the spread of contagion less likely to occur. In the original plan of the rooms these were all intended for hospital rooms, and were so marked by the architect. Indeed it would seem that it was not intended when the building was planned that the principal would live in the building, and the best way to relieve the congested condition of things in the building is to move the principal and his family out. If I were to begin to speak of the disadvantages to which the principal and his family have been subjected during our nearly eight years occupancy of the building or rather residence in it, I would be tempted to refer to many things that perhaps had better borne in patience than mentioned, especially if the remedy can be had without exposing them to the light of day. It is enough to say that there can be no family life where every thing is in common - rooms, sitting room and meals. If there were a suite of rooms where the family might be by themselves and have their meals apart, and not be brought into contact with the pupils whenever they stir out of their bedrooms, nor be subject to the constant noise of all that is going on on all sides from morning till night, nor have to guard our little girl every hour of the day through the halls from the unnameable indignities of boys of lustful and beastly passions, then might continued residence in the building be regarded as a proposition to be entertained. But in fact, except in the case of Mount Elgin Institute I am not aware of any Institute where the Principal and his family reside in the building. I see that\nyour letter from the department speaks of it being the policy of the department that the principal should reside within the school, and that departure from this policy can only be sanctioned on the strongest possible grounds. This sounds strange to my ears.\n\nI have visited Brandon\u2014it is departed from there; I visited St Pauls near Winnipeg\u2014it is departed from there; I visited Elkhorn\u2014it is departed from there; and when I was at St Pauls the department had just taken it over from the Episcopalian denomination, and the principal's residence had just been completed; had not as yet been occupied; Elkhorn had also been taken over from the same denomination but that policy was not in force there. It looks as though it were a policy that is not much practised. I omitted to mention Regina, which also I visited and stayed over night in the home of the principal. Mount Elgin is no doubt ideal in the matter of the relation of the principal's household to the institute, as supplying a home to the family and at the same time residence to the principal within the building. But that was arranged for when the new institute was planned, and I suppose added somewhere between five and ten thousand dollars to the cost of that Institute.\n\nBut we have to do now with remedying a condition of things not provided for at the beginning.\n\nI am sorry for the delay which the department hoped would not be necessary.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6423, file 869-5, part 1)\nP.S. I should have pointed out in my letter that the Bed Room occupied by the Principal on the Second floor should be occupied by a teacher who would have charge of the Boys Dormitory adjoining, but has to sleep elsewhere because of our having that room the only one in the Institute occupied by two persons. When I came here and saw how crowded everything was, I felt almost like an intruder, because there was no room for me, and the presence of my family in the Home Disarranged things. It was as if they had to be dis-arranged for the accommodation of my family. And this was so it has been to my chagrin. The present arrangement is unsuitable both for the Institute and myself. I shall be glad if you will explain this fact.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoseph Smith\nMemo.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 24th February, 1904.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General,-\n\nWith reference to additional accommodation required for the Principal and his family at the Coqualeetza Home, B.C., I beg to state that an addition can be made to the building at the rear of the right wing, without materially impairing the architectural effect of the structure.\n\nIf the proposed addition is about 23 feet square, and one story high, the cost will be in the neighbourhood of $1,000. If two stories high, the cost will be about $1,500.\n\nI may here mention that additions to buildings are objectionable in several directions. A lot of money is necessarily spent in rearranging part of the interior of the main building. The new part, almost invariably, settles unequally with the main building, causing unsightly cracks and openings, and the rearrangement of the interior of the addition can not be made as convenient and suitable as it would have been done if erected at the same time as the main building.\n\nIf there are not other objections with regard to the advisability of the Principal's quarters being located within the main building, the amount suggested, namely, $1,500., would be more satisfactorily spent and better value obtained if a separate building were constructed.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOTTAWA, 15th February, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn connection with the recent application made by Rev. Dr Sutherland in which he again asks for a grant for the purpose of erecting a private dwelling house for the Principal of the Coqualeetza Home I beg to say that he has forwarded plans for the proposed building and asks for a grant of $1500.00 for this purpose. In your letter of the 30th ultimo Dr Sutherland was asked to forward sketches showing the manner in which the present school building is divided, from which you will see that there is very little space set apart for the exclusive use of the Principal and his family. This is partly owing to the school carrying more pupils than are provided for, or that ever were intended to be admitted to the institution.\n\nWith regard to previous applications for a house for the Principal, the Department has maintained that he should reside in the main building so as to have continual supervision over the school. If the Department is prepared to make an exception in the case of this school, as has been done in some of the other schools in Manitoba, a house might be provided and the question then arises\u2014how is it to be paid for? The Coqualeetza institute is not the property of the Department. It was built on land belonging\nto the Methodist Missionary Society by them out of funds provided by themselves supplemented by a grant of $5000.00 from the Department.\n\nThe plans submitted by Dr Sutherland provide for a commodious dwelling containing six bedrooms and a wing for office accommodation.\n\nIt remains for the Department to decide whether it would be wise to allow the Principal to take up his residence away from his charge, and if so whether it should contribute any further grant to the erection of building to which it has no title.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6423, file 869-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Brother Ferrier:\n\nYour letter of September 3rd, to hand, with enclosures from the Dunham Co., and the copy of a letter from McDowell & Mann. These, I am returning to you herewith.\n\nWith reference to the Dunham system, I can only say our experience of its operation in the severe weather we had, was not satisfactory at all. You have the facts of the case, and we suffered much more that I cared to represent when you were here last, giving only sufficient details to convince you that some remedy should be affected before another winter.\n\nWith reference to the letter from McDowell and Mann, it is perfectly true that when he was here we had steam on both boilers, and fired up in such a manner as to raise the pressure and obtain heat throughout the building and an equal distribution in all the radiators. It is true we use a quantity of slab wood when the weather is not very cold. We also used cordwood, good, dry, hard, when the weather was not extreme. But when the extreme weather came with the gale of wind from the North, we used coal only; and there was no shortage. Night and day, without cessation, we tried our best to maintain steam, but failed to get the radiators heated in some parts of the building, other than along the top. We had no difficulty with the radiators on the west side of the house. That part of the building was very comfortable throughout.\n\nI do not consider that the test which was made by Mr. Mann on a warm day with no wind, is a criterion of the trials to raise steam that we had in zero weather in a wind with a velocity of forty-five to fifty miles an hour. That must have had a great influence on the circulation of the vapor in the radiators. My impression is that the cold wind blowing onto the radiators through the opening caused by the shrinkage of the window frames, caused condensation to take place so rapidly, that the water had hardly time to escape through the Dunham valves, before, in some cases, it froze. That, however, is only the opinion of a man not a steam expert. From simple observation that appeared to be the case. Then, from the return pipe, after the water comes through the trap near the boiler, there is only a fall of a foot and a half to two feet, I should judge. This would be about three pounds pressure to open the valves before the return water enters the boiler. The fall is very slight, and might have some effect. It has been suggested to me that a small pump driven by a one-horse power motor, attached to the return pipe would draw off the water and prevent a vacuum. This seems feasible.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter received from Mr. Excel, who inspected the boilers and machinery yesterday. This letter was entirely unsolicited. Mr. Excel is a man whose father, I found, had been a friend of Captain Oliver's in Scotland. In acknowledging the letter I shall inform...\nhim a copy has been sent to you. The change suggested, I have no doubt, could be made at comparatively small expense. I would not, however, suggest it until we had further tried the present system, which, I feel sure, unless the boilers are too small, ought to operate satisfactorily.\n\nIn my judgement, no amount of radiation, or a high-pressure steam boiler, will offset the shrinkage of the woodwork from the brickwork around the windows on the north and east sides of the house, and I would advise this be the first step taken as a remedy, and its affect carefully noted. This would be no experiment.\n\nI have not yet heard from Mr. Orr on the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. C.H. Beley,\nPrincipal.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nSeptember 15th, 1925.\n\nRev. G.H. Raley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Residential School,\nSardis, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMy interest in the boiler plant of your fine School was only whetted during boiler inspection today, through knowing the difficulty you had in properly heating the buildings last winter, and you will pardon perhaps an interest which is not merely idle curiosity.\n\nIn your capacity as Superintendent you cannot possibly know all technical details entering into a system of steam heating, and while I am debarrred from advising you on the matter, by reason of my official position, perhaps you will overlook a zeal for engineering perfection, so far as perfection may be obtained.\n\nAfter a careful survey again on the ground I can only reiterate my comment of last winter that the cast iron heating boilers as installed are unsuited for the installation. They are wasteful of fuel and are undoubtedly undersized to cope with weather conditions as frequently occur at Sardis.\n\nThis can only be shown as true by thermometric test of furnace and flue gases, as well as an evaporation test, but I am drawing on twenty-six years of comparative experience to base my conviction.\n\nWhat you really require, is a steel return tubular type of boiler set up in a standard brick setting, (for fuel and operating efficiency), in place of the very inefficient type of steam generators now in use.\n\nYou do not require to purchase such a boiler, brand new, I may say there are a number of suitable boilers available at reasonable prices, such boilers are discarded when we cut the pressures below those ordinarily used for power purposes, that is, to ninety\npounds and under. As you require only about two pounds to operate the Dunham Heating System, almost any boiler in reasonable condition and inspected for, say, even fifty pounds would suit your purpose for a long number of years, given the care exercised in the operation of the Institution. I make this suggestion in all sincerity, and feel sure you can approach your authorities to sanction a change which must surely result in a satisfactory service, and reduced fuel bill, both of which must be a desirable end in the calculation of all concerned.\n\nThe actual apparatus designed to transmit heat throughout the building appears to function properly, but I regret, indeed, as a mechanical engineer, I cannot so remark on the heat generating apparatus.\n\nIf I can be of assistance to you, and to your wards, through you, I shall be happy to render any service which may be for the common good.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nS.H. Excell,\nInspector of Steam Boilers &\nMachinery.\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nJuly 2, 1925.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are very much surprised to learn from yours of June 26th, that the Coqualeetza School Heating Plant is not satisfactory, as this is the first intimation that we have had regarding any trouble there since the installation was completed.\n\nWe would assume from your letter, that an investigation has been made to reveal the fact that the source of your difficulty lies with the Dunham Equipment used on this Plant. We are at a loss to understand this condition, and we do not see how it can possibly be caused by the Dunham Equipment, but we are taking immediate steps to obtain further information regarding their difficulty, and we shall write you again in a couple of weeks when we have had an opportunity to get a further report on the Job.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.A. DUNHAM CO., LTD.\n\nDGB/R.\n\nBr. Manager.\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nAug. 20, 1925.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. Methodist Indian Schools in Canada,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE- COLQUALERTZA INDIAN SCHOOL.\n\nFurther to ours of July 2nd, in this connection, we have made a thorough investigation regarding the difficulty which your Department has had in the Heating of the above Institution, and we are now convinced beyond any doubt that the Dunham Heating System and Equipment that has been installed in the School, functions in a very satisfactory manner.\n\nWhen the addition to this heating system was installed, early in 1924, some difficulty was experienced in getting proper and free circulation through the system and as a result, of this difficulty, the Dunham Company sent their Chief Engineer from Toronto who paid two visits to the Institution and with the contractors made slight changes in certain connections necessary to remedy the difficulty. The system was then thoroughly tested and our records show that its performance was entirely satisfactory.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter of June 26th, the writer went to Victoria to interview the contractors who had made the installation and was advised that their Mr. Mann, reached the school from Victoria in less than 36 hours from the time he was advised last Spring of the trouble you were having. He immediately asked the Resident Engineer to fire up the system which was done in the Engineer's own way. After he had fired for a period of 3 hours with one boiler, he had still low pressure showing on the gauge, and yet every radiator in the building was hot all the way across the top with a depth of from 4 to 6 inches. Mr. Mann then succeeded in having the other boiler brought into action and fixed in such a manner as to show a slight pressure on the gauge, at which time the steam was turned on to the system and it was found that the entire system down to the last radiator heated perfectly which in itself is proof conclusive that the Dunham Heating system was functioning as it was intended to do.\nRev. Ferrier,\n\nFor your information we asked Mr. Mann to state his experience in writing which he did under date of July 10th, and we are enclosing herewith a copy of his letter. We did not forward this information to you until we could discuss the matter with the Rev. Raley, which we succeeded in doing yesterday.\n\nI went over this letter with Mr. Raley paragraph by paragraph and he states that what the letter says, is the absolute truth.\n\nIn conversation with Mr. Raley yesterday, he advised that the cold wind blowing in around the windows created a condition so unbearable that he was not only compelled to move his own study, but also the children away from this exposure and that he had covered up these windows with blankets for protection against the cold. We therefore, got the impression that you may find it necessary to put storm windows on this building in order to make it comfortable as the radiators under these windows are almost bound to freeze up if his plant is not properly fired to create the necessary slight boiler pressure, while it would be impossible for them to freeze if the plant were in generally sufficient volume of steam to get the circulation up through the system.\n\nWe have taken a good deal of trouble to gather all the facts regarding this matter, not only for our own satisfaction but also for your information and we trust that your Department may see fit to equip this building with such protection as will enable this heating system to give the service for which it is intended, and if there be any further information or assistance we can give, we shall be very glad to hear from you at any time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.A. DUNHAM CO., LTD.,\n\nDGR/R.\n\nBr. Manager.\nMr. D.J. Brison,\n627 - Standard Bank Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe received your letter of July 2nd enclosing copy of letter from Rev. Perrier, Sup't of Methodist Indian Schools. The writer was out of town, hence delay in answering.\n\nWe received note from Rev. Perrier dated April 7th advising system was at fault. Our Mr. Mann left immediately by ferry and was at Sardis on Good Friday and did following: He found system was working as perfect as that style of heating can be and showed Rev. Riley accordingly. The only reason why this system is not \"perfect\" is because it is necessary to put fuel in the boilers.\n\nMr. Mann found every radiator in building hot across top no pressure at boiler and one boiler cut off. This showed that circulation or distribution of steam to all radiators was equalized and proved system was installed correctly. Mr. Mann, through Rev. Riley instructed the man in charge of boilers to raise steam. In his own way, he fired one boiler, raising steam in three minutes and no pressure. Only when under pressure did he light up the other boiler. Three minutes after valves were opened pressure rose and soon every radiator in building became hot right down to the trap.\n\nRev. Riley stated that he had never seen the system heat like that before.\n\nMr. Mann found the grate bars in one boiler burnt out. That tells what kind of firing plant has received.\n\nWe were informed slab wood was used at times during winter.\n\nThe trouble is either the man attending to firing in not allowed to burn enough proper fuel or he will not fire properly.\n\nThey may have the idea that the second boiler is there to be a relief when the first boiler becomes tired.\n\nRev. Perrier states \"the heating\" of school was very unsatisfactory. As this includes the firing, he is correct, but the heating system is absolutely unsatisfactory. If pressure is maintained, it is absolutely impossible for condensation to remain in radiators and freeze.\nIf steam supply is maintained in radi, condensation will run off by gravity as returns are open to atmosphere through air eliminator and return trap. If steam merely enters radi, and condenses a vacuum will form and condensation will be held at bottom of rad and may freeze.\n\nWe are sending this letter in duplicate so you may forward one to your head office.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Signed) C.J.

Also obtain separately a price for the storm sash for the north and east sides of the building. I would ask you to advise me if you will undertake to install and paint these sash if same are furnished by the Department.\n\nWhen this information is received the matter will be given immediate consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

When you have read this you might return it to me in Toronto, if it reaches there before the 3rd of October, otherwise send it to Brandon.\n\nI would like to have discussed with you personally the great need of outside window and door frames for the Coqualeetza Institute and also for the Edmonton School. This must be attended to before the cold weather sets in. I think a great deal of the trouble is due to the fact that the air flows so freely around the outside window frames and door frames, also that from the outside the air travels without obstruction, except at the corners, between the outside brick and the tile keeping the walls constantly cold. If the outside moulding is taken off and the space filled up it will, to a certain extent, remedy the situation in both these buildings.\n\nWill you kindly see to this at your very earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRe Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nESTIMATE\n\nFOR: Mr. H.

Raley,\nPrincipal.\nOctober 23rd. 1925.\n\nA. F. McKenzie, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn further reply to your letter of October 5th., re storm windows. We will undertake to paint the sash of the storm windows.\n\nIf the Department thinks it advisable we will install them. To supervise the careful fitting however of these windows and the hanging of them is something that requires a professional carpenter.\n\nIn the long run I think it would pay the Department to engage Mr. Patten, the man who has built the Technical Building at Five dollars ($5.00) per day, I would advise this. We will provide the services of another man who is handy and careful. Also we can furnish all the boys who would be helpful in the undertaking. The windows however must be hung snugly to keep out the cold. Otherwise the effect is lost.\n\nWe should be pleased to do the work but I think a good carpenter would insure 100% efficiency.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H. Haley,\nPrincipal.\nCOQUALEETZA:\n\nThe Principal has given a very extended list of needs. I might indicate a dwelling house for the farm instructor, sufficient cement to extend the front concrete fence to the full length of the main building, a hog pen and hen house, playground equipment ($300), covered play-sheds on account of the rainy season, also greenhouse, gymnasium, general repairs to the Principal's residence and some smaller items. However, I think that if you make us a grant of $8,000 for the coming year, it will be all that we should expect in the next Budget for this Institution.\nOttawa, November 24, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to storm windows at the Coqualeetsa Indian Residential School, and in reply to confirm my flight letter of the 20th instant, as follows:\n\n\"Reference storm windows, may purchase windows from Galbraith and Sons for north and east side of main building, technical building and residence. Windows to be painted and put in place by staff with assistance of one carpenter.\"\n\nI have also your letter of the 28th ultimo, requesting certain equipment for the manual training room at the school. I note that supplementary bench tools are required and that you estimate the cost at $220. You are authorized to make purchase of what is required in this connection, after securing competitive prices. When you are submitting an account in favour of the firm given the business, attach thereto a memorandum showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted. I regret that the Department cannot give favourable consideration at the present time to supplying a turning lathe or a band saw.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

On the 20th instant, the Rev. Principal was authorized by telegram to purchase storm sash for the north and east sides of the main building, the technical building and the principal's residence.

E. Ditchburn, Indian Commissioner, Victoria, he states that he wrote you regarding the matter. He states that this amount covers the cost of a furnace which was shipped by you to the Coqualeetza Institute, Sardis. As the furnace appears to have been ordered by the Rev. G. H. Raley, Principal of the above named Institute, you should look to him for settlement of your account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant referring to an account received by you from the McClary Manufacturing Company, Vancouver, B.C., amounting to $195.20 due from 16th November last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on the 4th December I also received a statement from the above mentioned firm that $195.20 was owing to them but as no purchase had been made by me for this amount I wrote to the firm for an explanation. On the 7th December the McClary Company replied enclosing copies of invoices dated the 15th November covering a furnace which was shipped to the Coqualeetza Institute, Sardis. These invoices I then forwarded to Rev. G.M. Raley, Principal of the Coqualeetza School, on the 8th December stating that as the furnace was not ordered through my office I did not know anything about the authority to purchase, but thought possibly that he might have had such authority and been instructed to have the account forwarded to this office. I, therefore, asked Mr. Raley to let me hear from him on the subject but so far I have not heard anything from him and I naturally took it for granted that he was forwarding the account to you for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. L. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 11th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nA statement of account has been received from the McClary Mfg. Co., Vancouver, claiming an amount of $195.20 to be due them from November 16th, last. It is not stated on the face of their account the nature of the supplies or the school to which they were furnished. It is thought that the above amount covers supplies purchased by you for the Kamloops Indian Residential School. If you have the itemized account, in duplicate, from this firm, I shall be pleased if you will, if you consider it to be satisfactory, certify the same in the usual manner and forward it to the Department in order that payment can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The receipts are all in good order.\n\nA few words of explanation are necessary:\n\nDenmark and Burton accounts include the irons, rope, hardware, etc., for six swings on the girls' playground, and six on the boys!\n\nMcClary Manufacturing Company's account is for a new furnace for the Principal's residence. This was essential for the protection of the property against fire. The old furnace was unsafe. The Rev. T. Ferrier advised its replacement some years ago.\n\nChilliwack Producers' Exchange account covers the purchase of paint for the first coat on the Principal's residence. This was necessary to save the surface of the house. It had not been painted for many years. This also has been advised by The Rev. T. Ferrier. A second coat should be put on this Spring.\n\nWilson, Max's account was for decorating rooms in the Principal's residence we found necessary, making over the old Coqualeetza office into a dining-room, the Principal's office now being located in the new main building.\n\nMonkhouse, A. - account No. 6 is for the material used for the same purpose.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6423, file 869-5, part 2)\nPilkington Brothers' account: this glass was used for a small hothouse necessary until we get the grant for the greenhouse, which forms a part of the original plan of New Coqualeetza.\n\nBowman, O.'s account: In this account is included a little lumber, which was omitted from the account for the Technical School. Also shiplap for the sides and ends of what used to be an open air dormitory. Flooring and lumber for the dining-room; also for a pantry built on to the Principal's house.\n\nAll the materials in these accounts were necessary and used to advantage on the buildings of the Department.\n\nTrusting this will receive favourable consideration at your convenience, and thanking you for your continued interest.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. H. Raley,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 6, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th ultimo, enclosing receipts for expenditures you have incurred at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. I would point out that these accounts cover a period of six months and are in the main unauthorized by the Department. I regret that it is necessary to recapitulate the general instructions contained in letters directed to you under cover of April 7, 1922, March 10 and August 4, 1923.\n\nYou should secure authority before incurring expenditure, other than for minor repairs to buildings and mechanical plant. The Department must insist in this connection, as otherwise there would be no check on our expenditure. Accounts for minor repairs should be forwarded at least once each quarter. In an earlier letter, I suggested that you deal with one lumber firm and one hardware firm only, for a stated period. Materials which can be strictly considered repairs to plant should be included on the firm's monthly or quarterly statement. The accounts should be in duplicate and should not be paid by school cheque, but should be certified, if correct, and forwarded to the Department for payment. Cheques will then issue direct to the firms. In other words, you should not pay accounts and then approach the Department for reimbursement.\n\nWhen you have special authority for expenditure, the accounts in relation thereto should be certified by you and forwarded to the Department separately, under a covering letter quoting the authority. Such accounts should be forwarded for payment as soon as they can be certified, and the items should not be mingled with those for current minor repairs.\n\nRev. G. H. Raley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Institute,\nSardis, B. C.\n\n- With particular -\nWith particular reference to the receipts which you have recently presented, No. 1, for a barrel of cement, may be returned for payment. No. 2 might be considered in part as repairs. I wish to refer to items for netting, totalling over $16.00, and for 150 ft. of rope, $7.00 which should not be included. Receipt No. 3, for a door and five sash, might be considered as repairs, but an explanation is necessary. There is no authority in connection with receipts No. 4 and 5 - a furnace and the freight thereon - and favourable consideration cannot be given. Receipt No. 6 has reference to lumber, which quite possibly has been used for minor repairs, and you may seek reimbursement. Receipt No. 7 has items for thimbles, rope, etc., which cannot be allowed. If you wished to erect swings in the playground, you should have secured authority. Receipt No. 8 is for labour, installing a furnace in the residence, which was unauthorized and cannot be allowed. Receipts No. 9 and 10 are for painting, etc., and, as they amount to approximately $167, they should have been the subject for a special letter seeking authority. Receipts No. 11 and 12 are largely for glass, which cannot be allowed as no authority was granted. Receipt No. 13 is for $25 worth of cement, which cannot be considered for minor repairs and cannot be allowed as there was no authority. Receipt No. 14 is for over $200 worth of lumber.

The supply however, is exhausted long since, and we have purchased at least ten. On the surface one might remark - isn't that rather extravagant? It is not, considering the number who use the balls and the condition of our campus. We have three teams and they are all keen. The playground is gravelly, and the cases and seams cut quicker than on grass or sandy fields, which to some extent accounts for the extra balls used. We play from September to March, right through the rainy season which is also hard on the leather. We have very little snow and but little frost. If it were possible for you to send us ten footballs - that would be an increase of two over last year - we should appreciate it very much.\n\nWe should also like two basketballs. It is two years since we received any from your Department.\n\nYou will be pleased to know we were very successful in the last League Games. Our boys played with men throughout, beating the Chilliwack High School, the Chilliwack United Players, and Chilliwack City. They won the Championship Cup.\n\nThe Department's action in providing footballs, basketballs, etc., has been helpful to the betterment of the health, the improvement of the physique, and the recreation of the Indians.\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.H.R./M.H.\n\nE.H.

(See letter No. 153-0-1, dated \"Ottawa, July 29th, 1926\"). This expenditure was incurred in connection with the annual holiday to Ocean Park, B.C., allowed to pupils of Coqualeetza Residential School, who have no opportunity to go to distant homes for the holidays.\n\nWhile this does not represent the actual cost of the Camp, it covers most of it -- not counting the food. The Camp is on a sloping hillside at the foot of which is the sea beach, where we have good bathing. The park is owned by private parties. It is not too public, so that our Camp has a good measure of privacy, and the pupils of the school have a healthy and much appreciated cessation of the routine of school life for a little more than two weeks. It was necessary to purchase a couple of tents this year, which will be useful for future camps.\n\nI shall be grateful if you will favour me with a cheque for this amount at your convenience.\n\nAppreciating the interest of the Department in this summer camp,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.H.

This will provide an amount of $350 towards the cost of erecting the fence.\n\nA properly certified account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the material, etc., should be forwarded in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Riley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Indian Res. School,\nSardis, B.C.\nSeptember 21, 1927.\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nActing Deputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nIn regard to the clause in your letter No. 153-0-5 dated May 30th; there is a misunderstanding as to the amount required and I am afraid the fault is in the language used in my letter of May 19th.\n\nClause 5 reads: \"A New Fence is a necessity on the front of the property next the public sidewalk, at each end of the present cement fence. The length of the newly required fence is 133 yards. Then it will be necessary to move the gateway further north to meet the needs of the new building, and to continue the cement fence up to that point\u201412 yards in all. Competitive estimates have been obtained, and the lowest estimate brings the cost of the 12 yards of concrete fence (matching the old fence) to $150.00, and the remaining 133 yards of strong wire fence, with posts and gates to $200.00.\"\n\nThe latter part should have read \"Competitive estimates have been obtained, and the lowest estimates brings the cost of the 12 yards of concrete fence (matching the old fence) to $150.00, and the remaining 133 yards of strong wire fence with posts and gates will cost $200.00.\n\nIn your letter of May 30th referring to the repairs for the outside dormitory and cottage you made this comment: \"The estimate of $300.00 in this connection should not be exceeded,\" and in your comment of the repairs for the principal's residence you also stated \"The estimate of $280.00 in this connection should not be exceeded.\" Your comment, however, in regard to the concrete fence and the wire fence is, \"I notice, \"The estimate of $200.00 in this connection.\"\nThe lowest estimate I was able to obtain for the concrete fence is $150.00. The wire fence with posts, gates and paint will cost at least $200.00, and our men have done the work on the wire fence.\n\nI might say the error is a clerical one, the responsibility for which I must assume unless the department would consider favorably a request for the balance namely, $150.00. I shall be grateful if the department would see its way clear to grant the above amount. This would meet the intention of the first requisition, namely, $150.00 for the concrete portion and $200.00 for the material for the 133 yards of wire fencing. The fence is a substantial one\u2014the Frost Woven Lawn Fence, Style S, with two coats of bottle green paint.

I note that detailed estimates of the cost of constructing a henhouse and a hogpen will be forwarded to Ottawa. You may proceed with the repairing and painting of the two outdoor dormitories and the cottage, which have been placed side by side. The estimate of $300 in this connection should not be exceeded. The old barn may be supplied with folding doors, a suitable floor and a coat of paint on the outside. The cost of the materials in this connection should not exceed the estimate of $300. The labour should be performed by the school staff and older boys.\n\nYou may purchase the material for a new flooring of British Columbia fir in the parlour, living room and front hall of the Principal's residence. You may also have two bedrooms and the front hall redecorated and the outside of the building painted. The estimate of $280 in this connection should not be exceeded. 12 yards of concrete fence and 125 yards of strong wire fence, with posts and gates, may be undertaken at the front of the school property. I note the estimate of $200 in this connection.\n\nIn the purchase of materials, you should secure competitive prices, and, when forwarding certified accounts in duplicate, you should attach thereto memos showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted. The labour should be provided by the management wherever possible. I realize that the decorating of the Principal's residence will have to be done by others. You should get two or three responsible decorators to quote on the supplying of the material and the performing of the necessary work.

These items were allowed, but other requests were noted for future estimates.\n\nA total of $1800 is available for improvements at this school, and, in view of the recent letter of the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, I am satisfied that practically $1,000 should be expended for repairs and only one of the small out-buildings erected this year. Therefore, I wish to recommend that the Rev. Principal be authorized to undertake the following improvements:\n\nPainting and repairing 3 outdoor dormitory buildings .. $300.\nPainting and repairing the old Barn .. .. .. 300.\nFlooring and decorating Principal's residence .. .. 280.\nNew front fence .. .. .. .. 200.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn my inspection of this institution I would like to draw your attention to the following needs by way of repairs and buildings:\n\n(1) The construction of a Hen-House and a Hog-Pen. I have reason to believe that these have been included in the estimates for this institution, but up to date Mr. Raley has not received official notice to go on with the work.\n\n(2) When in Ottawa I drew the attention of the Department to the Three Buildings, two of which were formerly used for dormitory purposes, and one a small cottage that was used for a farmer's home, which have all been placed side by side, contiguous to the north-west corner of the playground. The estimate for putting these in repair and painting was $300.00.\n\n(3) The Old Barn, which was removed from the present barn site to the rear of the stables and barn, is not at all in keeping with the rest of the buildings, and needs folding doors to close it in, a floor, and a coat of paint outside. The cost of this, for material, will be about $300.00.\n\n(4) The Principal's Home is in need of a new floor in the parlour, living room, and Front Hall. This should be of the best British Columbia fir. The cost of the flooring (nails and material) will be about $100.00. There are two bedrooms and the front hall that should be re-decorated - the cost $100.00. The Principal's home should be painted outside,-the cost of the material will be in the neighborhood of $80.00.\n\n(5) A New Fence is a necessity on the front of the property next the public sidewalk, at each end of the present cement fence. The length of the newly required fence is 133 yards. Then it will be necessary to move the gateway further north to meet the needs of the new building, and to continue the cement fence up to that point - 12 yards in all. Competitive estimates have been obtained, and the lowest estimate brings the cost of the 12 yards of concrete fence (matching the old fence) to $150.00, and the remaining 133 yards of strong wire fence, with posts and gates to $200.00.\n\nAll these items should be attended to in the present fiscal year, and in order that they may be properly executed immediate authority should be given to the principal. I would appreciate it very much if this can receive the immediate attention of the Department, and the Principal notified accordingly.\nI have requested the Principal to get plans for the Hog Pen and the Hen House, and to prepare an estimate of the cost of the same, sending this information to the Department. These buildings will not be extensive. I have suggested a Henery 100 feet long, and 14 feet wide, which will give ample accommodation for about 300 birds. The Hog Pen will only be large enough to meet the needs of about four brood sows and twenty-five or thirty pigs. This is about the usual number required for this department of farm operations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.

Haley,\nPrincipal, Coqualeetza Institute,\nCardis, B.C.\nMarch 22nd, 1927.\n\nJ. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nIf you remember when we were building the new barn at Coqualeetza in 1923, I drew the attention of the Department to the necessity of finishing the interior. I wanted the ceiling to be put in the cow and horse stables, as without that ceiling there was rather an unfinished appearance about it. Without the ceiling I mentioned the fact that the herring-bone work and joists would catch a lot of dust and stuff where vermin and spiders could flourish. We had on the walls a covering of tongued, grooved and dressed fir. I suggested that the cow stable and horse barns should be ceiled with the same class of lumber as we had put on the walls of the barn, namely first quality tongued, grooved and dressed fir. I also wanted two coats of paint put on to the walls of the barn as an interior finish. I could not think of whitewashing this fine lumber.\n\nThe Department, however, felt that there had already been as much money as was possible at the time put into the new barn, and we were satisfied. We have kept the place clean, sanitary, and disinfected it from time to time with sprays.\n\nA contingency, however, has arisen, upon which we have to take action. The Department of Agriculture for the Province have half-yearly T.B. tests, and at the last test a week ago, two of our cows were re-tested,-the first we have had. Of course they had to be destroyed, and the barn disinfected. We have gone through it entirely, using a spray of formaldehyde, and the Inspector instructed that we must white wash the barn, or paint it. I asked him if he would give me time to communicate with the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, to whom the barn belongs, as to what would be best for us to do, whether to put lumber on the ceiling and paint it, or just simply whitewash over it. I would strongly recommend the Department to have lumber put on the ceiling, and two coats of paint put on the walls and the ceiling. This can be done in the cow barn for approximately $200.00. We would do the work ourselves. If it was painted the paint could be washed without any trouble and the ceiling and paint would certainly add a finish to the inside of the barn which it lacks.\n\nIf you would kindly consider the matter and let me know your decision as soon as possible I shall be much obliged. If we do not paint, of course, we will have to spray with whitewash, which I do not like to put on to the dressed lumber already on the walls of the cow stable.\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department has favourably considered your request and I should be grateful if you would have the Reverend Principal secure an option on the corner lot before the Department takes steps to purchase. This action should be taken immediately, as the funds will not be available after April first. Instruct Mr. Raley to notify the Department by night letter when he secures the option and ask him to indicate the price. The Department will then ask the Department of Justice to search title and to arrange for the purchase\u2014all provided the price is satisfactory.\n\nYou may authorize Mr. Raley to erect a henhouse, at an estimated cost of $700. This amount should not be exceeded. He should secure competitive prices before purchasing materials and should supervise the erection of the building. If any expert labour is required, time sheets in duplicate should be kept, showing the receipts of the labourers. The Department feels it would be good instruction if the older boys and members of the staff did the work and if the entire grant of $700 was expended for materials.\n\nI understand that the hogpen erected this year has cost more than the departmental grant of $900. You may instruct the Rev. Principal to forward accounts for this purpose up to $1,300. As the farmer's residence has not been erected or purchased this year, the Deputy Superintendent General has authorized the above expenditures. I have to request that you will have Mr. Raley forward the accounts to Ottawa in time for payment before the first of April. An extra copy of this letter is enclosed, so that you may direct it to the Rev. Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nInspector,\nIndian Schools & Hospitals,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6423, file 869-5, part 2)\nIn the Main Estimates for the current fiscal year, there is an item of $3,500 for the provision of a farm instructor's residence at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. You will remember that this was to be used in part payment for the White property - the Missionary Society of the United Church to provide an equal amount. The Society has not voted its share, and Rev. T. Ferrier recommends that the funds be used for the following:\n\n(a) The purchase of the corner lot and house, which is about 200 yards from the main building. At one time the school authorities had an option on this property, the price of which was $1,200.\n\n(b) The provision of a henhouse, which I had intended including in the Main Estimates for the coming fiscal year. $700 is required.\n\n(c) To reimburse the school management for the extra cost of a hogpen erected this year. The Department allowed a grant for this purpose, but I understand some of the accounts were not forwarded to Ottawa as the estimate was exceeded. $400 has been mentioned in this connection.\n\nIf you approve of the current appropriation of $3,500.00 being used for these three items, which total $2,300.00, I believe it advisable to have the Principal secure an option on the corner lot before we take steps to purchase. We might secure a better price this way.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto,\nDec. 11,\n1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Farmer's Residence at Coqualeetza.\n\nIn regard to the vote of $3,500.00 for a farmer's residence passed at the last session of Parliament, I would suggest that the Principal be authorized to get an option on the corner lot upon which is situated the small house and part of this money be used for the purchase of this property; I believe the amount asked is $1,200.00, and the balance to be used for the construction of a henhouse and the completion of the hog pen now under construction.\n\nYour favourable consideration to this request will be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[T.

Erection of a residence for the farmer.\n2. Building a hog pen.\n3. Finishing store rooms.\n\nApproval is granted for an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $5,000 in the erection of a farmer's residence: $900 in the building of a hog pen and $800 in finishing the store rooms. You may arrange for this building activity at Coqualeetsa, on a day labour basis. The Principal should purchase all materials required, obtaining competitive prices as far as possible, and also for the labour required. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept for the labour. Accounts in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded in the usual manner covering the cost of all material. Should time sheets and an advance to pay labour be required, these will be sent upon request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

T. Ferrier and I wish to submit a recommendation concerning this year's building activity there. Our main estimates show the following items:\n\n- Finishing store room $500\n- Farmer's residence $3,000\n- Purchase corner lot and house $1,200\n\nTotal: $4,700\n\nThe reverend principal considers the erection of a hog pen a necessity. Last year there was an item in our estimates for this purpose but the work was never authorized as the proposal was before the Department late in the year for the first time. The purchase of the corner lot and house can stand until next year and Rev. Mr. Ferrier and myself recommend the following at the present time. As more careful estimates have been prepared there is a slight change in the figures:\n\n- Farmer's residence $3,000\n- Hog pen $900\n- Finishing store rooms $800\n\nTotal: $4,700\n\nI wish to recommend that authority be directed to Mr. Ferrier to arrange for this building activity at Corusletze on a day labor basis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

This was so small that it was impossible to heat water.\n\nI have been looking into it and I had the plumber out here to give me his lowest estimate on the installing of two hot water backs in the range and conducting water to the boiler.\n\nI was speaking to the Inspector of Indian Schools for the United Church who was here, and he advised me to send in the estimate to the Department and get the sanction of the Department before having the work done.\n\nI might say this is very necessary and will, when done, add greatly to our supply of hot water.

The amount I estimated rather low but have kept practically within the limits of the grant authorized by letter \"No. 153-0-5\" dated \"Ottawa, May 30th, 1927.\"\n\nGrant allowed for repairs to the 2 outside Dormitories and Cottage - $300.00\nGrant allowed for repairs, and painting Old Barn - $300.00\nGrant allowed for Principal's Residence Re-decorating, Painting, etc. - $280.00\n\nTOTAL $880.00\n\nThe expenditure in this regard, I am charging against the $880.00 is on the old barn, two outside dormitories and cottage, $630.05; on the Principal's residence, $250.05; Total $880.10.\n\nThe fact is I had another bill for lumber for the barn a little over $70.00 which the school will pay, seeing my estimate was too low and this grant does not cover it. The amount I saved of the grant from the residence, I should be pleased if the Department would be willing to credit it to what I charged on the barn, the 2 outside dormitories and cottage; above the grant.\n\nThere are in connection with the expenditure on barn, and outside dormitories, two accounts which I paid:\nThe Chilliwack Lumber Co. - $49.34\nW. C. McKay - $122.50\n\nAnd in connection with the repairs on the residence I have paid two accounts:\nE. E. Mower - $31.50\nH. W. Barrick - $99.05\n\nThe above accounts were paid by me owing to the fact that the men wanted the money for present needs. Would you kindly have the cheques made out to Coqualeetza Residential School?\n\nThe work was all done by the staff and older boys with the exception of what could reasonably be called skilled labor.\n\nTrusting this is all satisfactory,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

T. Ferrier, also, considers these are required. I regret that authority for the purchase of materials cannot be directed to you at the present time, as the current appropriation is completely assigned. I am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of my letter of today's date to the Inspector of Indian Schools and Hospitals for the United Church. You should list the improvements required at Coqualeetsa, in order of importance, each with an estimate of the cost, and forward to him for his attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Raley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetsa Indian Res. School,\nSardis, B. C.\nOttawa, March 5, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to a hogpen at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. An item in this connection was available for the fiscal year that is now closing, but it was not sufficient to finance the recent proposal of the Rev. Principal, which calls for departmental expenditure of approximately $1300. On May 30th, last, the Department suggested that detailed estimates of constructing both a hogpen and a henhouse be forwarded to Ottawa.\n\nFunds will be available, following your requests, for the erection of a farmer's residence, the purchase of the corner lot and house and the finishing of inside store rooms at the school, if Parliament allows the items that are now in our Estimates. You might list the requirements at this school, in order of importance, including the hogpen and the henhouse. An estimate of the cost of each should be given. The Department will then be in a position to determine what should be allowed at the present time. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Rev. Principal, with the request that he write to you with his recommendation, so that you will have all the facts before you when replying to this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nInspector,\nIndian Schools & Hospitals,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nBrandon, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nIn reply to yours of the 23rd inst.,\nNo. 153-0-5 re hogpen and henhouse at Coqualeetza Institute:\n\nWere these authorized in the fall of 1926 and provision made for their erection during present fiscal year? When I was there in May last I requested Mr. Raley to secure plans and specifications for both of these buildings and submit the same to the Department for consideration and approval. Evidently this was not done. A short time ago, I wrote Mr. Raley to have all accounts to be paid by the Department sent in so that they could be paid by the 31st of March. It seems he is now requesting what should have been done ten months ago.\n\nIf you find this to be correct, what I would like is to have Mr. Raley send in plans of these buildings with estimates of cost of material and give him instructions to purchase the material and have it paid for before March 31st. It is understood that the management is to do the labor.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGRD\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6423, file 869-5, part 2)\nOttawa, February 23, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIf you will refer to your letter of December 8th, last, which was pursuant to conversation with Department officers, relative to the needs at the Coqualeetsa Indian Residential School, you will note that no mention was made of a hogpen or henhouse. Mr. Raley has now written, asking the Department to authorize an expenditure of approximately $1500 in the preparation of a hogpen. He has also stated that a henhouse is needed.\n\nI may say that it was proposed to erect a farmer's residence, to purchase the corner lot and house and to finish the inside store-rooms at this school, if Parliament allows the items that are in our Estimates. You might let me know at your earliest convenience if the hogpen is more pressing than one or other of these proposals. As Mr. Raley is urging early action, I should be grateful if you would let me have an immediate reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nInspector,\nIndian Schools & Hospitals,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, February 23, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the advisability of erecting a hogpen and a henery at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. Pursuant to a conversation with Rev. T. Perrier, it has been the Department's opinion that other improvements are more urgent. However, I am today writing him, asking for a further recommendation, in view of your letter. I may say that certain funds will be available for improvements at Coqualeetza, if the items are allowed by Parliament.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Haley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Indian Res. School,\nSardis, B.C.\nFebruary 14th, 1928.\n\nR. Guerney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nYou will be pleased to know the improvements allowed by the Department are now complete with the exception of the hog pen and henery. These we are ready to commence, and inasmuch as the next month will be very suitable for us to undertake building, I am sending you, under separate cover, a sketch of the hog pen for your approval. Any alterations you think wise should be made, would you kindly embody them.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a list of material we shall require. Last year Rev. T. Ferrier wrote me advising that I write to Ottawa and get official authority to purchase material and send also a sketch of the structures.\n\nWe are in great need of these buildings. The old hog pen we are using is not a credit to us and altogether out of harmony with the other farm buildings which are now a great credit to the Department. We are still using the hog pen which was built twenty or more years ago. I shall be pleased if authority could be given for the purchase of this material. All the work can be done by the management, with the exception of the wiring for the electric lighting.\n\nCould I receive authority in this matter at the earliest possible convenience, and work will be proceeded with immediately?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.

December 3, 1927\n\nJ. D. MacLean Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn April last, Mr. Dubberley, the assistant inspector of electrical energy, completed an inspection of the wiring of the Coqualeetza Residential School, and drew attention to the following:\n\n\"All metal non-current carrying parts throughout this building are to be permanently and effectively grounded.\"\n\nI wrote to Messrs. Raynes and Horie, contractors, and asked them to advise me why this was not done when the building was erected. Messrs. Raynes and Horie replied \"that they worked to the specifications and under strict supervision of the Government.............everything was in order when the work was completed.\"\n\nAfter hearing from Mr. Horie, I wrote the inspector of electrical energy asking him to define more clearly what was required which he did. I gathered that the inspection and requirement was on account of a change in the Provincial Act since the building was erected. I immediately called for tenders from the two electricians at Chilliwack for \"effective grounding\" to meet the requirements.\n\nBoth came and inspected the work to be done and interviewed the inspector in Vancouver. After much delay and correspondence the work was finally given to Mr. S. Pugh whose tender in writing was $33.60. The other electrician was Mr. Marsh.\n\nThis was not referred to the Department before this work was done on account of the difficulty of getting satisfactory date and a written tender, and then when the tender was given, it was difficult to get the electrician, who is a busy man, to do consecutive work.\n\nIf in order I shall be obliged if the Department would favorably consider payment of the enclosed account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

MacLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find voucher and accounts, in duplicate, for work and material on account of improvements at Coqualeetza Residential School, Sardis, B.C.\n\nThe enclosed accounts refer especially to the finishing of store-rooms, clothes closets, and installing lockers, as authorized by letter to Rev. T. Ferrier, Inspector of Indian Schools, dated \"Ottawa, July 9th, 1928,\" and signed \"A. F. McKenzie.\"\n\nIn this connection the following accounts have been paid by me:\n\n| Name                  | Amount   |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| E.E.

I had to pay the account of A. Monkhouse owing to the fact that he is suffering from serious illness and could not very well wait for the money. Pearson Bros. is a small amount which was paid in connection with the school's monthly bill.\n\nWould you kindly have the cheque for these accounts, viz: $384.98, made out in favor of Coqualeetza Residential School; cheques for the accounts to the firms from whom the material was bought.\n\nA great deal of this work was skilled labor, and the work is very satisfactory. The store-rooms, etc. space added, is a great convenience, and is sufficient for a building of this size.\n\nEnclosed is a statement also of competitive prices.\n\nThanking the Department for the interest taken in the finishing of this work,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGHR:EMG\nEncl.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are, therefore, not prepared to authorize a grant for the purpose above mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E.

Ditchburn, Esq.,\nCommissioner, Department of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould it be possible for you with the help of the Department to make a small grant to Coqualeetza's Annual Field Day. We have senior, intermediate, junior and primary competitions, fifty-five events in all, three prizes in each event making 165 prizes not including cups, shields and medals, the prizes correspond to major and minor events in value.\n\nIf you could authorize a grant of $50.00 it would be most helpful, however the amount would have to be left to your judgement. Our boys and girls are exceedingly keen on athletics and are very sportsmanlike in their conduct. We cannot but show in the most practical way possible the Department is deeply interested.\n\nYou will be pleased to know our senior association football team won the Timberland Championship Cup for the Lower Fraser Division. Our second team won the Junior League Championship Cup and through the seasons games were not beaten. It would not be necessary to wait to get the cheque from the Department at Ottawa if we could have your personal interest in the matter.\n\nThanking you for your past favours and in anticipation\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.H.

Since payment was made it has been observed that the cheque sent you made over-payment to the amount of $6.25 on the last account, in which there was an error. Kindly refer to the third entry dated 2nd November.

I note that the space formerly used in the manual training building is now needed for the class in internal combustion engines.\n\nYou may expend the sum of $397.00 for this purpose, engaging one skilled carpenter to assist the manual training instructor and the older boys. Properly certified accounts, in duplicate, should be forwarded for the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Haley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Indian Res. School,\nSardis, B. C.\nOctober 30th, 1929.\n\nRussell T. Perrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is necessary to build as soon as possible in connection with the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School a garage of sufficient dimensions to hold three cars 30' X 16' with three windows and three double doors.\n\nThe cost involved would be-\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| 35 sacks of Cement          | $35.00 |\n| Lumber, shingles, doors and windows | $45.00 |\n| Hardware                    | $30.00 |\n| Paint two coats             | $35.00 |\n| Lighting                    | $37.00 |\n| Water                       | $45.00 |\n| One skilled carpenter       | $70.00 |\n\nTotal ... $397.00\n\nTo justify ourselves making this request, let me state that our manual training in the technical arts is necessarily developing and to our woodwork and blacksmith departments we have added a course in mechanical engineering including the gas engine. There are hundreds of gas motor boats used for fishing purposes owned by Indians in British Columbia. A large number of which are owned and operated by families represented at Coqualeetza. It is obvious this vocational training is more necessary for the boys of the coast villages and reserves than farming and horticulture.\nespecially helpful will it be for the boys of the V and VI grades who will not be able to go to the Technical High School in Vancouver and it will not be nearly so costly.\n\nTo the present time we have housed our cars in the Technical Building on the ground floor one part of which is devoted to blacksmith work. The building was originally designed for this extension in mechanical work; when the time was opportune to commence. This part used as a garage is now needed for the original design of the building.\n\nWe have three cars to take care of. One used by the Principal and the general work of the school, another by the nurse and field matron and the farm instructor who has been with us for six years has a car. No garage is rather a serious need and if the Department would assure a grant of the amount necessary I would build it at once at a safe distance from the other buildings, adequate in size and in keeping with the general plan of the school plant.\n\nWhile the training in building this unit will be helpful to the boys one skilled carpenter should be employed.\n\nTrusting my explanation is satisfactory and adequate to convince the Department of the wisdom and absolute need for such a building.\n\nI am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

These repairs were put in the Drying Tumbler. After several years constant use there was sufficient wearing as to require attention.\n\nRE FARQUHARSON & ECKLE LTD. Considering the fact there are twenty-six toilets in the building and they have been in commission since the opening it will be recognized by the Department that both vigilance and care have been exercised. These accounts are chiefly for new fittings.\n\nRE CRANE LIMITED. Valves for Boiler Room.\n\nRE KNIGHTS LUMBER CO. LTD. These accounts are for material only. A portion of this lumber was used to put a partition in the main long pantry to keep the food and dishes used for the staff separate from the childrens. This was put in at the unanimous request of the staff. The balance was used to protect the steam pipes which ran along the base boards in the boys and girls senior playrooms - making seating as was done in the junior playrooms years ago. This protection was found necessary as the unprotected portions of the pipes were being stepped on and bent and broken at the joints. A small portion of the lumber was used in making forms to replace chairs in the Assembly Hall.\n\nThese repairs were not submitted to the Department before being undertaken, but were urgent in the case of the toilets, drying tumbler, steam pipe protection and valves and I trust payment will be authorized.\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nMarch 20th, 1930.\n\nA.

H. Bailey,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 8, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing vouchers covering the expenditure incurred in the erection of a garage at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. I am returning these vouchers herewith, and have to request that you will prepare an account, in duplicate, in your own favour covering the accounts which you paid from school funds. You should not include any other unpaid accounts in this voucher. In connection with accounts that are to be paid direct by the Department, it is only necessary that they be forwarded in duplicate, certified by yourself. I would point out that only one copy of the following accounts have been received, viz.: Ross Nixon, covering the cost of gravel, and Marshall-Wells B. C. Ltd., for $13.65. When you prepare and certify the account covering the amounts paid by you, and also forward the duplicate accounts mentioned above, consideration will then be given to the payment of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Raley,\nPrincipal, Coqualeetza Res. School,\nSardis, B.C.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI do not know what funds will be available for Coqualeetza Residential School, Sardis, this year but trust the amount necessary for the building of a farmer's residence will be authorized.\n\nI might remind you the Department voted Three Thousand Dollars last year and gave permission at the Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada to have that amount applied to the purchase of a house and grounds five acres in the orchard belonging to Dr. White adjacent to the Department's property at Coqualeetza Residential School.\n\nThe purchase of the property valued at $7500.00 was unanimously recommended by the presbytery in British Columbia. The General Board in Toronto while in sympathy with the resolution and recognizing the advantage of securing the property for school purposes, on account of insufficient funds had to lay the matter over.\n\nA few days ago I attended the British Columbia Missionary Committee to urge the grant be made this year. The Superintendent of Missions and the Chairman of the Missionary Committee both advised me that the fund was inadequate, so regretfully, in view of more urgent claims I thought it unwise to press the matter.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6423, file 860-5, part 2)\nThe co-operation of the church and the Department for several reasons was approved and advised by the Rev. T. Ferrier, Inspector of Indian Education for the United Church of Canada and the late Mr. R.H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia. In endeavouring to obtain the necessary amount from the church I canvassed every influential approach possible.\n\nI hope the Department will now authorize the work to proceed on the $3000.00 basis.\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H. Bailey,\nPrincipal.\nTo The Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMarch 31st, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere are some rather pressing needs which have on previous occasions been brought to the notice of the Department and which I should like to stress - some of which might be authorized this year.\n\nGYMNASIUM. Since coming to Coqualeetza the need of a gymnasium has been felt for obvious reasons. Since we doubled our pupilage the need has been more keenly felt. We excel in our outdoor athletics. As however there is at least one half of the school year when outdoor games cannot be indulged, it is rather a serious situation. It will cost about $8,000.00 to construct the building in harmony with the general plant.\n\nGREENHOUSE. This a unit of the original plan of the new school adopted by the government in 1923. You will remember the lowest tender for the greenhouse was $5000.00. This was more than the Department thought should be spent for such a purpose. I have made an estimate with a contractor and find that a greenhouse of the same size can be built for $2000.00 by using a wooden frame instead of iron. A year ago we lost over $1000.00 geraniums and this winter we lost 1500 plants besides much valuable garden stuff we were trying to save for bedding out this spring. On account of the large grounds and extensive gardens we have to maintain, we are handicapped for lack of this necessity.\n2.\n\nTHE MAIN BUILDING of COQUALEETZA. It is now six years old and requires an expenditure of $2000.00 over-hauling plumbing and electric light systems, motors and machinery. Floors in the boys' and girls' play-rooms should be relaid. To save the floor surfaces the corridor should be revarnished and the wood work in certain parts re-painted. While the building has been kept very carefully, deterioration through lack of small annual expenditures is the last thing the Department would wish to see.\n\nThanking you for your favourable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.H. Raley,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 9, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the farmer's residence at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. I note the cost would be approximately $3,000. I have also your letter of the same date, relative to the need for a gymnasium and a greenhouse at the school. In reply, I regret that there are no funds available for major improvements at your school this year. A request of this kind should reach the Department in the fall, in time to be included, if allowed, in our Estimates to Parliament. I have made a note for future estimates in this connection.\n\nI note that the plumbing and the electric light system, etc., should be overhauled at the present time, and, while a large expenditure cannot be approved in this connection, I may say that the most urgent repairs will be considered favourably, if you indicate just what is needed, with an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, requesting that a grant to the amount of $300 be provided towards the cost of the expenses of the pupils of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School in order that they can attend a camp near Kitsilano Park.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will allow a grant not exceeding the above amount, and same will be paid upon receipt of the usual certified voucher in duplicate for the expenditure incurred to that amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

McKenzie, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to apply for a Grant towards the cost of transportation and camp expenses on behalf of the pupils of Coqualeetza Residential School, who have not the privilege of returning each year to their homes for holidays.\n\nLast year we were crowded out of Ocean Park where we have camped for fifteen years, and had to seek another site. Through Mr. Indian Agent C. C. Perry we found an excellent place on the fringe of Kitsilano Indian Reserve, adjoining Kitsilano Park. Our expenses coming to Vancouver were somewhat heavier than in previous years. We remained a month at the sea-side, and the children no doubt derived inestimable benefit from the change. We have had also to purchase this year a small boat for their pleasure. I would recommend the Department increase the grant to $300. This is a very moderate request.\n\nAs you know the children from nearly all the other schools return to their homes for holidays, and the school is so much in pocket, the Department allowing for each child the per capita for the regular holiday. In our case nearly forty children do not return home, and we have to keep them, and are under that much more expense than schools where no children remain for holidays. Would you kindly consider this, and if possible allow for this year the grant of $300.\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.H. Raley\nPrincipal\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nSARDIS, B.C. April 19th, 1930\n\nA.F. Mackenzie Esq.,\nAssist.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing voucher in duplicate and certified accounts for expenses which I believe will legitimately be considered a charge on the Government, inasmuch as they are permanent repairs and fixtures.\n\nThe following accounts have been paid out of school funds already:\n\nNo. 1 - Marshall Wells $20.57\nNo. 2 - The Gurney Foundry Co. 2.88\nNo. 3 - Crane's Ltd. 8.05\nNo. 4 - Chilliwack Plumbing Co. 3.00\n\n$34.50\n\nIf it is in order kindly have the cheque for this amount ($34.50) made payable to Coqualeetza Residential School. The unpaid accounts' cheques could be made direct, and in favour of:\n\nNo. 2 - David Spencer Co. $86.58\nNo. 6 - Max S. Wilson 16.80\nNo. 7 - E.E. Mower 23.00\nNo. 10 - Chilliwack Lumber Yards 27.25\n\n$153.63\n\nIn explanation of these accounts, I would not send them if the school could afford to pay them out of the grant we receive. Also, I believe you will consider them quite a legitimate expense.\n\nNo. 1 - The screens put on the windows when the building was erected have outlived their usefulness and needed renewing, especially on all windows of the basement floor.\n\nNo. 2 - The material had to be purchased rather hurriedly on account of the visit of Viscount and Viscountess Willingdon, and their party. Before making the purchase I explained over the phone the situation to Mr. Daunt, the Indian Agent, and while he could not authorize the purchase he advised it. It was the only thing to do under the circumstances, inasmuch as there was not time to spare for communication with Ottawa. The Chilliwack store had to send to Vancouver for it, and it required a skilled man to cut and lay the linoleum.\n\nI am confident you will agree that the visit of the vice-regal party was one of those rare occasions when the prestige of the educational work of the Indian Department...\nin British Columbia was at stake. The school went to some expense renovating, decorating and putting the yards, grounds and lawns into their trimmest appearance so that the setting of their visit and inspection should produce the most agreeable effect possible, and lastingly impress the pupils for whose benefit the visit was arranged. There will be only expense in connection with the visit I am asking the Department to consider payment of. The old linoleum by the constant wear and tear and the tramping of many feet daily to and from the class rooms and assembly hall, was worn and needed to be renewed. It could legitimately be regarded as a permanent fixture as it is cut to fit.\n\nNo. 4. - Tap for drinking fountain on the Girls' Side outside similar to the one on the Boys' Side.\n\nNo. 6. - Skilled labour, and paper, for a room in the Principal's residence.\n\nNos. 7,8,9. - Skilled labour rebuilding front entrance steps of Principal's residence. The steps were unsafe - the stringers rotten at the foot, the treads warped and split. Also the building of a concrete stand and laying pipes for the Girls' drinking fountain.\n\nNos. 10,11. - Lumber for the steps and some improvements in the Assembly Hall.\n\nTo the present time since the school was built in 1923-4 I have made the necessary repairs at comparatively little cost to the Department. Recommending favourable consideration be given to the account,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H. Raley\nPrincipal\nOttawa, November 7, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department authorizes you to arrange for the papering of a bedroom in the Principal's residence at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.

SCOTT,\n\nWith reference to the letter from the Private Secretary of the Minister of Agriculture, I may say that Principal Raley, of the Coqualeetsa Institute, on the 22nd ultimo, wrote the Department with reference to the needs of the school. One item was for a tractor, with plow, and disc harrow. As the farm at this school is not very large, I did not consider the matter urgent and did not intend to place it in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDear Dr Scott,\n\nYour generous gift of the lot and R made me very happy last night when I saw it.

McPaley\nOttawa, December 4, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, giving a list of the major necessities in order of their importance in the way of building and repairs required at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that our appropriation for the next fiscal year will be limited and the Department will be unable to effect many improvements in buildings or increased equipment. Your various requests have been noted and will receive consideration when our estimates are being prepared for submission to parliament at its next session, and you will be advised later which of the items as mentioned in your letter are allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Macdonald,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Raley, F.R.G.S.,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Residential School,\nSardis,\nBritish Columbia.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI do not know whether I am working through the right official channel or not when it comes to requisition for major necessities in the line of building in writing to you. I know however that you will kindly have the matter of this letter placed in the proper branch.\n\nOur wants are so numerous I have decided to list in order of importance and urgency, trusting that as many as possible will meet with the favor of the Department and find their way into the estimates. Nearly all of these items have from time to time been discussed with the Inspector of Agencies Colonel Pragnell, and also with Mr. Daunt.\n\nBOWMAN COTTAGE. Moving the Bowman cottage, purchased by the Department last year, to a suitable location on a concrete foundation and making other improvements suggested in my letter of August 15, 1930. The Department asked me, letter #153-0-9 dated Ottawa August 23, 1930, to postpone this work till next year. $480.00\n\nWOODSHED. As early as 1923 we made a requisition for a woodshed. Building the new school and other important items have placed this item in the background. We are however feeling the need of it as we use wood for fuel as well as coal in the buildings outside the main building. We use wood in the kitchen and bakery, and principal's house and technical building where wood furnaces are installed. The proposed shed would be 60' X 25' on a concrete wall 4' with new wood saw. Cost approximately $600.00\nMr. Ferrier - 2 -\n\nGYMNASIUM. This matter has been brought to the notice of the Department nearly every year for the past twelve years. The need is constantly felt and since we occupied the larger building and doubled our pupilage, it is constantly a matter of regret we have not such a building for use for physical training, gymnastics and games when outdoor games cannot be indulged. I have been led to believe that we would not have to wait much longer before the situation would be relieved and a gymnasium, which is recognized as necessary, would be built. $8,000.00\n\nINCINERATOR. Incinerator 2' 9\" X 6'. Iron, firebrick with concrete base. We have, of course been burning our refuse, all paper, rags, dust and dirt of which it is natural a large quantity is swept up every day. This is not allowed to accumulate anywhere in the building. We have not yet had a very satisfactory way of disposing of it by burning. We have used extemporaneous incinerators in the hope of obtaining a permanent one. This would be built of firebrick and iron. $75.00\n\nCONCRETE YARDS, BOYS' ENTRANCE AND GIRLS' ENTRANCE. During the Fall and Spring this is very rarely dry. It would require $300.00 girls' side, $300.00 boys' side, to make a sufficiently large yard so that the girls and boys on their respective sides would be able to line up without getting their feet wet. $600.00\n\nPLAY GROUND EQUIPMENT. The stationary equipment and fixtures for outside games do not represent a heavy monetary investment, yet it should have immediate attention, inasmuch as we have not only to provide recreation for the short period allowed in public schools in the cities but we have to provide for the hours when the pupils are not at some duty or in the classroom. I would recommend equipment identical to that in use in the Vancouver city public schools, to consist of swings, see-saws, slides, sand bins, standards for vaulting and leaping and parallel bars and other apparatus. For the Junior boys and girls it is necessary to have a concrete small wading pool. Estimate for boys $250.00; for girls $250.00. $500.00\nELECTRIC BREAD CUTTER. I have examined these extensively as they are used for slicing in nearly all institutions where they serve at a meal 100 or more people. We have revolving knives. There is always danger of the children slicing their fingers. We have had two or three cases of rather serious cuts from this type of cutter. Then, unless the knives are kept in perfect condition they drag the bread rather than cut it. We have not found this satisfactory. The electric slicer is what we should be using. The cost is - - - $125.00\n\nFARMER'S COTTAGE. The grant of $3,000.00 was made for this purpose in 1928 and negotiations were entered into with the Missionary Society for a grant of $4,500.00 with which to purchase the residence and property of Dr. White. This property joins the school and would have been a splendid acquisition. Believing the Missionary Society would interest itself in the project, some delay was caused pending the decision and while they approved of the scheme, the condition of the fund would not allow a grant to be made for the purpose. I might say the British Columbia delegation to the Missionary Board were all in favor of this grant being made by the Missionary Society. However, it was too late for us when the decision was given unfavorably, to think of building, consequently the grant lapsed. We referred to this matter in the Spring and I received a letter from the Acting Assistant Deputy #153-0-5 April 9, 1930, stating that a note had been made of the matter for future estimates. I would suggest a re-vote and ask that $3,500.00 be granted for this purpose $3,500.00\n\nTERRAZO FLOORS. Terrazo floors for basement and lavatories to replace the San San laid down when the building was erected. This material was evidently not laid satisfactorily, consequently it is worn into holes, cracks and peels off. It is found in a good many places it was not laid to a sufficient thickness. We understood it should have been. The marble chipped floor we have in the dining room has proved very satisfactory. This matter, I believe, was taken up by Inspector of Agencies, Colonel Pragnell.\nCOVERED PLAY SHEDS. The large amount of rain in the Coast district of British Columbia makes it necessary to have a covered playground of ample dimensions to accommodate a large number of children. Otherwise, from November to March they have very little continuous play out of doors. It is not wise nor advisable that during the wet weather such a large number of children should be confined to the play rooms of the school. They are satisfactory for short periods but when it rains days at a time the difficulty of recreation is a problem unless they can get outside. These covered playgrounds would consist of a roof, supported and strongly braced, and a floor, with sides and walls to the North and East. Each would cost $750.00. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $1,500.00\n\nGREENHOUSE. This is a unit passed in the original plan of building the Coqualeetza School. The lowest tender then for this was $5,000.00. I have made a careful estimate with a contractor and find it can be built at half the price of the original tender. By a few changes in the structure, my estimate would be - - - - - - - - - - $2,000.00\n\nSTEAM WANGLE FOR LAUNDRY. - - - - - - - - $1,200.00\n\nTRACTOR. Tractor for farm work with the necessary equipment, plough and disc harrow. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $1,441.00\n\nFRONT GROUNDS AND DRIVE. To hard surface the circular drive from the main road in front of the building and put coping around the main lawn would be a great improvement to the front of the building. This could be done for - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $1,500.00\n\nShould you require details regarding any or all items I shall be glad to furnish any information I have. It is understood it will be impossible to get all our needs at once but as we have had only one large item outside the plant, we are hoping it will be possible to get the gymnasium this year.\n\nThanking you for your interest.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H. Bailey, Principal\nOttawa, December 3, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, relative to the repairs required to the electric light system and motor of the dough mixer at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, and enclosing quotations which you received for carrying out this work.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange with the Chilliwack Electric Co. Ltd., Chilliwack, to carry out the repairs as mentioned in their quotation to the electric light system, and you may also arrange with them to thoroughly clean the motor of the dough mixer. It is noted that their price for the above work is $75.30. You may also arrange to have the necessary repairs made to the Thor ironer, and the expense incurred for the purpose should be kept as low as possible.\n\nAfter the above work has been carried out, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe quotations which you received are returned herewith as requested. When forwarding the account covering the cost of the repairs, you should attach thereto the quotation and list of repairs of the Chilliwack Electric Co. Ltd.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Raley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Res. School,\nSardis, B.C.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nSARDIS, B.C. Nov. 22nd, 1930.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are needing some repairs to our electric light system and feel it should be done as soon as possible. I have had four men go over the system thoroughly with our Engineer and pointed out what was advisable and examined the motors, light switches, etc. Three have put in an estimate; one has not.\n\nIn commenting on these, I might say that the estimate of Mr. J. Snow includes a half Horse Power motor. This is not really necessary this year. Mr. Snow's estimate is $70.00, exclusive of the cleaning of the dough mixer.\n\nThe contractor of the Chilliwack Electric Company went thoroughly into the matter and took sufficient time to investigate carefully notwithstanding the fact it is the lowest estimate. Including the cleaning of the dough mixer, his estimate is $75.30. Mr. Marsh, Manager of the Chilliwack Electric Company, mentioned the Thor ironer and I am of the same opinion that it would be difficult to give a fair estimate of repairs without taking it down.\n\nThe Valley Electric Company is $100.00, exclusive of the cleaning of the motor on the dough mixer but includes repairing the Thor electric ironer.\n\nWhen you can, let me know what can be done by the Department and the estimate you would like me to take.\n\nWould you kindly return the estimates to file.\n\nThank you for your interest.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

Pragnell dated December 15th instant, with respect to the New Westminster Agency, in which connection I desire to say that the several representations therein made have been reviewed.\n\nWith regard to the suggested requirements of Coqualeetza Indian Residential School I beg to say that as far as I am aware no request has been made by the Principal for a steam heater and I hardly think one to be necessary. One was supplied to the St George's Indian Residential School at Lytton which has never been used.\n\nThe Cooking-pots in use at this school were as ordered by the Principal when the school was furnished, and pots of the same size were supplied to all the other schools, from which no complaints have been received.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nKamloops, B.C., December 15, 1930\n\nINSPECTION REPORT, NEW WESTMINSTER AGENCY (NO.1).\n\nCOQUELEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nI went over the school with the Principal, Rev. Raleigh. The school was not quite full. I found that the floors are going in the wash rooms and will have to be relaid shortly. The kitchen wants a steam-heater in it. The present twenty gallon cooking pots used as steamers are too heavy, cumbersome and possibly dangerous for the children and cooks to lift. An ironer is badly needed in the laundry. This, I understand has been promised. The clothes drier is far too small and a pull out cupboard one should be installed as at other schools. This is more than necessary here owing to the amount of wet and rainy weather. An electric bread slicer would also be of great use. Keys to locked doors in this school should be boxed in glass fronted boxes and placed near the locked doors in case of fire, and fire axes placed beside the fire escape doors in case of their jamming in frosty weather. This has been done at most other schools.\n\nI examined the barn and found same clean. There were twelve cows milking, Guernseys. The pig pens were kept nice and clean. I noticed that the school has a good potato crop.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nThe Rev Mr Raley,\nCoqualeetza Inst.\nSardis, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAfter going into the requirements carefully for the renovation of the electrical equipment for the different buildings in the Inst., I am able to give you the figure of Seventy Dollars and thirty cents to cover the supplies needed, work necessary to install same and repairs where such can be made. Your worst trouble is in the suspension fittings. These have been fitted with a single lock nut and bushing to a ceiling plate, which practice is not sufficiently rigid. I have allowed in my price for taking these down for rethreading so that these can be doubly locked in position. To merely tighten the present holder would be temporary work.\n\nI would suggest, where there are no beams on the ceilings, the fitting be dispensed with altogether, replacing it with a ceiling plate fitted with a receptacle and a wire guard screwed to the ceiling. This would prevent any recurrence of the present trouble.\n\nShould you decide on this course, my prices covers either the repair of the present fitting or installation of this cover and receptacle where the fittings are needing repairs, but does not cover the guard suggested. I might suggest that the motor on the rough mixer should be thoroughly cleaned; apparently it is in good shape but very dirty, which will lead to serious trouble if allowed to slide. To take this down and clean would cost $5.00.\n\nI also notice The Thor Ironer is out of commission. It is not possible to give any figure on the repair of this without taking down and could only be repaired on a time and material basis.\n\nEnclosed please find a list of repairs necessary.\n\nThanking you for this enquiry.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Chilliwack Electric Co Ltd.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The repairs are satisfactorily made and the material furnished. They also repaired the Thor motor Ironing Machine, the cost of which was $15.00, for putting in new gear.\n\nI had them also install a new switch and wiring to the yard light at a cost of $14.00. The switch in the yard was formerly near the foot of the pole and the light had to be turned on in the yard; naturally we had difficulty keeping it in repair and had to go in and out to turn the light on and off, which was necessary in the yard between the technical building and the boys' side. I had the electrician run a wire from the light on the pole to the men's lavatory where it could not be tampered with by the boys and where it could be turned on and off without necessitating an officer of the school going out into the yard.\nA. F. MacKenzie\n\nJanuary 15, 1931\n\nI trust that this may be included by the Department in necessary repairs. It is over and above the amount authorized in your letter of December 3, 1930, #153/0/5.\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H.

I am returning the same herewith, and you should arrange for payment from per capita earnings or other receipts of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. H.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find account for $102.98 for furnace for use at Coqualeetza Residential School, Sardis, B.C. It is regularly certified and I trust the Department will consider favorably the payment of the account.\n\nIn addition to the boilers in the main building, we have two buildings heated with furnaces -- one in the Manual Training and the other in the Principal's residence. The Department has only purchased one furnace about six years ago. The other one has been in use for nearly twenty years and though we have patched it and cemented it and repaired it from time to time, it got beyond even the possibility of repair so for the safety of the building, it was necessary for us to install a new furnace. We took the casing off and I consulted with furnace men as to the possibility of again repairing it. It was however, they stated, a foolish and uneconomical expenditure to put any money into it. The fire box was cracked in several places. It had been eaten through where the smoke stack is joined to\nMr. McKenzie\n\nFeb. 28, 1931.\n\nthe furnace, and being the winter I felt justified in making the purchase, hoping that as it was absolutely necessary the Department would consider the payment of it.\n\nThanking you for your interest.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent, Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI am enclosing account in duplicate, certified, for the amount of $47.00 fees we have had to pay for music examinations. It would help us greatly if the Department would consider the payment of these as the letter shows I had to send Mr. Minchin the cheque before I had time to communicate with you in the matter.\n\nI believe the Department has considered the payment of fees for educational purposes and we have up to the present time, paid the fees for the High School and other examinations, without reference to the Department. There are two pupils in addition to those who are taking Toronto Conservatory examinations, whose fees are $8.00. I have been unable to get receipts in duplicate up to the present and consequently they are not included, but if the Department would consider favorably the payment of this, as I consider it a fair and legitimate charge, I should be very much obliged.\n\nThe pupils pay for their own lessons and the general effect of music in the school has been uplifting and generally beneficial as well as of cultural and educational value to the pupils.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

The former arrangement will have to continue, as the Dominion Department of Public Works informs me that they have no inspector who can be given this duty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., March 19, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe-Inspection School Boilers.\n\nWith reference to the matter of the annual inspection of heating plants at the various residential schools in British Columbia, the Department has during the past several years been having these plants inspected by the Provincial Inspector of Boilers and certain fees have been paid therefor.\n\nI understand that the Dominion Department of Public Works has now an Inspector of Boilers who gives attention to the various public buildings, and the thought has struck me that possibly some arrangement could be made with the Public Works Department whereby this Inspector could be utilized to make inspections of the boilers and furnaces at our Indian Schools. Such a scheme no doubt would work out more economically for the Department than is at present the case. I would, therefore, recommend that you take this matter into consideration and if necessary endeavour to have some arrangements with the Public Works Department made accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B./KD.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 21st, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nMr. Inspector G. H. Barry, in a report on his recent inspection of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, recommends that two lengths of fire hose, each 50 feet long, be supplied, one to be for use on each side. He states that the present supply of hose will not take the water to certain areas unless several lengths are joined together. The Department will approve of your arranging for the purchase of these two lengths of fire hose - each 50 feet long and of the same size as the hose at present in hand. While you should obtain a good grade of hose, it is not intended that any unnecessary expense be incurred in the purchase of same. You should forward a properly certified account, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that a door be cut between the boys' infirmary and the boys' corridor. He states that this would allow for an approach from the boys' side direct and not the roundabout way through the girls' side, as at present. Please state your views regarding this recommendation of Mr. Barry and, also, the cost involved in having the door installed.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that fire escape ladders be installed leading from the small boys' and the small girls' dormitories. He states that there are two iron ladders available at the school which were formerly used on the old school. The Department will approve of your arranging, as soon as possible, to have these fire escape ladders installed. The work should be done, as far as possible, by the school staff but, if necessary, the services of a bricklayer may be engaged, in which case you should forward certified accounts covering the cost of his services.\n\nThe purchase of the fire hose and the installing of the two fire escape ladders should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Raley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Indian Res. School,\nSardis, B. C.\nExtract from Report of Mr. Inspector G.H. Barry, dated February 25, 1931, on his inspection of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nOriginal on File 153-0-6.\n\nSuggestions:\n\nI would suggest that TWO lengths of fire hose, each 50 feet long, be supplied to the school. One to be for use on each side. The present supply of hose will not take the water to certain areas, unless several lengths are joined together. It would probably be found impossible to collect the lengths required in case of a real fire.\n\nI would suggest that a hydrant be placed at the valve outside the front of the building, and 250 feet of suitable hose be provided for attachment to this outside hydrant.\n\nI feel that a door should be cut between the boys' infirmary and the boys' corridor. This would allow for an approach from the boys' side direct, and not the round about way through the girls' side as at present. In the newer buildings such a door is provided in just this place. It looks to me as if it had been left out in this building by accident.\n\nI very strongly recommend that no time be lost in the authorization of Fire Escape Ladders from the small boys' and small girls' dormitories. These small rooms I regret to say look very like DEATH TRAPS to me. There are two iron ladders available at the school. These are from an old building. The Principal states that he requires the consent of the Department for the drilling of the necessary holes in the brick work and for the services of a bricklayer.\n\nRemarks:- The floors in the basements are very much worn. The material of which they are made does not seem to stand up well to the constant use to which it is put. There is a different material being used now in the newer schools, which I should recommend be used when the present covering is replaced.\n\nBesides the jacket heater for domestic water and the high pressure boiler for the laundry water, there are two sectional boilers (Cast Iron Heaters) in use. One tubular boiler would probably do the work in a better way and reduce the cost of firing considerably.\n\nIn bringing this rather lengthy report to a close, may I say that the above suggestions are merely being made to raise the safety factor of the school.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nMar. 10, 1931.\n\nA.

H. RALBY,\nPrincipal\n\nDated at Sardis, B.C.\nMarch 10, 1931.\nA.F. Mackenzie Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing in reference to the need of refrigeration in our kitchen.\n\nIt is very much needed and while I have not pressed the matter on the Department before I am seized of the fact that it is now time to urge such provision. We should save food and milk if this was provided. I believe the Department installs a small plant where ice cannot be obtained and stored. As we cannot obtain ice locally I am justified making this request. I have looked into the matter of a plant provided by the Jarvis Electric Co. Ltd., Vancouver and would suggest the \"KELVINATOR\" as suitable. The cost of this would be between $600 and $700. There are other refrigeration plants and competitive prices would be in order.\n\nWould you kindly at your earliest convenience let me know if I have authority to proceed with the matter.\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.H. Haley,\nPrincipal\nOttawa, July 14, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, requesting that a grant be provided to install refrigeration in the kitchen at the Coqualeetsa Indian Residential School. In reply I have to say that the Department has no funds available at the present time to provide the cost. A note will be made to include the amount required in our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Haley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetsa Institute,\nSardis,\nB.C.\nVictoria, B.C., December 4th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to transmit herewith the inspection report No. 2 of Mr. G. S. Pragnell, Inspector of Agencies, dated December 2nd instant, of his inspection of the New Westminster Agency.\n\nIn regard to the Coqualeetza and Mission Residential schools, I beg to say that Inspector Barry (schools) is at present on his tour of inspection, and will report also in due course thereon.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nKamloops, B.C., Dec. 2nd, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith report on the above agency (New Westminster No. 8) as follows:\n\nCO-ULETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nI went over the school with the principal. There were 220 children in the school at the time of my visit, which happened to be \"Founders' Day\" and sports of all kinds were in full swing that afternoon. They were going to have for supper, bread and butter, fruit, cocoa and milk.\n\nThe school was clean and in excellent order, though as before reported, most of the floors are in very bad shape and should and will have to be attended to as soon as possible.\n\nThe Principal wishes to make some slight structural alteration in the matter of a doorway into the infirmary from the boys' side. This would give direct access, which is not so now.\n\nI also went over the barns, which were well kept and in good order. The stock, pigs, cows and horses were clean well fed and looked after.\n\nI went over the manual training school, which as I have before reported, is a great success. I was particularly pleased to see that the boys are taking up boat building. One quite a large launch for fishing purposes, was in the course of construction, and apparently, they seem to be making an excellent job of it.\n\nThe boys of the school were playing a football match against a white boys' team. These boys are really first class football players and played a good, keen and clean game. In fact, the sports and sporting instinct at this school reflects great credit upon the principal. Organized games such as take place at this school are, to my mind, a most important subject in the upbringing and forming of character amongst the young Indians; perhaps even more so than academic knowledge. Besides games, these children are trained in various other ways, such as cadets, scouts, girl guides, cubs, brownies, gardening, etc. There are now forming a library, in fact every activity and perhaps more than can be found at a high priced white boarding school. All these activities make for an excellent atmosphere in the school, and show what can be done to benefit the Indian children's training but at the same time they must entail endless work upon the principal and reflect great credit upon his organizing abilities.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, November 30, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, relative to the major necessities in the way of building and repairs required at the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department was unable to include an item in the Estimates during the current year for removing the Bowman cottage. Your various requests for buildings and repairs have been noted for our Estimates for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Haley,\nPrincipal,\nCoqualeetza Res. School,\nSardis, B.C.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nNovember 20, 1931\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLet me draw your attention to the fact that I have received no intimation, up to the present time, of a grant towards the requisition for Building and Repairs for Coqualeetza Residential School 1931-1932 I sent on November 22nd, 1930.\n\nI received a reply from you #153-0-5, dated Ottawa, December 4, 1930, to the effect that the Department would be unable to effect many improvements in building or increase equipment. Quoting from your letter \"Your various requests have been noted and will receive consideration when our estimates are being prepared for submission to parliament at its next session, and you will be advised later which of the items as mentioned in your letter are allowed.\"\n\nThe first on the list was the Bowman cottage. The request was for $480.00. I had previously written regarding this and received a reply from the Department, letter #153-0-9, dated Ottawa, August 23, 1930. The reply states \".... I notice you have already effected the removal. The Department is forced to ask you to postpone the completion of this work until next year when funds can be provided for the purpose......\".\nMr. MacKenzie\n\nNovember 20, 1931.\n\nI can fully appreciate the fact that your Department cannot possibly have the funds at its command as in previous years. It is necessary however, if at all possible, that we should complete the improvements on this. We are utilizing the cottage to advantage and should be greatly helped if the Department would authorize this expenditure. Would you kindly advise us in this connection.\n\nThanking you for your interest.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H. RALEY,\nPrincipal\n\nGHR:hjc\nNovember 17, 1931.\n\nA. F.

This is the same amount that was allowed last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Bailey,\nPrincipal,\nCocolacten Institute,\nSarais, B.C.\nA.F. McKenzie Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to apply for the favourable consideration of a grant as last year, namely $300.00 towards the expenses of the annual holiday camp at Ocean Park for Coqualeetza Residential School. I might state that this year we shall have increased expenditure owing to the fact that more children have to remain at the school and be accommodated at camp. You may remember that for the past two years we had the camp on the corner of the Kitsilano Indian Reserve, Vancouver free of cost. This year owing to the building of a new bridge across the Reserve it was not considered a suitable place for the children so we rented a delightful site for one month at Ocean Park.\n\nThanking you for your interest in undertaking this for the welfare of the children,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nG.H. Raley,\nPrincipal.\nFINAL REPORT\non\nCONSTRUCTION OF WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM\nto\nKOOTENAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nKOOTENAY INDIAN AGENCY\nBY\nF. R. ARCHIBALD\n\nC. E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDom.Water Power & Hydrom. Bureau,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nFebruary 8, 1932.\nFINAL REPORT\non\nCONSTRUCTION OF WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM\nto\nKOOTENAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nKOOTENAY INDIAN AGENCY\nby\nF. R. ARCHIBALD\n\nVancouver, B.C.,\nFebruary 8, 1932.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nFebruary 8, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReport is herewith submitted covering the construction of water supply system to Kootenay Indian Residential School, together with summary of costs.\n\nWork was done in accordance with that portion of Mr. W. C. Warren's report of March 4, 1931, which dealt with the development for domestic water supply only.\n\nCONTRACT\n\nAdvertisements were published in the \"Cranbrook Courier\" inviting tenders for the construction of the water supply system according to plans and specifications which called for the construction of two concrete intake boxes at the springs and a reinforced concrete reservoir on the existing pump line from the school, the erection of wire fencing around the site of the springs and the installation of about 2800 feet of 3-inch pipe line from the springs to the reservoir. The contract for this work was let to Mr. A.E. Jones of Cranbrook and was signed by him on November 14, 1931. Work was started on the same day and continued until\n\nG.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nDecember 5th when it had to be temporarily discontinued owing to non-delivery of pipe. Work was resumed on January 8, 1932, and finally completed on January 20th, on which date the system was in full operation.\n\nThe contract price for this work was $4400.00.\n\nEXTRA WORK\n\nReconstruction of Reinforced Concrete Reservoir\n\nAs discussed in detail, in memorandum dated January 2nd and attached to this report as Appendix \"A\", it was deemed advisable to reconstruct the reinforced concrete reservoir. This was done on December 6th. The cost of this extra work was $410.72.\n\nCleaning of Pressure Tank\n\nFrom the concrete reservoir, water is pumped to a steel tank from which it is raised by air pressure to the upper floors of the school building.\n\nThis tank I am informed, has a capacity of approximately 3,000 gallons. It is buried under about ten foot earth cover outside of the engine room of the school in the angle formed by the engine room and chapel walls. A timber lined shaft about 14 feet deep gives access to the manhole, which is located in the end of the tank adjacent to the engine room.\n\nAs this tank had not been inspected for over ten years it was considered advisable to clean it thoroughly before cutting in on the new water supply system from the springs.\nThe bottom of the tank was found to be covered some four inches deep with sludge deposited from St. Mary's river water. About thirty pails full of this material were removed, the interior of the tank was then thoroughly scrubbed with wire brushes and well rinsed out.\n\nIn addition to cleaning out the tank it was found necessary to reline the shaft leading to the manhole of the tank, the old lining being badly rotted.\n\n**PUMPING ENGINE**\n\nAs instructed by you under date of November 26, 1931, the pumping engine used prior to December 2, 1931, was on that date removed and replaced by a Gilson internal combustion engine. After a short period of operation this engine proved most unsatisfactory and was replaced by a Petters atomic diesel engine which is reported to be giving complete satisfaction.\n\nThe final cost of this installation was $882.36.\n\n**AMENDMENT OF PLANS**\n\nDuring progress of construction it was considered advisable to make slight alterations in the design of the reservoir. These alterations are shown on the plan attached to this report, which plan supersedes the plan accompanying Mr. Warren's report of March 4, 1931.\nSUMMARY OF COST\n\nContract - A. E. Jones $4400.00\nReservoir Reconstruction 410.72\nCleaning pressure tank 68.46\nNew engine 882.36\nEngineering supervision 326.35\nExpress 11.10\nAdvertising 34.44\n\n$6133.43\n\nPhotographs of various portions of the work are appended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. R. Archibald\nDivision Hydrometric Engineer\nVancouver, B.C.,\nJanuary 2, 1932.\n\nRe - Water Supply System\nKootenay Indian Residential School\nFailure and Re-construction of Concrete Reservoir\n\nMemorandum - Mr. Webb\n\nConcrete work on the above project was put under way on November 18, when the upper intake box was installed. On November 20, concrete was poured for the lower intake box. When forms were removed from these structures the concrete was found to be of excellent quality and well set.\n\nTemperature records for these days, taken at Cranbrook about six miles distant, show a maximum of 36 degrees and a minimum of 13. No records were available at Kootenay Indian Residential School but it lies at a considerably lower elevation than Cranbrook, has a sheltered location in the St. Mary's River valley, and, I am informed, winter temperatures at the school are always higher than at Cranbrook. From the above it is obvious that there was no danger of ill effects from frost action on the dates noted.\n\nConditions on the morning of November 21 were apparently not different from previous days and installation of the reinforced concrete reservoir was proceeded with. During that night however there was a very sudden drop in temperature, Cranbrook records showing a minimum of 10 degrees below zero.\n\nThis cold snap continued until after December 1, and I am informed, was altogether unexpected and most unusual so early in the winter season. Records kept by the Forestry Department in\nCranbrook show nothing like it since 1924.\n\nRecords obtained at Cranbrook by the Meteorological Service of Canada show the November mean temperature for the previous 23 years to have been 29 degrees. The mean temperature for November, 1931 was 24.2 degrees; for the first twenty days of the month it was 34 degrees, but for the last ten days it was only 4.5 degrees showing a period of exceptionally low temperature.\n\nToward the end of this cold snap, salamanders were placed in the reservoir to slowly thaw the concrete. In some countries, I am informed, concrete is allowed to freeze and later when thawed out, a good set is obtained. After a few days of thawing with the salamanders different portions of the forms inside the reservoir were removed and samples of the concrete aggregate secured. In no case, in my opinion, was there a satisfactory concrete set, the thawed aggregate appearing to be nothing better than packed sand and gravel. Orders were thereupon given to dismantle the reservoir and to prepare for its reconstruction.\n\nThe cold snap broke on December 2, and on December 4 the reservoir was reconstructed under favourable weather conditions. To safeguard against another sudden drop in temperature, all materials were heated, and immediately on completion of construction the reservoir was covered with straw and manure.\n\nFairly mild weather held for some days and it is confidently expected that the reservoir as now constructed will prove to be a structure of good workmanship.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Morley also has overseas service to his credit.\n\nMr. Robertson comes next in rating, he having been inspector of construction on public buildings erected at Chilliwack but has no overseas record.\n\nMr. Baxter comes third.

BARCLAY M.D.,\nMedical Superintendent,\nCoqualeetza Indian Hospital, Sardis, B.C.\n\nVoucher No.: 588\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6423, file 869-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\nOttawa,\nJanuary 27, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWithin the last few months we have received from Doctor Barclay two accounts, one covered by his voucher 289 for $17.97 and the other by his voucher 588 for $27.60. Both of these amounts are comparatively small, but a review of our files does not indicate that any authority was given for the purchase of the articles covered by the vouchers. I am particularly interested in knowing just what use they hope to make of the four hides purchased.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter received from Dr. W. S. Barclay requesting authority to expend approximately $24.00 to purchase moose hides for use in connection with the vocational work at the hospital which is carried out under the supervision of the teachers, Miss Flynn and Mrs. Robertson. The transportation costs are estimated by Dr. Barclay at $5.00 to $6.00, making the total amount required for this purpose approximately $30.00.\n\nIt will be noted that Dr. Barclay suggests that the funds received from the sale of articles made from the hides could be used for financing odd purchases, in which I presume he includes further supplies of leather.\n\nMuch of real value is being accomplished in having the children at the hospital take an interest in this and all forms of craft work and I have no hesitation in recommending favourable consideration of this application. I would also recommend that, if in order, the expenditure be made a charge against Vote 79 B.C. Special.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\n1st November, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nSome of our women patients have been making beaded leather novelties which have had a ready sale. Although beads have been quite hard to get, we seem to be able to locate small quantities here and there which keep our patients occupied, but it has been almost impossible to secure leather.\n\nFollowing an enquiry, Mr. Indian Agent Howe has informed me that I could secure a number of moose hides from a Mr. J.E. McKintyre of Fort McLeod, B.C. at a cost of Six Dollars each, plus cost of transportation. I am not sure whether Mr. McKintyre is an Indian, or whether, (more likely), he is in charge of the Hudson Bay post.\n\nWould it be possible to secure authority for the purchase of, say four, of these hides at a cost of $24.00 plus perhaps another $5.00 or $6.00 for transportation, from the \"B.C. Special Vote\"? It is necessary, in connection with our vocational work here, to make small outlays for material from time to time, and I would propose that we would sell leather from hides thus secured and use this small fund for financing odd purchases.\n\nMr. Howe says in his letter that we would not be able to get these hides until through the Christmas mail. It is quite likely too, that word should be sent north as soon as possible in order to make certain they are available for that mail. If it is necessary for you to communicate with Ottawa, I would suggest therefore, that you write by Air Mail and ask for an Air Mail reply. I am writing to Mr. Howe saying what steps have been taken.\n\nW.S. Barclay, M.D.\nMedical Superintendent.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, November 8, 1943.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., P. O. Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia.\n\nYour recommendation that an amount of $50.00 be authorized for the purchase of moose hides in connection with vocational work at the Coqualeetsa Hospital is approved - payment to be made out of Welfare Vote. Please quote this file number and date of letter as your authority.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCoqualeetza Indian Hospital,\nSardis, B. C.\nFebruary 12th, 1944.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia,\nP. O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nIn reply to your letter of February 7th, file 107-9-1151, asking for information relative to vouchers #289 and #586.\n\nThe expenditure for the latter of course was authorized by the Department through your office. The hides are to be cut up and used in the making of moccasins and small miniature beaded moccasins, gauntlets, jackets etc., which are used for wear as lapel ornaments.\n\nVoucher #289 covers an extensive list of small quantities of articles used by the patients for doing handicraft work. Such articles include wool, cotton, oilcloth, homespun, needles, thread, crochet hooks, linen and jack-knives. The jack-knives of course were for the purpose of encouraging the boys to do totem pole carving on the yellow cedar which you were able to secure for us quite some time ago. At times I have bought small quantities of poster paint for the necessary colouring of these totem poles. The varnish used to finish the articles comes from our own hospital stock. Some of the articles made with other supplies, some of which are indicated above, and which are worked on by the women and girls include stuffed dolls, stuffed oilcloth children's toys, table runners, cushion covers, small crocheted articles, shopping bags, afghans, and similar articles which do not come to mind at the moment.\n\nI am sure the Department is not questioning the desirability of carrying on this type of work, as we have found that when our patients, especially the younger ones are doing these things they are really less active than when they are not occupied. With the supervision and encouragement of the teachers they are really carrying on much the same type of work as is done in the schools I believe, and more than once I have been given to understand that they are happier when they have something like this to do.\n\nActually of course I did not recall that the Department ever specifically authorized any special sum to be used for purchase of these necessary quite varied supplies, and they may feel it advisable to budget for this particular branch of our hospital work which I consider a necessary part of our treatment. Thus far of course it has been difficult to estimate the cost of such supplies during a full year.\nTo Major MacKay\n\nFebruary 12th, 1944.\n\nMost of these are bought in small quantities and where available, of course can be much more easily obtained by personal purchase than requisition to the Department. So often the need arises without being able to anticipate a sufficient time in advance for reference to the Department.\n\nThe Department may wonder what is happening to the finished articles. Not long ago I indicated to the Department in connection with a request for supplies of small seed beads that the articles produced (mainly small novelties) were being sold. This is true of most of the other goods made by the patients. Depending somewhat on the particular item a portion of the selling price is returned to the patient, not so much as recompense for the time involved, but to provide them with a little spending money. Part is given over to the B.C. Indian Spitfire Fund, and a small proportion usually not more than five to twenty-five cents (depending on the total value) is retained by the teachers for buying additional supplies. We have adopted the procedure of paying the patient in cash at once out of this small fund we are trying to build up, so that he or she will not have to wait until the eventual sale of the article. We have found that patients are much more pleased and more cooperative when this is done. I have always taken the attitude that we are not a factory and no attempt whatever is being made to produce things on a commercial scale in spite of the fact that requests have come from many places for these \"Indian articles\". We cannot begin to supply these many requests.\n\nLast fall at the Chilliwack Exhibition we had a display of our handicraft which excited a very great deal of interest, and as a result there was quite a flood of individual orders for this type of handicraft. I think we received some worthwhile publicity.\n\nIf there is anything further I can explain in connection with this part of our work I would be very glad to do so, and if any specific instructions from the Department are required they will be welcome. Thus far we have had to more or less let the work develop along the most suitable lines. Actually there is almost enough supervisory work involved not only with the patients, but with the many little financial transactions, to require the full-time of one person.\n\nW.S. Barclay\nW. S.

There is so much to say in regards to the teaching and the occupational work at the Coqualeetza Hospital.\n\nAt first glance it might appear that our requirements are excessive in comparison with other Indian schools; but when it is understood that very few of the books can be re-issued on account of the presence of disease; that a large number of carefully graded and selected workbooks are essential because the children can use them without constant supervision (the teachers are with them for 30, 60, or 90 minute periods four days a week) and that any extra aids which will sharpen their interest, add to their happiness, or promote their well-being should be used, then you must feel that the actual expenditures are well justified and profitable.\n\nIt is a great consolation and inspiration in our work to see how eagerly the children look forward to their school period, and to see how splendidly they progress. It is an amazing fact that their progress parallels and often exceeds that of the pupil in the ordinary schools in the primary grades.\n\nI shall forward a list of recent publications (selected and approved by the Vancouver School Board) which would be most interesting for the children. There is a very great need for a large library with a reading vocabulary suitable for pre-primer to grade three reader. We cannot obtain jack-knives here at all. Are there any available in the east? We need three dozen badly. If it would be possible I should also like some samples of Ontario bass-wood with the bark left on it, to try out carving bear, moose, etc.\n\nYou will be pleased to know that two of our boys won first prizes in the Kiwanis Hobby Show for Boys this week, one for wood carving and one for leather craft.\nYou are no doubt familiar with the project that I prepared under the supervision of Dr. Barclay for the teaching of tuberculosis control in the Indian Schools.\n\nIn closing I ask you to please look at my qualifications, my work, and my inspectors report; then compare my salary with the Teacher's Salary Schedule for British Columbia.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nAlice M. Degen\nOttawa, April 25, 1945.\n\nDear Miss Flynn:\n\nMr. Hoey has referred to me your letter of April 6. I have reviewed its contents carefully, and when future requisitions are received we will keep in mind the requirements at Coqualeetza.\n\nWe were especially pleased to know that two of the boys from Coqualeetza had won first prizes in the Kiwanas Hobby Show.\n\nI have requested our Purchasing Branch to make an endeavour to secure the three dozen jack-knives. I am not certain that we will be successful, as these articles are very difficult to obtain, owing to present conditions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Alice Flynn,\nCoqualeetza Indian Hospital,\nSardis, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOttawa, April 25 1945\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\n(File 153-29-11)\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nCoqualeetsa Indian Day School\n\nVOTE 79\n\nSHIP TO Dr. W.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Colonel Neely,\n\nReplying to your letter inquiring about our system of handling the Occupational Work, and also regarding the extra work course I am taking a course in Applied Psychology from Washington University. It was not ready until now, and to add to any delays in completing the course, my husband has been very ill with Bright's Disease and his doctor says he is liable to have continued acute attacks, which add to his partial paralysis, complicates life for us both.\n\nRegarding our Occupational Work, I do all the bookkeeping, handle all the correspondence and fill orders, send out invoices and bills, buy all supplies either by personal purchase in Vancouver or by letters, send out samples to prospective customers, contacting personally where possible. In addition I have supplied all the women patients with materials for work, collected all finished on Thursday (which I use for occupational work of all kinds) and paying the women from goods supplied by the General Office. All bills come through my department, and purchased...\nare paid by the General Office on presentation of these bills. I also pay for all Totems made by the Indian boys here, but Mrs. Reid does all work in connection with the Totems, as part of her work with them. I, of course, find markets and do all bookkeeping. She also helps in packing orders, and in any way possible, but she goes into the wards from three until eight P.M. and prepares her work besides, so she has little time to spare. Miss O'Connor teaches from twelve to one each day, taking her dinner at half past eleven, when the patients are also eating. At that time I attend to any executive work necessary, or senior teachers give out library books to my pupils. Miss O'Connor doing that for her pupils, sent the opportunity occurs. We both teach from nine to eleven thirty, and from two fifteen to four, on each school day, excepting Thursday, when I attend to correspondence, that I have mentioned above. Both bookkeeping and work mentioned above. Both Miss O'Connor and Mrs. Reid assist where and when they can, and we often do business in our own office with offenders.\nCoqualeetza Indian Hospital\n\nOCCUPATIONAL DEPT.\n\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nAnd visitors, and we all help to prepare and pack exhibits. This year we have had a Coqualeetza Exhibit at the Vancouver Women's Hobby Show, the Chilliwack Indian Fair, and a Community Art Exhibit at the Vancouver Art Gallery. This always adds to our social work, and often means arranging the exhibit and packing it up again just to put it back for the hospital exhibit. As you can see, the selling end of our work makes a very heavy addition to the usual work of an Occupational Therapist, but it adds greatly to the contentment of our patients to have something to spend money on, and what they make here is frequently all the money they have.\n\nMrs. Reid is very talented in her own line, and has a very pleasing personality. She does most of her work among the young boys and girls, who need occupation and supervision outside school hours. Miss O'Brien is a good friend to every patient, as well as such a good and experienced teacher. We are all very interested in boys' work, and try to help where we can, in cooperation with the hospital staff.\n\nHope this short gives you a fair picture of the work of our teaching staff.

Conwell Esq.,\nSup't of Indian Dept.,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the 15th of April last, I sent to Mr. Lomas of this Agency, my application to Department for a grant, that would enable me to continue the several night and day schools, established by me in the different Indian Camps of the Saanich Peninsula. I stated that since fully two years I teach the Indians of S.W. and N. Saanich daily from 7 to 9 O'clock (P.M.) - that since January of this year, having also erected with your kind permission a School and church building on the East Saanich Reservation, I have kept a regular day school there as well, though this camp is fully four miles distant from my residence. The attendance at both schools is most satisfactory, and only\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6424, file 870-1, part 1)\nthe want of much needed assistance stands in the way of its being very largely increased. As buildings, schools supplies and in fact every item of expense has been borne solely by one, and as my own personal gratuitous attendance to this work is becoming unequal to the requirements, I beg that you will again kindly urge upon the Department both the necessity and justice of our claim in this instance to at least some immediate financial help for the maintenance of these schools as they now are. You will permit me in this connection to call your attention to the excellent opportunity for the establishment in this vicinity of a most successful industrial or boarding School. You are aware of the splendid disposition of my Indians hereabout, and of their dislike to send their children to distant...\nVistaunt schools. Now our church owns a 100 acres of the best land in Samish, joining on Reservation, and distant but a few miles from four Indian camps; of this land some twenty acres or thereabouts are cleared; I am certain that His Lordship Bishop Lemmens would willingly place this land, or such part thereof as might be needed, to the disposition of the Department for Industrial or Boarding School purposes. May I beg of you that forwarding anew my application for immediate assistance to any day school, you will bring this matter also to the attention of the Department at Ottawa, and that you will supplement my application with such arguments as your own knowledge of the situation here will suggest.\n\nI feel confident that your personal\npersonal views on this subject,\nbased upon such knowledge,\ncannot but be favorable to the\nrealization of this proposition.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nA.J.

I did not know if I could compete or not, my school being an Indian school. At the last moment I concluded to do so. I had to compete against all the White schools in Saanich district; there being no names thrown on any of the writing I placed one copy book by the other writing to show what the Indian school could do. The First Prize was awarded to Michael Kelag, No. 5 on the School Register. The boy winning the prize is only 11 years old. The Indians are very much pleased about it, and I think it will help the school, for they are all going in to see who will be the best at the next examination.\n\nPlease do what you think best about this Report.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam Thompson, Teacher Saanich Indian Day School, B.C.\nOttawa, 29th October, 1900.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th inst., inclosing a letter from the Teacher of the Saanich Indian School reporting that at the Saanich Agricultural Fair held lately pupil No. 5 of that School took the first class prize for writing in competition with the pupils of all the white schools in the District.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is much gratified to learn of the success of the Saanich School and the pupil referred to in particular and would like you to convey an expression of its satisfaction to this pupil and the Teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Vullingsh, Roman Catholic missionary at Saanich in regard to the non-opening of the Saanich Indian day school during the quarter ended the 30th of Sept. last, one of the reasons, and the chief one, for this being the usual absence of the Indian parents with their children at the various places of employment outside the district, as explained by the Rev. A. J. Vullingsh, the other being the resignation of the teacher, Mr. Wm. Thompson, some time ago to take a more lucrative position elsewhere. As every effort is being made to secure the services of a teacher for the school it cannot be seen that anything more can be done by the R. J. church authorities than the endeavors being made in the premises.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.

I have the honor to enclose herewith a copy, in duplicate, of a letter, from Rev. A. J.

I consider the reasons given quite satisfactory and submit the same for the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent\nVictoria, B. C.\nF. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\u2014\n\nI beg leave to inform you, that the Indian Day School at East Saanich, on Tsawout Reserve has not been opened during the quarter ending the 30th ult. No doubt you are aware, that the teacher of said school: Mr. Thompson resigned June 30th, end of previous quarter to take a better position elsewhere in the Province. Taken in consideration the summer holidays and the absence of the Indians who especially of that locality are usually slow in returning home from San Juan fisheries and other places;\u2014the vacant situation being also, as you will easily understand, difficult to supply (at once and for that particular place;) awaiting for some time the arrival of a new Bishop, for whom I had wished to reserve the teacher's appointment and the changes, in connection with a new mission at Sidney etc., to be brought about in Saan. Dist. = these and other reasons induced me to postpone.\n\nHoping however, soon to be able to open this School again, (there being no immediate necessity) I remain Sir,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n(Signed) A. J. Vullingha\n\nSaanich, B. C. Oct. Ist, 1908.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 30th ultimo, addressed to the Hon. Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, enclosing a petition from William Thompson, the teacher of the Indian Day School at Saanich, asking for a pension or gratuity; I would say that no provision is made for retiring teachers of Indian day schools on a pension or allowance. According to the information on file in the Department Mr. Thompson's wife is competent to carry on the school, and there would be no intention of making a change so long as the school is conducted efficiently.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\n\nRalph Smith, Esq., M.P.,\nNanaimo,\nB.C.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, November 9, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nWith reference to the petition of Mr. William Thompson, teacher of the Saanich Indian day school, B.C., applying for a pension or gratuity on account of failing health and length of service, which was forwarded to the Department through Mr. Ralph Smith, M.P., I beg to say that the Department has no provision for the superannuation of teachers and I only know of two cases where a retiring allowance was made.\n\nMiss Carrie Morley, who taught the Spanish River school for over twelve years and was obliged to resign on account of ill-health and old age, was allowed six months' salary; and Miss Annie O'Connor, who taught the Maniwaki school for twelve years and resigned on account of ill-health, was given a gratuity of $50.00.\n\nUpon referring to Mr. Inspector Green's reports on the Saanich school I find that the Indians complained very much of the school and that the Inspector pointed out to Mr. Thompson the need of improvement in conducting it. Mr. Thompson was married in the early part of the year 1906 and he told the Inspector that his wife would move with him to the reserve and assist him in the school. In his next report the Inspector states that the school had made a new start since Mrs. Thompson commenced to help\nhelp and that she was an excellent assistant and taught\nthe girls who attended regularly sewing and knitting\nand there was marked improvement since his former in-\nspection.\n\nFrom the Inspector's reports it would appear\nthat Mrs. Thompson is quite competent to carry on the\nschool independently of her husband, and, as long as\nshe does so, there would be no need of a gratuity or\npension for him.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6424, file 870-1, part 1)\nOttawa, October 31, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th inst., enclosing a communication from Mr. Agent Robertson, covering a copy of a letter addressed to him by Rev. Father Vullingsh, in which he states the reasons why the Sannich day school was not open during the September quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that these explanations are satisfactory and the Department trusts that the services of a suitable teacher will soon be secured for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.W.

In the latter communication reference was also made to an orphan girl, who it was considered should be placed in a Boarding or Industrial school. No reply has been received to either of these communications and I have to ask you to let the Department have the information called for at once.\n\nI may say that a lack of promptitude in dealing with the school correspondence of your Agency has been noted of late and this has led to considerable inconvenience in the work of the office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6424, file 870-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 27, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of June 7th, last, to which no reply was received, in which you were asked to report whether there was any improvement in the attendance at the Saanich school.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of an inspection report from Mr. Green in which he recommends that some improvements be made to the school building, but the Department is not disposed to undertake any expense unless assured that there will be a decided improvement. I would ask you, therefore, to take this matter up with the Indians and the teacher and inform them that unless a decided improvement in the attendance is effected the school will be closed on June 30th, next.\n\nMr. Green reports that there is an orphan girl who would attend school if she had proper clothing. The Department considers that this girl should be placed in a boarding or industrial school and I would ask you to make a special report upon her case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\nI then called upon the teacher, Daniel Dick, and asked him what was the cause of the school being closed. He replied he could not get the children to attend. I caused him to open the school, light a fire and ring the bell, 11.10 a.m. Four pupils were in attendance. I made round of reservation, but as the other children were away from home, some at Sidney delivering clams to the Cannery with their parents and others out with their parents and other Indians digging clams, I was therefore unable to do anything further until their return, 3 p.m., a number having returned home, I called upon several of their parents and asked them why they did not send their children to school. Complaints seemed to be general amongst them that their children often go to the school but find it closed. I could not say very much to them as I found such to be the case upon my visit this morning. All of those that I was enabled to see, promised they would be at school tomorrow morning.\n\nRev. Father Schelling called at the school, 3.20 p.m.. I explained to him in the presence of the teacher, Daniel Dick, the condition I found matters standing upon my visit at the school upon my arrival, and on the reservation in general, regarding the non-attendance of the pupils. I also called upon Indian Loui Pelky, whom complaints had been made to me that he was instrumental in preventing the children from attending school, which he positively denied. Strange to say, out of the four that were present in the school today, three of them were his children namely Macheil, Alfred and Ignations Pelky.'\nOttawa, June 7, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nSometime ago Mr. Inspector Green reported on the Saanich Indian day school. This report showed the attendance to be very poor. It was also noted that an effort had been made by yourself and Mr. Green to have the Indians take a greater interest in the education of their children. It was the intention of the Department to write you at the same time that you were communicated with in connection with the Songhees day school, but the matter was inadvertently overlooked.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to state whether any improvement can as yet be reported. If not the Department will have to take into consideration the closing of this school, as the very small attendance would not warrant keeping it in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Although Mr. Chisholm took a great interest in the work, he secured an average for the quarter of only 2.78. The reason for so small an average is as stated on his report that owing to the Indians leaving the reserve with their children gathering sea-weeds for the market, digging clams, picking strawberries and fishing. Then there are six children from this reserve enrolled at the Kuper Island industrial school which also helps to reduce the average.

R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncans Station, B.C.\nOttawa, January 15, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Mr. Inspector Green's report on the Saanich Day School. It would appear necessary either to close this school or give it a trial under a new teacher. Mr. Green recommends the appointment of a lady teacher and the Department is disposed to favourably consider this recommendation. I would ask you to take this matter up with the Missionary in charge and report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncans Station, B.C.\nExtract from Report of Inspector A.M. Green on the Saanich Indian Day School, December 28, 1911. Original on file\n\nTEACHER.\n\nHe appears to be a nice young man, but has lost interest in his work, and the Indians have lost confidence in him, and say they will not send their children to the school because they do not learn.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nI believe a lady teacher who would take an interest in the children and parents, and look after the girls, would be the best for this school.\n\nIt is useless for Daniel Pick to remain as teacher. I respectfully recommend that the school be closed or a better teacher secured. The Indians told me plainly that they will not send their children as long as he is the teacher.\n\n(Sgd.) A.R. Green\nInspector\nOttawa, October 6, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letters of the 27th ultimo I beg to say that, in view of the circumstances, the Department does not consider that the orphan girl on the Saanich Reserve should be taken away from her grandfather and grandmother. There would not appear, however, to be any reason why she should not attend the day school and if the grandparents are not in a position to provide her with clothing you are authorized to spend a small sum for this purpose and the Department will then expect her to attend the day school.\n\nYour remarks with reference to the advisability of making any improvements to the building in the meantime are noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C\nSir:\n\nHaving further reference to yours of the 27th, of last February No. 74621/I in regard to attendance at Saanich (Tsawout) day school. I have the honor to state that on the 28th, of last March, I wrote to Rev. Father Scheelen the Priest in charge of the mission, advising him of the contents of your letter. And since receipt of your letter the 7th, June 1910 I have made special efforts with the parents for a better attendance, and generally when they are at home there has been an improvement. But as many of this Band depend upon fishing for a living, they are a great deal of the time away digging clams, picking sea weeds, etc. It will be seen by the last two quarter's report there has been an improvement in the attendance, and I trust that it will continue.\n\nRev. Father Scheelen nor the Teacher in charge are disposed to ask for any improvement to the building at present.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCowichan Agency\nIndian Office\nDuncans Station, B.C., Sept. 27, 1911\n\nSir:\n\nHaving reference to the last clause of your letter of the 27th, of last February No. 74621/I. In regard to an orphan girl on the Tsawout (Saanich) reserve. I have the honor to state that this girl is about 15 years of age and has to look after her grandmother and grandfather, as neither of them are very strong and she could not be spared from home without being a hardship on the old people. Then there is not a vacancy in the industrial school at Kuper Island, and I have instructions to admit no more there until the number is reduced to what the grant is allowed for, and the deficit of the school is reduced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. Mclean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, September 20, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of June 6th, last, and two previous communications in regard to an orphan girl on the Saanich Reserve who would attend school if she had proper clothing. You were informed that the Department considered that this girl should be put in a boarding or industrial school. An immediate reply in regard to this matter must be insisted upon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R.

I cannot make\nit in duplicate, as this is the only form I\nhave left.\n\nYou will notice there has been no attendance\nalthough it is not my fault, the children\nwere all away. I have been round the reservation\ntimes again, but failed to find any one at\nhome. They are just commencing to drift back.\n\nI may say that it is very unsatisfactory\nfor me having to go round the reservation\nmyself, to bring what few children there\nwere to school last quarter. So I think that\nunder the circumstance I will tender my\nresignation.\n\nYours respectfully,\nEdith Christie\n\n422653\nOttawa, October 31, 1912.\n\nEXD.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant enclosing the resignation of Mr. Colin A. Chisholm, teacher of the Saanich Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this resignation is accepted and, in view of the very low average attendance and lack of interest taken by the Indians in this school, it has been decided that it should remain closed for a time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncans Station, B.C.\nDecember 17, 1941.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT there are twenty-three (23) Roman Catholic Indian children of school age on the Saanich Reserve, Cowichan Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, for whom at present no educational facilities are provided;\n\nTHAT funds are available in Vote 165, 1941-42, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for the establishment of a day school on the Saanich Reserve.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that a day school be established on the Saanich Reserve, Cowichan Agency, Province of British Columbia, in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 98, 1927, to be known as \"The Saanich Roman Catholic Indian Day School\".\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith an educational survey of the Saanich Reserves, Cowichan Indian Agency, recently completed by Inspector G.H. Barry.\n\nThis report shows that there are sufficient children of school age living on the East Saanich Reserve, at present not attending any school, to give a fair average attendance should a new school be established on that Reserve.\n\nWhile in the Cowichan Agency recently, I visited the East Saanich Reserve and looked over the church building which has been suggested as suitable for use as a class room until such time as a day school can be provided by the Department. This building is quite suitable for our requirements, being sufficiently large, well-lighted, and adequately heated by a good wood-burning furnace. The rental suggested is $10 per month which, in view of the accommodation provided, is considered quite fair. There is a well with excellent water close to the church and is operated by a hand pump. This well was put in last year by the Engineering and Construction Service of the Department.\n\nUntil better arrangements can be made, the Department would be well-advised to favorably consider the establishment of a day school on the East Saanich Reserve as suggested in this report and if funds can be\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nfound to meet the cost of desks, furnishings, rent and the fuel required, I would recommend that these be obtained and the school made ready for the admission of pupils early in January. Provision would, of course, also have for the teacher's salary.\n\nIt will be observed that of the twenty-three children available to attend, six are non-Catholics. In view of this, an arrangement similar to that existing at Koksilah might be made for religious instruction for these children.\n\nAs the suggested arrangement is to be of a temporary character, a formal surrender of the land by the Band is not considered necessary at this time. The Band might, however, by resolution agree to the use of the land by the church for mission and educational purposes at the pleasure of the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMalaspina Hotel,\nNanaimo, B.C.\nOctober 28th 1941.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith an educational survey of the Saanich Indian Reserves, the field work of which was completed when I was in Saanich a few days ago.\n\nMay I refer you to a letter of August 28th last from Rev. J.J. Tyre S.S.M. and your letter 15/2/3820 of August 28th addressed to Mr. Indian Agent Moore with reference to the possible establishment of an Indian day school on the East Saanich Indian Reserve.\n\nThe attached survey was made while I was engaged on ordinary inspection duties and it did not put the Department to extra expense of any importance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald A.

The main room is some 40 feet by 20 feet and the lighting is very good for such a hall.\n\nSome playground space would be necessary, and that now being offered to the Roman Catholic Church by one of the Indians if properly cleared would be I think satisfactory. There is a pump at the new building.\n\nThe new building is heated by hot air from a small heater in the basement.\n\nThere is some doubt with regard to just how the part of the Indian Reserve on which the new building stands was handed over to the Roman Catholic Church many years ago, for the new building is on the actual site of the former Roman Catholic Church here.\n\nBefore a temporary Indian day school is authorized at Saanichton I believe it would be well to obtain from the East Saanich Band a surrender of the site of the hall and playground in favour of the Roman Catholic Church as represented by His Excellency the Bishop of Victoria.\n\nAt least two dozen single school desks would be needed for the proposed school, as well as some blackboards and a teacher's desk and chair. The necessary furniture of such a school as I have in mind would not cost more than $200.00 Some fuel would be required for heating the building and of course the salary of a teacher would have to be provided.\n\nI am very anxious that some education be provided for as many of the Saanich Indians as possible and considering the need for economy I would recommend that favourable consideration be given to the establishment of an Indian day school on the East Saanich Indian reserve in the building suggested by Rev. Joseph Cyre S.J.\n\nThough it is not mentioned I may say that a suitable rental for the building while occupied as a school would be $10.00 a month.\n\nI would further recommend that if a school be established as suggested the academic year be one of eight months only, from October 1st to May 31st yearly.\n\nNanaimo B.C.\nOctober 26th 1941.\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDecember 17, 1941.\n\nPRECIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL\n\nEstablishment of the Saanich Roman Catholic Indian Day School, Saanich Reserve, Cowichan Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia.\nOttawa,\nDecember 19, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Establishment of a day school for Roman Catholic Indian children on the Saanich Reserve, Cowichan Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia.\n\nIn a letter dated November 28 Indian Commissioner MacKay encloses an exhaustive report made by Inspector Barry regarding lack of educational facilities on the Saanich Reserve.\n\nThere is no school on the Saanich Reserve at the present time and it is evident from the report that there are at least twenty-three (23) children of school age who are not receiving any education. Both Commissioner MacKay and Inspector Barry recommend the immediate establishment of a school on this reserve.\n\nIt will not be necessary to erect a school as a suitable building for classroom purposes can be secured for a rental of $10.00 a month.

I wrote as suggested to Mr. R. H. Moore and have his reply now in hand.\n\nIn regard to a teacher I propose Miss Eleanor Crossland now residing at 1009 Penterlew Place, Victoria, B. C. She has a 2nd class permanent certificate for Manitoba and Saskatchewan and 30 years experience including some time at Kakawis on the West Coast where she gave good satisfaction. She is rather old being 65 but enjoys good health and having once trained for the sisterhood has a good back-ground. She is working now and would therefore like to have a definite answer at the earliest possible date so that if not accepted she may retain the position she has.

Before new day schools can be established it is necessary to secure an Order-in-Council and this has caused some delay. However, P.C. 10018 of December 23, 1941, authorizes the establishment of this day school.\n\nIt is noted that you can secure a suitable building at a rental of $10.00 a month.\n\nYou may also purchase the desks and other equipment that you consider necessary but every possible economy should be effected.\n\nI presume that you will be able to secure a qualified teacher and salary will be allowed at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month plus cost-of-living bonus. I enclose the necessary forms which the teacher should complete and return to this office. When sending these you should advise me the exact date on which this school opens. We will arrange to have scribblers, exercise books, etc., ordered from the Government Stationery Office immediately. These will be shipped to Indian Agent Moore.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M.

Hoey,\nStupt.of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nAt a meeting of this Board on the 2nd inst., our Committee on Indian Affairs reported that arrangements had been completed for the use of the Catholic Chapel on the East Saanich Reserve as a day school for the children of that reserve.\n\nThis report was both welcome and encouraging, and we feel that adequate facilities are now provided for the education of the children on both the East and West Saanich Reserves.\n\nHowever we were advised that no provision has as yet been made for the children of the Cole Bay reserve on the Saanich Peninsula, and would like to suggest that, until a school is provided on the Cole Bay Reserve, whenever the number of children there warrant it, transportation be provided these children to either the East or West Saanich School, either of which we understand has facilities for these extra pupils.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nW.H. McNally,\nSecretary,\nSaanich Board of Trade.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 12, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant suggesting that Indian children on the Cole Bay Reserve be provided with transportation in order that they can attend the new day school being opened on the Saanich Reserve.\n\nI am communicating with Indian Commissioner MacKay with regard to this matter and on receipt of his reply you will be further advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Referring particularly to the last paragraph of this letter I would appreciate your advising the approximate distance that it will be necessary to transport the children now living on the Cole Bay Reserve in order to enable them to attend the school on the Saanich Reserve. At the same time you should let me know the approximate monthly cost of this service. I doubt if there will be any funds available but would like to have the information at the earliest possible date in order that I can again communicate with the Saanich Board of Trade.\n\nIn reviewing the report attached to your letter of November 28 I am under the impression that there is no building that could be used for school purposes at Cole Bay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nFebruary 15, 1942\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer you to my letter 13/3/338 of November 26th 1941, with which I forwarded a copy of Inspector Barry's Educational Survey on the Saanich Reserve.\n\nThe attached copies of a letter from the Saanich Board of Trade of the 5th instant addressed to the Department and of Departmental letter 152-15-1 of the 18th instant are forwarded for your information, as the question of the education of Indian children living on the Cole Bay Reserve is now being considered by the Department.\n\nThis matter has, of course been discussed briefly with Inspector Barry who is, of the opinion, that a solution of the problem arising at Cole Bay cannot be found in the transportation of Indian children on that Reserve to either the Tsartlip Indian Day School or the lately established Saanich Indian Day School, partly due to the distance from Cole Bay to the above established school and partly due to the fact, that there would not be accommodation available for the Cole Bay children at either the Saanich or Tsartlip Indian Day Schools.\n\nInspector Barry considers that the best method of dealing with the question under review is the establishment, for the time being, of an Indian Day School on the Cole Bay Reserve for the children of that Reserve and, possibly, for some, at least, of those living near Patricia Bay, if the distance between the latter point and the proposed Cole Bay School were not too great.\n\nIt is essential that I have before me, at the earliest possible date, a very full report from you dealing with the whole of the matters referred to in attached letters from the Saanich Board of Trade and the Department, and I should also be glad to have your views on Inspector Barry's suggestion that a temporary school be established on the Cole Bay Reserve. In particular I should like to be informed as to the possibility...\nof renting a suitable building for school purposes on the Cole Bay Reserve or at some nearby point where possibly both these children living on the Patricia Bay and Cole Bay Reserves could conveniently attend.\n\nAlthough I may say that I am not at all in favor of the establishment of transportation service for the Cole Bay and Patricia Bay children to existing Indian Day Schools, I should be glad also to have your views on this point and to know what the approximate cost of such transportation would be, if the Department decided that the provision of school bus service was the best method of dealing with the situation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you know I have striven consistently to avoid making any financial requests to the Indian Department since the world war broke out for we all realize the grave necessity of practising the utmost economy all along the line. However I feel confident that it is still the aim and purpose of the Government to keep the educational services functioning at least at a minimum. This is why I felt considerable relief when finally the new chapel at the West Saanich Reserve was taken over to be used for school purposes on behalf of Indian children who were in crying need of attention.\n\nBut there are still a score of children of school age in or near the Cole Bay Reserve who have positively no attention and naturally what has been done at long last for the West Saanich Reserve only serves inevitably to emphasize the more the dereliction of their conditions making the parents of these latter resentful and providing a subject of perpetual criticism of the Department by the many whites who take what after all must be construed as a well meant interest in the fate of their Indian neighbors. I appreciate the predicament of the Department and no matter what be the decision, will do all in my power to explain the inequalities of treatment that war may sometimes necessitate but, it will do no harm to express an opinion as to what might prove a solution to the problems of this area so long the cinderella of the Island.\n\nThe East Saanich School is small and in poor repair, the West Saanich School while new is as we know in the nature of things only a temporary arrangement though a good one under existing circumstances, so I feel that the eventual solution of the problems for the area as a whole would be a new consolidated school to which the children from East and West Saanich, as well as Cole Bay and Patricia Bay could be brought. If the sisters could be persuaded to take it over, the results would be first class.\nObviously there can be no question of a consolidated school now and from what I can gather there is no room for the Cole Bay children in either the East or West Saanich schools, so I believe the best alternative would be to rent some temporary structure at Cole Bay and use it as a school until the war situation has cleared up. Personally I am not very conversant with the cost of transportation in such cases but with the present gas and tire situation I fear it would not be economical nor, perhaps, after a time even possible.\n\nI wish the department to understand that I wholeheartedly appreciate the difficulties they have to contend with but hope that somehow, at least, a temporary solution may be somehow available.\n\nWith every good wish,\n\nYours in Christ,\n\n\"John C. Cody\"\nBishop of Victoria.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th instant, file number above noted, with reference to educational matters on the Saanich I.R.'s, I wish to advise that from your letter it would appear that I am just supposed to reply to the matters referred to in the letters attached to yours, with the added information or rather my views on the suggestion that a school be established on the Saanich I.R. #5, on a temporary basis.\n\n(1). I am definitely against the establishment of a school at Cole Bay, either on or off the I.R., for various reasons any one of which I think is sufficient at the present time. (a) Only 20 children of school age on this reserve, 8 of which are already at Kuper Island School and would probably have to remain there anyway as it is doubtful if home conditions would be satisfactory for them to attend a day school. 2 of the 12 remaining are sickly with T.B. and would have been in the Coqualeetza Hospital now if the parents would consent. This leaves a total of 10 children available for day school and it is reasonable to expect that the average attendance would not be more than 6. (b) There is no suitable building on the Reserve and certainly none available off the Reserve as every where else is occupied with war workers at the Patricia Bay Air Station as well as wives and families of the airmen stationed there. Then again, the authorities have already closed the Sidney High School on account of its location and contiguousness to the Airport and it would certainly not be permitted for us to open a school near the Cole Bay Reserve that could be used by the children of No 4 I.R. (if there happened to be any\u2014which there are not at the moment although there will be one boy next year). (c) Indians living on Cole Bay Reserve are the worst drifters of any in the Agency, they generally leave the Reserve very early in the Spring and don't come back until Christmas, so that actually there is just a period of about 4 or 5 months in the year that we may expect a 75% attendance of school children at any school except the Residential School which opens before the parents go Hop picking.\n\n(2). The exact distance between the Cole Bay I.R. and the Tsartlip School is 4 miles and while the approximate cost of transportation would be sixty or sixty five dollars per month, I am not entirely satisfied that this would be the solution, although I believe that it would be the best unless having the children attend Residential School. There will be ample room for all the children at Cole Bay to attend Tsartlip School, if they could get there, but unless proper transportation facilities are provided, where the children are protected by insurance I will not recommend any haphazard method such as used in this Agency at Nanaimo prior to this year.\n\n(3). Personally, I feel that where the parents of the children are unable to support them properly, and provide food and clothing for them regularly and all the time during the winter months, we ought as well have those children sent to the Residential school where they will be properly cared for and nourished. It may cost a little more but in the long run will be cheaper. When we take into consideration the number of children attending day schools now in the Agency whose parents are unable to support them properly, and another, and the shoes and clothing that they require when they may attend school, I believe...\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested, I have read the letter of February 23rd last addressed to you by His Excellency, the Bishop of Victoria, and also Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of February 26th, dealing with the future education of Indian children at Cole Bay, Saanich Indian Reserve No. 3, Cowichan Agency.\n\nIt is noted that there is no suitable building at or near Cole Bay which might be rented for use as a school and, further that owing to the proximity of the R.C.Air Force base at Patricia Bay, it would be contrary to Canada's Defense policy to operate a school in the near vicinity of this Air Port, Sidney Provincial High School located at an even greater distance, having already been closed for the reason given above.\n\nFrom Mr. Indian Agent Moore's report it would appear that there are only ten healthy children of school age at Cole Bay, for whom a school education should be provided though, possibly, some, at least, of the eight children on this Reserve now at Kuper Island School might attend a day school were one to be provided within reasonable distance of their homes.\n\nMr. Moore is evidently of the opinion that, the ten children mentioned above could be easily accommodated at the Tsartlip Indian Day School, West Saanich, if transportation were provided, the Tsartlip school being located about 4 miles from Cole Bay. Mr. Moore further estimates that the approximate cost of this transportation at between $50.00 and $65.00 per month.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O.

Box 70-\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nMajor D.M. MacKay\n\nMarch 4, 1942.\n\nDuring the present emergency, there is no certainty that gas and tires would be available for the motor vehicle used in the transportation of the Cole Bay children to Tsartlip School, and in any case I am not prepared to recommend the establishment of any school bus service in Saanich at the present time, apart from the fact that I am not at all convinced that there would be accommodation at Tsartlip for these children.\n\nA short time ago I recommended that Indian boys and girls attending Residential Schools on or near the coast might, under certain circumstances, be discharged on reaching their fourteenth birthday, in order that such children might engage in the fishing industry. Should the Department approve of my suggestion, it is quite possible that several boys and girls would, in the near future, be discharged from the Kuper Island Residential School. The vacancies caused by such discharges as I have referred to above, might well be filled by some, at least, of the Cole Bay children now in need of education.\n\nFor the reasons given above I am not prepared to recommend provision of day school facilities for the small number of children at present available on the Saanich Indian Reserve No. 3.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

Very careful consideration has been given to your letter but I regret that at the present time favourable consideration cannot be given to this application. As you are aware, Government funds are not being expended at the present time for the erection of buildings other than those required for war purposes. Besides, it is more than likely that there will be further restrictions in transport facilities.\n\nIn view of the recent letter written to you approving the discharge of pupils of 15 years of age, and even younger in some cases, to assist in the fishing industry, there will be several vacancies in the residential schools.

I only received Bishop Codgie's letter after I had written to you re Inukmeep.\n\nI prefer the school at Saanich and would be pleased to accept the position.\n\nI will try to wind the affairs up here and be ready by the end of February.\n\nAny information you could give me about living accommodation would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMary Hadel.\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVancouver,\nB.C.\n\nDear Friend:\n\nThis is to advise you that having investigated as well as possible the qualifications of Miss Mary Wadel of East Bay Gambier Island B.C. I feel that at the present time when candidates are so few in number we would be well advised to recommend her for appointment to the vacancy on the Saanich Staff.\n\nWishing you and yours every blessing for this new year I remain,\n\nYours in Christ,\n\n+ John C.

Rev. Bishop Cody nominating Miss Mary Wadel\nfor the Saanich Indian Day School together with Miss\nWadel's application for the position.\n\nIt will be recalled that Miss Wadel was\nprepared to accept the position at Inkameep but has\nsince decided that she prefers the Saanich school.\n\nI would recommend that Miss Wadel be\nappointed to the Saanich Indian Day School at the\nsalary and allowance provided for the position, her\nduties to commence February 1st.\n\nD.

To succeed her we have appointed Miss Mary Wadell at a salary of $90.00 a teaching month, effective February 1, 1945. I attach copy of letter of appointment and the other documents will be forwarded to you when received.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 21, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, in which you state that Miss Mary Wadell prefers to teach at the Saanich Indian Day School. The Department approves her appointment as teacher of that school at a salary of $50.00 a teaching month, effective from February 1, 1943. As it is several years since Miss Wadell was formerly in our employ, you should have her complete the usual forms and return same to this office.\n\nWhen the former teacher, Miss Tremblay, was appointed it was understood that the Saanich School would only be in operation for 8 months; namely, from October 1, 1942, to May 31, 1943. In this connection I would refer you to my letter of September 30, 1942. Is it your desire that this school close at the end of May or do you consider it should remain in operation until the end of June, 1943? In either case the Department will be guided by your wishes, but Miss Wadell should be definitely informed regarding the closing date of the school.\n\nR.A.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nMiss Germaine Tremblay,\n750 Princess Avenue,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\n/B\nDuncan, B. C.\nApril 20th, 1943.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the Saanich Indian Day School, I wish to advise that the closing date of this school for the summer holidays was brought to my attention by the Teacher. I told her that as far as I knew it would close at the end of May next but in view of the fact that it opened a month late after the Christmas holidays, I would recommend to you that it be kept open until the end of June, providing she (the Teacher) was reasonably sure that the attendance would warrant it during June.\n\nShe informed me that the question had already been taken up with some of the parents and the general opinion was that very few, if any, of the families with children of school age would be going to the U.S. this summer to pick berries as they could do better at home. This corresponds with the feeling among the Indians pretty well throughout the Agency. I would therefore recommend that this school be kept in operation until the end of June next.\n\nI may say for your information that this Teacher, Miss Wadel, is certainly making an improvement all round in that school. She has planted a small school vegetable garden, also some flowers along the walks, not to mention the general cleanup outside the building. However, her good work does not end there as she has got the pupils right on their toes and for once they seem to be learning something, not to mention the art of cleanliness. I would say Miss Wadel is a very satisfactory teacher.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of the 20th instant requesting authority to continue the Saanich Indian Day School in session for an additional month at the end of the present term for the reason that it was not reopened until one month after the Christmas holidays.\n\nUnder the circumstances outlined, I would recommend approval of the suggestion and would request your advice.\n\nD.M.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo enclosing letter from Indian Agent Moore with reference to the closing date of the Samish Indian Day School. As this school was closed for the month of January it should remain in operation until June 30, 1943.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour File 152-15-1\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Moore, advising that Miss Mary Wadel, whose resignation has been submitted effective June 30th, wishes to receive funds to her credit in the Retirement Fund as at that date.\n\nPlease arrange for the refund of same to Miss M. Wadel, Saanichton, B.C.\n\nD. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nJune 24, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M.

However, I presume\nthat you have received her resignation and have\naccepted it. No doubt you have already\ncommunicated with Right Reverend Bishop Cody\nwith a view to having him nominate a successor.\n\nThe amount to Miss Wadel's credit in\nthe retirement fund will be forwarded to her\nsubsequent to June 30 and I will advise the\nTreasury Office regarding her address.\n\nR.A.
