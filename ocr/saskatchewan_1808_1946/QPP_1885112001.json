It covers local news, politics, and community events. The newspaper is owned by James Wedeman.\nThe Qu'Appelle Progress\n\nPublished by JAMES WEIDMAN\n\nEvery Friday.\n\nAt the Post Office Printing Office, in the Town of Qu'Appelle, near Regina, Canada.\n\nThe Progress is a Weekly Journal of Local, Territorial, Canadian, and Foreign News, History, Literature, Politics, and Personal Items.\n\nSubscription price: $1.00 per annum, inclusive of all postage.\n\nThe rate for our advertising space by contract are as follows:\n\nOne column per week, monthly issue...$3.00\nTwo columns per week, monthly issue...$6.00\nQuarterly rate...$12.00\nThree issues...$5.00\nTwo issues...$4.00\nOne issue...$2.00\n\nBusiness cards $1 per month, payable quarterly.\n\nThis rate does not apply to notices, advertisements, letters, meetings, legal notices, or anything of a business nature.\n\nQu'Appelle Progress is printed on 10 tons per line press. The paper for each issue is delivered to the office, and is delivered to the subscriber at no additional cost.\n\nThis rate does not apply to notices, advertisements, letters, meetings, legal notices, or anything of a business nature.\n\nOur chief aim will be to advocate the best interests of the settlers in these Territories, and impress upon the Government their advantages as well as any matters which may arise from time to time. The recent visit of the newly appointed Minister of the Interior and the pains he has taken to ascertain the wants of the people, has led to the hope that the affairs of the North-West will be administered more satisfactorily than heretofore. We shall watch closely the result, and if occasion requires, we will not hesitate to criticise and condemn the course he may take, but we will meet the requirements of the pioneers who have carried the Star of Empire so far westward. We will ever contend for those principles which make up the sure foundation of British institutions; we will also be diligent and enthusiastic in allay all sectarian and religious differences, but at the same time we will strenuously oppose any religious conglomeration that may endeavor to postpone govern- ment until the will of the people is nullified. As our name indicates, we will give our hearty support to every movement that has for its object the social, moral and political Progress of the Dominion at large and the North-West in particular.\n\nOn account of the difficulties attending the issue of a new paper, this number is not as complete as The Progresses will be in future, still it indicates to a certain extent the style and purpose of the publication. In a word, The Qu'Appelle Progress will be a live newspaper for the benefit of everyone.\n\nOur advertising space indicate a generous support on the part of the leading business men of the place, though there are still a few whose announcements do not appear, but will probably come in later.\n\nIn our efforts to furnish a live local journal, we ask for and expect a liberal patronage from all classes of the community.\n\nNOTES AND COMMENTS.\n\nThe Eiff has found its rope.\n\nTake The Progresses only and often.\n\nTHE QU'APPHELLE PROGRESS FROM NOVEMBER 1887 TO JANUARY 1888.\n\nLouis Riel had met the penalty of his crimes. His trial was fairly tried, and appeal was had to the highest court in the realm, and the verdict of \"guilty\" sustained. But before the carrying out of the sentence, strong pressure was brought to bear on the Governor General, who was obliged to exercise executive clemency in favor of the rebel. As demanded for sparing his life grew in strength among his French sympathizers, so the proclamations were issued, and the demand was made that he should ever been hanged because of the demands of his French-Canadian friends. By alienation Riel had turned foreigner; he came to the Northwest to raise the standard of insurrection, to incite the Indians to rapine and murder; by his lawless acts, he was the cause of the shedding of much Canadian blood and treasure. Being convicted a traitor, yet every privilege of appeal was only what the law and justice demanded. It is to be regretted that there are so many French Canadians who so far forget their nationality that they would rather be in British territory, than serve as soldiers for the French speaking population; or that a guilty criminal of one nationality is not as amenable to our laws as one of another nationality. Such do not need to be taught that any attempt to stop the wheels of British justice will but result to their own injury. The majority of that nation are good citizens, but there are still manifestations in matters of government, when but any considerable portion of them attempt to coerce the Administration into a position of resisting to shield one of themselves, such demonstrations must be quelled at once.\n\nOUR TERMS.\n\nWe have placed our yearly subscription at the low rate of One Dollar, with the object of enforcing advance payment. We can much better afford to publish a paper at that price when we receive our money promptly than when paid for, when we took the burden of collecting accounts at a higher figure.\n\nBesides we will thus promptly secure a larger circulation, which will enable us to increase our advertising space, and also allow us to pay your name and dollar, and mail your neighbour's to subscribe, and you will obtain full value for your money.\n\nThe editor is anxious to hear from any interested reading from now till January 1st.\n\nEarthquake Shocks.\n\nThe eastern coast of the United States, Virginia to Maine, was threatened during the past week with an earthquake. The city of Alexandria, Va., had an intense excitement in the province of Quebec, and demonstrations have taken place, but it is to be hoped wise counsels will prevail, and that the excitement will calm down, without causing loss of life or property.\n\nRELIGION AND PARTY POLITICS.\n\nThe English press of the Dominion generally were agreed that Riel should suffer the full penalty of his crimes, but the Irish portion was very content he would not die. It was said that Riel was the Quebec liberal, that the Dominion Government, and that it does not concern the rebel. It was sought in particular to fasten the whole responsibility upon Sir John Macdonald and Mr. Riel. But as matters stand, however, and the most satisfactory verdict established itself, it appeared, mostly in the hearts of the people, it was an important crisis for the party, as well as the country, and must be, if possible, congratulated.\n\nHaving an Adjoining Paper as well as our own, The Qu'Appelle Progress Press, Mr. Riel has beaten her own time, and been her own gallant guide.

He once said I will only hear those compositions which are played without accompaniment, and that I do understand then I must leave the room. He once said that he thought he could work more quickly, but such was not the case. He once said he could not make himself heard in the hall, and afterward he would work there. He once said that he thought genius was a gift from God which he had received, and that he thought God had given him talent, he said, and I think that Haydn, I think I have done my duty for the world.\nDOOLITTLE'S LIVERY\nFeed and Sale Stable,\nQU'APPELLE ST.\nSingle and Double Runs for Hire.\nFreighting a Specialty\nAll Kinds of Coal\nKept Constantly on Hand at the Lowest Prices.\nCash Paid for Hides & Skins\nQU'APPELLE.\n\nL.

Everything now is terribly dull. Things are worse than they were in North Dakota or even compared with the same here. There is also more enterprise or better practice. So there is neither one nor the other across the lines is belied to the skies.\"\n\n\u2014Mr. Nicholas Floyd Davis, of the Regina Leader, will lecture this evening in the Presbyterian church, on the subject of Home Government.
