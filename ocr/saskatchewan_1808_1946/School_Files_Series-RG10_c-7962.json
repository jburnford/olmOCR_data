Hope, Teacher of the Indian Day School at Little Grand Rapids, has informed him that there were no children in attendance at the school on the first of September and that he does not expect any until the time of the next annuity payment.\nOttawa, November 14, 1922.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe September quarter return of the Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School, signed by you, has just been received. This return states that the school was open 45 days.\n\nThe Department cannot understand why school was in operation for this length of time, owing to the fact that it was only opened on July 24th, last, and a recent letter from you stated that there were no children in attendance on the 1st of September and that you did not expect any further attendance until the time of next annuity payment.\n\nThe Department would like you to report fully on this school, stating definitely for what period of time it was open during the past summer and also for how many days you consider the teacher should be paid.\n\nKindly give this matter your immediate attention in order that a cheque for the amount due can be sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. O. Latulippe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBelkirk, MAN.\nSir.\u2014Dear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, NO.125-12-3, in reply I beg to say that on Saturday last I made a special trip to East St. Peters to interview the teacher, Mr. W.J. Hope, so as to furnish you with a definite report in regard to the Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Hope stated that he had made an error in reporting to this office that this school was closed the 1st September, that he meant the latter part of September, he claims that he taught till about the 20th of September, but did not have the school register with him, and had then to return to Selkirk on account of ill health. Due to his physical condition, the Rev. Mr. Niddrie was good enough to fill in his school returns, and he considers that he is entitled to two month's salary.\n\nI also inquired of him what he meant by stating that the children of the Little Grand Rapids Band would not return until the time of next annuity payment, to this he replied that he was informed by some of the Indians that they would return with their families from their hunting about the first part of June, after the rivers clears up, he also stated that when he left there was two families and they were going away shortly.\n\nI visited this school on the 26th July and 4th of August last and taking into consideration that the children had not attended school previously, I consider that the results were quite satisfactory. I sincerely regret that there was a misunderstanding between Mr. Hope and myself in regard to my first report and hoping that this one will be satisfactory.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.\nSupt.

The members of the Band had taken out 70 logs and hauled them to a site in the centre of the Reserve, to build a school 20 X 30 ft., with addition, for teacher's residence 12 X 20 ft.\n\nThe only stipulation made was that the Department should furnish rations to the Indians who worked on the job, they furnishing the labour free. The rationing would mean approximately $100.00.\n\nThe school has been held in an old log building, built on the H.B.C. land, for which the Department furnished windows and stove in 1922. These could be used in the new building. Roofing, nails, locks and hinges would be required at a cost of $35.00. A blackboard and the usual supply of books and stationery would be required.\n\nMiss Moar has been a pupil of the Selkirk Collegiate and has taken her Grade XI, and I think would be well qualified to fill the position.\n\nKindly let me know if you will give authority for expenditure, for rations and material, asked for.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indians Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 20th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer further to your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the re-opening of the Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School.

You may also supply $55 worth of roofing and hardware. Competitive prices should be obtained, and when you are forwarding accounts in favour of the firms given the business please support them with a statement showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nA supply of books and stationery and a blackboard are being ordered from the King's Printer and will be directed to you for proper forwarding to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This is a log building, 24 x 24, with 10 ft. walls, roofed with small hewed spruce rails. A year ago they received roofing and hardware to the amount of $35.00, and also rations for the Indians working on the building, which amounted to about $60.00.\n\nI found they were still short on material to complete the building, and they asked for further assistance from the Department, of the following:\n\n- 3 Rolls Roofing.\n- 4 windows, 6 x 10, 12 light.\n- 1 door\n- 300 lbs. lime.\n\nThe approximate cost of above material would be $30.00, and I would recommend that this expenditure be granted to enable them to complete the building.\n\nKindly let me know your decision as soon as possible, to allow me to forward the material before navigation closes about the middle of October.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 29, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to finishing material required for the Little Grand Rapids Protestant Indian Day School.

This was taken up and went through in voucher No.121/25, dated 15th Feb., 1925. Last summer when at Little Grand Rapids, the building was not finished and Mr. Latulippe authorized the rationing of those working so that the school would be completed by the fall and ready for school opening.

You may arrange for the purchase of 30 single school desks and have them forwarded before navigation closes. You should place the order with The Canada Seating Co., 911 MacArthur Bldg., Winnipeg, Man., for the following desks:\n\n| Quantity | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| 6        | Single school desks for pupils 15 to 18 years |\n|          | 6 \"         | 12 \" 14 \" |\n|          | 6 \"         | 10 \" 12 \" |\n|          | 6 \"         | 7 \" 9 \"   |\n|          | 6 \"         | 5 \" 7 \"   |\n\nThe desks should be shipped knocked down, securely crated, all parts complete, and ink wells should be supplied with each of the four larger sized desks. The above firm should supply these desks at the lowest price charged this Department and should, if possible, include in the cost the freight charges to Selkirk. You should obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost and these should be certified by you in the usual manner and sent to the Department for payment. You should arrange shipment of the desks from Selkirk to Matthewson Island where, it is presumed, they can be securely stored until the teacher can make arrangements to freight them to the school. Certified accounts covering the cost of the freighting from Selkirk to Matthewson Island should also be forwarded.\n\nYou should give the matter of the purchase of these desks your early attention in order that they can go forward in due time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This account is being paid, but the Department cannot understand why it was necessary to have the supplies shipped by aeroplane.\n\nThe purchase of midday meal supplies and other articles was authorized by official letter of September 17th. You submitted an account from F. Barresford dated September 24th. You later submitted an account dated October 31st from the Hudson's Bay Company covering the cost of freighting school supplies from Berens River to Little Grand Rapids. This account included one sack of beans, and it is noted that the account from the Aeroplane Company also included this item.\n\nPlease let me know why all the supplies were not sent forward at the freight rate of $3.50 a hundred. Shipping supplies by aeroplane is very expensive, and, in this case, the charges for shipping them amounted to more than the cost of the articles. There is no necessity for incurring such heavy expenditure if you apply early in July or August for authority to purchase the supplies necessary for outlying schools.\n\nThe Department will expect to have a full explanation regarding your reasons for delaying the shipment to Little Grand Rapids School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Day School, whilst the school supplies including one sack beans shipped by plane, was for the United Church Day School at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 29, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to freighting supplies to the Little Grand Rapids School last year. Your explanation regarding the use of aeroplane transportation has been noted.\n\nAs mentioned in official letter of the 13th instant, you should apply early in July or August for authority to purchase supplies necessary for outlying schools.

McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nFL\nOttawa, January 29, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is advised that a quantity of the biscuits supplied for use at the Little Grand Rapids United Church Indian Day School have become mouldy. It would appear that these biscuits were packed in the boxes while still warm.\n\nI have to request that you will advise the Department how many boxes of these biscuits have become mouldy and state the weight, if possible. When we receive this information, regarding the quantity of damaged biscuits, the matter will be taken up with the firm who supplied them, with a view to having them replace the quantity of damaged biscuits. Please give this matter your prompt attention and furnish the information requested. You should address your reply to the Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nL. L. Schuetze, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nUnited Church Indian Day School,\nLittle Grand Rapids, Man.\nDear Sir-\n\nIn reply to Yours of the 29th January which I received yesterday on Sunday.\n\nIt is very hard to state the exact amount of Biscuits spoiled, there were about 5 boxes in all so far, but only one of them was so bad that we had to throw away about half.\n\nEach box has 25 lbs Net Weight, I would judge that about 50 lbs were spoiled altogether.\n\nOf course the balance of these boxes were not very tasty either, as the Kiddies complained about them.\n\nTrusting that this Information is satisfactory\n\nI remain Yours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6239, file 523-5, part 1)\nDear Sirs:\n\nReferring to a previous letter to you of January 29th concerning the alleged receipt in poor condition at Little Grand Rapids of a consignment of biscuits manufactured by you, word has now been received from the consignee that about five boxes were affected out of which about fifty pounds are spoiled.\n\nIt would of course not be possible to make good this damage at the present time and it is thought that the matter can be left in abeyance for the time being.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nThe Rankin Chambers Co.

Mr. Luther Schmetz, our present Missionary here; and my co-worker came to us last year from Little Grand Rapids where he was Missionary etc.; for IO or more years; he has told me of the need for a new school-building there.\n\nAs it is now too late to consider making a request for anew building I wish to ask you for the authority to spend $300 in erecting a lean-to to the present building and carrying out any repairs to the old building. As the school building is two miles by water from the Mission House, serving hot lunches necessitates cooking in the morning, transporting by canoe with us at 8 AM; rearming in class room at noon, washing and eating and cleaning up after all in the same room. With a lean-to, washing, cooking, eating, and cleaning up after could all be done by senior pupils under teacher's surveillance.\n\nOur Indian Agent will be here in June and at L:G:R: soon in July where I shall see him; however I would like very much to have the work underway as soon as I get up there in order to insure its completion by the end of August; this explains in part my reason for wishing you to take action directly.\n\nThe $300.00 would equip as well as erect the lean-to proposed.\n\nTrusting to hear from you at your convenience:\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher:\n\nR:A: Hoey Esq.,\nSupt: Of Welfare And Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa:\n\nP:S: I have been to L:G:R: at different times and have seen the conditions:\n\nP:S: This building erected last year is a wonderful place; it is just about everything a Day School should be: We demolished the old building and divided the materials among 40 families; Empire Day we had 300 people here to attend our Sports; Our prizes amounted to $60; Our average attendance since moving into this building has been well over 30.\n\nC.O.S.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, June 16, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Street:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 26th ultimo, in which you intimate that it is your intention to take charge of the Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School and Mission early in July.\n\nI note with interest your request for authority to spend approximately $300.00 in the erection of a lean-to to the present school building. I may state that the existing regulations governing the expenditure of departmental appropriations make it almost impossible to comply with a request of this kind. For example, all lumber, building supplies, etc., must be purchased by the Departmental Purchasing Agent. Certain exceptions are made in outlying districts, but these exceptions apply to cases that have been carefully reviewed and submitted to the Purchasing Agent for his approval.\n\nThere is nothing on file here to indicate the condition of the Little Grand Rapids school. It is just possible that if the school is in a dilapidated or semi-dilapidated condition, it would be very unwise to spend even the sum of $300.00 in repairing it this year. It might be better, in view of all the circumstances, to apply for the erection of a new school, on the understanding that construction would take place next year.\n\nWe have in the 1939-40 estimates a comparatively small sum for the upkeep and repair of school -\n\nColin D. Street, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nUnited Church Indian Day School,\nBerens River, Manitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6230, file 523-5, part 2)\nof school buildings in the Clandeboye agency. The total sum is so small, however, that I hesitate to even consider the expenditure of $300.00 at any particular day school.\n\nMay I suggest to you that you communicate with either the Indian Agent, Mr. McPherson, or Inspector Hamilton, asking either of them to forward to the Department a recommendation as to what should be done at Little Grand Rapids. It is my understanding that Mr. McPherson has recently visited the district. If such is the case, he ought to be in a position to make a recommendation with respect to the repairs that may be required at the Little Grand Rapids school.\n\nI am sending this letter forward by air mail, in the hope that it will reach you when Mr. McPherson is still in your district.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nUnited Church Indian Day School\nBerens River, MB\nJune 26th, 1939:\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have received your letter of the 16th for which I thank you. Treaty was paid here a week ago. Both Mr. Hamilton and Mr. McPherson visited our school. Your letter came the next day after Mr. Hamilton had departed for the north. However he told me there was a possibility that he would be at L:G:R: for Treaty next month.\n\nWe expect to leave here by plane on the fifth of next month so will be in Little Grand Rapids a week or so before Treaty is paid. I shall at that time ask either the Inspector or Agent to forward to you the necessary recommendations re the school building.\n\nConsidering the probability of a new school there for next year I shall reduce my requests as for the present building to a minimum.\n\nWe expect Treaty to be paid at L:G:R: about the middle of July.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher:\nUnited Church Indian Day School\n\nMid-day meal Requisition, etc.\n\n42 cases biscuits\n360 lb. beans\n200 lb. rice\n50 lb. split peas\n50 lb. pot barley\n200 lb. sugar\n25 lb. cocoa\n3 cases Carnation evaporated milk - 24 tins per case\n25 lb. salt\n1 pkg. large matches - 3 cartons\n1 gal. laundry soap\n1 case carbonic acid bath soap\n6 fine-toothed combs\n4 scrubbing brushes\n4 brooms\n2 10-qt. water pails\n12 yd. cloth towels\n12 yd. linen towels\n1 inside door set (present one badly broken)\n2 dozen plates\n2 cups\n2 spoons\n1 large cooking kettle\n200 lb. lime\n3 white wash brushes\n2 mirrors\n6 pkgs. chloride of lime\n50 lb. yarn - 4\u00bd lb. mixture\n\nLittle Grand Rapids, Man.\nBerend River P.O., Man.\n\nRichard Schwartze\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is expected that you will keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nE. McPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nBasements would not be required for either of these schools.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSelkirk, Man., August 1, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just returned from making the Annuity Payment at Little Grand Rapids, at which Reserve I took up the question of a new school for the United Church. The school in use now is in such poor condition that I would suggest that the Department allow Mr. Street to get permission from the Church officials to use the Church for a school during the Winter months.\n\nI have discussed with Mr. Street the possibility of making repairs to the old school, but in my opinion it would be only a waste of money to repair this old building.\n\nMr. Street suggests that a school 26' x 42' be built to accommodate the pupils, he also suggests that a dining hall 16' x 32' be built. It is my opinion, that owing to the excessive freight rates on materials shipped into this district, that he could get along nicely if a new school only, were built.\n\nThe Roman Catholic school on this Reserve is also in very poor condition. Here again, the building is old and in such condition that any repairs made would not help much and would be only a waste of money. A new building 36' x 22' should be built to replace the old building in use at the present time.\n\nIf new schools are to be built on this Reserve, the materials would have to be shipped in during the Winter season, either by tractor or by horses. I will advise the Department further as soon as I am able to find out what the freight rate would be on materials shipped either from Berens River or from Riverton.\n\n(1)\nOttawa, August 11, 1939.\n\nRe: Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the first instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIn the 1939-40 estimates provision was made for the construction of a United Church Indian day school at Little Grand Rapids, at an estimated cost of $5,000.\n\nIf, as you suggest, it is impossible to proceed with the actual construction of this school during the present fiscal year, action should be taken to purchase the materials necessary for the construction of this building. If you consider it inadvisable to provide basement accommodation, I am personally of the opinion that, in addition to the regular schoolroom, accommodation should be provided for vocational training or the serving of midday meals. It is just possible that the addition I have in mind could serve both purposes. I have learned from experience that it is almost impossible to expect a teacher to undertake vocational instruction and provide noonday meals in the regular classroom. However, this is a matter that you might discuss with Inspector Hamilton.\n\nI am particularly anxious that consideration should be given immediately to the purchase of lumber and other materials necessary for the construction of the building itself. It is highly desirable that these supplies should be purchased and paid for from this year's appropriation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nE.

Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 11th, File 125-12-5.\n\nI regret the delay in answering your letter, but I have just received the information as to the cost of hauling freight to Little Grand Rapids.\n\nI have a price from George Leyound, Matheson Island as follows:\n5\u00a2 per lb. on cement, windows, etc.\n$80.00 per thousand board feet of lumber.\n\nThe above prices are for hauling freight from Matheson Island to the site of the school at Little Grand Rapids. There would be an additional freight charge by the Selkirk Navigation Company of .25\u00a2 per 100 lbs of cement, windows, etc., and of $3.00 per thousand board feet of lumber, from Selkirk to Matheson Island.\n\nIn regard to accommodation for vocational training, etc. Due to the rocky nature of the ground, it would not be possible to put in a basement. Therefore, if this accommodation is required, an addition to the building would have to be built.\n\nAs it would be necessary to have this material shipped to Matheson Island before freeze up, I cannot over-emphasize the need for immediate action if this building is to be built this Winter or next Spring.\n\nThe shipping season closes here the first week in October.\n\nI am enclosing herewith on form 37\u00bd, the list of material required for the school building itself and also the list of material for the addition for vocational training. I have also estimated the cost of hauling this material from Selkirk direct to Little Grand Rapids. We have been unable to get even an approximate bid for carpenter work for constructing this building.\n\nTrusting that this information may be of some value to you, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 15, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nProvision has been made in the 1938-40 estimates for the construction of an Indian day school at Little Grand Rapids, Clandeboye agency, province of Manitoba, at an estimated cost of $5,000.\n\nThe Indian day school operated at Little Grand Rapids is at this date in such poor condition that permission has been granted by the church officials to use the church for school purposes during the coming winter months. I regret to state that a great deal of delay has been experienced in making provision for the construction of this school. The Indian agent was absent for a time on a treaty paying trip and has taken a full month to secure information requested in respect to lumber, freight costs, etc. The agent now estimates that the cost of building material and freight will amount to approximately $3,500 and has sent forward a requisition describing this building material in detail.\n\nIn view of the lateness of the season, I recommend, subject to the approval of the Minister, that Inspector Hamilton be authorized to call for tenders for the supply of this material and that the construction of the school be undertaken this Fall, if possible, under the direction of a capable foreman-carpenter.\n\nDirector\n\nRAH\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to Department letter 125-12-5, dated September 7th, 1939, I wish to report that I took this matter up with Mr. McPherson and a letter went forward direct from his office dated September 12th.\n\nI would draw your attention to the expensive freight rate, especially from Matheson Island -- $5.00 per cwt. on cement and $60.00 a thousand on lumber. This makes the cement cost approximately $6.45 per cwt. and lumber approximately $115.00 per thousand, F.O.B. destination. I am sure these prices make building, especially in these times, prohibitive. I have seen many a good log school throughout our white districts and if logs are available they should meet the need at this point. These people are trappers and hunters, consequently the attendance will be very irregular, as the women and children usually accompany the father to the trap lines. I would be glad to know what action the Department takes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, September 20, 1939.\n\nRe: Little Grand Rapids School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, in which you intimate that consideration should be given to the desirability of constructing the Indian day school at Little Grand Rapids with logs that might be secured in the immediate district.\n\nI am of the opinion that not only the Little Grand Rapids school but a number of schools in the outlying districts of the Dominion should be of log construction. No doubt, you are aware that the provincial government of Manitoba have built a number of such schools in recent years. I regret to state, however, that it will not be possible to cancel the orders that are no doubt already placed for the purchase of lumber for the school at Little Grand Rapids. The records here indicate that immediately following the receipt of Mr. McPherson's letter of September 12 the Purchasing Agent was asked to proceed with the purchase of the lumber outlined in the requisitions attached to Mr. McPherson's communication. It was my understanding that tenders were called for by air mail and arrangements made for the immediate delivery of these supplies. The Department was particularly anxious -\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nanxious that these supplies should be purchased and delivered at Little Grand Rapids by winter freight. I should add that our letter to which Mr. McPherson referred on September 12 was dated August 11, 1939, so that it took the Agent over a month to send forward the information necessary before the Purchasing Agent could call for tenders.\n\nIt is my hope that the time at your disposal will enable you to give a certain amount of thought to the desirability of constructing Indian day schools with logs in the other districts from which we have already received requests for new schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSupplies mentioned hereunder have been received and found satisfactory with exception of those listed under \"Remarks.\"\n\n| Quantity | DESCRIPTION                  | UNIT | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------------------------|------|-------|\n| 3 rolls  | Tar Paper                    |      |       |\n| 66 lin.ft.| 1 x 10                       |      |       |\n| 66 \"     | Water Table                  |      |       |\n| 480 ft.  | 1 x 6 Siding                 |      |       |\n| 620 ft.  | Shiplap for roof             |      |       |\n| 7 rolls  | Roofing, 3 ply               |      |       |\n| 2 \"      | Hercules                     |      |       |\n| 4 only   | Windows frames               |      |       |\n| 4 \"      | Door 2'6\" x 6'0\" x 1-3/8\" 5X Panel | |       |\n| 1 \"      | Door Frame                   |      |       |\n| 3 rolls  | Hercules                     |      |       |\n| 1250 ft. | Shiplap, inside              |      |       |\n| 1000 \"   | Ten Test                     |      |       |\n| 90 lin.ft.| 1 x 6, base                 |      |       |\n| 90 \"     | Quarter round                |      |       |\n| 2 sacks  | Plaster Filler               |      |       |\n| 90 lin.ft.| 1 x 5 Casing                |      |       |\n| 14 \"     | Window Stool                 |      |       |\n| 60 \"     | Window Stop                  |      |       |\n| 30 lbs.  | 3/4\" Nails                   |      |       |\n| 1 kg     | Finishing Nails              |      |       |\n| 10 lbs.  | Lock Set                     |      |       |\n| 1 only   | 3/4\" Butts                   |      |       |\n| 3 lbs.   | Roofing Nails                |      |       |\n| 20 lbs.  | 1/2\" Box Nails               |      |       |\n\nLot Price ............... $1,274.00\n\nConfirming order by wire of 23rd September 1939.\n\nMarked for - \"Little Grand Rapids N.C.

As these papers had to be filled in by Mr. Street, Missionary at Little Grand Rapids, there has been some delay in getting this account straightened out.\n\nI trust you will find this account to be now in order.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE.

It is noted that the tractor was only rented for 3\u00bd hours and it is difficult to understand why it was necessary to employ so many men to load the tractor. Are all the persons mentioned on the account employees of the Patricia Transportation Company? If not, receipts from each of them should be attached to the voucher.\n\nWhy is board charged for salaried employees? In view of the short length of time any one of them worked there is no apparent reason for having to feed them. Very detailed information will be necessary before payment of this account can be considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 14, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from L/Cpl. C. Calcrat of the R.C.M.P. in which he states that he visited the Berens River Reserve on January 22. With reference to the Little Grand Rapids U.C. School he writes as follows:\n\n\"Thirty children were present at this school although the register recorded fifty-two at times. Twenty-two or three of the children present are Indians, the balance are whites attending from around the settlement. I was also informed that there is some discussion regarding the location of the new school. The band, chief and Councillors desire the school be built on the reserve at the old location. The Missionaries I understand wish it be built by the Mission which is entirely off the reserve and two or three miles from the present school.\"\n\nIs the Department to infer from the above report that the maximum number of Indian children who will attend this school will be 22 or 23? As you realize we have no responsibility for the education of the white children and in view of reduced appropriation it is impossible to consider providing school accommodation for other than Indian children. A full report on this phase of the school activities at Little Grand Rapids is required.\n\nIn connection with the latter part of the officer's report I may say that when the new school is erected the Department must insist on its being built on the Reserve. We are not permitted to erect Indian\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nday schools off a Reserve. Please let me have your recommendation regarding the location of the new school.\n\nThe Department understands from the information contained in your letter of August 1, 1939, that no action has been taken toward the erection of this school. The materials were purchased and paid as requested by your voucher No. 1081/39 of November 21. In view of present conditions and the dissolution of the House I am not in a position at the present time to state what funds, if any, will be available during the fiscal year 1940-41 for the erection of this building. Consequently it is necessary for you to make immediate arrangements to carefully store the material that has been supplied in order that it may be kept intact until it can be used. Please let me know immediately what action you have taken in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBERENS RIVER\n\nIn the P.M. (22nd inst.) I proceeded to the U.C. Indian Dept. school where an inspection was made and the teacher Mr. C.D. Street interviewed. The school was found in a fairly clean condition. Mr. Street also informed me the Dept. was furnishing lumber for a new school this season. No complaints were received but Mr. Street informed me some Indians had been making brew and were drunk around the New Year. Thirty children were present at this school although the register recorded fifty-two at times. Twenty-two or three of the children present are Indians, the balance are whites attending from around the settlement. I was also informed that there is some discussion regarding the location of the new school. The band, chief and Councillors desire the school be built on the reserve at the old location. The Missionaries I understand wish it be built by the Mission which is entirely off the reserve and two or three miles from the present school.\n\nC. Calgraf, L/Cpl.\nSelkirk, Man., February 9, 1940.\n\nRe: U.C. Indian Day School to be Built at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI wish to be advised by the Department if it would be satisfactory to have the new school built on the Church property, as this is the best location for it. I looked the ground over last Summer while paying Treaty and I feel satisfied that the site on the Church property would be by far the best. Would we have to get permission from the Church to have the school built on this property and would this arrangement be satisfactory?\n\nOne of my reasons for wishing this, is that the teacher's residence is located on the Church ground, and, as the lumber will have to be stored until Spring, it would be more satisfactory to store it where there would be someone to look after it. There is a warehouse on this property where the lumber and cement could be stored until the school is built.\n\nAs the Patricia Transportation Company will be starting to haul this material shortly, I wish you would please advise what arrangements you wish me to make.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the proposed site of the Little Grand Rapids R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to the fourth paragraph of my letter of the 14th instant in which it was pointed out that the Department considered that this school should be erected on the Reserve. We made this decision in order that the school would be located at the closest point to the persons it is intended to serve.\n\nFrom L/Cpl. Calcraf's report it appears that the Mission property is two or three miles from the school and besides it is practically impossible to obtain permission to erect Indian day schools on other than Government property.\n\nFrom the information contained in my letter of the 14th ultimo you will realize that it is extremely doubtful when funds will be available for the erection of the new building and consequently I consider that the lumber and other materials should be stored in the warehouse on the Church property where it can receive proper supervision. It may involve a slight expenditure to have it transported from this point to the location of the school on the Reserve but at the same time it will no doubt result in none of the materials being stolen.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nR.A.

We obtained prices on freighting this material to Little Grand Rapids from George Leyound, Matheson Island and from The Patricia Transportation Company but decided that the latter Company's price was the lowest.\n\nMr. Street, Missionary at Little Grand Rapids, advises that this material has been received and stored on the Church property.\n\nTrusting that you will find this account to be in order, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nEnclosure.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRealizing that it is incumbent for me at this time to write you re the choosing of a site for our new school here I trust that you will understand that my sole motive is that the persons concerned are in possession of the most important factors relating to their decision.\n\nIn the last mail I received a letter from my predecessor here. He came here in 1927; he built this Mission and left here to go to Berens River in 1936; I shall quote what he has to say regarding the site of our new school: \"As to your school, my advice to you is to have all your side included in the Reserve; this was favorably looked on before, and they really need that piece of ground; whatever you do not build the school on the other side; you will see this spring that all the children will be on your side and you will have to take all the children across the lake to school, or have none at school; and that is a big problem for any teacher.\"\n\nLast September and October I had to take and bring their children to school; this side of the lake is the busy side; both stores are here; the Grand Rapids here and just beyond the rapids lies Lake Pekangecum; their fishing grounds during the open water months they are all camped on this side; there is nobody on the side where the school now is; during these months:\n\nThe best land by far is on this side; several times the Band has tried to get this side incorporated in the Reserve; last winter the H.B.C.O. Manager met the Indians at a Band Meeting and I acted as chairman; when he reminded them that it was still not too late to have the Reserve made larger by adding the land on this side which would make it better for all concerned; the old Chief spoke up and said: \"Oh! I don't want to go now; who is going to build me a house over there?\" That gives you an idea of how much interest he had in two of his children who live on that side care about the welfare of the children and the people as a whole. The other councillor has already moved over here years ago and quite a bunch of the industrious ones of the band; they have built on this side and want the school here; at that meeting we saw that the issue was not with them as to what was best for the people but rather a jealous rivalry between the ones who are located here and the less active ones who stay on the Reserve;\" As the land over there is very rocky it is hard to have a garden of any size;\n\nThe best solution as I see it is to have the grounds between the mission and the rapids added to the Reserve; the point where our Mission Buildings are was marked by cutting a line through the bush from water to water under the directions of Mr. Schultze my predecessor; that was cut some years ago; you can still see the line and the Indians all recognize it as such; I know the line well as I was one of the two men who cut it; the other man Mr. Kirkness used to be our Missionary at Pekangecum but died some years ago; have the Reserve line run from that line to the Rapids; there is a trader near the Rapids; then across the Rapids is the H.B.C.O.; both of these parties favor this idea; the Trader would I expect wish to have his piece of ground left out of the Reserve; the H.B.C.O. land would in no way be affected;\n\nThe future of this place is without doubt on this side; more and more of the Indians express their desire to be over here; the R.C. Mission is in a different position on the Reserve; they are situated at the western end where there is considerable good ground; they would be disinterested as to the site of our school; indeed their present teacher sees the wisdom of our school site being here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.D. Scott\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6239, file 523-5, part 2)\nOttawa, May 7, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Street:\n\nI have hesitated to reply to your letter of April 6 until now, not knowing what comment to make in respect to the proposal submitted by you with respect to the site for an Indian day school at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nThe funds for the construction of this school were secured prior to the outbreak of the war. We find ourselves at this date with lumber, building material, etc., at Little Grand Rapids but without the money necessary to proceed with the construction.\n\nIf, however, it is your opinion that the Indian reserve should be extended to include an area suitable as a site, I am afraid that there is little hope of constructing a school at any time in the immediate future. The extension of an Indian reserve would from the outset involve negotiations with the Provincial Government and the transfer of provincial lands to the Crown in the right of the Dominion. I am not sufficiently optimistic to believe that these negotiations can be undertaken and carried through without a great deal of delay and lengthy correspondence and explanations. It is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for the Department to erect an Indian day school other than on property within the boundaries of an Indian reserve.\n\nI am today communicating with Indian Agent McPherson, asking him to undertake a complete survey of conditions at Little Grand Rapids, probably at the time of treaty payments.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nRev. C. D. Street,\nUnited Church Mission,\nLittle Grand Rapids,\nManitoba.\nOttawa, May 7, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of letter received by the Department from Reverend C. D. Street, Indian day school teacher, Little Grand Rapids, Manitoba, and copy of my reply thereto.\n\nIt is exceedingly difficult to decide what action, if any, should be taken at Little Grand Rapids, in view of the limited funds at our disposal and the dispute that seems to have arisen in respect to the school site. It is not the policy of the Government, as you are no doubt aware, to establish Indian schools outside the boundaries of Indian reserves.\n\nWould it be possible for you to make a thorough survey of conditions at Little Grand Rapids, probably at the time treaty payments are made? Immediately following that survey, you should be in a position to make certain very definite recommendations to the Department. I can give you no assurance at this date that funds will be available for the construction of the school this year. The suggestion has been made that the lumber already shipped in might be utilized for the repair of both buildings, that is the R. C. school and the United Church school, as representations have been made to us for the establishment of a Roman Catholic school at this point, and that the Indians might be persuaded to undertake the repair work without cost to the Department. However, insomuch as we have promised the United Church to establish a school at this point, representatives of the Church would have to concur in the new arrangement if you considered such an arrangement practicable. I have little on file to indicate the condition of the present buildings. They may have reached a stage where their repair would simply be a waste of money. I should like you, also, to discuss this matter with Inspector Hamilton. If you consider the reserve ought to be extended, it might be advisable for Inspector Hamilton to discuss this extension with the Lands Department of the Provincial Government. The transfer of land, of course, is a matter that comes wholly within the jurisdiction of the Reserves and Trusts Division and any recommendations you and Inspector Hamilton make with respect to the transfer would have to be taken up with the Superintendent of that Division.\n\nYou might acknowledge receipt of this letter and let me know when you are likely to visit the Little Grand Rapids district.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

At the first opportunity I will discuss this matter with Inspector Hamilton. After this interview I will notify you on whatever suggestion is to the best advantage of the Department and the schools.\n\nI would like to state that all of the lumber and materials has been stored away and is under cover. Just as soon as I have any further information regarding this matter, I will notify you at once.\n\nRegarding the extension of the Reserve, as you have stated no doubt it will take considerable time to arrange with the Provincial Government for this transfer of land.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE.

(RG 10, Volume 6239, file 523-5, part 2)\nSelkirk, Man., August 6, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\u2014\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 3rd, 1940, File 125-12-5, relative to the site and building of the U.C. Indian Day School at Little Grand Rapids, I am enclosing herewith a map of the Reserve area, showing the present location of the U.C. Indian Day School.\n\nWhile making Annuity Payments at Little Grand Rapids this year the question was brought up by the Chief as to where the new school was going to be built. The Chief stated that they wished the school to be built on the present site. Some of the Councillors or members of the Band objected to this suggestion. I would recommend that the school be built on the present school site, which is on Reserve land.\n\nThe lumber and cement has been stored in three separate buildings and they are all under lock and key. This material is all stored on the Church property which is situated on the opposite side of the River from the school. The River at this point is approximately half a mile wide. The cement is the only material that will deteriorate if left for another year. We have made inquiries from Contractors as to regarding the cement and they inform us that it will be of practically no use if it is not used this Summer. I would like to make the suggestion that if the Department does not have the money to build this school this Summer, that this cement be given to the Indians for chinking their homes. In this way the cement would not be wasted. However, if the Department decides to build this school this year, I would recommend that it be built on the old site on Reserve land.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A.

Indian Day School at Little Grand Rapids. He is very insistant that I give him a report on this matter. I do not feel that I should give information from this office regarding this matter, as I consider that it is quite a complicated situation. Both Denominations, R.C. and U.C. requested that new schools be built at Little Grand Rapids. This was in 1939. From a letter I have on file dated March 23rd, 1939, File 125-30-5, it would appear in your fifth paragraph that the R.C.'s made their request first. However, when the material was purchased, it was for the U.C. Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School.\n\nI would recommend that the Department write Father Provincial and explain the situation to him. Please advise what the Department wishes me to do in regard to this matter.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt.

Indian Day School. I have also received your personal letter of the 6th instant.\n\nIf you consider that the Indians will make good use of the school you may allow them to use it.\n\nIn my letter of May 7 I suggested that it might be possible to repair both the Little Grand Rapids R.C. School and the Little Grand Rapids U.C. School with the material that was bought last fall and is now on the Reserve. You stated in your letter of May 11 that you intended to discuss this suggestion with Inspector Hamilton but for some unaccountable reason you have not written to us further in regard to the matter.\n\nI should appreciate hearing from you immediately in this connection and at that time you should let me know what amount would be required for labour in the event of your agreeing that it would be feasible to repair both of the schools mentioned above. You should also state if Indian labour will be available. If white men would have to be employed you should state the tradesmen required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. E.

However, no provision whatever has been made in the estimates of this year for the money necessary to proceed with the construction of the United Church School at Little Grand Rapids, and at this date we have no assurance that we shall be able to secure the amount necessary for this purpose in the estimates of next year. In view of this fact and in view of existing conditions, it would be a generous gesture on the part of the teachers if they agreed to your suggestion. It is just possible that a certain amount of cement might also be required for the repair of the schools. Anything you can do to bring about an amicable and satisfactory solution of the problem confronting us at Little Grand Rapids will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. E.

(RG 10, Volume 6239, file 523-5, part 2)**\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer you to your letter of August 27th, File 125-12-5, relative to repairs to the U.C. and R.C. Indian Day Schools at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nIn this connection I wish to advise that I wrote Mr. Bellavance of the R.C. School and Mr. C.D. Street of the U.C. School, requesting them to advise in writing if these two schools could not be put in good condition for Winter use by both schools using some of the materials shipped for the new U.C. School. We have now received replies from both teachers stating that they could repair their schools free of all charges for labour. We have advised them to proceed with the repairs as outlined above.\n\nI feel satisfied that as far as Mr. Bellavance of the R.C. school is concerned, he is very well pleased to be able to get the material, which does not amount to very much, to repair his school. He also informed me that he would do the work himself, free of any charge. On behalf of the Department I wrote him a letter thanking him for his co-operation in this matter.\n\nMr. Street informed me that he would have the cost of labour for repairing his school done free of any charge. I also wrote a letter thanking him for assisting us in this matter.\n\nI feel satisfied that the school question at Little Grand Rapids is arranged satisfactorily for a few years at least, especially in the case of the R.C. School.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand from Indian Agent McPherson that you have agreed to make the necessary repairs to the Little Grand Rapids U.C. School without cost of labour to the Department.\n\nEspecially in view of the troublous times through which we are now passing the Department appreciates your co-operation in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G. D. Street,\nU.C. Indian Day School,\nLittle Grand Rapids,\nvia Berens River, Man.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant and note, with pleasure, that the teachers of both the Little Grand Rapids U.C. and R.C. Schools are arranging to have the necessary repairs done to these buildings without any cost for labour to the Department. I am writing to both teachers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand from Indian Agent McPherson that you have agreed to make the necessary repairs to the Little Grand Rapids R.C. School without cost of labour to the Department.\n\nEspecially in view of the troublous times through which we are now passing the Department appreciates your co-operation in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. N. Bellavance,\nR.C. Indian Day School,\nLittle Grand Rapids,\nvia Berens River, Man.\nDear Sirs:\n\nI beg to report having made a special trip and visit to Little Grand Rapids Reserve.\n\nAt R.C. school the teacher is busy fixing up and repairing the old school, the lower logs are very badly rotted but they are trying to make it habitable for this winter. This week Mr. Street intends repairing and fixing up the protestant school.\n\nI would like to make a suggestion that this winter logs be taken out to build two new schools. There is at present time on the reserve nearly enough lumber and material, provided logs where used to build both schools, which was shipped in last winter by tractor it would require very little additional material to make both schools. The condition of both these schools is such that they should be replaced by new ones next summer especially for the health of the children.\n\nW.H.G. Gibbs, M.D., C.M.\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from Indians of the Little Grand Rapids Reserve.\n\nFrom the information contained in your letter of September 19, 1940, it was presumed that the necessary repairs to the R.C. School and the U.C. School would be completed last fall. However, if the information contained in the letter from the Indians is correct it would appear that nothing has been done at the U.C. School. Please let me know immediately what work has been done at both schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\n\nMr. E.

Our letters have apparently had no effect and I would suggest that the Department write Street direct and advise him that it is impossible to build a new school at this time due to the War. I consider that a letter from the Department requesting that Mr. Street make the best of his present school until such time as the Department is in a better position to undertake construction of the new school, would have more effect than if we were to write him again.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\nSelkirk, Man., March 14, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 10th, File 125-12-5, relative to repairs made to the R.C. and U.C. schools at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nI am very much surprised at the contents of the letter received at the Department from Mr. Street, I know that Mr. Street wrote the letter as I had been informed that he was making out a letter for the Indians. I wish to state that Mr. Street and Mr. Bellavance advised me last Fall that if they were able to secure a certain amount of materials that they would be able to put both of their schools in suitable condition for use. I received a letter late last Fall giving me the enclosed list of materials used in repairing both schools. To show you the difference in the two men, Mr. Bellavance wrote me and advised that his school was now in first class condition and thanked the Department for the materials used in making the repairs. He further advised that his school was now in good condition for several years use. Mr. Bellavance's school was in far worse condition than the U.C. school. Mr. Street, on the other hand, appears to have taken the stand that he does not wish to assist the Department by repairing his school to the extent that Mr. Bellavance has done. According to Mr. Street's letter, as Far as I considered that the question was settled but owing to the Hudson's Bay Company going to build at Little Grand Rapids this year, he has decided the school should be built now. I believe that this matter would not have come at all at this time if the Hudson's Bay had not decided to build this year.\n\nI note that he states that the materials are improperly stored. I wish to advise that at Treaty time last Summer this lumber was all under cover and well stored. I am sorry to say that Mr. Street has always been more or less a source of trouble to our Department, as he has always been a great letter writer and in urging the Indians to try and use their influence with the Department regarding supplies, etc., on Reserves where he has been Mississauga. Of course I fully understand that, owing to the material being there on the Reserve, it is putting the Department in a bad position. However, if the Department decides to build this Summer, there will have to be extra material shipped in, which would cost the Department a considerable sum. I consider that the Indians would be perfectly willing to leave matters as they are, as long as the War is going on, if Mr. Street would leave them alone.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 18, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Street:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a petition, dated Grand Rapids, Man., March 3, 1941, signed by the Chief and three councillors of the Little Grand Rapids Band of Indians. It is noted that in this petition the Indians ask for the utilization of the material now on hand for the construction of an Indian day school at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nIn this connection may I refer to a letter received from Indian Agent McPherson, dated Selkirk, Man., September 19, 1940. In this letter Mr. McPherson, commenting on conditions at Little Grand Rapids, states:\n\n\"I wish to advise that I wrote Mr. Bellavance of the R. C. school and Mr. C. D. Street of the U. C. school, requesting them to advise in writing if these two schools could not be put in good condition for winter use by both schools using some of the materials shipped in for the new United Church school. We have now received replies from both teachers, stating that they could repair their schools free of all charges for labour, and we have advised them to proceed with the repairs as outlined above\".\n\nMr. McPherson, in a letter dated March 14, 1941, referring to the materials sent in for the construction of a school at Little Grand Rapids, states:\n\n\"I wish to advise that at treaty time last summer this lumber was all under cover and well stored\".\n\nI may state that no provision whatever has been made in the 1941-42 estimates for the construction of an Indian day or residential school anywhere in the Dominion. Indian residential schools have within the last year or so been destroyed by fire at Carcross, Yukon Territory; Albany, James Bay Agency; and quite recently the newly constructed classrooms of the Alberni United Church Residential School at Alberni, British Columbia. When funds are available for the construction\n\nof Indian -\n\nMr. C. D. Street,\nTeacher,\nUnited Church Indian Day School,\nLittle Grand Rapids, Manitoba.\nof Indian schools, these afore-mentioned schools will necessarily have the first claim on our appropriation. In the meantime, it should be pointed out that it is exceedingly difficult for the Dominion Government to secure funds from Parliament for the erection of the buildings necessary to maintain our regular services. A number of the provinces have placed at the disposal of the Dominion Government, without cost, institutions ordinarily used for the care of the sick and the education of their citizens. Outstanding in this respect is the action of the province of Ontario which placed at the disposal of the Dominion the seven million dollar building at Peterborough, Ont. It is my further statement also that the Manitoba Government has placed at the disposal of the Dominion the Manitoba School for the Deaf, Tuxedo, Man. It should be stated also that the Public Works Department of the Federal Government has abandoned a number of post offices, for the construction of which contracts had been completed.\n\nThe only suggestion, therefore, that I can make in the case of the school at Little Grand Rapids is that the materials now on hand be used to the best possible advantage for the repair of the existing building. If the Indians are interested in the education of their children, they might be persuaded to undertake this work in the interests of the young and as a patriotic duty. They should be reminded that we are living in the most critical period in Canadian history, when the country is actually fighting for its existence. It is gratifying to learn, from the last paragraph of the petition, that the Indians do not wish to ask for anything that would interfere with the nation's war effort. In view of this declaration, I feel confident that by the exercise of your influence you can persuade the Indians to repair and reconstruct the present building to such an extent that it will provide school accommodation for the pupils in attendance until times become somewhat normal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nUnited Church Mission,\nLittle Grand Rapids,\nManitoba.\n\nApril 1st, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Hoeg:\n\nHave received your letter of March 18th re Indian petition concerning erection of school here.\n\nReferring to Agent's letter to you Sept. 19th, 1940, I wish to state that I did repair our old building. However, with an old log, plastered, building, there is a limit to which such repairs are wisely carried out. For instance the floor is terrible, but the condition of the roof does not warrant a new floor. There is no ceiling, yet the cross beams are so low that a new ceiling is out of the question. And may I might go on from here. I worked.\n15 days and in that time made the old place as habitable as I could; very much better than it was before.\n\nAnd then concerning the Agent letter dated March 8th, 1941. Again the agent is correct. However, the only stockhouses are being used for this, which makes it inconvenient for the Mission. The roofs of these 3 storied houses are all in need of repair.\n\nIn regard to your last paragraph may I say that in my opinion little saving of any considerable quantity of materials or labor to replace old building is a matter of question. If put the old place in as good condition as I could without as before stated carrying out an unnecessary use of valuable materials on an old delapidated place.\n\nAgain our people are all away now. There\nwill return next month. School will reopen on June 1st. All Indians who can will get work on H.B.C. construction work here. Those who cannot will fight on the river if fighting can be gotten. And those not able to get work will probably leave to hunt and fish where game is plentiful.\n\nIt has indeed a pity that a way could not be found of building a new school this summer. To see 65 sacks of cement harden like a rock and be thrown away, a waste of around $300, while the H.B.C. is building 2 or 3 new buildings a stone's throw away is hard to be understood, by the Indians.\n\nWhen Mr. Graham, the H.B.C. travelling inspector was here he told the Indians and me that he would be very glad to do all\nhe could to help build our school. The Indians themselves would be quick to help if they were given enough to exist on while working\u2014say $1.60 a day.\n\nI trust I have explained everything to you also, hoping that a way will be found to build school this summer before cement is useless.\n\nThanking you very much\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.S. [Signature]\nOttawa, April 15, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Street:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the first instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nNo provision whatever has been made in the estimates now before Parliament for the construction of Indian day or residential schools anywhere in the Dominion. In view of this decision, it will not be possible to seriously consider the construction of the Indian day school in which you are interested at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nI was sorry to learn that the cement on hand had deteriorated somewhat. It was my hope that storage facilities could be provided at Little Grand Rapids that would have kept this cement in good condition. However, if it has deteriorated, there is little that can be done about the matter. In view of the critical period in which we find ourselves and the desire on the part of Canadians everywhere to conserve public funds, would it be possible to have the Indians at Little Grand Rapids undertake more extensive repairs to the school than appear to have been undertaken at this time? I make this suggestion with the feeling that it may be several years before money is available to undertake the construction of public buildings anywhere, other than buildings urgently needed for war purposes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

They were at once interested as to whether they might be of assistance to us. It was thought by them that their carpenters could possibly be persuaded to supervise the work on our school if the Indians were to do the work. Then the question of rationing was taken up and they expressed themselves as willing to do their share and hoped that some arrangement might be made whereby the Govt. and the H.B.C. and Church find a solution.\n\nWould you please do what you can in order that our school be built and so make use of all these valuable materials especially the cement.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned........C. D. Street.\nAttention of Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am enclosing copy of a letter which Mr. Street, our missionary at Little Grand Rapids, sent to Dr. Cormie. I do not know to what he refers, as I thought the school had been erected, but I thought you might be interested in getting this communication.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, June 12, 1941.\n\nRe: Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 4th instant and also copy of a letter received by Dr. Cornie from Mr. C. D. Street, teacher at the above noted school, enclosed therewith.\n\nI should state that an appropriation for the erection of an Indian day school at Little Grand Rapids was included in the 1939 estimates. However, certain delays occurred and we found it impossible to proceed with the construction of the school during the year 1940, for the simple reason that no funds for this purpose were available, the 1939 funds having lapsed.\n\nThe delays I have in mind were the delays in securing the material and shipping it to Grand Rapids and a dispute in respect to the exact site. It was finally decided that a portion of the building material sent in should be used for the repair of the school, and I was informed that partial repairs were undertaken. It has not been found possible to include a sum in the estimates of this year for the construction of an Indian day or residential school anywhere in the Dominion. The Government has simply suspended the construction of all buildings other than those necessary for the war effort. I notice that one or two post offices that were already started have been abandoned.\n\nI am however today communicating with Mr. Street, and if he can persuade the Indians to undertake this task, in return for a ration allowance, the Department would be prepared to supply these Indians with rations during the period of construction. I note with interest that the Hudson's Bay Company would be prepared to have their carpenters supervise this work. It is this offer on the part of the H. B. C. that prompts me to make the offer of rations on behalf of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR A Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.

(RG 10, Volume 6239, file 523-5, part 2)\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, June 12, 1941.\n\nRe: Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School.\n\nDear Mr. Street:\n\nYour letter of May 15, 1941, addressed to Dr. Cormie, has been passed on to me by the Reverend Dr. Dorey.\n\nI have little to add to the information contained in my letter to you dated April 15, 1941. No provision has been made by the Government in the Estimates of this year for the construction of any buildings other than the buildings absolutely necessary for the conduct of the war. I note with interest, however, the willingness on the part of the R. B. C. to supervise the work. If the company is willing to do this and if the Indians are capable and willing to undertake the task, the Department would be prepared to allow rations to the Indians during the period of construction. It will be necessary, however, for you to make an estimate of the amount of rations required so that we can have this information before a final decision is reached.

Indian Day School, Little Grand Rapids.\n\nRegarding your letter of July 4th, File 125-12-5, I wish to advise that this letter was received here on July 5th and I immediately wrote Mr. Street, instructing him that the Department would allow $350.00 for rations for Indian labour building the school. I informed him that there would be no further material supplied and that the school would have to be built on Reserve property.\n\nI note in the copy of your letter to Mr. Street dated June 12th that he must have informed you that the Company would supervise the work of building the school. I informed Street that there would be no wages paid for a carpenter. On July 11th I received a letter from Mr. Street in which he requested me to interview Mr. Talbot as Mr. Street stated in this letter that if the Department paid the ration bill, the Hudson's Bay Company would supply a carpenter. I could not understand why the Company would supply a carpenter at no cost to us, so on July 14th I interviewed Mr. Talbot and he told me that they certainly would not supply a carpenter and pay his wages.\n\nWhile making Treaty payments at Little Grand Rapids yesterday, this question was brought up and Mr. Street now states that the carpenters will do the work but their labour alone will cost $350.00 while an extra $300.00 is required for Indian labour moving supplies across the River to the site of the school and for labour working on the school. Street wishes to know by Monday, July 21st if the Department will supply this extra money, as the carpenter and his men will be leaving Little Grand Rapids on Tuesday if nothing is to be done regarding the school.\n\nPlease advise by wire what action you are taking.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE.

School with a few repairs, such as a new floor and a few minor changes could be made to do for several years. I also understand that some of the Indians from this Reserve did not go to the trap lines last Winter as Mr. Street kept the children attending his school. I have told Mr. Street that he must not compel the parents to remain on the Reserve in the Winter time because he considers the children should be going to school. Trapping is the only means these Indians have of making a living and when they do not get out to their trap lines in the Winter, they have a hard time to earn sufficient to keep their families in food and clothing.\n\nE.

Dr. Cormie points out that the old classroom is not in shape to be used and in his opinion was not worth repairing. The children are being taught in the Church and according to Dr. Cormie this has been the case for the past year or two. During the conversation Dr. Cormie stated the Indians were satisfied with the arrangement.\n\nI would like the Department's approval to continue the present arrangement for this term at least. At treaty time this year the old school can be inspected by the Agent and some recommendation made then regarding what should be done to provide suitable classroom accommodation.\n\nA.G.

In 1941 we supplied materials to\nrepair this school. We were requested by Indian\nAgent McPherson to forward $350.00 for labour.\nThis was done, but in a letter dated July 18, 1941,\nhe stated that $650.00 would be required and this\nextra amount was not available at that time.\nPresumably the materials that we supplied in 1941\nare still stored at the school, although I believe\nsome of the material was used in repairing another\nschool, due to the fact that Mr. Street, who was in\ncharge of the Little Grand Rapids U.C.

McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Manitoba.\n\nIn a letter dated January 24, 1944, Mr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, wrote to the Department with reference to the Little Grand Rapids United Church School. I presume he wrote to you at the same time, as the recommendation in his letter was that the arrangement of holding school in the church should continue until treaty time. We do not appear to have received any further communication in regard to conditions at the Little Grand Rapids United Church School. However, I may say that recently we received a complaint to the effect that the lumber and other materials, which we understood were well stored (see your letter of March 14, 1941), are not being properly looked after. We understand that some of the material was used in 1941 for repairing the Little Grand Rapids R.C. School and also a small quantity in repairing the Little Grand Rapids U.C. School.\n\nDid you have an opportunity of inspecting this material at treaty time in 1944? If not, have you any information regarding where this material is stored and the condition in which it is kept? An early reply will be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nOn receipt of your letter 125-12-5 of Jan 31/45 I wrote to Mr. Dueck, Teacher at the Little Grand Rapids Day School re the material for the new school on that Reserve.\n\nMr. Dueck now reports that the material \"is well protected from wind and weather where it is\".\n\nE.

McPherson, Esq., Indian Agent Selkirk, Man.\n\nAs per instructions I visited the R.C. and U.C. Day Schools while at Little Grand Rapids Reserve for Annuity payments this year.\n\nI am attaching map of this area showing the approximate positions of our two schools the H.B.Co and the Missions. You will not there is no Reserve land on the north side of Family Lake near the H.B.Co and the U.C.Mission. The Teacher lives in the U.C.Mission and has to cross approximately one mile of water to the school every day. In the spring and late fall this crossing is not possible owing to the ice conditions. From information gathered I understand for two thirds of the school term the families of the U.C. pupils move from the reserve across near the H.B.Co and during this period the Teacher has been transporting them back and forth by canoe to school but of late has been holding classes in the Mission House. The Indians seem to favor a new school being built near the Mission on the north side of the Lake. This would not be on Reserve property. The Manager of the H.B.Post states that the Company does not own the land where their buildings are and doubts if the Church owns the land where the Mission buildings are. Except for the fact that it would not be on the Reserve, the logical site would appear to be on the north side of the lake.\n\nThe present U.C.School is a log building 24 x 24. It is in very poor repair and too small for the number of children that should attend. There are nineteen on the roll and should be approximately thirty. The attendance will undoubtedly increase owing to the regulations governing the family allowances. There are no outside toilets at this school and material should be included for these when making up a bill of material for a new school. I would suggest a lean-to kitchen on the school for preparation of the mid-day meals.\n\nThe R.C. School is a log building 20 x 16 in very poor repair and too small. There should be approximately thirty-five children on the roll at this school. Some of the new lumber for the U.C.School was used here for a ceiling and minor interior repairs to make the building warm enough for winter use. I understand that the R.C. pupils are on the reserve during most of the school term so the present site would be satisfactory for a new school.\nOwing to the fact that the U.C.School can not be used now and the condition and size of the R.C.School I would recommend that two new schools be built here as soon as circumstances will permit.\n\nThe material already shipped for the U.C.School is well protected from weather. It is stored in three small log buildings belonging to the U.C.Mission. It was difficult to get an exact check of all this material without taking it outside I made as careful a check as possible of all material on hand and have enclosed a list of same.\n\nThese schools closed for summer vacation June 30th and will re-open Sept 1st.\n\nF. M. Hughes\nAgency Clerk\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI instructed Mr. Hughes, Agency Clerk to go into the school situation while paying annuity at the Little Grand Rapids Reserve this summer and am enclosing a copy of his report to this office.\n\nMr. Hughes' report gives a fairly clear picture if the situation as far as schools are concerned at Little Grand Rapids and it would appear that two new schools are required as soon as circumstances will permit.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, September 6th, 1945.\n\nMr. E. McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the school situation on the Little Grand Rapids Reserve.

However, you should point out to all teachers that they must not make purchases for which they expect the Department to pay, until the requisite authority has been received.\n\nWe have no intention at the present time of decreasing the amount that we have previously allowed yearly for midday meal purposes. However, in view of the payment of family allowances, it is felt that if the money is properly expended by the parents, the children should be better fed and clothed and consequently we do not see the necessity for increasing the amount for midday meal purposes.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Purchase Order #2501\nPurchase Order #2502\n\nI wish to inform the Department that a voucher covering purchase order #2501 was sent in Nov 8th, 1945. Part of this order was not filled due to a shortage of stock.\n\nI have not received an account for purchase order #2502. I shall investigate this matter with the T. Eaton Company.

The Company state that the original invoices were forwarded to Little Grand Rapids and apparently the Teacher there failed to return them to this office.\n\nI might state here that copies of Dept Purchase orders were not forwarded here during 1945-46 as in former years. On this account it is possible to have invoices go astray as in case of No. 2502.\n\nE.

Hughes,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa, March 1st, 1947.\n\nMr. F.M. Hughes, Acting Indian Agent,\nSelkirk, Manitoba.\n\nWe are in receipt of your report of your visit to the Little Grand Rapids Reserve and in reply I wish to advise you that funds are being provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48 for the erection of a new U.C. school on the Little Grand Rapids Reserve.\n\nPlease have an inventory taken of the material on the site and let me have detailed information regarding the additional material that you consider is required.\n\nWe propose to build a combined school and teachers' residence. Does this meet with your approval?\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nc/o to Inspector Hamilton.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI have received a copy of an account from the T. Eaton Co. Ltd. for material forwarded to our Little Grand Rapids U.C. School in March, 1945. This material was purchased on Department Order No. 2502 and our Voucher No. 810 - $45.25 went forward for payment March 30/46. The Company state they have not yet received payment of this account.\n\nF. M. Hughes,\nActing Indian Agent\nOttawa, March 18th, 1947.\n\nMr. F.M. Hughes, Acting Indian Agent,\nSelkirk, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant regarding T. Eaton Company account, our records show that cheque 58873 for $45.25 was issued and sent to the T. Eaton Company on April 13th, 1946.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour letter 125-12-5 (WT 1) of March 1/47 was received here March 7/47 and I immediately forwarded a message to the Teacher to have a complete inventory taken of the material on the Little Grand School site. A copy of this inventory is enclosed. I have a copy of an inventory taken by myself two years ago but with no one in charge of the present school for some months thought it advisable to have another taken.\n\nI am of the opinion that a combined school and residence on this reserve would be very satisfactory, however, having no plans of the building you propose to erect I cannot give an estimate of balance of material required.\n\nF.

The present school is in very poor condition and some plastering and shingling will be required this fall to make the place fit for use during the coming winter. If this building program is definitely to be carried out next summer (and I hope such is the case) I would suggest that the men now working at the Roman Catholic Mission School be asked to tender on similar buildings for the United Church school.

Olson,\nSuperintendent, Clandeboye Indian Agency,\nSelkirk, Manitoba.\n\nSawmill - Poplar River Indian Reserve -\nLittle Grand Rapids U.C. Day School -\n\nYour letter of November 24, concerning sawmill for the Poplar River Indian Reserve, has been brought to my attention. While it is our intention to eventually build a school at Poplar River, we were only able to include one school for your agency in our estimates. This school will be at Little Grand Rapids for the United Church. We already have some lumber at the site of this school (a search of your files will reveal the exact quantities).\n\nThe question is: Would it be feasible to haul lumber across the lake from Poplar River to Little Grand Rapids, if your mill was set up there? We could provide you with the bill of materials required for the construction of our standard one-room Indian day school and teacher's residence. You could then delete the materials already on hand plus the materials which you could provide from your sawmill. This would then leave a list of materials which could be requisitioned for from outside. However, as pointed out above, a lot depends upon the practicability of the suggestion that materials be transported from your proposed sawmill across the lake to Little Grand Rapids.\n\nWe would appreciate an early answer to the above proposal.\n\nBernard F.

We will leave the specifications of the teacherage in your hands based upon the stock of lumber at present available. I enclose a sample plan which could be following in erecting this teacherage.\n\nWith regard to the school, it is hoped that the company concerned can finish this building to reach the dead line at Riverton. You will note that we have requested delay until January 1, 1949, if the former date can not be met. It will be necessary for you to arrange for the excavation of the basement using local labour. Inspector Hamilton has had some considerable experience this summer in the erecting of three teacherages which were ordered for Manitoba day schools from this company. He is being sent a copy of this letter and you should refer to him for any further information you require from the company.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/HH.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Little Grand Rapids U.C. Day School.\n\nThis acknowledges your letter of January 5th, 1948, file 125-12-5 (WT). Its contents and instructions have been carefully noted.\n\nThe North American Lumber & Supply Company has been interviewed in Winnipeg, Man., and report ability to make delivery of this order as specified for shipment via Riverton, Man., March 1st.\n\nIt is desired to submit the following observations for your consideration relating to our Little Grand Rapids situation.\n\nIndian housing on this Reserve is in a deplorable state. Special effort was put forth to obtain improvement with result we have five blocks erected and logs out for five more. It was my intention to use major portion of our Agency balance in allotment 10 and 13, vote 515, to ship windows and assorted lumber by Tractor Train this winter for housing assistance next spring. If we miss this shipment, we can do nothing to aid housing at Little Grand Rapids until 1949.\n\nAccording to your letter January 3rd, file 17125-14 (W.T.5), we will use our balance for our essential and important efforts at Poplar River Indian Reserve. Therefore, I would like to suggest for your consideration the following:\n\nThat order to North American Lumber Company, Winnipeg, for one room Pre-Fabricated Day School be enlarged to include Teachers Residence attached to school, per plan submitted by this Company for your consideration last fall. The cost would not exceed $2,000.00 extra for pre-fabricated joint residence and school. In having school and residence in one unit, we save on excavation costs, one basement wall and one house wall,\nalso one heating plant instead of two if residence is separate. There are other advantages.\n\nIf this were acceptable, then we could use Bill of material on hand at Little Grand Rapids (now intended for Teachers Residence) to assist regarding housing improvements.\n\nInasmuch as only one of our five schools estimated for 1948-49 is being granted, it is hoped this request with its relatively small extra costs may be granted.\n\nThe order for one room day school has not yet been received by North American Lumber Company from Central Purchasing Department, and for some days yet they are able to accept substitution to joint pre-fabricated school and residence. Should such meet with your approval. Will you therefore advise quickly decision regarding this request.\n\nB.E. Olson,\nSuperintendent,\nClandeboye Agency.\n\nBEO/ENW\n\nC.C. Inspector A.G. Hamilton.\nJanuary 17, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nLittle Grand Rapids U.C. Indian Day School.\n\nOn January 5 on similar file we forwarded you a requisition for a prefabricated one-room day school for the above Indian Reserve.\n\nWe had a small supply of lumber on hand at this point and it was our intention to use this in the erection of a small teacherage.\n\nIn this plan Superintendent Olson had originally agreed. We have now received an airmail letter from him, a copy of which is attached. Therefore, in view of the information contained in his letter could we please have our original requisition changed to read now as follows:\n\n\"One Prefabricated one-room day school with attached teacher's residence as per plan previously agreed upon\".\n\nThis plan has been the subject of long discussion between Mr. Buck, Mr. Carpenter of North American Lumber Company and myself. It would be appreciated if you would airmail or wire North American Lumber Company and inform them of this change. It would seem evident from the last paragraph of Mr. Olson's letter that they are quite prepared to accept this substitution and probably are anticipating it.\n\nArrangements have already been made with our Welfare Division whereby they can take over the lumber on hand at Little Grand Rapids for the construction of Indian homes and credit an amount for these supplies to our Education Vote.\n\nEmil.\n\nBernard F. Mooney,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJanuary 17, 1948.\n\nMr. B.E. Olson, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Selkirk, Manitoba.\n\nLittle Grand Rapids U.C. Day School\n\nReference your 5-11-3 of January 14th.\n\nImmediately upon receipt of your letter I advised the Departmental Purchasing Agent of the requested change to a pre-fabricated one room school with attached teacher's residence. It is presumed that the Minister's office will concur in your recommendation.\n\nI have also checked with Mr. Armstrong of the Welfare Division and he has concurred in the use of the lumber at Little Grand Rapids for use on your housing project. When this lumber has been so used could we please be advised so that funds can be transferred from the Welfare vote to the Education vote to cover cost of transfer.\n\nBernard F.

In view of the fact that the cost of the building will probably be in excess of $5,000.00, it will be necessary to obtain an Order in Council. Therefore, I would appreciate your doing everything possible towards arriving at an estimate of the building and forwarding it to Mr. Vincent so that he can issue the necessary Purchase Order. In the meantime, we have ordered the cement and it should now be on its way to Mr. Olson. You can also expect to hear further from me with regard to having orders for similar types of schools.\n\nI wish to thank you for your past cooperation and hope that you can provide Mr. Vincent with the information he requires as work progresses.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Winnipeg, plus freight and erection supervisor's wages, fare and expenses;\n\nThat it is considered that the provision of this school and attached teacher's residence is a pressing urgency and within the exception provided in Section 36 above recited and further, it is considered that the work can be more expeditiously and economically executed as suggested herein.\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Acting Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted for the provision of this building as outlined above, this being the only arrangement possible at the present time and it being essential that this work be undertaken at once and carried to completion in order that the building will be available for use by the time the next school term commences.\n\n[Signature]\nClerk of the Privy Council\n\nIndian Affairs.

The workmanship on this school is exceptionally good, and it is a very nice building, with teacher's residence attached. However, the floors have not been finished and I have instructed Mr. Olson to buy material to have this done at once, as they should be put into shape before used. The teacher is Mr. N.G. MacIntosh, who has just taken over the school. He is very enthusiastic, but has had very little experience with Indians, and I doubt if he will make good. This school is badly in need of about 16 desks, also a desk and chair for the teacher. I requested Mr. Olson to take this matter up with you. The school is also very much in need of sports equipment. At the time of my visit there were 35 children in the school and they were very clean and neat.\n**J. W.

Leach, concerning the recognition of the Little Grand Rapids R.C. Indian Day School. I have noted that a satisfactory commencement has been made and I am pleased to state that a salary of $4 per teaching day will be allowed for the activity. As from the first instant Brother Leach should forward day school quarterly returns to the Indian office at Selkirk. In view of the difficulty of communicating with Little Grand Rapids, it might be advisable to have the salary cheques made out to you in trust for Brother Leach. Salary will be paid upon receipt of the returns. I trust that this activity will be one of much usefulness for our Indian wards of the locality. I regret that no funds can be allowed for building activity at this point. Favourable consideration will be given, however, to all requisitions for stationery, books, etc. Please inform the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

C. Day School to the Little Grand Rapids R. C. Day School with salary at the rate of $80 a teaching month.\n\nHe will succeed Antoine Guimond from September 1st, 1936, and the following entry should appear on the September paylist in connection with this school:\n\n524 - Boniface Guimond - c/o Banque Canadienne - $80.00 Nationale,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\n\nMr. Guimond's services will be continuous from the above date.\nMr. Philip Phelan  \n266 Holmewood Ave.  \nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMy dear Phil:\n\nReverend Father de Grandpr\u00e9 of Berens River is under the impression that the Department promised to pay Boniface Guimond the sum of $186.50 for freight expenses incurred by him in the summer of 1936. If there is any foundation for this assumption and if the amount has not yet been paid, you will render Father de Grandpr\u00e9 a real service by having a cheque issued at your earliest convenience as Father de Grandpr\u00e9 financed Boniface Guimond all through last summer and he would now like to be paid back.\n\nBoniface Guimond could easily pay him if the Department reimbursed him for his freight expenses. The whole matter could also be more easily adjusted if the cheque, although made in the name of Boniface Guimond, was mailed to Reverend Father de Grandpr\u00e9 at Berens River.\n\nPlease accept in advance my sincerest thanks for anything that you may be able to do for Father de Grandpr\u00e9.\n\nWith best wishes to the lady of the house and the children, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend J. O. Flourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, June 15th, 1937.\n\nDear Father Plourde,-\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the amount owing to Father de Grandpre by Boniface Guimond. Unless we receive an order from Guimond authorizing payment to Father de Grandpre, I regret that present regulations will not permit a cheque being sent to the latter.\n\nAs you know, we have to issue each salary cheque in favour of the teacher himself. You will remember my mentioning to you that, at one time in the case of the United Church, we used to issue all salary cheques for day schools under their auspices to the church but, for the last four years, we have had to issue all these cheques to the individuals concerned. In many of the United Church schools, they are up against the same difficulty as Father de Grandpre as they have to issue advances to many teachers.\n\nI still feel that it would be in the best interests of all parties concerned to retire Mr. Boniface Guimond from Indian school work.\n\nAs mentioned above, I am sorry I cannot do anything in this matter as I am only too willing to help Father de Grandpre if that were at all possible but present regulations are so strict that I cannot see any way of circumventing them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6239, file 524-3, part 1)\nOttawa,\nOctober 12, 1937.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 9th, I would refer you to my letter of June 15th last, a copy of which I enclose.\n\nI have a faint recollection of having received a letter from Father de Grandpre, but am unable to find a copy of my reply. I could not possibly have promised him that we would pay the freight expenses of Mr. Guimond. Expenses of teachers of Indian Day Schools, either for their personal travelling, or for the freight on their household effects, have never been paid by the Department.\n\nThe only way that we could make a payment to Father de Grandpre is by securing a Power of Attorney from Mr. Guimond authorizing payment of a part, or the whole, of his salary to Father de Grandpre. I enclose the necessary Power of Attorney form which Mr. Guimond must sign.\n\nI regret that I cannot do anything further in this matter, but you realize that our regulations in this regard are extremely strict.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, August 22nd, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School - No. 524.\n\nAs I informed you in my memorandum of March 13th, Mr. N. Bellavance gave up duties at this school on March 1st.\n\nTo succeed him, we have appointed Rev. Bro. Stanley Heytens at a salary of $100.00 a teaching month, effective September 1st, 1944. I enclose copy of letter of appointment and the other documents will be forwarded to you when received.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa,\nJune 25, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Little Grand Rapids R.C.\nIndian Bay School No. 624.\n\nThe Indian Agent advises that Mr. N. Bellavance re-opened the above-mentioned school on June 1, 1943. He should be paid continuously from that date to March 31, 1944. Salary should be allowed him at the same rate as last year.\n\nR.A.

At that time he expects to enlist. Consequently no further payment of salary should be made to him after the end of February without receiving authority from this Branch.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Certified | P.A. | Date | Initials | Referred To | For Release | Initials | Date |\n|-----------|------|------|----------|-------------|------------|----------|------|\n|           |      |      |          |             |            |          |      |\n\n(If purpose for which referred cannot be expressed on one line, add minute to file and enter here \"With Minute\")\n\nOA E8 10/1 E8 Rg.

The Department's practice is to assist this type of activity only when it has been proved successful and I regret that a grant for teacher's salary cannot be allowed at the present time. I note, however, that the Roman Catholic Indians have erected a building to be used as a classroom and the Department will allow an expenditure of approximately $33 for 2 rolls roofing paper, 2 rolls building paper, 4 windows, one door and 300 lbs. of lime. Shipment should be made this fall, if possible.\n\nAt a later date, you should report concerning the success of this school and the Department will give consideration to its official recognition and assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Church have started a Day school at Little Grand Rapids and as Reverend Brother Leech is well experienced in that kind of work, he was sent to assist in organizing this work, and he was replaced at Berens' River Day School, R.C. by Moniface Guimond, acting under the tutelage of the Reverend Father who is in charge of the R.C. Mission at Berens River. All these facts would have been placed before the Department by the church, but unfortunately when the arrangement was completed and the Rev'd Missionary of Berens' came to meet Rev'd Father Beyes, he missed him as he had just left for the absence I have mentioned and the matter was overlooked.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6239, file 524-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter, No. 125-30-5, dated 15th July re- requisition from Rev. F. Leach, O.M.I., Little Grand Rapids R.C. Indian Day School, for supplies for mid-day meal, I beg to enclose copy of requisition, with the amount of supplies which I would recommend, noted in red ink. The original quantities asked for, I have reduced to what I consider should be sufficient for the school attendance.\n\nPermit me to express my views on this subject. I am strongly in favor of giving the Indian children the best education possible, even giving the pupils a mid-day meal, if that will help to increase the attendance, but when that meal is given as an excuse for keeping the men at home and away from their trap lines in winter, I think it is time to call a halt. If these conditions are allowed to go on, it is impossible to foresee what problems the Department will be up against, in the way of supplying more destitute rations and supplies. At some of the reserves I visited this summer hardly any of the men went away trapping last winter; the reason given was that they wanted the children to attend school. At the Bloodvein Reserve, only four families went to the bush. When I paid there in June, I found that most of their treaty money had been taken up at the stores.\n\nYou will notice that I have struck out the 50 lbs. of sugar in the requisition, as this is hardly necessary along with a case of sweetened condensed milk.\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. Leach, offering, if his requisition is approved of, to freight in the supplies to Little Grand Rapids for 5\u00bdc per lb. The usual rate is 7\u00bdc per lb.\n\nI regret the delay in answering your letter and would greatly appreciate an early reply, so that these supplies can be forwarded at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6239, file 524-5, part 1)\nOttawa, September 7, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to supplies for the midday lunch at the Little Grand Rapids R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is only intended that children should be given either hot soup or a hot drink and biscuit to supplement whatever food they bring to school for their midday meal. The teachers of all the day schools in your Agency should be cautioned not to pauperize the Indians by serving a full meal. By following out the wishes of the Department in this regard the amount of supplies required would be considerably reduced.\n\nI note from your letter that you recommend the supplying of 100 Lbs. beans, 50 Lbs. rice, 25 Lbs. cocoa and 1 case condensed milk. You may secure these, and have them forwarded as you suggest. An order is being placed with the Canada Biscuit Co., Winnipeg, for 25 boxes biscuits. Please communicate with this firm at once giving them full shipping directions.\n\nYou may also purchase 1 axe, 2 water pails, 6 Yds. towelling, 2 combs, 2 basins, 2 brooms and 6 Lbs. yarn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian Day School at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nIt would appear that the work at this school is an absolute joke. I am now informed on reliable authority that the school is often closed for a week at a time, other times there are only four and five children attending.\n\nThere is no reason why his pupils should know anything about the pangs of hunger if he allows them to consume the supplies for Midday meal purposes that were sent to them. As for his purchasing supplies for the school, it is simply a joke.\n\nIt might be well to investigate the qualifications of this man to teach in any school, where some semblance of progress is required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAI/FL\n\nIndian Affairs.

He was nominated by the Church authorities, and we are communicating with them with a view to securing the nomination of a qualified teacher to take charge of the school in September. As soon as this information is received you will be advised, and you can then notify Mr. Guimond that his services will not be required after June 30th, next.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

McPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nMarch 11st, 1937.\n\nMr Robert A. Hoey,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Reverend Father Lamontagne, Provincial of the Oblate Order in Manitoba, in which he calls my attention to the plight of the Indians of Berens River, Blood Vein and Little Grand Rapids. There is almost no hunting and very little fishing and the Indians are in the most destitute condition.\n\nMay I hope that you will ask your agent or your inspector to pay a visit to these reserves as soon as possible and, if conditions are found to be as stated, that you will send relief to these poor Indians.\n\nMr Boniface Guimont, the day school teacher at Little Grand Rapids, writes the following about the condition of the Indians in a letter which I have just received: \"I received only twelve boxes of biscuits last fall which were exhausted a long time ago, considering the amount of pupils I had. Moreover half of the biscuits were spoiled. Now the people are starving and it is not unusual to see the poor kids coming to school with empty stomachs. A person should see this to realize it, \"It's Terrible\". Would you not put in a good word for them and have the Department instruct the agent to send them help; little though it may be it will be a help before they can go out to catch muskrats. Right now there is no fur, and the store-keepers can't manage to feed them\".\n\nI have no doubt that if these conditions really exist, you will want to correct them immediately.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nyours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6239, file 524-5, part 1)\nOttawa, March 17th, 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a complaint originating from the Provincial of the Oblate Order in Manitoba in which it is stated that Mr. Boniface Guimont, the day school teacher at Little Grand Rapids, complains of the receipt last Fall of only twelve boxes of biscuits, one half of which were spoiled. I wish to point out in the first place that six hundred and fifty pounds biscuits were shipped for use at the school of which Mr. Guimont is the teacher, packed in twenty-six boxes and the Department would like to ascertain how it came about that Mr. Guimont only received twelve.\n\nThe Department also wishes to know whether you received a previous complaint from Mr. Guimont as to the condition of the biscuits as it is the first indication that the shipment consigned for use at that school was not satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare and Training.\n\nE. MacPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nSelkirk, Man.\nSelkirk, Man., March 22nd, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 17th instant relative to school biscuits supplied to the Little Grand Rapids R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nAs you are aware the school biscuits last year were greatly reduced from what was estimated for. On reports received from Const. C. Calcraft, R.C.M.P. Berens River detachment, to the effect that the R.C. School at Little Grand Rapids was only opened for teaching at odd times, we concluded, that it was only fair to make a more equitable distribution of the biscuits supplied. This was done Pro Rata, based on attendance at the two schools.\n\nWe also notified the Department on March 20th, 1936 regarding conditions at this school, as we had been advised on reliable authority that the school had only four and five pupils attending. Also that the school would be closed a week at a time.\n\nThis is the first complaint we have had regarding the biscuits for the R.C. School at Little Grand Rapids. We did, however, have a complaint from Luther Schuetze, teacher at the U.C. School at Little Grand Rapids, stating that the biscuits were mouldy, this we reported to the Department on January 20th, 1937.\n\nWill you kindly refer to our letter of July 16th, 1936, in which I stated that I did not approve of Boniface Guimond being transferred from Bloodvein to Little Grand Rapids.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

Plourde, O. M. I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nReverend and dear Father,\n\nTowards the later part of August, I journeyed to Little Grand Rapids to install Mr. Bellavance as teacher at the day school situated there. From that point, I went as I did last year to visit my friends the Indians of Poplar Hill. They are always in the same good dispositions. You know that they themselves asked for a day school last year. Naturally they had hopes to receive a favourable answer this year. I told them how their case stood: \"The Department refuses to grant you a school because you do not live on the reserve to which you belong (Pekangigan).\" The Indians answered this objection in the following way: \"If we stay away at times from our reserve, it is both to our advantage and to the advantage of the Department. The Department should easily understand this. During the whole summer, there is no one on our reserve to give us employment and to help us to earn our living. Fish being our principal source of food, sometimes in fact it is all we have to eat, the supply at Pekangigan would be insufficient for the whole band. We would then have to ask for help and the government would be obliged to send us food by airplane in order to prevent us from dying from famine. This would cost a great deal. That is why we do not stay on the reserve.\"\n\nI know the extreme poverty of this band of Indians and I can say that the above statement is absolutely true. I have often heard the agent say to the Indians living on other reserves, and Mr. McPherson himself has often and rightly spoken in the same vein, to go wherever they can find food. That is what the Poplar Hill band has done but on account of this the government refuses them school and their children, about thirty of school age, are growing up without any education. That is the reason why these good Indians have asked me to approach the government once more and to ask for a summer day school for at least three months, that is, June, July, August, the period of the year during which they live at Poplar Hill. During the balance of the year, they wander from place to place, trapping.\nWill you be good enough, Reverend Father, to present our request once more to the Department, if Ottawa will grant the rations asked for last year (a list of which you must have in your possession) and if these rations are forwarded early next spring along with the list of tools which I forwarded at the same time as I sent you the list of rations, I will build this school myself next summer with the help of the Indians. You must remember that last year I offered to take charge of the transportation of all materials plus the rations and tools free of charge with the help of the Indians.\n\nMr. Bellavance who is now teaching at Little Grand Rapids could take charge of this new school on condition that the Department pay him for nine months of teaching at the latter point and three months of teaching at this new school at Poplar Hill. Mr. Bellavance to whom I have mentioned this matter would accept this arrangement quite willingly. In this manner the children of the Indians of Poplar Hill would receive some education and their parents would be quite satisfied. If this plan is accepted, it will be understood, of course, that the new school would receive the ordinary rations so that the children could be given a noon meal.\n\nI beg to remain, Reverend and dear Father,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Grandpr\u00e9, O. M. I.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe building in which school is being taught at Little Grand Rapids, Manitoba, is an old log structure erected many years ago. It is at the present time in a most deplorable condition and was so poorly constructed that it is not worth repairing. A new building is no doubt very necessary.\n\nAs Little Grand Rapids is not easily accessible, it being about ninety miles north of Bloodvein, over a very rough territory, and as it cannot be reached in the summer except by canoe, the suggestion is made that all the material for this school should be bought next summer and stored at Bloodvein until the winter of 1939. It could then be transported to Little Grand Rapids over winter roads, and the new school could be built in the spring of 1940. That is the most economical way of proceeding.\n\nThe missionaries working in those far away districts have so much to contend with that the Department should recognize their devotion by granting these small schools wherever they are necessary. I have no doubt that your agent, Mr. McPherson, will endorse Father de Grandpr\u00e9's request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. J. Plourde, O. M. I.\nOttawa,\nNovember 8, 1938.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the Little Grand Rapids R.C. Indian Day School. I regret that it was not possible to include an item in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40 for a new school at this point. However, your request will be kept in mind and if we are given an opportunity of providing funds in the supplementary estimates for new day schools careful consideration will be given to the requirements at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nA request has been received for the erection of a new school to replace the present Little Grand Rapids R.C. day school. Our correspondent writes as follows:\n\n\"The building in which school is being taught at Little Grand Rapids, Manitoba, is an old log structure erected many years ago. It is at the present time in a most deplorable condition and was so poorly constructed that it is not worth repairing. A new building is no doubt very necessary.\n\n\"As Little Grand Rapids is not easily accessible, it being about ninety miles north of Bloodvein, over a very rough territory, and as it cannot be reached in the summer except by canoe, the suggestion is made that all the material for this school should be bought next summer and stored at Bloodvein until the winter of 1939. It could then be transported to Little Grand Rapids over winter roads, and the new school could be built in the spring of 1940. That is the most economical way of proceeding.\"\n\nThe Department is prepared to favourably consider purchase of the material required for the above building and it would be appreciated if you would let me have, as soon as possible, detailed information regarding the material required also the best method of transporting it to Bloodvein and the time of year at which it should be forwarded to that point.\n\nIn considering a new building for the Little Grand Rapids R.C. school the Department also wishes to make certain that the Little Grand Rapids U.C. school is in good condition as we want to deal fairly with both these schools.\n\nE. McPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nYou should, therefore, report fully on the present condition of the Little Grand Rapids U.C. school and if any repairs are required you should let me know giving an estimate of the cost. In the event of it being necessary to purchase materials full details should be given in order that purchase may be made by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nAn early reply to this letter will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSelkirk, Man., April 3rd, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant relative to the Little Grand Rapids R.C. and U.C. Indian Day Schools.\n\nWe have written to the school teachers at Little Grand Rapids for particulars, also on my first trip up the lake I shall find out the most economical manner in which to freight in supplies next winter. This year tractors were hauling freight to Favourable Lake, Ont. to the Berens River Mines and the tractor road ran quite close to the Little Grand Rapids Reserve. It may be possible to have the transportation company at Berens River handle this freight.\n\nAs soon as we have a reply from the teachers at Little Grand we shall forward their estimates regarding the schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nEM/FL\n\nIndian Affairs.

I hesitated before sending in such a long list of items, although these are needed for the physical and intellectual welfare of my pupils.\n\nYou may rest assured that all school supplies are well taken care of; and I make it a point to see to it that my pupils do not waste any of them.\n\nI beg to give some explanation regarding a few of the requisitioned articles:\n\nThe kettle is for cooking the beans and rice supplied for the pupils' mid-day meal.\n\nThe sugar is to sweeten the cocoa and rice, as plain boiled rice is not palatable.\n\nOne must bear in mind that the meal served at school is very often the only one the pupils receive during the whole day; therefore it is but reasonable that the food be made moderately appetizing.\n\nThe asbestos cement is for repairing the school stove which is cracked open at half a dozen places along its side, thus making it unsafe.\n\nThe barber set is for a dual purpose: to change the cave-dwelling appearance of my pupils' heads to a more modern one, and to\nimpose a quota on the hitherto unrestrained immigration of highly undesirable parasites.\n\nIn regard to the shipping of all merchandise and stationery for my school, may I suggest (if at all possible without interfering with the Department's wishes) that same be addressed to me, Rev.

This would mean that the accounts would be paid from our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41. On this understanding you may purchase the above-mentioned supplies if you consider they are required. Purchase should be made from a firm on the approved list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am informed that Mr. McPherson, your Agent in charge of the Little Grand Rapids Indian Reserve, told Mr. Bellavance, the teacher at the Little Grand Rapids R.C. Day School, that funds had been provided for the building of a Catholic school and that the lumber had been bought and would be shipped during the winter.\n\nIt seems that the lumber was actually bought and freighted to the Little Grand Rapids Reserve; but instead of being delivered to the Catholic school, it was delivered to the non-Catholic school. It is rumoured that this lumber will be used for the building of the non-Catholic Day School instead of the Catholic Day School as Mr. Bellavance was informed by your Agent.\n\nI would like to know if there has been a mistake in this matter and what steps will be taken to insure that the lumber bought for the Catholic school will be used for the purpose originally intended. The information which I have given you above was brought to me yesterday by Rev. Father de Grandpr\u00e9 who is in charge of the Berens River District, which also combines Bloodvein and Little Grand Rapids.\n\nI wish to say that the above inquiry is not intended as criticism of the Department. I simply wish to know what the Department intends to do for the R.C. Indian Day School at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6239, file 524-5, part 1)\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BAILEY\n\nThe attached account covers supplies required for the Little Grand Rapids R.C. Day School during the coming academic year. The Agent wished to have these supplies taken to the school by winter freight and so he was authorized to arrange for the purchase. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows:\n\n524-76-02-289 = $38.27\n12-489 = 1.43\n02-221 = 41.88\n09-628 = .22\n\n$81.80\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. R.A.

If 150 lbs. were supplied at $3.35 cwt., the correct extent would be $5.03 whereas $8.38 (the amount charged) is the extension for 250 lbs.\n\nI would suggest that this discrepancy be investigated and an amended voucher secured from the Codville Company, following receipt of which, we will be pleased to issue purchase order.\n\nW.M.

This week Mr. Street intends repairing and fixing up the protestant school.\n\nI would like to make a suggestion that this winter logs be taken out to build two new schools. There is at present time on the reserve nearly enough lumber and material, provided logs where used to build both schools, which was shipped in last winter by tractor it would require very little additional material to make both schools. The condition of both these schools is such that they should be replaced by new ones next summer especially for the health of the children.\n\nW.H.G.

Both should be replaced and as I have already written to you about this matter, I hope that the necessary amount has been included in the coming estimates.\n\nThe last report I have from Reverend Father de Grandpr\u00e9, O.M.I., Missionary in charge of Little Grand Rapids, shows 38 children, 18 boys and 20 girls, attending this school. The building contemplated should, therefore, be large enough for about 50 children and the teachers' residence should be so constructed and furnished as to make the living in that far-off country as agreeable as possible.\n\nReverend Father de Grandpr\u00e9 has again written to me about this matter and I would like to have something in writing that I could forward to him. It will serve as an encouragement in the very difficult task that he is performing, in that faraway country.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 6th December, 1945.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the request for a new school and teacher's residence at Little Grand Rapids. In preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1946-47 we are including an item for the erection of the building requested. However, I am not in a position at the present time to state definitely whether this item will be allowed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.O.

Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nYou will recall the conversations we had re the above project. When I was last in Winnipeg, I approached the Brown Rutherford Lumber Co., to find out if they could supply the lumber this year, for this project and was informed that they could do so, at about $60, or $65. per thousand. I have had a rough sketch of the buildings prepared, one for the house and the other for the school.\n\nThe only means of transportation is from Winnipeg to Berens River by boat and then over the winter road from Berens River to Little Grand Rapids, by caterpillar tractors. The price for the lumber submitted about by Brown Rutherford is f.o.b. Winnipeg and the freight from Winnipeg to Berens River and from Berens River to Little Grand Rapids would be extra. That from Winnipeg to Berens River is the ordinary rate on the Selkirk Navigation Company boats, but from Berens River to Little Grand Rapids is a little higher because of the mode of transportation.\n\nThe lumber and other materials for the school are listed below:\n\n1. 80 bags of cement\n2. 62 pieces, 2\" x 10\" x 12' - 1240 sq. ft.\n3. Shiplap for floor 24 x 36 - 1000 sq. ft.\n4. Flooring 24 x 36 - 1200 sq. ft.\n5. Walls 2 x 6 x 10-150 pieces - 1500 sq. ft.\n6. Shiplap - 3000 sq. ft.\n7. Siding - 1600 sq. ft.\n8.

It is noted that you have been unable to obtain quotations from several firms including Brown and Rutherford Limited.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I., interviewed Mr. Brown in Winnipeg about six weeks ago and at that time Mr. Brown intimated to him that there was such a heavy demand for building material that the firm was not answering requests for quotations as they could sell all material they obtained. However, Mr. Brown told Father Plourde that in view of the long association of the Oblate Order with the firm of Brown & Rutherford, they would be prepared to supply the materials for the Little Grand Rapids School even though it meant disappointing other customers.\n\nIt is pointed out in memorandum of September 12th, that the material should be purchased this year if at all possible so that the erection of the building can be accomplished during the summer of 1942. If purchase is delayed until next spring it will probably mean that the building could not be erected before 1943. With the above in mind, it is recommended an order be sent immediately to Brown & Rutherford. Judging from the reputation of the firm as outlined by Father Plourde, it is felt that they will not overcharge.\n\nDirector,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lavigne, O.M.I., Provincial of the Oblate Order, St. Boniface, Manitoba, has requested he be given permission to purchase the items mentioned on our requisition of Sept. 12th.\n\nIt is realized the materials required are in short supply and no firm handles all of the items. Father Lavigne thought he could purchase the majority of the items by securing some from different firms as and when available and could arrange for their shipment to the site of the proposed school by winter freight.\n\nFunds for the erection of this school are available in the current year's appropriations and we would like to purchase the materials if at all possible. May I also refer you to the last paragraph of my memorandum of Sept. 27th in which it is pointed out the erection of this school in 1947 depends upon securing materials required at the earliest possible date.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would approve our accepting the offer of Father Lavigne.\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hughes,\nIn charge, Indian Agency Office,\nSelkirk, Manitoba.\n\nLittle Grand Rapids, R. C.\nIndian Day School.\n\nAfter considerable difficulty we have been able to purchase through the Reverend Father M. Lavigne, C.M.I., St. Boniface, Man., the necessary materials for the erection of a school and teacherage at Little Grand Rapids. These supplies are being delivered by tractor now and this school will be erected by the Church concerned during the next summer.\n\nYour report on your trip to this reserve on February 18 and 19 mentions these building materials being shipped in and it is felt that the above will clarify the situation for you.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nCopy sent to Inspector Hamilton\nOttawa, 12 September 1946.\n\nMemorandum:-\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Little Grand Rapids R.C. Day School No. 524\n\nIn the current year's appropriation provision was made for the erection of a new school at Little Grand Rapids Reserve. If the material can be purchased this year the school can be erected next year. Otherwise, the erection of the school would be delayed until 1948.\n\nWe are advised that Brown and Rutherford Lumber Dealers, Winnipeg, Manitoba, have all or nearly all of the items mentioned on this requisition. The last boat for Berens River leaves Winnipeg on October 15th and consequently the order should be placed at the earliest possible date in order to enable the Company to ship the items.\n\nThe coding on this order is as follows: - 524-76-13-493.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, 27 September 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Building Material for School at Little Grand Rapids, Manitoba\n\nWe are in receipt of your memorandum of September 26th with reference to our requisition of September 12th. It is noted that you have been unable to obtain quotations from several firms including Brown and Rutherford Limited.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I., interviewed Mr. Brown in Winnipeg about six weeks ago and at that time Mr. Brown intimated to him that there was such a heavy demand for building material that the firm was not answering requests for quotations as they could sell all material they obtained. However, Mr. Brown told Father Plourde that in view of the long association of the Oblate Order with the firm of Brown & Rutherford, they would be prepared to supply the materials for the Little Grand Rapids School even though it meant disappointing other customers.\n\nIt is pointed out in memorandum of September 12th, that the material should be purchased this year if at all possible so that the erection of the building can be accomplished during the summer of 1942. If purchase is delayed until next spring it will probably mean that the building could not be erected before 1943. With the above in mind, it is recommended an order be sent immediately to Brown & Rutherford. Judging from the reputation of the firm as outlined by Father Plourde, it is felt that they will not overcharge.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 1 November 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Building Material for Erection of School on Little Grand Rapids Rapids I.A.B., File 125-30-5 W.T. 1\n\nWe have received your memorandum of Oct. 7th in connection with the above.\n\nHowever, Rev. M. Lavigne, O.M.I., Provincial of the Oblate Order, St. Boniface, Manitoba, has requested he be given permission to purchase the items mentioned on our requisition of Sept. 12th.\n\nIt is realized the materials required are in short supply and no firm handles all of the items. Father Lavigne thought he could purchase the majority of the items by securing some from different firms as and when available and could arrange for their shipment to the site of the proposed school by winter freight.\n\nFunds for the erection of this school are available in the current year's appropriations and we would like to purchase the materials if at all possible. May I also refer you to the last paragraph of my memorandum of Sept. 27th in which it is pointed out the erection of this school in 1947 depends upon securing materials required at the earliest possible date.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would approve our accepting the offer of Father Lavigne.\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs.

Olson, Superintendent, Clandeboye Agency, dated May 31st, 1948. Original on file 125-12-1\n\nFather De Grandpre approved R.C. day school being in session this summer having in mind the change of school term per previous correspondence. He is not quite sure how good the attendance will be with half the children no obliged to attend. In other words while U.C. Day School children are free to roam around pending construction of U.C. school there may be some difficulty in getting regular attendance for R.C. children. In any event it will not be fair to judge our results of attendance this summer as very conclusive for the change in term.\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n*Date: May 8th 1948*\n\nFor Mr. John's R.C.

Day School, I wired Superintendent Olson and have received the following reply:\n\n\"Furnishings Ordered Eaton's Contract Dept., Winnipeg but can't be delivered except by tractor train late January next\".\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Ave., East,\nOttawa.\n\nPP/HM.\nExtract from Regional Supervisor Davis' Report of September 25th.\n\nLittle Grand Rapids Day School R.C.\n\nThis school was built a year ago and the teacher's residence and the school are separate buildings. They are both fine buildings with insulated brick siding and very nice and clean.\n\nThis school is badly in need of more blackboards and rearranging, as the blackboards are on the small side of the building, near the cellar entrance. Large blackboards should be purchased and the children's desks turned around facing the other way, enabling them to get full advantage of the light. The Brother here also teaches some manual training which is carried on in a separate building, built by the church for this purpose.\n\nThe school has no furnace and I would recommend that one be shipped in this winter and installed. Mr. Olson will be taking this matter up with you at a later date.

This letter was not even acknowledged and sometime later the Department was advised that incompetent Indian in the person of John Peter Anderson had been placed in charge. To this appointment a number of the Indians objected and it is thought with good cause, provided the information sent the Department from two sources is correct.\n\nArchdeacon Phair was again written to on the 25th ultimo and as in the case of the first letter no reply has been received.\n\nAs Your Grace is aware the gradual improvement of these schools as occasion offers is the earnest desire of the Department, but success cannot be hoped for without the co-operation of the Church authorities, who, under the existing arrangements, are given the privilege of nominating teachers.\n\nThere may be satisfactory reasons why Archdeacon Phair\n\nMost Rev.

Deputy and Secretary.\nDec. 17, 1910.\n\nDear Mr. Maclean:\n\nArchdeacon Phair has handed me your letter of Nov. 25th, re the appointment of Mr. J. P. Anderson to the school at Sandy Bay. On November 12th, I had a letter from the Rev. George Bruce, in which he stated that the chief at Sandy Bay had asked for the appointment of Mr. Anderson as teacher and also enclosed a list of the names of those who approved of his appointment.\n\nI know nothing of the man and have been consequently unable to give my approval of his appointment, but I have informed Mr. Bruce of the attitude of the Department in regard to it. This is all I can do at present. The appointment, I understand, is only a temporary one, until some more competent teacher can be secured. I may say that we find it quite impossible to secure competent teachers at the salary offered by the Indian Department. Unless the salary is considerably raised, it is hopeless to think of securing teachers to fill these schools.\n\nI enclose a petition which has come from the Dog Creek Indians for an additional school at that point, together with a list of the children who would be likely to attend it. Kindly let me know what action the Department is likely to take in regard to this. The whole question of the services of Day School teachers should be taken up. Can you kindly let me know whether any steps are being taken towards establishing a school at the new reserve at Fisher River?\n\nWith kind regards, I am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nJ. D.

It will be better for the future to correspond with me direct in regard to school matters.\n\nI had not heard that the Department had consented to raise the salary to $500. I shall at once make enquiries as to the possibility of securing a teacher at that amount, but it is very doubtful whether I can obtain one who is competent, even at that figure. Common day schools in Manitoba have raised the salary of teachers to $600 and $700 a year and there is a great dearth of suitable ones at the present time. However, I will do my best to secure somebody. In the meantime, what had better be done in regard to John Peter Anderson. If the Department disapproves of him, as it is clear from your letter, he had better be notified at once to sever his connection with the school. Mr. Bruce sent me a long list of names of those who profess to be favorable to his taking up the work, but I have no desire to press him upon the Department if he is unsuitable, as I know nothing at all about him.\n\nWith kind regards, I am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Sec.,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 28, 1910.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 20th instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Little Saskatchewan day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department trusts that Your Grace will be able to secure the services of an efficient teacher for this school. The difficulties of the situation are recognized and even if a teacher with professional training cannot be induced to take this position it is thought at least that some person interested in Indian work and competent to teach the children may be secured. The Department considers it well in the meantime to leave Mr. Anderson in charge for a few months pending the results of Your Grace's inquiries.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6240, file 525-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nWhile at the Fairford reserve in February last, Philip Anderson, the chief of the Little Saskatchewan band came to see me about the school. From what he told me, the Rev. Mr. Bruce got a letter from Archbishop Matheson asking him to try and get a teacher for their school, in the meantime, till he could get a qualified teacher. They succeeded in getting Peter Anderson, an ex-pupil of the Fairford school and he taught from the middle of October till the Christmas holidays and did not open up in January as he was informed by Mr Logan that he would not be paid, and he had not received any pay at the time of my visit. As the Chief was very anxious to have school opened, after seeing Mr Bruce about Peter Anderson's qualifications, I told the Chief that he had better start Anderson again, and keep him teaching till the Department sent a properly qualified teacher. The Chief and Councillors are very anxious to have a good teacher sent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, March 21, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in reference to the Little Saskatchewan School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in December, last, the Department communicated with His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land and requested him to nominate a qualified teacher for this school at his earliest convenience. His Grace was informed that Mr. Anderson might remain in charge pending the result of his inquiries. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the Church will be able to nominate a competent teacher at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nStonewall, Man.\nOttawa, March 22, 1911.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of December 28th, last, and to ask Your Grace what steps, if any, have been taken to secure a competent teacher for the Little Saskatchewan School.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Peter Anderson is an Indian, a member of Fairford band, and is illiterate, as one can hardly understand a letter written by him. He could never make out a quarterly school return.\n\nI shall be very pleased to hear if or not he has been appointed to the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, March 27, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in reference to the appointment of Peter Anderson as teacher of the Little Saskatchewan School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department, while realizing that Anderson is not altogether fitted for the position, consented to his remaining in charge until such time as a permanent, qualified teacher can be obtained. The authorities of the Church of England are at present endeavoring to secure a qualified teacher and it is hoped that they will be able to get one at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

I am extremely sorry to say that I have not been able to procure a suitable teacher for the Little Saskatchewan school. As I stated in my other letters, teachers are very scarce in the west and large salaries are being offered. I will continue my efforts but I am not very hopeful of success.

I may say that in some of our day schools we have teachers who, although they have not had the advantage of professional training, are nevertheless remarkably successful in the Indian work; on the other hand one with some special training is generally to be preferred.\n\nI trust that Your Grace will be able at an early date to nominate some suitable person to replace Anderson at the Little Saskatchewan school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

This will show you the difficulties we are up against on these Reserves. There is the same difference of opinion at Fairford. Mr. Bruce and his friends are on one side and there is a strong party against them. It is hard to say what is the best but my view is that the Dept. ought to be firm and do what is best for the Indians irrespective of little cliques. In the past, the Agents have pandered too much to local feelings and have made too many promises which could not be implemented by the Dept.

In letter of the 19th ultimo Your Grace asks what salary the Department intends to offer for a teacher at Sandy Bay (Lake St. Martin).\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is the first intimation the Department has had of any change. I may inform Your Grace that a very satisfactory report on Mr. Pavel's work for the past year was recently received. This report showed a decided improvement in the standing of the children in their class-room work and, as Your Grace may be aware, Mr. Pavel has always maintained a splendid attendance. In view of these facts the Department does not consider it would be advisable to entertain the question of a change at the present time.\n\nThe communications addressed to Your Grace are returned herewith, as requested.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMost Rev.

You wrote me about having a change there on account of the incompetency of Mr. Anderson. No complaint has ever been made in regard to Mr. Favel. When you wrote me about Mr. Anderson I communicated with the Chief without making any statement of your wishes but simply with a view to ascertaining the opinions of the tribe.

For two reasons I have been unable to procure a teacher for that school. In the first place the band appear to be divided as to whether they want a new teacher or whether they wish to retain Anderson. At one time they wrote me that they desire a change and within a few days they retract what they have written. When the chief and councillors were in Winnipeg in July I asked on their return to summon a meeting and let me know what they really wanted. They have never done so. In the second place there is no place at Little Saskatchewan for the teacher to live. For these reasons I have been unable to do anything but I am writing to the Chief today about the matter and will let you know what reply he gives. Even when the two difficulties which I have referred to have been removed, I am not very hopeful of securing a competent teacher. The salary offered is too small. A short time ago I advertised for teachers for our Indian Schools at the Sioux Mission etc. but no one would entertain the offer after the salary was mentioned. The fact is, the Department will have to offer more to these teachers or the schools will remain vacant. I am hoping to be in Ottawa in Apr 1 and will be glad to go into these and other matters with you. Yours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Is it possible for the Department to offer him more? He is a friend of the two very good men whom we have now at the two Schools at Peguis. Kindly let me know what you can do. Rupert Bruce is still in charge of the School at Upper Fairford though his father has retired from the Mission and a new man has been placed in charge, Rev. T.H. Dobbs, formerly of Shell River. What about the effort to establish an improved Day School at Fairford? You will remember that you were to look into it before the Estimates were made up. Now that Mr. Bruce is not there I believe that the Indians can be persuaded to accept an Improved School particularly if they are told definitely that the Department has no intention of giving them a Boarding School. The trouble in the past has been that they were always given to understand by the Agents that the Department was ready to give the Boarding School but that the Bishop held it back. They even were given the impression that my predecessor had used for his own purposes the $28,500 voted by the Government for the purpose in Mr. Sifton's time. As I stated in a former letter, I am willing to accompany any one whom the Dept. decides to send and use my influence with the Band.\n\nWishing you all the blessings of this Season, I am very sincerely yours,\n\nD.C.

If the parents would put in a supply of wood for the school and otherwise help where necessary?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Act Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 7th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, regarding the admission of a number of children of white parents to the classroom privileges at the Little Saskatchewan Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will consent to the attendance of these children on condition that there is sufficient accommodation for them in the classroom and that they will not interfere with the teaching of the Indian children, and, also, provided the teacher is willing to accept and teach them. Their names, however, are not to appear on the teacher's quarterly returns.

The attendance is good and a worthwhile activity can be built up on this reserve. The Public School Inspector has reported that Mr. Favellie, the teacher, is making no progress and it appears that during the incumbency of this man there can be little improvement.

I should be pleased if you would inform Mr. Favelle that the Department is grateful for his long and faithful service, but it is considered advisable in the best interests of the work to retire him as from the 30th proximo. The Ven. Archdeacon Thomas also has been asked to inform Mr. Favelle and the Church authorities will nominate in due course a fully qualified successor.\n\nAs teachers of Indian day schools are partly church appointees and partly government employees, it is extremely difficult to arrange for a retiring allowance or pension. However, if you feel that injustice will be done in the case of Mr. Favelle if the Department does not make a strong effort in this connection, you may request him to make an application for such allowance or pension and to give us a brief history of his career as a teacher at Indian day schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th instant, regarding my intention to retire from the work after serving for another year, which event would have brought me to my fourth year of continuous labor amongst the Indian peoples, and children in general\u2014a matter which was very dear to my heart, and now, I regret that it cannot be so, owing to prevailing circumstances, which I am aware cannot be helped. However, to work at matters from different points of view, I would ask the department the least favor if they are unable to have me nominated for another year, would they at least be graciously pleased to give me employment until the end of September quarter? When I would be in a position to turn over the work without any great haste, and assured that throughout all the years, I have tried my best to do my duty, though very often handicapped in many ways. It is now almost forty years since I was appointed by the late Inspector E. McCall to take charge of the Protestant day school on the Esaua River Reserve, after spending some years there where there were two schools\u2014Protestant and Roman. The Roman Catholic being greatly in the majority, it was thought advisable to transfer me to the Stone River School; where I found the people living in Reddenon, in its darkest form. I can assure you, I had some work to do, to counteract their beliefs as to the \"Wendigo,\" who they claimed roamed about the place, in the early springings. During whom he may discover I spent ten years with those Indians, and I am thankful...\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 13th May last No. I26-8-1.\n\nI beg to enclose you a communication I received from Mr. J.B. Favell outlining his work for the last 39 years.\n\nIf the appointment is not made for a successor to Mr. Favell, I would suggest Mr. Favell be allowed to teach the September quarter, and on his retirement a monthly allowance be made for him.

Fairford operating under most favorable conditions still holds the lead, but it is being overtaken by Lake St. Martin School, though Mr. Garwood works alone there with scanty equipment, unfavorable environment and a heavy ungraded school. All are doing well, however. Mr. Wheeldon, of Little Saskatchewan, has done much more efficient work this year and the school shows substantial progress.\nLITTLE SASKATCHEWAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis is also a log school of similar type to the one on Lake St. Martin and is in a good state of repair. The school is taught by Mr. Albert Wheaton. There are 29 children on the register and at the time of my visit there were 21 present. The work in the classroom was fair, an improvement, I believe, over last year. Mr. Wheaton is doing fair work in the school here, but he has not the energy and the go that Mr. Garwood has. A mid-day meal is also served at this school, consisting of about the same substance as at the other school already mentioned.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6240, file 525-1, part 1)\nLITTLE SASKATCHEWAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis is taught by Mr. Albert Wheadon. The school is of log construction, and the teacher's residence a frame bungalow which was built last summer, and is similar to the one at Lake St. Martin. There was also an addition built to the school last summer as a children's dining-room, which is very satisfactory. Since my last visit there the school grounds have all been fenced in. A plot has been broken for a garden which is looked after by the children and the vegetables grown are used in the midday meal. As I was on the reserve Saturday and Sunday I did not have an opportunity to inspect the classroom, but from what I gathered, Mr. Wheadon is getting very good results, and the average attendance is about 17, which I think is fair, as there are only about 21 children on the register. There are quite a number of small children who will soon be of school age. Mr. Inspector Plewis informed me that the work was satisfactory at this school. I would be very pleased if the Department could see its way clear to give Mr. Wheadon an increase in salary as well as Mr. Garwood, as he has had no recognition from the Department since he started.

A list is attached hereto showing the children of school age. All the people shown on the list are permanent residents at the Hatchery with the exception of Chas. Sumner. This Indian is resident during the winter months. The reserve is located on Lake Winnipeg at the mouth of the Dauphin River. It is a fishing station, the Provincial Government using the river as a Whitefish spawn fishing station during the fall run of the Whitefish. It is approximately 50 miles from the nearest railroad station\u2014Gypsumville\u2014the roads being impassible during the summer months, small boats being used on the Dauphin River. This point can also be approached from Selkirk, the Government boat making it a point of call two or three times a year. During the winter months it is a point of call for teams freighting fish from the lake, and during the commercial fishing season\u2014which commences January 1st until the close March 20th\u2014the Indian fishermen from Fairford, Little Saskatchewan and Lake St. Martin reserves, camp there with their families. The few residents on the reserve during the summer months does not warrant the building of a day school. During the winter season, a number of school children are on the reserve with their parents. Of recent years the number has decreased, as fishing has not been so good, and Indians have arranged with people living on the Lake Reserves to take care of their children, so that they could attend the school.\n\nThe permanent residents of the Hatchery are \"Shakers\". They have erected a church from collections amongst themselves and transient Indians, a member of the Band Holds service. During the winter this reserve is a hotbed of vice, and efforts have been made to break up their desire for dances. It is my opinion that the desire for a day\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6240)\n\nFile 525-1, part 1\nManitowapah Agency - Little Saskatchewan Day School - Church of England - General Administration. 1895 - 1935\n\nFile 525-3, part 1\nManitowapah Agency - Little Saskatchewan Day School - Church of England - Teachers' Salaries. 1925 - 1946\n\nFile 525-5, part 2\nManitowapah Agency - Little Saskatchewan Day School - Church of England - Building Maintenance (School plans) - Supplies - Accounts. 1930 - 1938\n\nFile 525-5, part 3\nManitowapah Agency - Little Saskatchewan Day School - Church of England - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1939 - 1949\n\nFile 525-8, part 1\nManitowapah Agency - Little Saskatchewan Day School - Church of England - Teachers' Residence. 1927 - 1948\n\n... 2\nLittle Saskatchewan R\nvia Gypsumville P.O.\n20/2/25 Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn regard to your cheque no 5463 for $112.50.

In either event, you should state the size of the site you consider necessary and the general condition of the land, viz: whether level or sloping. You should also mention the direction in which you consider the building should face.\n\n(3) Will it be necessary to provide living quarters for the teacher, in connection with the School?\n\n(4) Can drinking water be easily obtained on the site recommended by you?\n\n(5) Would you recommend construction by contract or by day labour?\n\n(6) Do you consider a full basement advisable?\nIn addition to the information requested above, you should also give any particulars that would assist the Department in planning the building. It is hoped that your reply will be both detailed and definite, in order that further correspondence will not be necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. J. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nSir,\n\nRe 126-8-5.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo re the building of a new one room school on the Little Saskatchewan Reserve. In reply to this letter I beg to submit the following information:\n\nNo.1. Provision should be made for 35 children.\n\nNo.2. Site is available on the reserve adjacent to the site of the old school now being used. The land is level. The school should be faced to the road which runs north and south. About two acres of school lands are now fenced.\n\nNo.3. A teacherage was built on the school site ten years ago. This is in excellent repair.\n\nNo.4. Drinking water has always been obtained from Lake St. Martin. A distance of approximately 400 yards to the shore line. I am doubtful if good drinking water could be obtained by sinking a well. A shallow well would only give surface water, and a deep well alkali water.\n\nNo.5. I would recommend the job be done by contract, Indians to be employed as helpers etc.\n\nNo.6. I would strongly recommend a full basement with a furnace for heating purposes. This gives room for storage and does away with a heater in the centre of the schoolroom floor. It is also less dangerous than the stove method of heating, and gives more room in the schoolroom.\n\nThe old school-house is built of logs. A log building is a continual nuisance. During the winter the slamming of the door loosens the chinking and it is continually dropping out causing replacements and a cold school. It also seems impossible to make whitewash stick to logs and this is for ever peeling.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6240, file 525-5, part 2)\never\n\nPeeling off leaving the floor in an unswept condition. I would strongly suggest that the new school be of frame construction. A midday meal is provided for the pupils from November to April and I also suggest that provision be made to accommodate the pupils in the basement during the eating of the meal.\n\nThere is sufficient wood fuel for some years to come and a wood furnace should be installed.\n\nI might state that the site is not owned by the Department, and I am very doubtful if the Indians of this reserve would give the Department title.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6240, file 525-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nOttawa, December 2, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of November 18th, with reference to the proposed new school on the Little Saskatchewan Reserve. In Paragraph No. 2 of your letter, you state that \"site is available on the Reserve adjacent to the site of the old school now being used\", but in the last paragraph of your letter you state that \"the site is not owned by the Department and I am very doubtful if the Indians of this Reserve would give the Department title\".\n\nThese two statements appear contradictory and I would appreciate your advising the size of the site on which the present school is located and if it would be possible to erect a new school on this site.\n\nYou might also give a description of the nature of the soil as this information is required in order to decide if a basement could be provided at a reasonable cost.\n\nIn the event of our deciding to erect the school by day labour, you should let me know the nearest railway point to the school and the distance of this railway station from the school. What would it cost per day to hire trucks to transport the material from the station to the school site.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nSir,\n\nRe: 126-8-5.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, and wish to advise that the fenced school plot is approximately two acres. It would be possible to erect the new school on the old school site, but I would not recommend it as the old school is too close to the main road. I would suggest that the new school be built about 30 yards east of the old school. I attach a diagram showing the fenced plot.\n\nThe soil is of a sandy nature for about 8 inches, very stoney, the subsoil, \"hardpan\". This \"hardpan\" is of the usual texture found in the Inter-lake district, and borders on cement. In asking for a basement to the school, I am certain this form of construction would be the cheaper in the long-run.\n\nSt. Martin is the nearest railway point. Gypsumville the most convenient from a road standpoint. The haul from Gypsumville would be approximately ten miles. There are no trucks in the district and at this time I am not able to give an estimate of the cost of transporting materials. I believe hauling could be done cheaper by hiring Indian teams. It would also give the Indians of the three Lake Reserves work. Another point in favour of having shipments sent to Gypsumville, is that there is a resident R.R.Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nLittle Saskatchewan Reserve,\nGypsumville, Manitoba,\nDecember 3rd, 1937.\n\nTo\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nIn account with Mrs. Robt.

Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n11th April, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nI am forwarding herewith copy of a memorandum from our Chief Engineer asking for site plans showing the approximate locations of buildings in the following cases:\n\nMetagami I.R., Ontario - Day School & Teachers Residence.\nCaughnawaga I.R., Quebec - Addition to Day School.\nLittle Saskatchewan I.R., Manitoba - Day School.\nGold Lake I.R., Saskatchewan - Farm Instructor's House.\nBella Bella I.R., British Columbia - Day School & Teacher's Residence.\n\nIt is noted that in cases where several reserves come under one agency it is considered advisable for the correct plans to be forwarded to the respective agents for the marking of building locations.\n\nJ. M. Wardle,\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nApril 25, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose a plan of the Little Saskatchewan Indian Reserve. Please mark in red ink the exact location of the proposed new Day School on this Reserve. This information is required by the Surveys and Engineering Branch and the plan should be returned to me as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe - Proposed Day School, Little Saskatchewan Indian Reserve, Manitoba.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of the 30th ultimo regarding the cost of the above school.\n\nThe previous estimate of $5,700.00 was based on preliminary sketch plans and costs of similar work with slight increase to cover advance in cost of materials and wages. Since then in working out the detail drawings some economies have been possible and it is estimated that this structure can be built for about $5000.00.\n\nIn regard to the second paragraph of your letter regarding only $3,500.00 being listed for the building in the breakdown of the item of $56,000.00 our understanding is that the tentative allocation of funds was made by the Indian Affairs Branch for their 1938-39 Estimates without regard in some cases to the amount necessary to provide accommodation to meet their requirements. It is suggested that the Indian Affairs Branch after consultation with our officers furnish a list giving reallocation of funds in line with school requirements.\n\nThe school is of simple design and construction and embodies the accommodation and requirements asked by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ. M.

Please let me know if it is necessary to supply these at the present time. Our funds are extremely limited and unless the school can be operated without these desks it is doubtful if funds can be found.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Inspector Hamilton's report on the Little Saskatchewan Indian Day School dated November 18, 1938:\n\nThe old school is still in use, but the new building is practically ready for occupation. This is the finest day school I have seen, either on a reserve or in a white, rural district. The building should be supplied with new seats and desks, teacher's desk, teacher's chair and two plain chairs. The equipment from the old school is most unsuitable, and in fact, practically worn out. I understand a list of equipment needed is being supplied by the teacher. A table and benches are also needed for the basement, where the noon lunch will be served.\n\n(Sgd.) A. G.

In official letter dated October 25, 1937, Indian Agent Waite was asked to submit for departmental consideration the information ordinarily requested from Indian agents with respect to the construction of such buildings. In reply the Indian Agent stated:\n\n1. Provision should be made for 35 children.\n\n2. A site is available on the reserve adjacent to the site of the old school now being used.\n\n3. A teacherage was built on the school site 10 years ago and is in excellent repair.\n\n4. Drinking water can be obtained from Lake St. Martin, a distance of approximately 400 yards.\n\n5. I would recommend that the job be done by contract, Indians to be employed as helpers, etc.\n\n6. I would strongly recommend a full basement with a furnace for heating purposes. This gives room for storage and does away with a heater in the centre of the schoolroom floor. It is also less dangerous than the stove.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6240, file 525-5, part 3)\nstove method of heating and gives more room in the classroom.\n\n7. A midday meal is provided for the pupils from November to April, and I recommend that provision be made to accommodate the pupils in the basement during the serving and eating of this meal\".\n\nIt has been the policy of the Department in recent years to provide full basement accommodation at Indian day schools. Such accommodation is an absolute necessity if vocational instruction is to form part of the regular course of study provided. Basement accommodation is also necessary where noonday lunches are provided.\n\nThe construction of this school, with accommodation for 36 pupils, was undertaken by the Surveys and Engineering Branch and the work was performed by contract. Mr. Wardle, in a report dated January 13, 1929, states:\n\n\"The total amount paid the contractor is $4,761. There will be in addition certain miscellaneous departmental expenditures chargeable to the work. Final figures will be given you in due course\".\n\nThese final figures have not been submitted to this Branch. It will be noted, however, that the cost compares very favourably with the cost of Indian day schools constructed in recent years.\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in his report dated November 22, 1929, states:\n\n\"I was very favourably impressed with the new building you have erected during the course of the summer at Little Saskatchewan reserve, which in my judgment is certainly a credit to your Department\".\nThe last census indicates that there is an Indian population at the Little Saskatchewan reserve of 184 with 25 Indian children under 7 years old and 30 children between the ages of 7 and 16.\n\nI am sending forward herewith the photographs of the school received by this Branch, which I should like returned at your convenience.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe - Indian Day School,\nLittle Saskatchewan Indian Reserve, Manitoba.\n\nThe Chief Engineer advises me that the total cost of the above project, under Vote 168, is $4,760.78.\n\nDirector.\n**STATEMENT**\n\n*Nov. 26*\n\n*M.

I note that you suggest shingle stain. Recently the Department remodelled a school in Quebec and the following mixture was used instead of shingle stain:\n\n1 Pint of Japan drier\n6 Lbs. of ochre (green or red)\n3 Gals. of used cylinder oil\n(Let oil rest in order to clear)\n\nMultiply these proportions by 4 and add \u00bd gal. linseed oil.\nMix well and let stand for a day.\n\nA quantity of the mixture mentioned can be obtained at a great deal less cost than the shingle stain and we have found by experience that it is more durable.\nYou may purchase 100 feet of lumber for repairs, 1 sheet of wall board and 2 brushes.\n\nR.A.

I am pleased to inform you that funds are now available for this purpose and you may proceed with the work. You estimated the cost to be approximately $2,200 and I should be glad to learn that the expense will not be more than this amount. I regret there are no funds this year for a similar building activity at the Lake St. Martin Indian Day School.\n\nIt has been suggested that a kitchen for the preparation of the pupils' midday meal be provided at the Little Saskatchewan School. Please look into the advisability of providing such a room in the new building. If it can be included without materially adding to the cost and you consider it necessary, you should make arrangements.\n\nI understand that a porch should be added to the classroom at this school and that the playground and garden should be fenced. If you are satisfied that these improvements are required, you may proceed with the work.\n\nPlease be guided by general instructions in Dr. Scott's 1-1-5 of the 6th instant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6240, file 525-8, part 1)\nOttawa, June 11, 1927.\n\nW. M.

McLEAN.\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Wheaden, teacher of the Indian Day School on the Little Saskatchewan Reserve, Portage Agency, called last week re the need of a bed, spring and mattress.\n\nMr. Wheaden pointed out that they have their own bedroom furnished but when the Nurse arrives or any other official they are obliged to give up their room and then must use cots; which is inconvenient and uncomfortable. The Nurse remains for eight or ten days each month; consequently there is a real need for a spare bed. I have been accommodated at this same home and never knew until now I had the only bed.\n\nI would recommend a complete bed unit be supplied. Batons state this will cost from $25.00 to $30.00. The bedding companies have passed their quota and if secured from them a priority rating is required.\n\nI would like authority to make the purchase at once from the T.Eaton Company and will endeavour not to exceed $30.00. The size required is a 4 ft. bed, complete with high riser spring and well-constructed cotton filled mattress.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

Taylor, teacher of the Moose Lake School, to take effect at the close of the current quarter and suggesting that owing to the neglect of the Indians in regard to school matters generally, this school should remain closed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the average attendance as given in the Returns from this school would not justify the Department in carrying out this suggestion and steps should be taken to secure the services of a new teacher after the summer holidays, and if the Indians will supply the necessary firewood for the school it may be purchased and the cost deducted from their annuity money.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Sect: Genl:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nH. McColl, Esq:\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward here\u2014without separate cover\u2014Lumberland & Moose Lake School returns for Dec. Qr. 1896.\n\nRegarding the latter I may state that the teacher Mr. Wm. Moore was chosen by the L.M.S. last fall to hold the position during the winter at Moose Lake.\n\nThe box of biscuits noted by the teacher as having been given to Moses Martin, was given by me at the Annual Payments to insure Samuel Martin & was the second boy he received. It will be observed that the teacher has issued biscuits for scrubbing the school. This was before your letter on the subject was received. Some of these biscuits he has charged to his own account but I consider it would be unjust to make him pay for them.\n\nThe \"girls over age\" to whom he issued biscuits, probably attended school for a very short time only, & were therefore not entered.\n\nE. Mc. Doll, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Affairs,\nWinnipeg.\nentered on the Return, though they certainly should have been.\n\nRegarding the school being open on Saturdays, I feel to state that I do not remember having instructed Mr. Morris to this effect, but still, might have done so, as the quarter was already so far advanced when he was appointed, and though he proceeded as quickly as possible to his post, he has not been able to complete the number of days required. The biscuits issued on Saturdays (3\u00bd lbs.) are further separately from the 150\u00bd lbs. issued during the quarter; while it would appear that they are already included in that amount, unless indeed the teacher has not reckoned the Saturdays in the column for \"days present.\" This matter will be (D.V.) enquired into.\n\nAs stated on the Requisition for salary 11 lbs. biscuits @ 10c. per lb. is deducted from his salary. I am aware that this is less than the contract rate, but they can be purchased for that figure in this district, and is therefore hoped no higher will be charged against him.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nMEMO\n\nNote -\n\nSee letter 18 Mar 98 on 137269 instructing Aft. Reader to close contract with Rev. Rural dean Hills for renting church buildings as school houses at Moose Lake and other points.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith under separate cover Grand Rapids, Chemawawin, Moose Lake and Big Eddy School Returns for March quarter 1898.\n\nRegarding Moose Lake, I would respectfully recommend that the teacher's salary be allowed him, since it was through no fault of his own that the school days were not completed. The Moose Lake Indians are well nigh incorrigible, though spoken to repeatedly regarding the providing of wood for the school, and it would be a good plan, should the Department approve of it, to deduct the amount of salary for the 8 days, $9.37\u00bd, from the annuities of this band at next payment. Shall this be done?\n\nI have the honour to be, &c.\n\nJ. Reaer,\nInd. Agent.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\nOttawa, November 28th, 1906\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nIt has been suggested that the Teacher at the Indian School at Moose Lake near Cedar Lake should be removed from his position at once. I do not know under what church this school is conducted or whether the appointment is made directly by the Government, but if so please arrange for Walter Lundy, of Pine Bluff in the same district, to be appointed as teacher.\n\nDeputy Supt-General.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 30th November, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nIn connection with the Deputy Superintendent General's memorandum of the 28th instant re the removal of the teacher of the Indian school at Moose Lake I beg to say that upon referring to Mr Inspector Marlatt's report of his visit to this school in July last, I find that Thomas Bear is the name of the teacher, he having replaced Louis Cochrane, who was removed to Shoal Lake where Bear had formerly been teaching. The Inspector states that Cochrane is an English Half-breed educated at Emmanuel College, who could teach if he would apply himself but that he is lazy and indolent, the Indian largely predominating; while he speaks of Bear being a successful teacher.\n\nI think it right to call your attention to Mr Marlatt's remarks regarding the teachers of these two schools, as it seems to me that the wrong man would be likely to be dismissed were the Deputy Minister's instructions carried out.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I will say at the outset that it is a special case, not considered as such; that is, it will not consider it as a precedent, or as affecting the general principle that I have already laid before you of paying half-teaching expenses of first teachers in their school district.\n\nMr. W.C. Lundy has taught day-school at Morse Lake for over a year. The Inspector at his last visit, while not altogether approving of the result yet said he lay all the blame on Lundy, but said that the Indians did not like him, & that he wished him moved to another school (I have Mr. Laird's letter to this effect). The nearest vacant one was Shovel Lake, some 10 days or a fortnight's travel. Lundy had to take wife & family household goods, & he says that the journey cost $56 (his planoe & boat etc.) But unhappily, on the way, his canoe upset in a bad rapid. One little girl was drowned, his boy...\nescaped is almost a miracle, everything went to the bottom. Shoes, pans, guns, traps, clothes, food, etc. After some hard work and privation they reached More Lake, little but almost starving. What is the date, with winter coming in, almost everything he possessed gone?\n\nI have sent him $50 meanwhile, but we really can not afford it, our funds for Indi work are overdrawn now.\n\nI told him that I could not afford this, but he must have it, so I would try to get that $50 returned, another sum added. First there is the $50 for the journey, then the money required for property lost. Can you not forward me $75 or $100, out of which I can return the Church funds all or part of the $50 advanced, and give the rest to him in further aid?\n\nHe did his work for us at More Lake fairly well, and it was at the Inspector's request per Hon. D. Laird that he was moved\u2014trying for a favorable reply.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJ. A. Saskatchewan\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe case brought before the Department by the Bishop of Saskatchewan in the attached letter is certainly one which is entitled to sympathy, and we would not be straining a point in doing what the Bishop wishes us to do. I would suggest making the matter official and sending the Bishop $100.00 to be accounted for in the ordinary way, that is, for travelling expenses and amount of personal effects lost. The voucher for the latter item should of course be accompanied by a statutory declaration that the things were actually lost and that the values charged are the correct values.\n\nAccountant.\nWith Chequ.\n\nOttawa 16th November, 1907.\n\nRight Revd Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's letter of the 9th instant, reporting the sad accident in the case of the Indian School teacher Mr W.C. Lundie. I observe that you say that if the Department will afford the assistance asked on Mr Lundie's behalf the matter will not be regarded as creating a precedent. Upon those grounds, and in view of the deplorable nature of the loss sustained, the Department has decided to accede to your request. I therefore enclose herewith cheque No 5914 for $100.00 to defray Mr Lundie's travelling expenses, and also to compensate him for goods lost. It will be necessary for the Department to be furnished with vouchers, duly certified, and in duplicate, for the amount of the cheque. The voucher for the household goods should give the articles in detail, and state their value, and should be accompanied by a declaration.\n\nThe Right Revd,\nG.A.

(b) Mr. E. Constant notified me that he was giving up the school in Sept. I looked in vain for someone to take his place. But Mr. Lamb, a trader, and a former teacher, brought a Mr. C.T. Mitchell to my missionary, Rev. A. Fraser and recommended him for teacher. Mr. Mitchell only promises to take it till June next. He is an American Protestant and promises to \"try to fill all the requirements of Church I.D.\" and to begin at once. I know nothing of him except that Mr. Lamb recommends him, and I have found Mr. Lamb reliable and good to the Indians. It is not the most satisfactory way of filling the appointment, but I have no other in view. I have desired my missionary to watch most carefully and report the first sign of trouble or inefficiency. I would request your Department to give him a trial and to notify him to that effect. Address to Mr. C.T. Mitchell, c/o Mr. W. Lamb, Moose Lake, c/o The Pas.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.A. Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, October 12, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, and in reply to that portion in which you refer to the appointment of a teacher for the Moose Lake school I have to ask you to be good enough to inform the Department whether Mr. Mitchell, who has been nominated for the position, is a British subject or, if not, whether he has taken the necessary steps to become naturalized. Otherwise the Department cannot consent to his employment as teacher of an Indian school.

I believe that the J.D. might with advantage arrange with the Educational Department of Manitoba that the latter should admit the Indians at Moose Lake to the Public School there, & the J.D. school be closed. The J.D. has a school at Moose Lake, a small school, renting from us a very poor building, & often in charge of a very inefficient teacher. A few hundred yards away is a Public school for Non Treaty Indians, a few weeks, a good building & I believe a good teacher. There will be no objection raised by our Church to your closing your school, if the pupils are admitted to the Public School.\n\nI don't think there could be any objection raised in the case of a \"separate school\" etc. I think that the Public School authorities, Provincial & Local, would not object, if the J.D. would make a grant, smaller than the sum you now spend on the school.

Acting on this suggestion Mr. T. H. P. Lamb, Official Trustee of the Moose Lake Public School, was written to and asked whether there would be accommodation in the public school for the Indian children and, if so, would the School Board be willing to admit them and on what terms. Mr. Lamb has now replied stating that there is ample accommodation for all the children, both Indians and whites, in the Moose Lake Public School and he refers the Department to you for terms on which this proposed amalgamation could be made. He states that the salary of the teacher is paid by the Manitoba Government.\n\nThe Department would like to be advised what portion of the expenses in connection with maintaining the school should be borne by this Department. If the change is made the Department will be prepared to enforce compulsory education among the Indians.\n\nThe last census return shows that there are 27 Indian children of school age on the Moose Lake Reserve and the last quarterly return from the Indian school shows an enrolment of 24. The salary allowed to the present teacher is $400.00 per annum.\n\nR. Fletcher, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

He reports that so far none of the Indian children have reported at the Public School.\n\nHowever, I am leaving for there this week and will no doubt be able to adjust these school troubles while there.\n\nMr. Jackson advises me that he made the Moose Lake Indians no promises at all regarding the school, and the subject was never discussed on his last visit there.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Macdonald, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter No. 119408/1 dated Feb. 2nd. re Moose Lake School.\n\nWhile there on Feb. 2nd. I had the Chief call a Band meeting, 21 men being present, to discuss the School situation, and they were unanimous in demanding that their school be re-opened. They have no complaint or fault to find with the Public School, and their only reason is that when their treaty was made they were promised a School and they want it. I explained to them that the Public School was only a hundred yards from their school, was a well built modern school with a qualified teacher, something they did not have in their own school. They acknowledged all this, but absolutely refused to send their children.\n\nOn my return I received the Department's letter No. 119408/1 dated Jan. 20th. and wrote the Chief accordingly, and also to Mr. Lamb requesting him to advise me of any action taken.\n\nThe whole trouble can be laid to the Chief, John Steersman. He is a narrow minded, self important individual, and will not be convinced and cannot agree with his own Councillors. As a result one resigned and another, Jacob Naaskapow No. 119, was elected at this meeting. I am afraid that in order to enforce this regulation it will be necessary to use drastic measures. This place is distant about two days travel from here, with no traffic over the road, and it is a matter of a month to get a letter there and\nand back.\n\nI might add that the benefit the Indian children would derive by attending the Public School would be 50% more than they would under the old system. The place is hardly big enough to support one school, let alone two.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst.

The teacher was Miss Burroughs, who received her education in London England. She has taught in Alberta and Manitoba public schools before coming to Moose Lake, and has a second class certificate. The school was in clean tidy condition, without a garden. The non treaty children attending school were progressing well, but the Indian children knew very little. None of them could write their name, and all should be classed in lowest grade. Some of the children have not opened their mouth to speak to the teacher since entering school. I think things will look better in this school in the near future, as at present the Indian parents do not wish their children to attend a mixed school and no doubt advise the children to act as they do.\n\nThe Indians ask for a new school to be built on the reserve, but at present I would not recommend to the Department that this be done, the present school and teacher are satisfactory, the trouble lies with the Indian parents.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nAsst.

As I reported before it is the fault of the Indian Parents, and I will endeavor to straighten them out on my next visit. There is no missionary at this point to keep the people stirred up to the necessity of sending the children to school, and it requires continual talking to get them to attend.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAss't Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 31, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant enclosing report from the teacher of the combined Indian and white school at Moose Lake and stating that this report shows that very poor results are being made at this point, which is the fault of the Indian parents.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, when you next visit this reserve, you should inform the Indians that they must send their children to school regularly in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nAttached you will find a copy of the notes made by me while on a visit to the Moose Lake Union Day School, on June 9/19.\n\nAt the band meeting held on the same date, the Chief and Councillor brought up the question of the school, they want to get a school of their own on the reserve, they want the teacher to live on the reserve, so that he could give out the provisions to the destitute & the medicine to the sick. They say that Mr Lamb the Dispenser, is away a good deal and his children give out the medicine, and they do not like that. They also said that the Half-Breed boys who attend the school are always fighting with the Indian boys, I inquired from the Teacher as to this, and she has not seen anything of it.\n\nOne of the Councillors told me that his daughter 10 years old was not able to tell him any date on a Calendar that he has, and after this information was given me, I examined this girl at the school, and she could point out any date on the school calendar, and this is a sample of a great deal that the Indians tell us, it might have been a year since he asked his daughter to tell him the dates.\n\nI would not recommend that any change be made at the present time, none of the Indian Children live farther than half a mile from the school, and if the band want their children educated they have the privilege of sending them to a better school than they could have on the reserve. The complaints about the dispenser, would be the same if the teacher lived on the reserve, as she would have to be absent at times. I do not like to see the Storekeeper on any reserve dispensing the medicine, or giving out the destitute supplies, but on the Moose Lake reserve just now it cannot be avoided.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nStonewall, Manitoba, August 15th, 1919.\n\nNotes made on a visit to the Moose Lake Indian Day School, on Monday June the 9th, 1919.\n\nI inspected the Moose Lake Consolidated Day School on Monday June the 9th, and found Miss Margery Burrows acting as the Teacher. This young woman was educated in London England, and has a Board of Education Certificate, from that City.\n\nShe holds a 2nd-class certificate from the Province of Manitoba, and has Normal training. She taught for one year in England, 1 year in Alberta, and 6 years in Manitoba.\n\nI found on the roll of the School the names of 31 Indian Children, 9 Girls and 12 Boys.\n\nThere were present at the inspection, 6 girls and 7 boys, all of whom were in standard 1.\n\nThere were 5 girls and 5 boys in the A.B.C. class, and all they knew is to point out the letters of the Alphabet, and they are very slow at that, they know the figures, and can count up to 50, they are learning to make words on their slates.\n\nThe senior class of the first Standard, 2 boys and 1 girl read a very little in the first reader, and are very poor at spelling, they can do small sums in addition, and could write their names on the blackboard.\n\nThe pupils of this school have made no progress since my last inspection, and the Band complained that their children can not get along with the white children, who also attend this school. I looked into this and found that there was really no foundation for this complaint. Most of the other children, small Indian children who attend, are non-treaty children, and a great many are related to the Indian Children. The real trouble is the very irregular attendance of the Indian Children, and this accounts for their lack of progress. Miss Burrows tells me that she finds it very difficult teaching at this school, on account of the lack of knowledge of the Indian language, and the irregular attendance.\nOttawa, August 22, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, to which is attached a copy of notes made by you on a recent visit to the Moose Lake Union Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your remarks regarding the attendance, progress being made in the class-room, etc., have been noted.\n\nWith reference to the request of the Chief and Councillors for a new school building I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to erect a new school on this Reserve at the present time, and the present arrangement made with the Department of Education for the Province of Manitoba for the education of the Indian children will be continued.\n\nI may say that Mr. Agent Waddy forwarded a report in July, last, regarding the poor results being made in this school and he attributed it to the fault of the Indian parents, who did not send their children regularly to school. He was instructed to inform the Indians, on the occasion of his next visit to the reserve, that they must send their children to school regularly in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nS.

I took up the question with the Indians of sending their children to school and the Chief promised faithfully that he would do his best to send all the children of school age to school while their parents were living on the reserve.\n\nThe Indians brought up the matter of having a day school on the reserve, but I told them the Policy of the Department was that where a Provincial School was in close proximity to the Reserve the Indians had to attend same. The Indians are dissatisfied with this arrangement as they state that if they have a Teacher for a day school on the reserve this man can act as Dispenser of medicines and ration issuer and can also help them in many other ways which at present they miss. The Chief sent a letter to the Governor General on his Visit to The Pas but the letter did not arrive in time to be presented to him. I took care that the letter was not forwarded on, but enclose it herewith and it will be seen from this what the views of the Indians are on the subject.\n\nMr. McDonald, the former Agent and myself\nhave kept after the Indians on this school question but neither of us made much headway.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report in June 3rd, I inspected Moose Lake Day School and found on the register fourteen boys and six girls. There were present, nine boys and six girls. Two of these were in Standard two, the balance were in Standard one. The average attendance for this quarter will not be more than ten. The teacher, Mr. Banning has certainly made great improvements on these children.\n\nThe two boys in the second class could add, subtract and multiply by mental arithmetic better than any pupil in any other day school on The Pas Reserve can do with the aid of their slates. The other children are learning all the subject asked of them.\n\nThe improvement is fair with the smaller children, who have not attended school regularly.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that on the 7th inst., I visited the combined White and Indian school at Moose Lake.\n\nThe teacher, at the time of my visit, was Mrs. Wynn, a B.A. of Edinburgh, who took over the school when the other teacher got married in the winter.\n\nThe number of Indian children on the roll is 18, there were 13 present at time of visit, but average for quarter would not be more than 7. This was due as usual to parents taking children away during the rat hunt.\n\nThe children are making satisfactory progress, there were three beginners who knew the alphabet, eight in grade one, read, write, add two columns of figures and do simple multiplication. One pupil was in grade two doing about the same work. One was in grade four along with some white children and was holding his own with them in work of that class.\n\nThe school is in tidy condition, though the Indian children were not very tidy in general appearance, due to poverty of their parents in most cases.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6240, file 526-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that I visited the combined White and Indian Day School at Moose Lake, Man., on the 6th June.\n\nThe teacher is Mr R.E. Banning.\n\nRegister showed 22 pupils, 15 had been present during the June quarter.\n\nAt time of visit 2 were present, five more came along one hour late.\n\nAverage for April and May is about 3, the attendance in June will be slightly larger.\n\nFollowing is statement of attendance in 174 school days prior to my visit:\n\n| Name          | Days |\n|---------------|------|\n| H.

One year ago they were getting on fine, but this last year they have kept away from school so much they forgot all they knew.\n\nI beg to recommend that the Department withdraw support from the school. The Manitoba Government has supplied the best of teachers but the Indians do not appear to want education. If they wish to send the children to school I can get them into the Mackay Boarding School.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, reporting on your visit to the Moose Lake combined White and Indian Day School, and recommending, in view of the irregular attendance of the Indian children, that the Department withdraw its support from the school. I beg to state that we are informing the Department of Education accordingly.\n\nWe note that you recommend placing these children in the MacKay Boarding School. This school has now its full enrolment for which a grant is allowed, and should vacancies occur, there would be no difficulty in obtaining pupils from the reserves in the immediate vicinity of the school. We are re-opening the Elkhorn Industrial School this coming fall, and as this institution will accommodate about 100 children, an effort will be made to recruit that number. It is considered that the greater number of the children of Moose Lake who are in good health and of school age, could be sent to Elkhorn. If the parents will not consent, we could take them under Section 10 of the Indian Act. You should consult the parents regarding the placing of their children in the Elkhorn School and obtain applications for as large a number of these children as possible. They would probably be sent there the latter end of September, next.\n\nYou should also inform the Department of the names and ages of the children of school age, whose parents refuse to sign applications, and we would then consider the question of enforcing the compulsory clause of the Act. An earnest effort should be made to obtain as many as possible of the Protestant children from Moose Lake for the Elkhorn Industrial School when it re-opens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

The average attendance of the Indian children for the months of April and May, last, was about 3, with a slight increase for June. The attendance has been so irregular that the children are making no progress. The parents take no interest in the education of their children.\n\nAn effort will be made this fall to recruit all the children of school age, who are in good health, to an Indian residential school, at either Elkhorn or The Pas. I have therefore to inform you that this Department is withdrawing its support from the combined White and Indian Day School at Moose Lake, from June 30th, last. The Indians have had every opportunity to obtain an education for their children in this combined school, where your Department has supplied them with good teachers, and it is considered that the best means of giving the children an education is to place them in a residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

They assist at Mackay School in a few cases.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of letter 128-6-1 of the 6th ulto.regards Moose Lake combined Indian & White School and in reply desire to state that up until last week I could not visit this place as I was absent on annuity work most of the time and busy getting office work straightened out after my return, however, I went to Moose Lake Reserve on the 10th inst., and held a meeting of the people on Saturday the 11th inst.\n\nI informed the Indians that the Department had withdrawn support from the local school, and gave the reasons. The Indians already knew of this as the Manitoba Government had advised the settlers that they could not keep open the school.\n\nThe Chief at Moose Lake stated that he had told the people almost daily to send the children to school, but they would not listen to advice, and that he could see that the only thing to do under the circumstances was to close the school. However, he asked me to try once more and see if things will not be better, he would like the school opened for another year.\n\nThe settlers ask that we also try once more as they will not have a school for their children if we withdraw support from the combined school. I will not recommend anything of the sort as during the whole time I was trying to get the Indians to attend school I never remember getting any help from any of them. It seems useless to the Indians to send the children to school; they may have assisted what I saw no results from their work, and if the school is re-opened matters would perhaps be better for a short time, but the Indians would forget their promise about as quickly as the wind would change.\n\nI informed the people that I was at Moose Lake to try to get pupils for the Elkhorn Industrial School. I asked each Indian with children of school age to sign an agreement to send the children to Elkhorn. They all refused, so I informed them that when the school was ready for pupils I would visit the Reserve, probably in company with a medical officer and the R.C.M.P. The people understand the law in this regard, and the Chief appears to be in favor of whatever is done by the Department.\n\nover.....\nOttawa, August 21, 1923.\n\n2240-104\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th instant, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to re-open the Moose Lake School.\n\nWith reference to sending the children to the Elkhorn Residential School I beg to say that you will be written under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mr. Agent Waddy, The Pas, Man., is being informed regarding the arrangement that has been made for the tuition of the Indian children at Moose Lake and the tuition grant that will be allowed.\n\nIt is regretted that it will not be possible for the Department to make any appointment of a field matron at this school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A competent teacher has been secured to begin duties after the summer holidays. This Department is allowing a tuition grant at the rate of $20 per capita, per annum, based on the average attendance as shown by returns which should be prepared by the teacher at the end of each quarter and forwarded to you for transmission to the Department.\n\nYou should, upon the occasion of your next visit to Moose Lake, encourage the Indian parents to take advantage of the facilities offered for the education of their children. It is hoped that there will be a regular attendance of the children of school age. The teacher should include on the quarterly returns for submission to this Department only the names of Indian children. When forwarding these returns, please state the name and address of the Secretary-Treasurer of the School Board to whom cheques in payment for the tuition grant should be sent.

McLean Esq  \nAssistant Deputy and Secretary  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre Moose Lake School District #1698\n\nI have your favor of 9th instant advising that you have been informed by His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan that Moose Lake School District No. 1698 will have its school in operation from September 1st next. I do not know where his Lordship got this information or why he is specially concerning himself in the matter. The school is in operation now and has been in operation for several years past. We have agreed to work in conjunction with the diocese if a qualified teacher is furnished but thus far they have not been able to recommend a teacher to us.\n\nWe are glad to note that your Department is prepared to make a tuition grant of $20.00 per capita per annum, based on the average attendance, for any Indian children that attend the school. It may be possible to secure the attendance of some children whose parents do not wish them to go to the residential Indian schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Fletcher  \nDeputy Minister of Education.\n11. Moose Lake.\n\nThere are one hundred and twenty-eight treaty Indians and eighty non-treaty and white. The Manitoba Government gives us $500.00 towards the cost of the teacher. The Indian Department have only promised $20.00 per annum per capita which is not a fair share. It should be the other $500.00, or $40.00 per capita. Mr. Waite, B.A. is a fully qualified experienced teacher and the Church has been providing $1200.00 and furnished house since early in April. The Indian Department's share of this should be larger.\n\nBishop Floyd's interview\n\nOct 4/36\nOttawa, November 11, 1924.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to the Moose Lake Public School, which was discussed at the time of Your Lordship's recent visit to Ottawa, I have to inform you that the arrangements have been made in the past with the Manitoba Department of Education. When Indian children in the Prairie Provinces attend a public school, the Department allows a per capita grant of $20 per annum, based on the actual attendance.\n\nIn former years, the Manitoba Department of Education and this Department conducted at Moose Lake a combined white and Indian school and the Department of Indian Affairs paid half the costs. The Indian parents took no interest in the education of their children and the attendance was so irregular and unsatisfactory that the Department discontinued support and responsibility. The Moose Lake School is now a public one, and if Indian children attend, the Department will allow the trustees the per capita grant of $20.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight reverend Sir.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. G. E. Lloyd, D. D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that on February 25th I visited the combined Indian and white school at Moose Lake reserve. The Indians attending the school are three boys and five girls; all these are in Standard one. School had been open for thirty-eight days in this quarter to the time of my visit, and the average attendance of Indian children was four.\n\nThe children that are in Standard one are not showing much of an advance, as can be figured out from the poor attendance. About all I could say for the benefit this school is doing to the Indian children is probably keeping them away from home where they might get in the way of their parents. It is practically impossible for Indians at Moose Lake to send their children to school more than half time, as their mode of making a living takes them away from home most of the time.\n\nWhen I was in the school I took notice of the work being done by the white children and half-breeds who are attending regularly and they are getting on as well as children of the same age in Town here. The teacher is first class, and if very little improvement is shown in the Indian children it is not the fault of Mr. Waite.\n\nI would be obliged if the Department would let me know who receives the cheque for teaching the Indian children in this school. Rev. Mr. Waite asked me to find out.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Mr. Waite, the School Teacher Missionary of Moose Lake, Manitoba.\n\nIn discussing the matter of the School, he pointed out the unfairness of the position taken by the Indian Department with regard to that School. I have called the attention of the Department to this before, and it certainly seems an unfair agreement.\n\nAccording to the present report there are eight Indian children for which the Indian Department should be responsible, and nine Halfbreed children for which the Manitoba Government pays $500, while the Indian Department only pay $136. for the year. It is true there is a prospect of the Indian children being increased, but even so, the payment from the Indian Department for this year for services rendered is not a fair share of the cost on maintaining a qualified teacher on that Indian Reserve.\n\nWith kind regards\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nJ.D.

The teacher is a native girl from Lac Ba Ronge and was brought up under the guidance and influence of the late Archdeacon J. MacKay, she reflects great credit upon the author of her education; she is a fine woman who has her work well in hand, and who is well qualified to achieve the success she has made of her school. Attendance for quarter ending 31st March, 1928, was 13.06.\n\nEquipment of the school was tidy and in good condition, the pupils present were a bright and healthy looking lot. I heard their class exercises and they all responded well in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Building is in good condition, capacity is for 28 pupils, well lighted, southern exposure, ventilated well, heated by stove in winter, all clean and tidy.\n\nJ. R. Buhn,\nInspector of Indian Agency.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to report that the Combined White and Indian School at Moose Lake has not been in operation this quarter.\n\nIn the month of January there was some sickness at Moose Lake and the teacher did not open the school. After that time she got permission from the Department of Education at Winnipeg to take a holiday on account of her own health. This has been extended to May 31st I understand.\n\nThe teacher is married to the Missionary at that point, and I understand that the amount of her salary is deducted from his stipend by the church authorities. The missionary is not satisfied with the arrangements and if the practice is continued will operate against the success of the school. When I was at the reserve last week I told the Indians that if the school is not reopened shortly I will place their children in a boarding school someplace.\n\nThe Department might take the matter up with the Manitoba school authorities to find out definitely what is going on. My view of the situation is that we will always have trouble there as long as the church deducts the teachers salary from stipend of the missionary. When we have a teacher acting as lay reader at reserves it is not so bad, but when we place a missionary as teacher they get dissatisfied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 4th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, informing the Department that, owing to sickness, the combined white and Indian school at Moose Lake has not been in operation during the quarter ended March 31st, last, also that the teacher has obtained permission from the Department of Education, Winnipeg, to take leave of absence to May 31st, next.\n\nWith reference to the deduction by the Church authorities of the amount of salary paid Mrs. Parker from that of her husband's salary, who is missionary on the Reserve, I have to say that this Department does not feel that it can take any action in this matter. The appointment of the teacher is made by the provincial authorities, and this Department only allows a grant based on the average attendance. The question of placing any Indian children of school age in residential schools would receive favourable consideration if the present arrangements for the carrying on of the combined day school are unsatisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Day School at Moose Lake, man.,\n\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan has asked me to look out for a Teacher for the above School, and I am in correspondence with Mr. J.H. Willson, Wainwright, Sask., about the position. Mr. Willson is a First Class Teacher of many years' experience. I do not know him personally but I have written to two clergymen whose names he has given as references. When he applied for the school he had not full information as to conditions at Moose Lake. I have now written him full information, and if he is still willing to go there and the referees give a satisfactory account of his work, I shall wire you his name as the Bishop's nominee. I should be glad to know what salary the Department would give to a fully qualified Teacher, as Mr. Willson naturally wishes to know this. Would you kindly address your reply to Paynton, Sask., where I shall next pick up mail.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. L. J.

The Diocese of Brandon has been making a larger grant to the teacher's stipend at Moose Lake than we do in other schools in this district; and on the advice of my Bishop I am writing to petition for a larger grant. Would it be possible for you to allow us a fixed grant of say thirty or thirty-five dollars a month for this school?\n\nI am,\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

I may add that the return received for the quarter ending December 31st last, contains the names of 16 pupils. I am enclosing this return, and would request that you check it over carefully and state if all the children therein are wards of this Department. If any are half-breeds, this information should be noted after their names on the return. This return should be sent back to the Department with your reply. You might also state the number of Indian children of school age in the vicinity who could attend this school. I may add that a request has been received for an increase in the grant provided by the Department for the tuition of the Indian children. As you are, no doubt, aware, at the present time we allow a grant at the rate of $20 per capita per annum, based on the average attendance, for the Indian children only.\n\nYou will note the enclosed return is signed by Rev.
