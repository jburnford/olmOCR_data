We ought to try, by jury, and the duties of jurors. We have no desire to dwell upon the miserable details of this wretched business, but a considerable amount of sympathy is necessarily given to men whose intentions was in the first instance to present a most flagrant miscarriage of justice\u2014more the less did the watered proceedings of the courts endeavor to serve, to show how dangerous it is to attempt one evil by another. What more particularly appeals to us is the way in which this travesty of justice came to result in such terrible consequences. It would be very difficult to imagine anything more marked than the contrast existing between the theoretical advantages of the system of jury in certain cases, if a grave nature and the disastrous practical results which so often ensue, an every community of intelligent citizens who are tried by the verdict of the legal machine will do well to consider why this should be the case. It is obvious that in a few lines we can only glance at the subject, but we may say that roughly speaking, a miscarriage of justice in cases decided by a jury results from one of three causes, viz., fear, favor or ignorance, viz., fear, invisible on the part of the jurors, favor, invisible to the uninitiated mind is disconcerted questions ends in leaving the jurors to be almost entirely guided by the verdict of the judge. If this is undesirable and we express no opinion on the point, jurial is evidently superfluous. The ignorance which results at the hearing of a hearing in attention and evidence with a gawk to evidence produced simply proves that the jury chosen on the occasion are unworthy of a status above that of the negroes before emancipation. We may say that fear may not induce that courage is of two sorts, physical and moral. With respect to verdicts of juries, although it is impossible actually to sympathize with the misfortunes happened lately in Ireland, were afraid of being marked and followed up by assassins, if they expressed their honest convictions yet the physical courage of the individual must be considered before they are to be universally condemned by people who are not in their position. Fear them in check, if once gained past and favor are so intimately connected as to make it difficult to consider them absolutely a party, but whereas allowances may be made for the circumstances already referred to, none whatever can be allowed for moral cowardice in this connection. That any member of a primitive race should be able to influence, should, after having been sworn to return a verdict to the best of his ability on the evidence before him allow himself to be influenced by the fear of doing having a second thought of the community, deserves enough to sympathize with criminals\u2014what is vulgarly termed down on him\u2014seems monstrous. Undoubtedly they do arise cases in which self-respect and sense of duty to that miserable method called popular favor should be hesitate to take what his conscience points out clearly as his duty. However, we do not see that fact obtained as a result of actual bribery is an impossibility on this side of the line, but what we are disposed to fear is, that in many cases jurors forget that they are own personal liberty to put aside verdict on one side rendering a verdict and that the juror who is guided by anything but his unprejudiced opinion of the nature and value of the evidence submitted to him, has only utterly united in forfeiting the rights and privileges of a free man but only from the nature of the case making his conscience the sole arbitrator, escapes equating the offence of betraying by a residence in the province.\n\nTHE INDIANS.\n\nIt speaks well for the settlers in the Territories that with all their own means to occupy them they can spare a large portion of their time for the troubles of the Indians. There is a very generally diffused opinion amongst those who ought to be tolerably well acquainted with the condition of the Indians in the Territories, that matters of these very serious. No doubt Indian agents fancy they will recommend themselves to the Government by the conduct of great economy in their management, and that by such economy, we mean the avoidance of any unnecessary waste, the price is very valuable, but if on the other hand, the economic methods allow the land to be used for the benefit of the red man, by disease resulting from all such complaints as supreme upon semi-starvation, surely it would be more economical, more merciful, and not one whit less productive to supply them with infected cattle from the smallpox wards of the hospitals. That the Government policy with regard to making Indians self-supporting is a sound one, there can be no doubt, and to do doubt will be quite able to take care of themselves when those who are now children have grown up trained to the necessary habits, and knowledge for agriculture, but to expect that a different generation doing so, is about as reasonable as to expect the leopard to change its spots, or the Ethiopian his skin. If the white man has by his presence driven away the game which provided the Indians with support, he is mostly bound, if whatever cost, to provide a substitute, and even to take the lesser ground of expense, it is infinitely cheaper in the long run to do the Indians good than to see them starve.\n\nNEW LAND REGULATIONS.\n\nWe are authorized by the Commissioner of Dominions lands to make the following announcement for the information of the public interested:\n\n1st.

SPROAT, Agent.\n\nPrince Albert District, N.W.T.\nCHURCH CONCERT.\n\nIn reporting the concert held at Treston Hall on the evening of Thursday of last week, in aid of the M. I. Church, we may refer to the remarks of Mr. Wright, our parishioner of the Church of England, in his position with regard to criticism of public performances. The performance of anyone who benefits pecuniarily by it, is not fair for subject for criticism, as are the goods which we pay for a price in a store. Why, ladies and gentlemen go to considerable amount of trouble to get up a programme, and it is often the case that they do so from a benevolent desire to help some charitable or worthy object, we feel that it would be the worst possible taste to air our critical acumen in their behalf. Under such circumstances where we cannot conscientiously praise we can be silent.\n\nThose who went to the concert with the intention of helping the Church funds and at the same time enjoying some music, which was performed by amateurs, were in no way disappointed, and the result is all the more creditable as the performers laboured under some serious disadvantages. In the first place, the building, although the best that can be obtained, is, for concert purposes, from the close proximity of the building to the platform and other peculiarities to defective in acoustic properties is decidedly unsuitable, and extremely difficult and to successfully perform with effect, more particularly in choral or part singing. In the next place the accompanying instruments, although of good quality below concert pitch, and had the programme could not well under the circumstances, be embraced by the introduction of comic songs, such as are usually performed not only by their intrinsic merit, but by the force of contrast, tended to give point to the more classical selections. We can only notice the programme in its details very briefly. The anthem \"Ye Shepherds tell me\" was rendered and had evidently been well practised, while at least equal to anything of the same kind we have heard in Prince Albert, we cannot refrain from remarking that all our choral-singing has been improved by a very much greater preponderance of soprano voices to lead, a slightly increased force on the second tenor parts with mix totally improved distribution of the voices, however, this may be the fault of circumstances and we can only do our best with what material we can obtain. Mrs. Brown, Miss Hunt, and Mr. Davis have certainly their reputation by their performance of that beautiful pastoral, \"Ye Shepherds tell me,\" part of which they repeated in response to an enthusiastic ovation. Handel's \"Angels ever bright and fairest,\" originally arranged as a solo and quartette, was rendered in a way which gave great pleasure to the audience. Those who know how thoroughly calibrated the voices are squared to do justice to the solo were glad to find that that had been omitted to Mrs. Shaw. Mrs. Shaw is a vocalist of the audience when she gave them \"Tryo's Lovely Doll.\" That lady to a naturally true, and powerful voice, gave the merit of an easily delivered distinct enunciation, which enables us to sympathise with the composer of the music of her art. Often is Mrs. Brown had to appear, she gave naturally mannered the vocables, recall to a very pretty tune, \"The Last Rose of Summer,\" which was added by Miss Sproul with her usual accomplishment added by Anna Ladd, \"To The Last Rose of Summer,\" was a most satisfactory encore. Mr. Parker, who has a powerful voice, and sang with confidence, did justice to the popular song \"Hearts of Oak.\" Mr. T. O. Davis, whose quaint songs are always so heartily appreciated and harmonically connected, based that he can hold his own in any other order of songs by his performance \"Sitting by the Style.\" In answer to a request from the audience, he gave us \"The House That Jack Built.\" Mr. Peterson deserves credit for the way in which he played his instrument. He made the programme a success by accompanying the following songs: \"Tryo's Lovely Doll,\" \"The Last Rose of Summer,\" and \"Hearts of Oak.\" Messrs. Hunt and Johnson, the masters of the tri and duet, afforded considerable delight by their performance of the organ, and in addition to this Mr. Wright's concert making the one he has given in Prince Albert, we came to an understanding with it. We should gladly have heard more from Miss Shaw's charming harp. Mr. Wright, St. Louis, who has a fine command, handled his lips before beginning his solo, but we do not know what he can do without them. The programme was well arranged, and played every pretty waltz, really well. The worst element of music was the accompaniment of the violins which would have been a severe test of the powers of a master violinist. The violins were played with great skill and attention. From the words with which one of the audience expressed his approval during the evening we concluded that Mr. Wright had been to the Sioux reserve.\n\nCHIT-CHAT LOCALS.\n\nGathered by humour Reporters.\n\nPudding gets plentiful.\n\nVery little water was thrown during this afternoon.\n\nMr. H.

As the animal is suffering severely it should be closed.\n\nMrs. Brown, Miss Hunt, and Mr. Davis accompanied Mr. H. E. Reed on his visit to Troy. They are going on as we set out their respective occupations, and will be greatly missed by the musical world.\n\nBy the last mail we received a letter from Sergt.
