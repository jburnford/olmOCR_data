The season will be remembered as one of very natural but not the least unfortunate state of things, by those who from self-interested motives, desire to divert the stream of immigration from our shores, is so well evident; that it becomes impossible to point out to any one, that while circumstances may not unfairly be charged to our settlers, there is not the faintest evidence in this to detract from all that has been claimed for the natural advantages of the climate and soil of our region. We cannot without hesitation that had our farmers exercised a reasonable economy and foresight in the management of their affairs, they would, taking into consideration, have been in a position to lay by a good store of grain at this season, if not with perfect economy, at any rate with out alarm. To make an exhaustive catalogue of all the available errors which have landed us in this situation, again would be useless; we would only say, that we have been in a position to lay by a good store of grain at this season, if not with perfect economy, at any rate with out alarm.\n\nThe following have been appointed Justices of the Peace:\u2014James Anderson, Thomas, Charles, Robert, Ross, John D.

He became impressed with the country where he resided, and continued there for many years, finally moving to Winnipeg. His opinions prevailed during the relations of that time, and he supported the movement which led him to live in Canada. He was here for two and a half years, when Wm.
