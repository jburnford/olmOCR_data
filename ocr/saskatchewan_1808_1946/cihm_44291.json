During the debate, in 1795, on Mr. Wilberforce's motion for abolishing the slave-trade, some of the defenders of the traffic threw out so many insinuations, against what they considered as the arbitrary and oppressive conduct of the British commanders, that Mr. Grey animadverted with much bitterness upon the speakers, and loudly demanded a full enquiry, which he pledged himself should not be eluded, as many other enquiries had been. Those who were hostile to the two officers, accepted his challenge, but they, nevertheless, suffered more than two months to elapse, before they gave any signs of their readiness to appear in the field. At length, on the second of May, 1795, Mr. Barbam, with the declared purpose of founding on them a subsequent investigation, moved for papers relative to the conduct of the British general and admiral, towards the French in the West India islands, after they had submitted themselves to the victorious troops. The papers\nwere granted, after an animated conversation, in the course of which the friends of the accused parties bestowed much censure on the unfair manner in which their opponents had acted. The question rested for nearly another month, at the expiration of which period Mr. Thellusson moved that the affidavit of Mr. Malespine should be received; but his motion was negatived, though Mr. Grey acceded to it, pledging himself, at the same time, to prove that the affidavit was a gross and scandalous perjury, which was worthy of, and would, perhaps, be visited by, condign punishment.\n\nMr. Barham made his motion on the second of June. Having cleared his ground by vindicating his own motives, and repelling the charge of delay, he proceeded to expatiate upon the importance of the business to which he was now calling the attention of the House. To the transactions of which he complained he attributed all our present disasters in the West Indies. He contended, that the second proclamation, which was issued by the commanders, was a general confiscation of every thing that the inhabitants possessed; and that, even supposing the islands to have been taken, as they were falsely said to have been, by storm, the measure subsequently adopted by the victorious officers was unjust to the colonists, and illegal in itself. But the fact was, that no obstinate resistance was made, the\nreduction of Martinico having been completed in twenty-eight days, with the loss of only eighty men. It was asserted that the proclamations had never been acted upon, an assertion, the truth of which he denied; and that they had been annulled, by orders from home. The rescinding of such acts in a private manner was, however, not sufficient, and he, therefore, moved an address to his Majesty, for a public disavowal of them.\n\nIn reply, Mr. Grey maintained, with much warmth, that the conduct of the commanders was not in the smallest degree reprehensible, and that the proclamations, and the facts of the case, had been grossly and wilfully misrepresented. The law of conquest, he said, had not been pushed beyond the mitigated practice of modern times. There was no sweeping confiscation of property; nothing, in reality, having been touched except the produce and stores which had been packed up for exportation previously to the twenty-fifth of March. It had been denied, that the white colonists were aware of the danger of resistance; but this denial Mr. Grey proved to be erroneous, and shewed that they had been fully warned of that which they were to expect. It had been denied, also, that they made a desperate opposition; but, in answer to this, he proved that every step of ground was obstinately defended, by the whites, and by the whites alone, the\nRELATIVE TO THE WEST INDIES.\n\nnegroes and mulattoes not having taken that hostile part which Mr. Malespine had falsely sworn that they took against us. The conquest, he said, was more than six weeks in being accomplished, and was not achieved without the loss of between three and four hundred men. As to the obnoxious proclamation, what necessity was there for any censure upon it, even granting, which ought not to be granted, that it was worthy of censure? It had never been put in force; the commanders having annulled it, as soon as they found that it was likely to occasion discontent. The motion, then, was useless at best, and designed for no other purpose than to wound the feelings, and tarnish the fame, of two meritorious and successful officers.\n\nMr. Dundas followed, in a strain of equal severity, and concluded by moving three resolutions, negativing the motion of Mr. Barham, and approving of the conduct of the two commanders. This gave rise to a long debate, at the close of which the resolutions were carried by a large majority.\n\nThree days subsequently to this decision upon the merits of the living, the House of Commons paid a proper respect to the dead, by voting the erection of a monument in St. Paul's, to the memory of General Dundas, whose remains, as the reader has seen in the third volume, were treated in so brutal a manner, at Guadaloupe, by\nthe ferocious and despicable barbarian, Victor Hugues.\n\nThere was only one other subject, relative to the colonies, which produced any debate during this session. The desolating of the islands of St. Vincent's and Grenada, by the insurrections which have been mentioned in the history of the war, had the natural effect of embarrassing severely many of the merchants who were connected with those colonies. In this emergency they petitioned the Parliament to relieve them by a loan, to the amount of a million and a half, in exchequer bills. Their petition was referred to a Committee, by which it was favourably reported upon. The measure of affording relief in this mode was censured by Mr. Fox, as giving to the ministers an irresistible influence over the whole of the commercial interest, and being thereby dangerous to the constitution of the country. It must be owned that, in this objection, sound reason was on the side of Mr. Fox. The opposition did not confine their remarks to this point. They entered into a discussion, on the disasters which had been sustained in the West Indies, all of which, they contended, had arisen from the negligence and incapacity of the ministers, who had neither furnished sufficient forces, nor dispatched them at a proper time. These charges the ministers, of course, affirmed to be unfounded; and there, for the present, the matter\nRELATIVE TO THE WEST INDIES.\n\nwas suffered to rest. The bill, authorizing the loan, was passed without a division.\n\nThe precedent of the government affording relief being thus established, it was speedily acted upon. In the year 1799, the merchants of Liverpool and Lancaster applied for a loan of half a million, in exchequer bills, on good security being given for the repayment of the money. This application was made by Colonel Gascoyne, and was supported by Mr. Bryan Edwards and Mr. Pitt. It was urged that the petitioners had immense quantities of sugar on hand, for which they must immediately pay nearly a million in duty and freight; that the foreign market was closed against it; and that it would be politic to give some assistance to the merchants, in order to prevent the price of the commodity from sinking in such a manner as would certainly prove ruinous to them, and to the colonial proprietors. For some aid, it was said, they had an undoubted right to look to the Parliament, the present glut of sugar at home having been caused by an act in which they had no share; an act of the government, by which it had been hoped to make foreigners pay a part of the duty, that had used to be withdrawn upon exportation: a plan which, though wise in itself, had been defeated by unforeseen circumstances. Denying that the latter cause had produced the effect now attributed to it, Mr. Pitt, nevertheless, declared his intention\nof allowing the drawback for a certain time, or until sugars were at a certain price. To the granting of the loan he gave his cordial assent. Mr. Tierney and Mr. Yorke were hostile to the measure. It was, however, carried in the committee without a division, and a bill to authorize it was subsequently passed.\n\nThis was not the last time that the subject of these loans gave rise to debate in the House of Commons. Adverse circumstances having prevented the Grenada merchants from repaying the whole of the money which they had borrowed, they were more than once under the necessity of applying to the legislature to sanction a further delay. An application of this kind, in the year 1803, was heard by many of the members with much dissatisfaction, and they did not fail to express their sentiments with considerable force. The request of the merchants was, however, granted.\n\nAfter having, at every opportunity which occurred, severely animadverted upon the misconduct which had been displayed in the management of the war, and particularly upon that part of it which was carried on in the West Indies, the opposition determined to bring the subject once more, in a regular form, under the consideration of Parliament. Mr. Sheridan was the person by whom the task was undertaken. It was not, however, till late in the session of\n1796, that he came forward to move for the papers, on which he meant to substantiate his charge against the ministers. The debate on the propriety of granting the papers was more than once adjourned, and language of much asperity was used by Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Fox, Mr. Grey, Mr. Francis, and General Tarleton, on the one side, and Mr. Pitt, Mr. Dundas, and some of their supporters, on the other. The ministers were unsparingly accused of having manifested nothing but imbecility and culpable negligence in the whole of their military proceedings. Their expeditions to the West Indies, it was said, had been uniformly of insufficient strength, while the forces, whose presence there would have ensured victory, had been employed upon impracticable projects; those expeditions, too, had been dispatched at improper seasons, as if purposely to expose them to the fury of the elements; fit occasions of sending reinforcements had been allowed to pass by unregarded; no attention whatever had been paid to the health of the soldiers, either in the transports or abroad, the consequence of which neglect had been a dreadful mortality; and thus the safety of the British West Indies had been put to the hazard, and a heavy disgrace had been thrown upon our military reputation. Instead of sweeping, by prompt and decisive measures, our despised enemy from his colonies, those who held the reins of govern-\nment in this country had suffered him to assume the character of an invader, and to ravage a part of our own colonies, and to prey upon our colonial commerce, with almost perfect impunity. While the ministers had in their hands all the resources of a mighty empire, was it, the opposition asked, was it to be borne, that thousands of lives and millions of treasure should be lavished, in the melancholy purchase of disaster and shame? No! the business was one which, on the face of it, called for enquiry, and they hoped that the house, for the sake of its own credit, would not fail to enter upon a thorough investigation.\n\nThe principal share in the defence of the ministers fell to the lot of Mr. Dundas, an advocate never deficient in boldness. He denied that the force originally employed was inadequate to its object, and that he or his colleagues had ever neglected to provide, to the full extent of their means, for the health or the comfort of the troops. It had not, he said, been in the power of the government to make greater exertions than those which they had made. The ministers had, on the contrary, strained every nerve to put our army in the western islands on a formidable footing; and, in proof that they had done so, he referred copiously to documents and dates. The disasters which had occurred were undoubtedly great, and much to be lamented, but they were, he contended, of a kind which could not have\nbeen warded off, or even foreseen, by human wisdom. There was, in short, not the shadow of a pretext for the accusatory motion with which the ministers were now threatened by their uncandid opponents.\n\nSome of the papers were, at length, granted; many others were refused, the impolicy of producing them being pleaded as the cause of the refusal. On those which were laid upon the table no proceeding was ultimately adopted: for, though Mr. Sheridan gave notice of a motion, he had not time to bring it forward, a dissolution of the Parliament having taken place before the period which he had fixed for his motion.\n\nTo the Maroons, the war against whom has been narrated in the first volume, the attention of Parliament was twice called; once in the session of 1796, and again in that of 1798. The employment of the blood hounds, to track them in their recesses, gave rise to the first debate. The subject was introduced by General Macleod, who moved an address to his Majesty, to lay before the House whatever dispatches had been received respecting the mode of carrying on the war against the Maroons. He considered the use of the dogs as being a blot on the national character, and shocking to humanity; and in this opinion he was warmly joined by several members. The motion was opposed by Mr. Dundas, and by others, on the ground that the\ngeneral had no better authority for making it, than an unauthenticated private letter; that the Maroons were a faithless and murderous race; that, even supposing the dogs to have been used, they had not been used for the purpose of destruction, but merely of discovering the haunts of the enemy; and that it was not to be imagined that the government would permit any of its agents to act in an inhuman manner.\n\nThese arguments were by no means satisfactory to the members of the other side, who persisted in maintaining that the Maroons were a much-injured people, and that it was disgraceful to us to call in to the assistance of our soldiers such auxiliaries as blood hounds. General Macleod, nevertheless, finally consented to withdraw his motion.\n\nOffended by the mention of his name in the debate, the Earl of Balcarres, the governor of Jamaica, published, in the Gazette of that island, a letter which reflected upon the general; and this produced an angry correspondence between them, which, however, did not lead to any disagreeable result.\n\nThe transportation of the Maroons to Nova Scotia was the occasion of the notice of Parliament being again called to them. The subject was taken up by General Walpole, by whom the treaty, in 1795, was concluded, and who now moved that the House should resolve itself into\na committee, to examine the circumstances of the negociation, and of the subsequent departure from the terms of that treaty. Indignant at the idea of having, as he expressed himself, been made an instrument to dupe and entrap the Maroons, he censured, with much asperity of language, the manner in which the Assembly of Jamaica had acted, and he contended that the Maroons had been basely and perfidiously treated. They had, he said, observed every article faithfully; and had been made the victims of the pride and jealousy of the Assembly, by which unworthy body of men they had been banished to a cold, inhospitable climate, without the slightest attention having been paid to their remonstrances and intreates, or to his own offer of giving satisfactory evidence in their favour.\n\nIt was affirmed, on the other side, by Mr. Dundas, Mr. Barham, and Mr. Sewell, that the Maroons, by their obstinately holding out beyond the period fixed for their surrender, had forfeited all claim to be entitled to the terms of the treaty; that the step which the Assembly had taken was an act of prudence, which circumstances rendered necessary; that everything that was possible had been done for the comfort of the Maroons in their new place of residence; that the known humanity of Sir John Wentworth, the governor of Nova Scotia, was a sufficient guarantee that they would be treated with the utmost kindness;\nand that, in point of fact, they were at present more happily situated than they had been when they were living in the mountains of Jamaica. The House admitted the validity of this reasoning, and the motion was in consequence negatived, by thirty-four noes against only five ayes.\n\nThe retention of that repository of pestilence, the island of St. Domingo, was the next subject of complaint with the party in opposition. On the eighteenth of May, 1797, a motion was made by Mr. St. John, that \"an humble address be presented to his Majesty, praying that he would be graciously pleased to give directions that the troops in St. Domingo should forthwith be withdrawn. Mr. Fox was the seconder of this motion.\n\nSeverely censuring the conduct of the war in every part of the world, Mr. St. John especially reprobated our trans-Atlantic operations, as having been marked by a series of the grossest blunders. Look at the subject, he said, in whatever point of view we would, it was impossible to find anything like a vindication of the proceedings of the ministers. Those who thought the re-establishment of the French monarchy to be essentially necessary; and here he referred to the published opinion of Mr. Burke, must look with disgust upon distant expeditions, as a waste of that strength which might be employed nearer home, in a more\nRELATIVE TO THE WEST INDIES.\n\neffectual manner. Those who considered the conquest of colonies to be proper, must dissent from the mode in which it had been attempted to accomplish that object. But as to St. Domingo, there never had been a hope of reducing it under our authority, defended as it was by twenty-five thousand men, besides forty thousand revolted negroes. Yet, on this desperate enterprise we had squandered several millions of money; and, what was still worse, the lives of several thousands of our bravest soldiers. To counterbalance all this loss, we were not, he said, in possession of a single advantage; as, notwithstanding our possession of Cape Nicholas Mole, the privateers of the enemy committed incessant depredations upon our trade, and we did not receive any imports from that fragment of the colony which, at such a vast expense, we still retained. On these grounds, he trusted that the House would adopt the address which he now proposed to it.\n\nAs usual on such occasions, Mr. Dundas was the ministerial champion. His first attempt was to overthrow the opinion expressed by Mr. Burke, and this part of his speech was discreditable to its author, as its language could be attributed only to gross sophistry, or to a degree of ignorance which was disgraceful in a statesman. Confounding entirely times and circumstances, he laid it down as a principle, that a war against France must be a colonial one; that no other\nkind of war could be worse than that shown in 1766 having been glorious, this must be more dangerous and consequently he was justified in declining what he was pleased, with his accustomed hardihood, to call, \"the new-fangled ideas of peace and war,\" which he sometimes heard broached.\" He had forgotten that his colleagues had truly represented this to be a war essentially differing in its nature from any of those in which we had formerly been engaged; and that we had never, till now, had allies in the bosom of the hostile country imploring our aid. The opposition did not receive better treatment than Mr. Burke at the hands of Mr. Dundas. He brought against them a charge of inconsistency, because at one period they had accused him of neglecting the colonies, and on the contrary, they now censured him for paying too exclusive an attention to them. The defence of the retention of St. Domingo he rested, partly on the value of the island to France, but principally on the ground that our keeping possession of the colony was the best mode of securing the safety of Jamaica, which would be put to the hazard were St. Domingo in the power of the enemy; especially while the revolted negroes were there. Should the latter obtain the ascendency, he considered the property of Jamaica as scarcely worth a single year's purchase. That there was a great mortality, he confessed; but he hoped that it\nwould cease; nor could he agree that troops ought not to be sent to a place where the climate was deleterious. As to the expense it would, in future, not be more than three hundred thousand pounds annually; against which sum was to be set off the revenue derived from the colony, which, notwithstanding what had been asserted, was not insignificant, the produce of our part of the colony having been to the value of a million and a half in the year 1796, and given employment to no less than four hundred vessels.\n\nThe charge of inconsistency called forth a masterly refutation from Mr. Fox. He and his friends had, he said, insisted, and they were still of the same opinion, that, if colonial conquests ought to be made, the force entrusted to Sir Charles Grey was inadequate to its purpose. But what contradiction was there between this idea, and the idea that nothing ought to have been attempted against St. Domingo? Then, turning the tables upon the accusers of his party, he forcibly contended that the folly of having acted inconsistently belonged to them alone. They had admitted the justice of Mr. Burke's principle as to the nature of the war, and that being once admitted, his reasoning was unanswerable; yet, in their mode of carrying on the war, they had acted in direct opposition to that very principle. Certainly, as far as regarded the re-establishment of the French monarchy,\nthe reduction of all the French colonies was of no utility whatever. The government, it appeared, had not policy enough either to adopt or reject wholly the system of Mr. Burke. They adopted it so far as to rouse all France to arms, but not so far as to make it the leading object of the war; though it was only by pursuing the latter course that there was any chance of a beneficial result.\n\nThe motion was opposed by Mr. Wilberforce and Mr. Bryan Edwards, who, nevertheless, thought that the plan which had been pursued was an erroneous one; and that our force ought to be concentrated for the protection of those colonies which were yet sound and untainted. It was more elaborately objected to by Dr. Laurence, on the ground that, though we ought, at the beginning of the war, to have devoted our military force to higher purposes, it would, at this moment, be impolitic to relinquish acquisitions, which would give us weight in a negotiation, and which enabled us now to hold somewhat in check the republican cruisers in the West Indian seas. It would also, he urged, be disgraceful to fly from St. Domingo, as the measure would be looked upon merely as an indirect compliance with the enemy's doctrine of treating on the basis of their laws and constitution, and especially as it would deliver up to the fury of a remorseless foe, those planters who had\nthrown themselves into our arms in the hope of receiving an efficient protection.\n\nThe motion of Mr. St. John was finally negatived by a hundred and sixteen voices against thirty-one.\n\nIn the third book of this history,* it has been shewn, in what a dishonourable manner the grant of the duties called the four and a half per cent. Leeward Island duties, was extorted from the fears and the weakness of the Barbadians, by that base and profligate monarch, the second Charles.\n\nIt has also been shewn there, that many of the conditions of the grant were never performed, by those in whose favour it was made; the Barbadians having been compelled to pay the duties, without receiving even the very inadequate compensation for which they stipulated in return.\n\nThe fund thus obtained, and the mode of disposing of it, had, however, long remained unnoticed in Parliament, and would, in all probability, have remained so still longer, had not a pension, payable from this fund, been given, towards the close of the year 1794, to Mr. Burke.\n\nThis was a circumstance which, considering the bitterness of the politics of that period, was not likely to escape the lynx-eyed vigilance, nor the heavy censure, of the party in opposition. It did not escape; it formed the basis of a motion, in the House of Peers, by the Earl of Lauderdale, on the fourth of March, 1796.\n\n* Vol. I. p. 330.\nThe motion of his Lordship was, that an address be presented to his Majesty, praying him to give orders that the four and a half per cent. duties, arising in Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands, be applied to the repairing and erecting of fortifications, and other public uses, for the safety of the said islands.\n\nOn this occasion only two Peers took part in the debate, if debate it may be called. The Earl of Lauderdale was on the one side, and Lord Grenville on the other. It was contended, by the noble mover, that the fund was granted for the defence and fortification of the islands, that this use of it had been solemnly recognized by Parliament itself, that any application of it to other purposes was a manifest abuse, and that, the ministers having applied it in an improper manner, it was necessary, by a solemn vote of the House, to prevent a repetition of such illegal conduct. In reply to this, it was asserted, by Lord Grenville, that the percentage was originally given for the express use of the crown, and as an acknowledgment of a right which belonged to the crown, that the particular instance, which had been alluded to, of the interference of Parliament, proved nothing against the royal rights, that pensions had always been granted out of this fund; and that, consequently, there was no pretext for consenting to the motion which was now brought forward. The Earl of Lauderdale\nmaintained, in answer, that Lord Grenville had mis-stated some of the facts; and mis-applied others, and that the arguments upon which the motion was founded, were unshaken by anything which had been urged against them. The motion was, however, negatived by a large majority; there being only six Peers in its favour, while against it there were forty-two.\n\nAfter this decision the question of the Leeward Island duties slept for fifteen years. In 1812, Mr. Creevey again brought the subject forward. His object was the same as that which had, so many years before, been avowed by Lord Lauderdale, namely, to apply the produce of the duties to the defence of the colonies. But his reasoning was lost upon the House of Commons, and a negative was, of course, put upon his proposal, for the appointment of a committee.\n\nDuring the continuance of the first war with France, little more, that calls for notice, passed with respect to the West Indian colonies. One measure has already been alluded to, which, though it passed unopposed, was in a short time productive of important effects. This was the reduction, made in the session of 1796, and again in that of 1799, of a part of the drawback previously allowed on the exportation of sugar; a step which was taken under the erroneous idea that, as foreigners could not do without sugar, and\nas they must procure it from England, they might be made to bear a portion of the duties with which the commodity was burdened. But it was soon discovered that the reasoning which had led to the adoption of the measure was fallacious, and that the comparatively trifling saving which was made by the lessening of the drawback was heavily counterbalanced, by the diminished sale of sugar, and the consequent distresses of the colonial proprietors.\n\nIn the last year of the war, Sir William Scott brought into the Commons' House a bill, for the better regulation of prize courts in our trans-Atlantic possessions, the chief purpose of which was, to limit the number to three courts, sitting at Jamaica, Martinico, and Halifax, of which the judges were to be selected from the English bar. The measure on the whole was generally approved of by the House; but to a clause, which enacted that on retiring the judges should have pensions for life, an objection was started, on the ground of its having a tendency to increase the influence of the crown. The validity of the objection was admitted, and the clause was modified. The judges were to be allowed a salary of two thousand a year, during their continuance in office, and half that sum annually, after their resignation, provided they had served for a certain period.\n\nThe peace, which was concluded in a few\nmonths after the passing of this act, was severely censured in Parliament, by many eminent statesmen, and their censure fell with scarcely less weight upon that part of the conditions which related to the West Indies than upon that part which related to Europe. It was repeatedly objected, in strong terms, that the ministers had restored to France far more than they ought, and that they had been culpably negligent on two essential points, one of which was the putting beyond dispute the right of cutting logwood at Honduras, the other, the securing to the British settlers the property which they had vested, to an enormous amount, in the conquered colonies.\n\nWhile this subject was under discussion, a fresh subject of complaint arose, in the sailing of a large French fleet and a powerful army, to St. Domingo; a circumstance which the opponents of the ministers considered as being fraught with peril to our colonies, in case the French ruler should be perfidiously disposed, and, at all events, with expense to the country, and with alarm to the colonists. By the ministers, on the contrary, it was asserted that there was no cause to doubt the pacific feelings of the French ruler, and that it was politic to allow him to put down the negro republic; which could not exist without endangering the safety of our own possessions. Mr. Addington, in particular, designated the black government as an usurpation, and declared that the\nministers would not have been justified had they prevented the sailing of the armament. Little, however, can rationally be urged in favour of that policy which, between the signing of the preliminaries and the conclusion of the definitive treaty, permitted the First Consul to send to the West Indies so formidable an expedition as that which he dispatched to St. Domingo. Had the negotiations been abruptly broken off between the two states, before the French army was worn down by the climate and the contest with the blacks, the consequences might have been fatal to our colonies in the west. That a British naval force was sent to that quarter is true; but a naval force has not always been found a sufficient protection from the enterprises of an active and intelligent invader.\n\nThough that which had been feared did not happen, yet one disagreeable consequence did actually result to us from this expedition. It widened the breach which already existed between the government of the parent country and the colonists of Jamaica. The colonists had some solid causes of complaint; and they believed themselves to have still more, for among their grievances they enumerated the struggles which had so long been made for the abolition of the traffic in slaves. Setting aside, however, their imaginary wrongs, it may be proper to give a brief sketch of those which had a real existence.\nThe first of the well-founded reasons for the discontent of the planters of Jamaica, was the conduct of the British ministry, in pertinaciously thrusting upon them a black force, in spite of their fears, their remonstrances, and even of their willingness to leave no pretext for the employing of such a force. It has, in a preceding part of this volume, been seen that, in order to avert the threatened evil of being compelled to receive negro regiments, the Assembly consented to provide for the pay and subsistence of two thousand white troops, and that the necessary vote was accordingly passed. Notwithstanding this, however, the ministry would not relinquish their favorite scheme. In direct violation of at least an implied compact, they actually sent to Jamaica the second West India regiment. It must be owned that, on this occasion, the alarm of the planters was by no means a childish one. The presence of an army of negroes, comparatively free, filled with all the pride of their profession, in the midst of a slave population, and therefore a degraded one, cannot, on many accounts, be otherwise than dangerous to the safety of the white proprietors. Even had the planters not been exposed to the more serious peril of a general revolt, there was something sufficiently appalling in the idea that many of the disciplined negroes might escape into the fastnesses of the interior, and there gather round them new and\nmore formidable bands of Maroons, to spread terror and havoc through the surrounding estates. Jamaica was but too well acquainted with the losses and sufferings which were inflicted by a Maroon war, and naturally dreaded the repetition of such a misfortune. Yet the repetition was not improbable. Some of the black troops had deserted; and there was no reason to hope that they would not make a full use of all their powers of mischief, whether natural or acquired. The assembly was keenly alive to all these circumstances, and it repeatedly and urgently prayed to the British government, to be relieved from the sight of men whom it could not consider in any other light than that of enemies in disguise. The government, however, was obstinately deaf upon this momentous subject.\n\nThe next theme of complaint with the colonists was the excessive taxation of their commodities, by which they were absolutely deprived of the means of making any profit on their capitals. As if sugar and rum were articles which had an inherent power of resisting the effect of heavy imposts, the ministers continued to make additions to the duties upon them, while by diminishing the drawback upon sugar, they in a great measure shut it out from the foreign market. It was also urged that, at the same time, they admitted to an impolitic and even destructive competition the sugar of the East,\nwhich was manufactured under none of the disadvantages of that which was imported from the West. The Jamaica planters stated, and they supported their statement by documents, that they were not in a condition to bear the heavy burdens which were heaped upon them with so little thought, or so little mercy. They pleaded that their estates were in general deeply mortgaged; that their outgoings were heavy; that their profits were always precarious, and that those profits had progressively sunk lower and lower, till they had at length become insufficient to furnish the means of existence, while upon the article of rum there was a positive and severe loss. Nothing less than ruin stared them, they said, in the face, unless some relief were afforded to them. All this, however, was unavailing to relax the close grasp of fiscal avidity. The ministers seem to have thought it quite enough to reply, that the colonists had no reason to murmur, their trade having always been a favoured and often a gainful one; and that the duties did not fall upon the planter, but solely upon the persons who consumed his produce. Than this last assertion, a more wretched sophism, or rather misrepresentation, for it does not rise to the rank of a sophism, cannot well be imagined. While the consumption remains undiminished by taxation, it is obvious that the tax falls upon the consumer of the article; but, the moment that a tax raises the price above\nthe means or the inclination of the consumer; it is equally obvious that the tax operates as a prohibition, and falls with a deadly weight upon the manufacturer of the prohibited article, and upon him alone.\n\nWhile such were the feelings and the situation of the planters, it is not to be supposed that they could, with any degree of patience, listen to a proposal of making a still further drain upon finances which were already in so exhausted a state. The proposal was, however, made. Let us now see on what grounds it was made.\n\nFrom the period when a military force was first stationed in Jamaica, the people of that island had, as a free gift, provided additional subsistence, barracks, and hospital allowances for the troops. In the year 1773, the Council and Assembly pledged themselves to provide, thenceforth, such additional subsistence for any force, not exceeding three thousand men, which might be sent for their protection. This pledge they more than redeemed. When, in 1791, the disturbances broke out in St. Domingo, the planters were so greatly alarmed by them, that they applied to the government at home for an increase in the number of the troops by which Jamaica was guarded. The increase for which they prayed was, however, not granted to them without a stipulation that they should be charged with whatever expense might be incurred by this\nmeasure, beyond that of the regular peace establishment. With this condition the fears of the planters induced them, at length, to comply; they, at the same time, asserting, in an address to his Majesty, their constitutional right to equal protection with any part of the British empire, and believing that the necessity for this augmentation of the stationary force would speedily cease to exist. Affairs rested in this situation till 1797, when the dread of the black regiments induced the Assembly to make that offer, which has before been mentioned, of maintaining two thousand white troops, at the sole expense of the colony. But the black troops having been subsequently sent to Jamaica, the Assembly was, of course, released from the performance of its share of the compact into which it had entered. It now remains to be shown what use was made of these precedents, of which two were inapplicable, and two were flagrantly unjust.\n\nOn the 17th of June, 1802, the lieutenant-governor of Jamaica sent down a message to the Assembly, in which he called upon it to take on itself the whole expense of maintaining the military force, not exceeding five thousand men, for the defence of the island. In order to render more palatable this strange demand, he promised that the British government would withdraw the black regiment, and consent that in future no corps of that description should be introduced\ninto Jamaica, without the concurrence of the House. He also informed the Assembly that it would no longer have to provide for the twentieth regiment of dragoons, one of those which were furnished in 1791, and which was now to be recalled; and he argued that as the House, at a much less critical moment than the present, had agreed to pay two thousand additional troops, it could not reasonably object to take upon itself the payment of the five thousand men which his message required. A hope was held out, that, at some period or other, an opportunity would be afforded of diminishing the number of the troops, in consequence of \"the restoration of good order and subordination in the French islands.\" The \"immense debt contracted by the mother country,\" and \"the absolute necessity of her resorting to some extraordinary means to enable her to support her increased naval and military establishments,\" were the reasons which the lieutenant-governor assigned for making this startling call upon the Jamaica planters.\n\nWhether this message was received with most surprise or anger it would, perhaps, be difficult to say. The House answered it by a positive refusal to comply with the demand, and it reviewed, at considerable length, and with no small share of asperity, the conduct which the British ministry had for some years pursued towards the colonists of Jamaica. It denied that\nthe twentieth regiment of dragoons, the withdrawing of which was now held up as an act of favour, was ever intended to be a permanent charge upon the island, and it spoke of the agreement, respecting the two thousand men, as having been originally obtained by ungenerous means, and subsequently annulled, by the violation of its conditions on the part of the ministers. Founding upon \"constitutional right and justice,\" its refusal to grant the supplies for the five thousand men, it added that, even did it possess the will, it had not the power to comply, and it proceeded to justify this assertion, by drawing a melancholy picture of the burthens and grievances under which the colony was at this moment labouring; among which it enumerated \"the ruinous and oppressive duties,\" and the prohibition of exporting, in American vessels, any of the staple productions of the island, except rum and molasses. An attempt to soften the language of this answer was negatived by twenty-four voices against six, and the answer was then varied in its original form.\n\nFour days after the sending of his first message, the governor sent a second, requesting to be entrusted with the control of the barrack department, and to be allowed to raise a corps of artificers. Here again he was unsuccessful. The House was not in a mood to yield anything which it had the power to retain; and it accordingly replied, that\nthe season was too far advanced to enter upon\nthe discussion of such an important subject; and\nthat it was desirous to postpone, till the ensuing\nsession, the consideration of the governor's re-\nquest. This was carried by fifteen voices against\neleven.\n\nThe ministers seem to have been exceedingly\ndisconcerted by their defeat. They, neverthe-\nless, returned to the charge. In his dispatch to\nthe lieutenant-governor, Lord Hobart laid it\ndown as a principle, that the island of Jamaica\ndid \"not contribute its full proportion to the\ngeneral expenses of the empire;\" from which he\ndeduced, as a consequence, that the inhabitants\nwere not justified in refusing to make provision\nfor the pay and subsistence of the troops. He\nrelied on the precedents of 1791 and 1797, to\nprove the fact that the colonists had always been\nexpected to provide for whatever force, beyond\nthe regular establishment, might be required for\ntheir protection; and, with respect to the com-\npact of 1797, he added, that the government had\nonly \"dissolved it, and not violated it,\" as had\nbeen inadvertently stated by the Assembly.\"\n\nHoping, perhaps, that a more moderate demand\nthan the former one would find grace in the sight\nof the Assembly, his lordship now instructed the\nlieutenant-governor to ask for the pay and sub-\nsistence of only three thousand men, and he as-\nsigned as a reason for thus lowering his demand,\n\"the events which had lately taken place at St. Domingo, the reduction in the army on that island, and the return of the French squadron from that station to Europe.\" This language, it should be remembered, was held by one of those very ministers who had considered, or affected to consider, the ascendancy of the blacks in St. Domingo as so alarming an evil, that it was advisable to get rid of it at the hazard of allowing an immense French armament to sail to the West Indies, before the negociation was even commenced for a definitive treaty. Yet, now, the wasting away of the French army, and the success of the blacks, were represented as contributing to the security of Jamaica. The dispatch concluded with a threat which, to say the least of it, was grossly impolitic. The Assembly was told that, if it would lend its concurrence to the new proposal, the second West India regiment should be removed; but that otherwise \"the intention of removing the black troops must be laid aside.\"\n\nIt was not till the close of November, 1803, that this dispatch was communicated to the House by the lieutenant-governor. The message which accompanied it was obviously intended as an appeal to their feelings of pride and patriotism. The House, however, was not to be seduced by smooth words. It showed as strong a dislike to the present scheme as it had shewn to the scheme\nof the preceding year. Denying that it did not contribute its full share to the expenses of the empire, and standing firmly upon its constitutional claim to equal protection, which claim it declared that it would never relinquish nor compromise, it positively refused to make any provision beyond that which it had been accustomed to make. The sum which it voted, in the year 1802, for the troops on the island establishment, including 20,000l. to the commander in chief, the Assembly stated at 210,000l. being more than ten times the charge at the commencement of the American war; and it declared that as large a sum would be necessary for the following year, which alone would be equal to an annual poll-tax of thirteen shillings. This, too, at a period when, for four years, the planters had had nearly their whole income torn from them by the operation of duties which were pretended to fall upon the consumer, but which left nothing to the grower for labour or capital.\n\nThe House then proceeded forcibly to retrace all the grievances of which it had complained on the former occasion, and it added to them the circumstance of being called upon to bear fresh and intolerable burthens, at the moment when measures were adopting to relieve the inhabitants of the mother country from some portion of the weight of their imposts. The past and present conduct of the ministers was again forcibly ani-\nmadverted upon, a brief but emphatic notice was taken of \"the doctrine of dissolving a compact at the pleasure of one of the contracting parties,\" a doctrine which was justly described as being destructive of all confidence, and most alarming to the weaker side,\" and a proper censure was bestowed on the threat of keeping the black regiment in Jamaica, which the House, and with reason, regarded as an unworthy attempt to overawe it into such a decision as would be pleasing to the government. This answer to the governor's message was agreed to by the House of Assembly without a single dissentient voice.\n\nThe House had scarcely dismissed this subject before its attention was called to another of a similar kind. The French garrisons which surrendered at St. Domingo had been conveyed to Jamaica; a step which was certainly not taken with any view of benefiting or conciliating the colonists. On the ground that the admiral was restrained by his instructions from hiring transports, the lieutenant-governor now applied to the House of Assembly, to vote a sum of money to enable him to procure the vessels which were necessary to carry the prisoners to Europe. The sum required was about fifty thousand pounds; but, as the number of the captives was soon after nearly doubled, the whole of the expense could scarcely have been less than a hundred thousand pounds. Though the House was in no small\ndegree alarmed by the presence of a body of French troops, twice as strong as the British force then in the island, it refused to vote any part of the money which was demanded, and it accompanied its refusal with a request that the governor would use all the means in his power for the speedy removal of these dangerous inmates.\n\nIrritated by his want of success, the lieutenant-governor, on his proroguing the Assembly, gave vent to his feelings, in a manner which could not fail of exciting anger and disgust in those whom he addressed. After having petulantly expressed his regret that the members of the Assembly had not given him an opportunity of thanking them for the supplies which were wanted for their own defence, he still more offensively expressed his hope that, upon maturer consideration, they \"would feel the propriety of supporting government in the most effectual manner at their next meeting, and thereby restore to themselves its fullest confidence in their loyalty and patriotism.\" In this language there was something so insulting, and so unjust, that it would, indeed, have been wonderful, had the House allowed it to be used with perfect impunity.\n\nThe House did not allow it to be so used. That body met again, towards the end of the year 1804, and one of its first proceedings was the ap-\npointment of a committee, to take the speech into consideration, and to search for precedents. The report of the committee was a firm yet temperate composition. It declared the speech to be an unprecedented and alarming breach of privilege; and it recommended the passing of a series of resolutions, vindicating the aspersed character of the Assembly, stating the large sums which had been granted, and branding as unconstitutional the conduct of the governor. The report was approved of, and the resolutions were adopted.\n\nIn the contest respecting the supplies, the Assembly was victorious. Fresh subjects, however, of complaint and dispute arose, even before the old ones had ceased to exist. Either with a design to punish the colonists for being refractory, or compelled by the pressure of financial wants, the British ministers proposed and obtained a large increase of those duties, on rum and sugar, which the colonists represented as being already intolerable. In 1803, an additional duty of four shillings a hundred was laid upon sugar, and, in the following year, the customs were raised twelve and a half per cent, which measure operated, of course, as a further and considerable tax upon every article of West Indian produce. The planters and their agents called meetings, and passed resolutions; they petitioned, memorialized and remonstrated; but all their\nefforts were exerted in vain, not the slightest diminution being made of the burdens which they bore. The House of Assembly itself was not more successful, though an elaborate report, drawn up by one of its committees, fully established the fact, that the most pernicious consequences had arisen to the planters, from the heavy duties imposed upon their produce, and from the recent impolitic encouragement which had been given to sugar manufactured in our oriental possessions. On this occasion, heavy censure of the attempt to abolish the slave-trade held a prominent place in the report; and it is not improbable that, in the minds of many persons, the introduction of it excited a prejudice against those parts of the report which were really deserving of deliberate attention.\n\nSo much on the alert, and it must be owned so wisely, was the House with respect to its privileges, that a bill framed by the Board of Trade having been sent out, for the purpose of being proposed to the Colonial legislature, the Assembly refused to receive it. In a resolution which it came to, the House declared that \"any attempt by that Board or any other to direct or influence the proceedings of the House in matters of internal regulation, by any previous proposition or decision on what is referred to or under their consideration and deliberation, is an interference with the appropriate functions of the\nHouse, which it is their bounden duty never to submit to.\"\n\nAt the moment when the Assembly thus spiritedly vindicated its rights, its attention was also occupied by a subject of the utmost importance. This subject was nothing less than the suspension of that intercourse with the American states, which had hitherto been permitted to the West-India islands, and by means of which alone they were furnished with the supplies which were in fact essential to their very existence. Almost since the commencement of the war, in 1793, the British shipping owners had relinquished the carrying trade of lumber and provisions, and employed their vessels in a more gainful manner. The natural consequence of this was, that the governors of the colonies were under the necessity of dispensing with the observance of the navigation laws; and permitting the supply of lumber and provisions to be imported into the islands in neutral vessels. For this plainly-compelled, and indeed meritorious, breach of the law, they had been regularly indemnified, till the year 1801, by acts of the British legislature, by which time the breach of the law had grown so completely into a custom, that even acts of indemnity seem to have been considered as wholly unnecessary.\n\nIn the year 1804, however, a sudden change took place. This has been attributed to the re-\npresentations of the British ship-owners, whose vessels were no longer fully employed in other branches of commerce, and who, therefore, became anxious to recover that carrying trade which they had so long neglected. A cry was in consequence raised against the illegality and impolicy of admitting the Americans to enjoy those advantages which, of right, belonged only to British subjects. It was not wonderful that such clamours should be favourably listened to by the ministers, whose measures had been so roughly censured, and whose plans had been foiled, by the West Indian colonists. Another pretext was also brought forward, to justify the step which it was resolved to take. It was said that the Americans smuggled into the colonies, to a great extent, a variety of articles, especially German linens, and the productions of the East, to the serious injury of the manufactures and commerce of the mother country. To put an end to this prejudicial intercourse was, therefore, only an act of justice to the parent state.\n\nIn pursuance of this new system, instructions were sent out to the governors of the islands, forbidding them, \"except in cases of real and very great necessity,\" to open the ports for the admission of such articles from the American states as were not allowed to be imported by law. These instructions were carried into effect by the lieutenant-governor of Jamaica, on the twenty-first\nof November, 1804, on which day he publicly notified that, after the expiration of six months, a stop must be put to the neutral trade. Alarmed beyond measure by this unexpected proceeding, the Assembly addressed the lieutenant-governor; stating the fatal consequences which must inevitably result from shutting up the ports, there being no means of obtaining sustenance for the slaves, or even for his Majesty's forces, without a continuance of that intercourse which was about to be destroyed. He was therefore entreated to recall his order, until the Assembly had had an opportunity of representing to his Majesty the destruction which was impending over their properties and lives.\n\nIn reply to this, the governor expressed his regret that the imperative nature of his instructions prevented him from complying with the wish of the House; and he recommended to the representatives to lay the case of their constituents before his Majesty without delay, that an answer might be obtained before the time arrived at which his order was to commence its operation.\n\nThe House of Assembly lost not a moment in following this advice. It petitioned his Majesty, on the subject of its previous grievances, and addressed him with respect to this new and fertile source of calamity. In humble but earnest language, the framers of the address repeated and strengthened the arguments which they had\nurged to the governor, adding that, in a period of war, it was impossible to procure British ships and British seamen to carry on the trade, or for the British northern colonies at any time to furnish the supplies, and they declared their full reliance that his Majesty, being informed of their real situation, would avert from them the ruinous and fatal consequences which were inseparable from the scheme of closing their ports against neutral vessels.\n\nAffairs remained in this state till the latter end of April, when, no redress having been given, and the time being near at hand when the ports were to be closed, the Assembly addressed to the lieutenant-governor a long memorial, accompanied by documents, in the hope of inducing him to grant a suspension of his order. The House seems clearly to have proved, that a similar interruption of intercourse had formerly been productive of the most deplorable evils to the planters, and of death to fifteen thousand negroes, and that there was every reason to fear that the same effects would now arise from the same causes. It was stated, in this paper, that to prevent the absolute ruin of Jamaica, 456 additional British vessels, navigated by 2862 seamen, must immediately enter into the American trade. This memorial, respectful in style, and cogent in argument, was of no avail; the lieutenant-governor replying that the strictness of his\ninstructions was such that he had nothing left but to yield to them an implicit obedience.\n\nAt length, however, the lieutenant-governor seems to have perceived the existence of that \"real and very great necessity,\" which was requisite to justify him in departing from the rigid letter of the ministerial mandate. On the day previous to that on which the ports were to be closed, he issued a proclamation, extending the term for six months; but he restricted the imports to flour, corn, corn meal, bread, rice, pease, beans, and lumber of every description. Salt beef and pork and salted fish were excluded by this proclamation, and as they were indispensable articles of subsistence, they being the correctives of the vegetable diet of the negroes, the House once more addressed the governor, and, for once, with success. It was answered that, since the appearance of the French squadron had occasioned martial law to be proclaimed, the custom-house officers had been instructed to admit salted provisions, and that it was hoped that all apprehensions on that score would be quieted by the speedy arrival of the fleet from Cork.\n\nHere ended the dispute, and it will presently be seen that steps were taken at home to prevent a recurrence of it. In the Leeward Islands all had, in the mean time, remained in a state of tranquillity. For this they were indebted to the prudence of their governor, Lord Lavington,\nwho conceiving \"a real and very great necessity\" to be in existence, wisely permitted the importation of supplies from the American continent.\n\nThe extraction of the shaft, says a great Italian poet, does not heal the wound. The contest with respect to some of the disputed points was now over, but the feelings of irritation which it had excited did not immediately subside. Besides, there still existed other causes of complaint, which were of equal importance. The Assembly continued to murmur, that the colony was subjected to a load of taxation which it was unable to bear; and, while this was yet rankling in its mind, it received intelligence that the abolition act had at length received the sanction of every branch of the British legislature. This last event speedily provoked from the House a report, and a series of resolutions, drawn up in a tone of half-suppressed anger and open despouderence, in which all the grievances and sufferings of the island were enumerated, and hints were thrown out that, as the planters of Jamaica had wantonly and unconstitutionally been deprived of the means of bearing the burdens imposed upon them, the mother country must, after the present year, cease to expect any further grants for the subsistence of the troops. So strong was, in various parts, the language of this paper as almost to raise a sus-\nRELATIVE TO THE WEST INDIES.\n\npicion that it was rather the want of power than of will, which kept the planters from resorting to something more forcible than words, for the assertion of what they were pleased to consider as their violated rights.\n\nBefore these feelings of resentment had had time to die away, they were stimulated into increased action, by an event which took place in the year 1808, and of which the particulars are recorded in the next chapter of this volume. During the mutiny, of which that chapter makes mention, two officers were killed by the mutinous negroes. No coroner's inquest having been held on the bodies, the House of Assembly, on its meeting in 1809, requested the Duke of Manchester, the governor, to furnish it with copies of the military proceedings which had taken place with respect to the offenders. This request was communicated to the commander-in-chief, who, however, not only refused to comply with it, but also prohibited all military persons from replying to any questions which might be put to them by the House. Fired by this insult, the House passed a resolution, asserting its right to examine all persons and papers; and it issued a warrant, requiring the commander-in-chief to attend at its bar, to answer for a breach of privilege. The commander-in-chief set the warrant at defiance, and the governor approved of his conduct. Determined not to abate a titl...\nclaims, the Assembly issued a second warrant, to take the commander-in-chief into custody for contempt, censured the governor for the part which he had taken, and resolved to proceed to no business till a proper reparation had been made for the breach of its privileges. In this resolution it persisted with firmness. The governor was no less immovable, and the result was that he, at length, found himself under the necessity of proroguing the House of Assembly. A considerable ferment was caused in the island by this unusual and decisive measure.\n\nThis dispute, however, died away, without producing any further consequences, and it may, in fact, be said to be the last which took place between the governor and the legislature of Jamaica. An attempt was indeed made in the year 1811, to refuse the supplies to the troops, but the dissentient party was out-voted. Since that period, little or nothing of any moment has occurred, except the general alarm which was excited by the Slave Registry Act, a subject which has already been touched upon, in one of the preceding chapters.\n\nThe attention of the British ministry and legislature was, at length, seriously turned to the distresses of the West Indian colonists. As famine was the worst evil which the colonists could encounter, the first step to be taken was to prevent the possibility of its occurring. No sooner,\ntherefore, did the party of Mr. Fox come into office than a circular letter was dispatched to the colonial governors, instructing them to continue the accustomed intercourse with America, and promising that the usual act of indemnity should be brought into parliament. At the same time, as no such act had passed since the year 1801, the governors were indemnified by the legislature for their past proceedings.\n\nThe compulsion of admitting American vessels into the West-India ports, in time of war, being considered as evident, the ministers deemed it improper that the practice should remain any longer in its present anomalous situation. For thirteen years the governors of the colonies had been exercising the dangerous power of dispensing with the observance of those laws which it was their duty to maintain. It is true, that the most imperious of all necessities had compelled them to exercise that power; but their conduct, though meritorious, was not, in strictness, the less illegal. To the ministers it appeared that, if a discretionary power must somewhere exist, and that it must so exist could scarcely be denied, it would be acting more wisely to place it in the hands of the crown, than to suffer it to remain with the governors, by whom it could not be used without a breach of the law. There is, indeed, much of impolicy, in habituating men to look upon the laws as trifling obstacles,\nwhich may, without hesitation, be set aside whenever they chance to stand in the way of convenience, or of interest.\n\nIt was with a view of putting an end to this unequal and pernicious contest, between the wants of the colonists and the laws of the country, that, in 1806, a bill was introduced into the British legislature. The bill, after stating the necessity of occasionally admitting neutrals into the colonial ports, and the expediency of providing for the admission of them in a legal manner, empowered his Majesty in council to authorize, under such restrictions as might seem needful, the governors of the colonies to permit the trade to be carried on; with this proviso, however, that neutrals should import no commodities, lumber and staves excepted, which were not the growth and produce of their own countries, and that they should not export from the colonies any sugar, indigo, cotton, coffee or cocoa.\n\nThis bill, apparently simple and just as its enactments were, was opposed with a degree of hostility scarcely less determined than that which, many years before, as may be seen in the fourth chapter of the sixth book of this history, was manifested against the plan of allowing the West Indies to benefit by supplies from the American states. It was first brought into the Lords, and it passed through the House, after having encountered a formidable resistance; but, when it\ncame into the Commons, an informality was discovered, by which a new bill was rendered necessary. The corrected bill was brought in by Lord Temple.\n\nNow began the tug of war; the bill being strenuously resisted in all its stages. Against the bill were arrayed, among others, Mr. Percival, Mr. Canning, Lord Castlereagh, Sir Charles Price, Sir William Curtis, and Mr. Rose; the latter gentleman taking the most prominent part in the debate. On the side of it were Mr. Fox, Lord Temple, Lord Henry Petty, Sir Francis Baring, Dr. Laurence, Sir John Newport, and the attorney-general.\n\nIt was urged against the measure that it was, in the first place, unnecessary, as, unless the government meant uniformly to authorize importation, the discretionary power of the governors must still exist; to which it was added, that the colonial governors must have better means than the privy council of judging of the wants of the colonies, and that the eagerness of the ministers to get this new authority into their hands, and the manner in which they were evidently disposed to use it, were good reasons why that authority should not be granted. Even the illegality of the existing system was pleaded as an argument in its favour, it being contended that the governors would not, without obvious\nnecessity, resort to a step which was confessedly illegal.\n\nThe moment, too, of bringing in the bill was said to be ill chosen, as America would be induced to look upon the proceeding as a mark of fear; she having recently passed an act, giving the president the power of shutting the ports, in case this country should refuse to offer satisfaction upon certain points.\n\nIt was roundly affirmed that this bill gave a death blow to the navigation laws, which laws had hitherto been held sacred, and that, those laws being our naval palladium, the consequences of destroying them could not be otherwise than fatal to our maritime greatness. On this head a profusion of declamatory language and melancholy forebodings was poured forth by some of the speakers, and especially by the master of the rolls, who, certainly not inspired by the spirit of candour, went so far as to say, that the bill contained a meaning, and had an object, which its framers did not think fit to disclose to the Parliament.\n\nTime, it was said, ought, at all events, to be granted for a committee to inquire into this important subject; and, if a committee were allowed to be appointed, Mr. Rose, somewhat rashly, pledged himself to prove that the British ship-owners were adequate and anxious to carry on the trade, to the fullest needful extent, and\nnot only to supply the islands with the means of subsistence, but also of bringing home the whole of the colonial produce, at an extra expense of not more than two per cent. upon the freight. The preference given to the Americans had, he was of opinion, been exceedingly mischievous to our maritime prosperity, and to the cultivation of our northern colonies; and to continue it would be still more so; besides which our manufactures and revenue would materially suffer, by the clandestine introduction of German and East-Indian goods into the islands, and the export trade of Ireland would be diminished, in consequence of the United States being able to furnish beef and pork at a much cheaper rate.\n\nIt was asserted, in reply, that all that had been adduced against the bill was rather cavils and conjectures than solid argument. For thirteen years it had been found to be impossible to support the colonies without an almost perpetual violation of the law, in throwing open the ports. The bill under consideration repealed no statute; it subverted no principle; it merely purposed to allow the king in council to do that legally, which the governors in the West Indies must otherwise do illegally. It was denied that any one advantage could arise from leaving, as heretofore, an unlimited discretionary power in the hands of the colonial governors. In cases of sudden necessity, they must doubtless continue to act as\nthey had for so many years acted; but it would be the duty of ministers to keep a vigilant eye upon the situation of the colonies, and to prevent, as far as human foresight could prevent, the occurrence of any such cases. According to the common course of things, it would be beneficial to the shipping owners to lodge in the privy council the power which was asked for, as the council would certainly be desirous to favour, as much as possible, the interest of the owners, while, on the contrary, the governors, being besieged by interested persons, and ignorant of the state and capabilities of the trade at home, might, by hastily opening the ports, enable the Americans to anticipate the supplies from England, and thus inflict a serious injury upon the British merchants, by rendering useless the whole of their outfit. This reasoning was further enforced, and the assertion that the Irish provision trade would be reduced was victoriously refuted, by the testimony of Sir John Newport, who stated that the persons engaged in that trade had been consulted upon the subject of the bill, and their answer was, that they should embark in the trade with infinitely more spirit and confidence than formerly, because they could speculate with greater security, if they knew that it would be governed by the privy council.\n\nThe idea that America would construe the measure into a proof of fear was looked upon as\nRELATIVE TO THE WEST INDIES.\n\na downright chimera. That power, it was said, had never even hinted at so monstrous and extravagant a claim, as the annulment of our navigation act. Nor, as some seemed to dread would the passing of this act make known to her any secret respecting the situation of our colonies; she being already quite aware that the produce of her soil was necessary to their existence. If, however, she were disposed to put a conciliatory construction upon the promoting of an intercourse with her, that circumstance ought rather to be a motive for the bill, than an objection to it.\n\nThat this was an unprecedented act, was affirmed to be an assertion which, to say the least of it, was erroneous; there being numerous precedents, with which the objectors ought to be well acquainted, they themselves being the persons by whom those precedents were furnished. Nor was there the slightest ground for the heavy lamentations which had been uttered, as to the certainty of the navigation laws being destroyed by this measure. On the contrary, as the measure would contribute to the prosperity of our West Indian possessions, from which we derived so large a portion of our naval strength, it was manifestly in unison with the spirit of those laws; they having been enacted for the sole purpose of increasing our maritime power.\n\nThe danger from smuggling was declared to be extravagantly exaggerated, if not wholly ima-\nginary. Even supposing it to exist, the Americans were not the only traders by whom it was likely to be caused. British ship-masters could engage in smuggling as readily as American. Such an argument, therefore, tended to put a stop to all intercourse. But was it seriously meant to be said, that the West Indies must be exposed to ruin, in order to prevent the chance of their receiving clandestinely some articles of East-India produce, and some German linens?\n\nThat in time of war, especially of a war like that in which the country was engaged, the supply of the West Indies could be accomplished by the shipping owners, was considered as an assertion which had for many years been contradicted by the positive evidence of facts. Was the House willing to encourage the projects of the shipping interest, at the risk, nay, at almost the certainty of producing the same terrible effects which had been experienced in a former instance, when in the island of Jamaica alone, fifteen thousand negroes died of absolute want, or from being improperly fed? How did it happen, that the owners had only just now discovered their capability of carrying on a trade which they had so long abandoned? Why was their alarm so much excited by a bill which, in fact, authorised the council to prevent the freedom of the American trade, whenever it could be prevented with safety to the colonies? Could they not, at any moment, apply to the\nprivy council, and show their ability to engross the trade, in which case they could have no reason to doubt of a favourable decision? Time was asked for, that a committee might enquire into the subject, but the matter had already been fully debated; and, besides, if the complainants were so ready with their proofs, as they were affirmed to be, how had it chanced, that they had declined to avail themselves of permission to be heard by counsel at the bar of the House? Delay appeared to be the sole object of the clamour for enquiry.\n\nThe bill was at length passed by the Commons, and sent up to the Lords. In the latter House it was opposed by the Lords Hawkesbury and Eldon, but was finally carried through and received the royal sanction.\n\nAs the distresses of the colonists were becoming every day less supportable, it was necessary that the Parliament should take some steps for the purpose of alleviating them. There were now in the warehouses of the British ports between a hundred and fifty and a hundred and sixty thousand hogsheads of sugar, for which no purchasers could be found. In this case, the readiest means of assisting the planters seemed to be, to allow, as far as was consistent with other interests, the use of sugar and molasses in the distilleries and breweries. Accordingly, at the close of the year 1806, Lord Temple moved for a committee to investigate the subject, and his\nmotion was agreed to. In the mean time, something was done for the benefit of the colonists, by giving an increase of bounty upon the exportation of sugars, and by imposing an additional duty on brandy and such other foreign spirits as were imported for home consumption.\n\nThe dissolution of the parliament put an end to the committee which Lord Temple had obtained. In the new parliament, however, a committee was appointed, to take into consideration the commercial state of the West-India colonies. In its first report it fully established the fact, that, in consequence of the heavy duties, and the rivalship of neutrals, the latter being a result of the former, the West-India planters were tottering on the brink of ruin. \"At length the depression of the market,\" said the report, \"has become such, that the prices obtained for the last year's crop will not pay the expense of cultivation, except upon estates on a very great scale, making sugar of a very superior quality, or enjoying other extraordinary advantages.\" The expense of a hogshead of sugar to the planter was stated to be from thirty-five to thirty-six shillings; while from the average prices in the Gazette, for the last eight months, it appeared that the average selling prices had been from thirty-one to thirty-six shillings; giving a mean price of thirty-three shillings and sixpence, and irrefragably proving that the planters had cultivated their\nestates at a heavy loss. Some diminution of duty, an increase of bounty on export, the encouragement of the consumption of rum, and, above all, a restriction of the trade between neutrals and the enemy's colonies, were the remedies suggested for averting the ruin which, it was said, unless speedy and efficient measures of relief were adopted, would inevitably fall upon the planters, and, through them, upon all that numerous class which derived its means of existence from colonial property.\n\nIt is obvious that these measures could not be productive of any immediate benefit to the planters, because they could not create an immediate market for the surplus produce, already enormous, and daily increasing in quantity. The situation of the planters, however, required that something should be done without delay. Mr. Perceval seems to have felt this, and accordingly, early in the year 1808, he moved for a committee, to enquire how far it might be practicable and expedient to confine the distilleries of the United Kingdom to the use of sugar and molasses only; and also what other provision might be made for the relief of the growers of sugar in the British West-India colonies.\n\nAfter a long and laborious examination of evidence, the committee presented four reports to the House. At the very outset the committee ascertained that the distress was \"as urgent as it\nwas severe,\" that it was continually growing greater, and that there was no prospect of it being put an end to without legislative interference. The first report was wholly dedicated to the subject of distillation from sugar, and it recommended the restriction for England and Scotland, but not for Ireland, there being circumstances which rendered it not advisable to extend the plan to the latter country. In order to prevent any injury to the British agricultural interests, it was suggested that if, in pursuance of this report, any bill were brought into parliament, it ought to contain a clause, granting to the King in council the power of removing the suspension, and permitting the distilleries to carry on their trade in the accustomed manner.\n\nThe other reports recommended the prohibition of foreign spirits during the war, or at least a heavy increase of duty upon them; the granting of permission to the colonists to barter sugar and coffee with the Americans for the supplies which were furnished by the latter people; the adoption of stronger measures to interrupt the intercourse between the enemy's colonies and the United States; and a reduction of the prohibitory duties on the importation of refined sugar, by which means the loss from drainage, amounting to one-eighth during the voyage, would be saved, the expense of freight would undergo a proportionable diminution, and the planter would gain the\nRELATIVE TO THE WEST INDIES.\n\nmaterials for manufacturing nearly three gallons of rum from every hundred weight of sugar which he refined. The prohibition of refining their sugars, to which the planters were subjected, was justly described as an oppressive and unjust one, which it would be wise to do away with, even at the cost of compensating the British refiners for whatever injury they might thereby sustain. In conclusion, a hint was thrown out, that sugar might perhaps be usefully employed in the fattening of cattle, in which case it might be proper to allow a drawback on the quantity so employed; but this was left for future consideration, a sufficient number of experiments not having yet been made to enable the committee to form a correct judgment.\n\nA bill for materially reducing the duty on coffee was at that moment before the House, and therefore the committee did not think it necessary to say more upon that head, than to give a decided opinion in favour of the measure, as being, for many reasons, a measure of sound policy. One great advantage of it was stated to be, its having a tendency to add to the security of the islands, \"by increasing the number of that middling class of white settlers, upon whom their defence so greatly depends.\" The bill was passed in the course of the session. One great effect of it has been, to spread through every rank of people the use of a salutary beverage, prepared from\nan article cultivated by our fellow subjects; and in so far, at once to relieve those whom we ought to regard with brotherly feelings, and to render us less tributary to the most insolent and worthless nation which is anywhere to be found throughout the wide extent of the continent of Asia.\n\nLooking at the peculiar circumstances in which the country was placed, with respect to its supply of grain, it would seem that, setting aside all consideration of the benefit of the West-India planters, the substitution of sugar for corn in the distilleries could scarcely fail to be regarded as a politic measure. Great Britain, from being an extensive exporter of grain, had become so large an importer, that she had long been dependent upon other countries for an average annual supply of 770,000 quarters, a state of things which, in various ways, had, but too manifestly, a prejudicial effect. At this period, in particular, the prospects of the country, as to that article of subsistence which has emphatically been called the staff of life, were by no means of a pleasing kind. There was no surplus on hand, but rather an absolute deficiency to be feared, the future crops held forth no promise of abundance, and America, one of our main resources, had sealed her ports by an embargo, which there was little reason to hope would be speedily removed. Thus situated, it behoved England to economize as\nmuch as possible; and, as the distilleries consumed yearly 470,000 quarters of grain, it appeared to be a step dictated by common sense to convert this quantity into food, instead of converting it into a moral and physical poison; the more especially as other materials for making the poison were at hand, and might be employed with infinite advantage to a numerous and meritorious class of British subjects. In this case it did seem that no party would be injured; and that one party at least would have cause to rejoice. The farmers would sell their grain to the baker instead of to the distiller; the people would be more assured of a supply of bread; the drinkers of spirits would still enjoy their accustomed Circean cup; the West-India planters would be somewhat relieved from the heavy pressure which bent them to the earth; and the revenue, always careless of life and morals when its own interest is not at stake, would have no defalcation to fear from the drying up of that which is, unfortunately, one of the most productive of its often impure sources.\n\nSo thought the ministers, but so did not think the major part of what is denominated the agricultural interest. Among the farmers and landed proprietors a long and loud clamour was immediately raised. Had the bill, which suspended only for a short period the distillation from corn, been an act for the confiscation of their estates,\nthey could scarcely have attacked it with more determined fury. In the newspapers it was loaded with every term of reproach which the memory or the imagination could suggest. County meetings were called, speeches, wanting nothing but eloquence and argument, were made, and petitions were sent up to Parliament, vehemently deprecating the terrible calamity which was about to be inflicted. In the House of Commons the opposition was truly formidable. In the first instance, the motion, for going into a committee, was carried by a majority of only fourteen; there being a hundred and eight dissentient members, out of two hundred and thirty who voted. In every stage the bill had to contend against a pertinacious resistance from passion and prejudice, and in several divisions the minority was unusually numerous. The bill, nevertheless, was at length carried through both Houses; the last shaft which was discharged against it being a protest, bearing the names of the Earls of Lauderdale, Selkirk, and Suffolk, and by no means remarkable for either accuracy of reasoning, or beauty of language. In succeeding years of scarcity the bill was re-enacted, and without producing any one of those direful evils which had been so confidently predicted, as the certain consequence of its being suffered to exist.\n\nThe debates on subjects connected with the\nWest Indies have, since that period, been \"few and far between;\" nor would it much interest the reader to enter into an analysis of discussions which involved no great principle, and led to no important result. The colonial offices' bill, which was brought in by Mr. Golbourn, in the year 1814, gave occasion to one of the sharpest of these minor contests. Its declared object was \"to prevent the granting in future any patent place to be exercised in any colony or plantation for any longer term than during such time as the grantee should discharge the duty in person, and behave well therein.\" It was, however, vigorously opposed by Mr. Creevey, and some other members of the opposition, as being, in reality, a mere delusion and cheat, intended to sanctify all abuses against a bill of reform, which was passed in the twenty-second year of his Majesty's reign. Two divisions took place, but the bill was finally agreed to by both Houses of Parliament.\nCOLONIAL EVENTS.\n\nVOL.

Having gone through the principal divisions of the subject, there only remains to give a brief account of those remarkable occurrences which, from natural or moral causes, took place in the colonies, during the period of the last quarter of a century. This chapter, therefore, will be entirely of a miscellaneous nature; narrating, firstly, the most important of those events over which man had,\nand can have, no control; and, secondly, those which were wholly occasioned by his negligence, or his crimes. To the first class belong hurricanes, inundations, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions; to the second, conflagrations, mutinies and insurrections.\n\nHurricanes have, at all periods, been the scourge of the greatest part of the islands of the West Indies. Desisting sometimes, for many years, from their terrific ravages, they seem, at length, to recommence them with a fury and perseverance proportioned to the duration of time which they have remained inactive. Such was the case in 1780; and such has been the case since the year 1813. In the latter instance, however, the interval of quiet which they left to the colonists was far shorter than it was in the former: in the one, it was only twelve years; in the other, it was more than twice that number of years; there being no hurricane, of any serious consequence, between the years 1744 and 1772. But it was in 1780 that the series of hurricanes commenced, which, with the exception of two seasons, spread dismay and ruin through the colonies, for the space of seven years. It will be seen, in the course of this narrative, that similar events are now occurring, and nearly in a similar order.\n\nIn August, 1793, St. Christopher's experienced a visitation of this kind, which did consi-\nderable mischief both to the shipping and the plantations. Antigua was the next island which felt the fury of the elements. The hurricane came on there on the evening of the eighteenth of August, 1795, and lasted till the following morning. Some houses were blown down, several vessels in the harbour were driven on shore, and much injury was done to the country.\n\nIn the succeeding year, Barbadoes sustained a heavy loss from a rain far exceeding in violence that which accompanied the tempest of the year 1780. This rain began on the eighth of November, and fell profusely during the whole of the night. But, at seven o'clock on the next morning, it increased in such a manner, that it seemed as if the heavens had burst, and were pouring down all their weight of waters. It continued to descend thus, without a moment's intermission, for four and twenty hours; during all which time not two seconds elapsed without the most vivid flashes of lightning and tremendous peals of thunder. The gully, as it is called, which runs through Bridgetown, and falls into the sea in Carlisle bay, was quickly filled; and, meeting with a spring and flowing tide, the mass of waters carried away both the bridges, and spread into the town, where, in many places, it was five feet deep. Some of the inhabitants escaped by wading, others on horseback; even the horses being under the necessity of swimming. The\ntown itself would probably have been swept away had not the gully opened over the fields a new passage to the sea, for a part of its contents; in doing which it hollowed out, across the road, a gulf forty feet in width and ten or twelve in depth. The roads throughout the island were entirely broken up, and the plantations were greatly damaged, many of them, for an extent of several miles being inundated, and the negro houses and other small buildings being entirely covered.\n\nThe Bahamas next felt the fury of the devastator of the Western islands. No hurricane had occurred in the Bahamas for eight years, and the season of 1796 had passed over so favourably, that the inhabitants were induced to hope that, that year also would be as free from danger as those which had preceded it. So confident were they that this would be the case, that the coasting trade of their perilous shores was carried on without any interruptions, and without any precautions. They were, however, soon undeceived. In the afternoon of the third of October, the storm began, and it raged, with scarcely any interval, till the ensuing morning. The break of day disclosed a distressing scene. The land was covered with the marks of havoc, but the sea presented a still more shocking spectacle. Of all the ships which, on the evening before, had crowded the harbour of Nassau, only three re-\nThe Narcissus ship of war was stranded on Long Key, the Porcupine was dismasted, numerous vessels and boats were sunk or driven ashore, and the margin of the sea was thickly strewn with wrecks of all descriptions.\n\nBut, terrible as this hurricane was, it was far less so than that which took place at Nassau on the 22d of July, 1801. The latter came on about noon, from between the east and north, with such violence, that, though their masts were struck, their anchors down, and every means was used to keep them to their moorings, the whole of the vessels in the harbour broke loose, and were driven on the strand. The masts of many of them were snapped asunder by the wind, with as much facility as if they had been composed of reeds. At three o'clock the wind veered to the eastward, and the spray of the sea rose in such clouds that objects at a short distance were rendered invisible. As the tide ebbed, the wind changed to the south; but, fortunately, the town, being protected by the hills in that quarter, did not sustain as much injury as it otherwise would have sustained. Southward of fort Montague, the sea made a breach through the sand hills, and filled, to the depth of several feet, the valley to the west. At sun-set the hurricane died away; nothing of it remaining but a fresh gale. On the land the damage done in the course of a few hours was very great. At sea the amount of it\nwas not less than one hundred thousand pounds. Independently of the ships which were sunk, and those which were crushed by striking against each other, a hundred and twenty sail were counted at one time, lying as wrecks on the shore. It providentially happened, that the tide had ebbed before the wind went round to the south, and had thus left the vessels upon the beach. The consequences would otherwise have been of the most disastrous kind, as the whole of the ships would have been driven to sea; and, in all probability, disabled as they were, but few of them would have escaped.\n\nSevere as these hurricanes were, the effects of them were confined to one particular spot. In 1804, a more tremendous infliction of this kind occurred, which included in its sweep all the Windward islands, though St. Christopher's was the colony where its widest ravages took place. It commenced on the fourth of September, and blew till the close of the sixth, without any pause. Antigua, St. Christopher's, Dominica, Martinico, St. Thomas, and St. Bartholomew's, all suffered in a greater or less degree. Two hundred and seventy-four vessels are said to have perished. Such was the destruction, that a ship from Surinam sailed for three days through the floating fragments of the wrecks. Nor were the horrors of the storm experienced only within the limits of the West-Indian islands. They\nwere felt as heavily on the coast of Carolina, on the eighth of September. At Charleston the loss sustained was to the amount of a million of dollars; and at Savannah, and many other towns and places, the devastation was nearly if not quite as extensive. Around Savannah the trees were torn up by the roots; and in the harbour, every vessel that was not buried in the waves, was thrown upon the wharfs.\n\nDominica had its share of this wide-spreading calamity. Two years after, however, it was the sole sufferer from a hurricane of equal fury. On the ninth of September, 1806, the sky became totally overcast; about seven in the evening the lightning began to flash, and heavy gusts of wind arose, which increased in strength till ten o'clock, when the rain poured down in torrents, and every vessel in the harbour, to the number of sixteen, was either sunk in the waves or driven ashore. The whole of the barracks on Morne Bruce, and nearly the whole of those on Morne Cabrit, were carried away, and a hundred and sixteen persons were killed or wounded. In Roseau and its vicinity a hundred and thirty-one persons, and in the estates along the coast, two hundred and ten persons shared the same fate. Every plantation on the windward coast of the island from the river Tabarie to Cape Morne Paix Bouche was nearly destroyed, and all the estates round the coast, from the river Tabarie\nby the way of La Soye, received considerable damage. The plantations to leeward likewise felt in a heavy degree the ravages of the storm. Every house from the river Mahaut to Prince Rupert's was overthrown or seriously injured, and the town of Portsmouth was laid in ruins.\n\nAt Roseau the greatest mischief was done by the overflowing of the river, which inundated the town in all directions, every house which obstructed its passage being thrown down, or swept away by the torrent. \"No pen,\" says a witness of the scene, \"can paint the horrors of that dreadful night! the tremendous noise occasioned by the wind and rain\u2014the roaring of the waters, together with the shock of an earthquake, which was sensibly felt about midnight\u2014the shrieks of the poor sufferers crying out for assistance\u2014the terror of those who in their houses heard them, and dared not open a door or window to give succour, and who expected momently to share the same fate, formed a scene which can hardly be conceived, and is still more difficult to be described. Fortunately for the inhabitants of the town, and, indeed, for the whole colony, the force of the wind and rain abated about three o'clock in the morning, and near the same time the water began to fall; if it had continued another hour, there is not a doubt but the town would have been entirely destroyed.\u2014The spectacle which presented itself on the return of day-\nlight, was horrid beyond every power of description; heaps of mud and sand, (in some places five or six feet deep) through all parts of the town\u2014the form of a street hardly to be discerned\u2014two large streams, or rather torrents, running through the midst of the town\u2014ruins of houses blown down, and others brought down by the flood, obstructing every passage\u2014the carcases of several of the unfortunate victims of this event drawn out from the ruins, and lying in the streets\u2014while numbers, almost distracted, were searching for some near relation, or friend, who had perished in the storm\u2014the lamentations of those who had lost some of their nearest and dearest connections, joined to the despair of those who had lost their little all, formed altogether a scene fit to draw tears from the eyes of the most unfeeling.\"\n\nAfter this violent effort of the elements a long pause ensued. It was not till the year 1812 that the West Indies felt the scourge of a hurricane. In the October of that year, one occurred at Jamaica, which though it lasted but a short time, did extensive injury to the plantations. In 1813 the destroyer reappeared, and with increased fury. The island of Dominica was the first victim of the returned pest. The storm began on the 23d of July, shortly after daylight, and was soon at its height. The barracks and other buildings at Morne Bruce, including the hospital in which were fifty sick, were levelled with the\nground, and numbers of persons were killed and wounded by their fall, or blown over the cliffs into the sea. Those at Prince Rupert's and at Cachecrou were equally destroyed. The government house on King's hill was prostrated, with all its offices, and the governor and his family were driven into the fort for shelter. Not a public building escaped uninjured in Roseau. In all parts of the country incalculable mischief was done; houses, mills, works, canes, coffee plantations and plantain-grounds, being either wholly ruined, or severely shattered. In addition to these horrors, it was at one moment feared that the town of Roseau would suffer the same dreadful fate as that which formerly fell upon the town of Callao. On the wind veering round to the eastward and southward, the sea suddenly rose as high as the sills of the second story windows on the verge of the bay; then, thundering along, shook the houses to their foundations, and rushed up more than a hundred and fifty feet above high water mark, sweeping with it, and breaking into fragments, all the small craft which it found in its progress. Happily, however, no other damage was done than the filling of the stores and cellars with water, and the carrying away of the front walls and the pillars of the galleries. On the same day all the shipping at St. Christopher's were driven on shore, and several of them were entirely destroyed.\n\nThe Bermudas next, on the 26th of July, en\ncountered the pelting of the pitiless storm, which was rendered more striking by contrast, the day having opened with the most delightful coolness and serenity. The severest effect of it was felt at St. George's. It continued from twelve till five, when it paused for an hour, at the expiration of which time it recommenced, from another point of the compass, and raged till midnight, when it finally ceased. The consequences were of the most lamentable kind. In the beautiful and flourishing town of St. George's more than one-third of the houses were beaten to the ground, and all those which were left standing were injured in various degrees. Hundreds of families were reduced to beggary, by the total loss of all that they possessed. In the harbour of St. George's alone more than sixty sail of ships were stranded, and many were sunk. The damage done in the town and harbour was to the amount of not less than two hundred thousand pounds; and other parts of the island were devastated in a terrible manner. In order to afford as much relief as possible to the sufferers, sums were voted by the House of Assembly, the Chamber of Commerce, and the St. Andrew's Society, and a further addition was made by a liberal subscription among private individuals.\n\nJamaica did not wholly escape. On the last day of July, a hurricane blew with great violence, driving on the beach several vessels, and sinking\nothers, in the harbours of Kingston and Port Royal, and doing much mischief to the buildings on shore. During the storm, a shock of an earthquake was felt, which, though a severe one, was but of short duration.\n\nDominica had yet something more to endure, in the course of this unfortunate year. On the 25th of August, another hurricane occurred, which was attended by deluges of rain. The river speedily rose to an unwonted height, and, bursting through its banks, bore down trees and every thing else that lay in its course. It rushed into the town of Roseau in three columns, and, in a few minutes, a large part of the town was inundated to the depth of ten or twelve feet. The avenues were choked up with trees, lumber, sand and dead fish; the streets were, in many places, ploughed up into furrows of ten or twelve feet deep; the provisions which were spared by the wind were swept away by the flood; numbers of the houses were shaken from their foundations, and some, of a less massy construction, were borne away to the sea. It was, however, a consolation, that no lives were lost in this second disaster.\n\nIn 1815 a part of Jamaica was again devastated. On this occasion, the north and northeastern districts of the island were those which suffered. The storm occurred in October, and its effects were tremendous. The tempest was accompanied by floods of rain, more mischievous\nin their action than the tempest itself. None of the oldest inhabitants had ever before seen the rivers rise to such an amazing height, or rush with such impetuous velocity. Houses, buildings, wharfs, whole fields of canes, and in many places even the land, were swept away by the torrents, which made themselves new channels, and bore down every thing before them. Many negroes were drowned, an immense quantity of stock was lost, and one-third of the sugar crop, and two-thirds of the crop of coffee, are said to have been destroyed.\n\nA more widely-spreading hurricane exercised its destructive fury, on the 21st of October, 1817. At the same moment it swept over a space of two hundred miles, from west to east, from St. Vincent's to the north of Dominica, and wherever it passed it scattered desolation. Of the British islands, St. Lucia and Dominica were those which were the most severely injured. At the former island, houses, barracks, crops, and vessels were involved in one common ruin. The government house was one of the buildings which was blown down, and the governor, General Seymour, with many others, perished by its fall. Dominica had already been ravaged by a storm on the 15th of September, which was only inferior to that of the year 1813; and now this second infliction filled up the measure of its misfortunes. The blow was rendered more heavy\nby the refusal of the governor to suspend the prohibition of opening the ports to provisions from America. The House of Assembly repeated its request, but in vain; the governor persisting in his refusal, on the ground that his orders to the contrary were imperative, and that there had not been shown a necessity sufficiently strong to justify him in violating instructions of so peremptory a kind.\n\nNor is the melancholy tale yet arrived at its close. Even at the moment when the writer is finishing this monotonous and gloomy narrative, intelligence is arrived that Jamaica and Dominica have again been visited by hurricanes, and that the latter island has been desolated in such a manner, as to make it necessary for the governor to grant permission to open the ports for the admission of supplies, in order to prevent famine from being added to the other sufferings of the colonists of Dominica.\n\nFrom the still more terrible visitation of earthquakes no injury has, for a long period of time, been sustained by the British West-Indian islands. Shocks are, indeed, frequently felt, strong enough to spread a momentary alarm, but not strong enough to destroy. In 1797, and again in the latter end of 1811 and the beginning of 1812, they were more numerous and more powerful than usual. The former year was distinguished by that tremendous convulsion, which,\nin South America, overturned and ingulphed populous cities, and almost changed the face of whole provinces. On the day after that on which the earthquake commenced in the provinces of Tacunga, Riobamba, Ambato and Quito, the effects of the subterranean commotion began to be felt in the West Indies, but particularly at St. Christopher's. The shocks were continued at intervals, never longer than a week between each, for several months, there being sometimes a hundred of them in the course of four and twenty hours. They ran, for the major part, in a direction from east to west, with an undulatory motion, and were accompanied by a rumbling noise under ground, like the murmuring of distant thunder. Some moved vertically, with sudden violence, attended by a series of abrupt explosions, each having a distinct report, similar to that of a cannon. The mighty terrestrial wave, however, exhausted all its fury upon the devoted continent, and its verge only shook, without injuring, the chain of islands.\n\nThe second instance of a series of shocks, which was in the years 1811 and 1812, was also connected with the desolation of a part of the continent. In twelve months, previously to May, 1812, more than two hundred shocks were experienced in the island of St. Vincent's. This was the prelude to the destruction which took place throughout the province of Caracas; in\nwhich province, on the 26th of March, 1812, the capital and more than thirty towns, with eighty thousand inhabitants, were destroyed. Some portion at least of the West Indies would probably have shared a similar fate, had not the imprisoned mischief found vent, by means of an extraordinary occurrence, which is now to be described.\n\nAlmost every island in the West Indies, particularly those of which the land is most elevated, has the vestige of a volcano, which is called by the English \"The Sulphur,\" and by the French, \"Souffriere.\" Those in Guadaloupe and St. Lucia occasionally, though faintly, emit flames, and throw out ashes. The Souffriere of St. Vincent's, however, is the most majestic of them all. Its altitude is three thousand feet above the level of the sea, and the crater, which is, or rather was, on its side, about two-thirds of the way to the summit, exceeded half a mile in diameter, and was between four and five hundred feet in depth. In the centre of this hollow was a conical hill, two hundred feet in diameter, and three hundred in height, the lower half of which was fringed with brushwood, shrubs and vines, while the upper was strewed with virgin sulphur. At the base of it were two small lakes; the one sulphureous and aluminous, the other pure and tasteless. From the fissures of the cone exuded a thin white smoke, occasionally tinged with a light bluish flame. This was the only mark that\nsubterraneous fire was still in existence on the spot; there having been no eruption for more than ninety years. Evergreens, flowers, aromatic shrubs, and many alpine plants, clothed the steep sides of the crater; and, that nothing might be wanting to render the scene perfectly romantic, it was enlivened by the singularly melodious notes of a bird, never heard in any other part of the island, and which was generally called, and as generally believed to be, invisible. From its base to nearly its apex, the mountain was covered by an exuberant growth of forest trees. The whole scenery of the place was, indeed, in the highest degree, picturesque, and was the frequent resort of those who delighted to contemplate the beauties of nature. Almost to the very hour when it was destined to undergo a sudden and wonderful change, the mountain was ascended by parties of curious visitors, who perceived no other signs of the approaching tumult, than a stronger emission of the white vapours from the fissures of the conical hill at the bottom of the crater.\n\nAt noon, however, on the 27th of April, 1812, thirty-two days after the destruction of Carracass, a severe concussion of the earth, a tremulous noise in the air, and the bursting forth of a vast column of thick black ropy smoke from the crater, announced that the volcano had arisen from its century of repose. Volumes of sand, gritty particles of calcined earth, and favilla, darkened\nthe air like a cataract of rain, and covered the woods, ridges and cane-pieces, with light grey ashes, resembling snow thinly strewed with dust; which speedily destroyed every appearance of vegetation. For three days all these symptoms continued to increase. During this time the sun seemed to be in a total eclipse, the sea was discoloured, the ground bore a wintry appearance from the thick crust of fallen ashes, and the cattle were starving for want of their accustomed food. On the 30th, at noon, the column of smoke assumed a sanguine hue, rose with a livelier motion, and dilated itself more extensively, as if the volcano had nearly thrown off all its terrene obstructions. The noise became incessant, \"similar to the approach of thunder still nearer and nearer, with a vibration that affected the feelings and hearing;\" the Charaibs fled from their houses to the town, and the negroes from their work, and the very birds were beaten to the earth, overpowered by the sand and stones which were projected from the mountain. At length just as the day closed, the flame burst forth pyramidically from the crater. The thunder now grew deafening, and electric flashes, some like rockets, some like shells, darting in all directions, and in all forms, illumined the dense and mighty column of smoke, which, in spite of the wind, hung immovably over the volcano. In a short time, the lava poured out on the north-\nwest side. It was opposed there, by the acclivity of a higher point of land, but, being driven on by fresh accessions, it ascended and surmounted the obstacle, forming the figure V in a torrent of fire, plunged over the cliff, carrying down rocks and woods in its course, and finally precipitating itself into a vast ravine, at the foot of Morne Ronde. All this while, large globular bodies of fire were exploded from the crater, which burst, and either fell back into it, or among the surrounding bushes, which were instantly in a blaze. In about four hours the torrent of lava reached the sea; and shortly after another stream descended eastward, towards Rabacca. The first earthquake which had yet been felt now shook the island. It was followed by a shower of cinders, which fell like hail for two hours, and this was succeeded by a fall of stones, mingled with fire, which continued for an hour. Many houses were set on fire, many negroes were wounded, and some were killed; but, happily, the weight of the stones bore no proportion to their magnitude, or the sufferers from them would have been still more numerous than they were. During this awful period, the cracklings and coruscations from the volcano were insufferably loud and dazzling, and, \"earthquake followed earthquake almost momentarily, or rather the whole of that part of the island was in a continual state of oscillation;\"\u2014not agitated by shocks, vertical or horizontal; but undulated\nlike water shaken in a bowl.\" Thus the month of May opened in the deepest gloom; the sea and the island being wrapped in sulphureous clouds and impenetrable haze. At length, in the afternoon, the eruption ceased, and the mountain sunk gradually into a solemn silence. The volcano, however, still burned; and on the ninth of June, it again gave alarming signs of activity; but nothing more occurred than the throwing up of a quantity of stones and ashes, which fell back into the abyss whence they came.\n\nAll the former beauty of the Soufriere was, of course, obliterated. The conical mount disappeared, and an extensive lake of boiling water, whose agitated waves perpetually threw up vast quantities of black sand, supplied its place; new craters were formed to the north-east and south-west of the original crater, and the face of the mountain was entirely changed; the ascent, where it was formerly rugged and precipitous, being made level and easy, by the filling up of ravines and the removal of rocks. The Wallibou and Rabacca rivers were destroyed, their beds being filled up by the floods of melted lava. It was at first feared that the island would be rendered barren by the ashes which lay on its surface to a considerable depth; but it does not appear that they were ultimately productive of any injurious effect. Barbadoes, notwithstanding its distance, was also covered to the depth of\nfive inches with the same substance; and its inhabitants, on the last day of the eruption, were terrified by the coming on of such utter darkness that they were unable to perceive their hands when they held them up to their faces. This darkness continued of the same intensity for four hours and a half, and then slowly decreased.\n\nFrom disasters arising out of the order of nature, and eventually, perhaps, beneficial in their consequences, we must now turn to those which are brought by man upon himself, and which unlike natural disasters, seldom allow him to draw from them, in the end, the consoling reflection that present good has arisen from past evil. In the latter class of evils, conflagrations hold an eminent place.\n\nThe first event of this kind, which comes within the scope of this work occurred in Grenada, on the 15th of May, 1792. It broke out in the Carenage, just as the evening gun was fired from Richmond heights. A slight explosion announced it, which was followed by the bursting forth of a large column of fire from the roof of a house belonging to Messrs Stott and Tate. Though assistance was promptly obtained, yet, the houses being chiefly of wood, dried by the intense heat of the climate, and the place where the fire began being unfortunately to windward, the flames spread with an inconceivable rapidity. They extended their ravages for two hundred yards,\ntill they were brought to a stand by the pulling down of a wooden building; and the obstacle which was opposed to them by a stone one. Unfortunately, the wind now veered round, and directed the fire to the other side of the way, which, notwithstanding the street was between twenty, and thirty yards wide, was instantly in a blaze. Here the destruction was equal; and though several houses were blown up to arrest the flames, they continued their devouring course, till they were at length stopped by the stonework of the gaol. The damages on this occasion was immense; large quantities of property having been destroyed, and many thousand pounds worth of cotton, rum, and other colonial articles tumbled into the sea, the shore of which, on the preceding morning, appeared as if strewn with wrecks by a tremendous storm.\n\nMontego Bay, in Jamaica, was the next place which suffered by a calamity of this kind. In the beginning of June, 1792, fire broke out in North Street. It was occasioned by the sparks which flew from a forge among the straw of some packages. With such fury did it rage that, in a very short time, it extended itself in every direction, involving Harbour Street, North Street, West Street, South Street, the wharfs, and part of Market Street, in one common ruin. Nor could it be checked but by the blowing up of the Court house, and several other buildings.\nSo swiftly did the flames spread through the narrow streets, and so intolerable was the heat of them, that three engines out of four were abandoned by the workmen, who were unable to remove them. One hundred and ten of the best houses in the town were levelled with the ground. A hundred and fifty-five hogsheads and fifteen tierces of sugar, a hundred puncheons of rum, and an incalculable quantity of plantation stores, were either burnt on the wharf, or lost by being precipitated into the sea. The pecuniary injury which was done was estimated at not less than between three and four hundred thousand pounds.\n\nA liberal subscription was immediately raised for the sufferers by the colonists of Jamaica. The inhabitants, also, wisely availed themselves of this opportunity to improve their town. They widened and straightened some of the streets, opened new ones, and took the proper steps for the promoting of health and safety. Montego Bay arose more flourishing and beautiful from out of its ashes, and it remained uninjured till the month of June, 1808, when it was again threatened with destruction by the hostile element. A fire broke out, in the centre of Church Street, which consumed nearly the whole of that street, and of Market Street, with part of Cornwall and other streets. By dint of exertion, however, aided by the improvements which had been made,\nit was put a stop to, before it had spread desolation as widely as on the first occasion. The damage done was, nevertheless, considerable; the greatest part of the goods recently imported having been lost in the flames.\n\nIn the same year, the town of Puerto d'Espa\u00f1a, in the island of Trinidad, was likewise burned to the ground; an event which has been already narrated in one of the preceding chapters of these volumes.\n\nCastries, the capital of St. Lucia, was equally unfortunate. The conflagration commenced on the night of the sixth of April, 1813, in a small negro hut, on the north side of the town. It unluckily happened, that the wind blew so strong from that quarter, that it was impossible to stop the progress of the flames, or even to save more than a very small portion of the property of the inhabitants. Castries was, in a short time, reduced to a heap of smoking ruins.\n\nJamaica was the scene of the last event of this kind which remains to be noticed. In no part of the West Indies is there a town which, during a long course of years, has been so singularly unfortunate as that of Port Royal. Earthquakes, hurricanes and fires have combined to reduce it from a state of wealth and splendour to a state of comparative insignificance. The latest infliction of this kind which it sustained was from a fire, on the 19th of July, 1815, which broke\nout in a negro yard in Cannon Street, and quickly communicated to the surrounding buildings. The wind was high, and, in about half an hour, the burning materials having been wasted in all directions, the town was in flames in several parts. The conflagration raged for several hours; nor did it cease till it had nearly demolished this ill-fated place. The dock yard was saved, though with extreme difficulty. This, the fort, the barracks, the hospital, the church, and a few houses, were all of Port Royal that escaped from the devastating flames. Greatly to their honour, the merchants and planters of Jamaica lost not a moment in setting on foot a subscription for the relief of the sufferers, and it was filled with spirit and liberality; the sum subscribed at Kingston alone, in only five days, falling little short of eleven thousand pounds.\n\nTo contemplate the calamities which arise from physical causes is, no doubt, a painful task; but it is a still more painful one to contemplate those evils which have their origin in moral causes. In witnessing, or in meditating upon, hurricanes, earthquakes, or conflagrations, there is nothing which inspires a humiliating idea, nothing which makes man turn with disgust from his fellow man; such scenes, on the contrary, are calculated at once to soften and to elevate the mind, and to link the human race more closely together by the ties of sympathy: but\nthe sight, or the narrative, of mutinies and civil slaughter gives birth only to emotions of doubt, or anger, or abhorrence, and compels man, which ever party he may espouse, to regard some portion or other of his fellow-creatures with feelings of contemptuous or of a revengeful kind. To subjects of the latter ungrateful nature our attention must, however, now be directed.\n\nIt has already been mentioned, in the description of the newly ceded colonies, that, a short time previously to the peace of Amiens, an insurrection was on the point of breaking out in the island of Tobago. This insurrection was intended to take place on the night of Christmas, 1801, and the signal was to be the setting fire to the canes nearest to the dwelling-house of each estate. It was hoped that the appearance of the flames would induce the whites to hasten to the spot, and that they might then be murdered with little difficulty. The carnage was designed to extend not only to the planters, but also to such of the negroes as refused to join the standard of revolt. The intended insurgents were several thousands in number, while all the force which Brigadier-general Carmichael could muster did not exceed two hundred soldiers. Luckily he obtained a knowledge of the plot, just when it was on the point of being carried into execution, and his presence of mind enabled him to frustrate the plans of the conspirators without danger, and\nwithout any shocking effusion of human blood. Having seized thirty of the ringleaders, he ordered one of them to be hanged at daybreak the next morning, on the signal staff, and the body to be thirty times lowered and re-elevated, a signal gun being fired at each elevation. The insurgents, who at a distance witnessed the execution, were thus led to believe that one of their chiefs perished at each fresh raising of the body; and the salutary effect of this belief was, that, supposing themselves to be left without a leader, they surrendered or dispersed. For his firmness and wisdom on this occasion, Brigadier-general Carmichael deservedly received the thanks of the colonial legislature, together with the gift of a sword.\n\nNot so bloodless was the result of a mutiny which, a few months subsequently to this event, occurred at Prince Rupert's in Dominica. This mutiny broke out on the ninth of April, 1802, and, on many accounts, excited the most serious alarm, not only in the colony where it happened, but likewise in the neighbouring islands. It was entered into by the whole of the eighth West-India regiment; one of those regiments which consisted entirely of blacks. No previous complaints had, it seems, been made by any of the individuals which composed it; but it was subsequently ascertained that the grievances, which they alleged as the cause of their revolt, were\nsome deficiency in their food, some delay in the issuing of their pay, their having been employed to collect wood for the benefit, as they imagined; of their officers, and, still more, their having been ordered to drain a morass, which latter occupation would, they feared, be exceedingly unwholesome, and a work of time. It is probable, however, that all this would not have been sufficient to stimulate them to the desperate measure of a mutiny, had they not been further irritated by a false and wicked report that they were to be sold for slaves. On those who practically knew what it was to be slaves, and what it was to be free, such a report could not fail to be productive of a terrible effect. It was a lighted match to a charged mine.\n\nThe explosion burst forth by the mutineers falling upon their officers, the majority of whom they murdered in the most barbarous manner; only two of them being spared. It was not till the next day that the news of this catastrophe was received at Roseau. The governor, Colonel Cochrane Johnstone, instantly collected all the militia and regulars who were at hand, and dispatched them by sea to Prince Rupert's, while he called in reinforcements from more distant quarters. He himself sailed on the eleventh, and arrived at Prince Rupert's on the evening of the same day. The troops which he had sent forward, joined with the marines of some ships of\nwar which were in the bay, had already been engaged in skirmishing with the mutineers, and had succeeded in compelling them to keep within the limits of the port. A parley had also been entered into, and terms proposed. The negotiation was now continued, and it was at length agreed that the mutinous blacks should lay down their arms. When the governor entered, with five hundred men, to receive their submission, he found them drawn up on the parade with their two surviving officers in front. He then ordered them to ground their muskets, under pain of being attacked; but instead of yielding obedience to this order, they seized their arms, and prepared to resist. A heavy fire was immediately poured in upon them, and a furious contest ensued, which, however, was of short duration. The revolters were speedily broken, and they took flight in all directions. Some scrambled up the outer cabrit, others fled up the inner one, and, as they ran along the line on the ridge, they fired the cannon there upon their pursuers, and then threw themselves headlong down the precipitous rocks. In half an hour the mutiny was at an end. Sixty of the mutineers were killed, and three hundred and seventy, among whom were forty wounded, were made prisoners. A very few escaped into the woods and mountains. The loss of the whites was four slain, and twenty-four wounded.\nSeveral of the most criminal of the offenders were executed; but, in announcing these events to the public, the governor deemed it just, or politic, to assure the West-India regiments that his confidence in their fidelity remained unshaken, and that he was convinced that they would join with him in abhorrence of the cruel murders which their late comrades had committed.\n\nTrinidad, towards the close of the year 1805, narrowly escaped from being the scene of a sanguinary tragedy. The blacks in that island, encouraged, doubtless, by the success of their sable brethren in St. Domingo, formed a plan to render themselves masters of the colony, by the atrocious means of a general massacre of the white inhabitants. They are said to have made all the municipal, judicial, and other arrangements for their new government, and to have been, for a long while, occupied in the organization of a military force. Happily, however, their scheme was discovered in time to prevent the conspirators from making any attempt to carry it into execution. Martial law was proclaimed; the most rigorous measures were taken to provide for the safety of the island, and a severe punishment was promptly inflicted on the ringleaders of the projected revolt.\n\nThat the employment of negroes as soldiers was not without danger, had already been proved by the melancholy event which occurred in Do-\nA fresh proof was now given in the island of Jamaica. About the latter end of August, 1808, fifty-four Chamba and Koromantyn negroes, who had been purchased to serve in the colonial corps, broke out into mutiny at Fort Augusta, while under drill, and massacred two of their officers, Major Darley and Lieutenant Ellis, who rode up to them to enquire into the cause of the tumult. They were speedily chastised for their disobedience and barbarity. Fifteen of them were killed on the spot, five were wounded, and seven were afterwards executed. The reason which they assigned for their conduct was, that they were too often drilled, and that they were desirous of returning to their native country. It was a consolatory circumstance that this mutiny was confined to the new recruits, and that the second West-India regiment, not only took no part in it, but was active in suppressing it. The sole disagreeable consequence which sprung from this event was the dispute, which has already been mentioned, between the governor of the island and the House of Assembly.\n\nA danger of far greater magnitude threatened this colony in the succeeding year. A conspiracy was formed among the negroes, the object of which was to establish a government similar to that of St. Domingo. The means were to be, the firing of the towns, and the murdering of the white inhabitants. The execution of this\nplan, it is said, was to have been begun by setting fire to the town of Kingston, the flames from which were to be the signal of revolt to other quarters. The day fixed upon was St. Patrick's day, but, some disappointment having arisen, the attempt was postponed till the end of March. Before, however, the latter time arrived, the conspiracy was disclosed to the government, by one Burgess, a deserter from the second West-India regiment, who had been introduced to the meetings of the conspirators. Burgess, having luckily been apprehended, was sentenced to death for his desertion, and, just before the sentence was to be executed, he, most probably with the hope of saving his life, revealed the important secret which his friends had confided to him. The subject having been strictly examined into, it was found that his depositions were true, and he was consequently pardoned. Many of the conspirators were apprehended, and many of them absconded. Two of them, Peter Watkins, who was to have been commander in chief, with the lofty title of duke, and Sambo John, who held the humbler rank of captain, were brought to trial, and were found guilty upon satisfactory evidence. They were both executed; and thus ended the project of a negro republic in the island of Jamaica.\n\nIt seemed, at this period, as if the revolutionary spirit were destined to make the circuit of\nthe West-India islands. Guadaloupe and Martinico were now in our possession, and both of them were in a disturbed state. In the former colony, however, matters were not pushed as far as they were in the former. In Guadaloupe disaffection showed itself only in words and in an occasional disobedience of the laws; but in Martinico a plot was entered into for seizing the town of St. Pierre, and the success of this step would doubtless have led to more extensive operations. At the head of this plot was a free Mulatto of the name of Moliere. The design was discovered on the day previous to that which was appointed for carrying it into effect. Moliere, his flight being prevented, blew out his own brains, many of his principal accomplices, less courageous, were seized in arms, and fifteen of them were put to death.\n\nDuring the latter part of 1813, and a considerable part of 1814, Dominica was harassed by a maroon war. It appears that the interior fastnesses of that colony had not been ranged for nearly fifteen years, the consequence of which neglect was, that the runaway negroes increased in these intricate and secluded haunts, till they became formidable in point of numbers, and exceedingly troublesome to the white inhabitants, on whose property they daily committed extensive depredations. Nor were they contented with robbery alone. It is alleged against these fugitives that the governor having issued a proclama-\ntion, offering pardon to all runaways, they put to death, after a mock trial, the messengers whom he sent with it, tore out their hearts, dried the hearts by the smoke of their fires, and exhibited them at the entrance of their camps. In various other instances, also, they committed the most wanton and atrocious barbarities. Ample proof of their daringness is afforded by the circumstance of large parties of them having entered Roseau, plundered the houses, and retired without the colonists having ventured to attack them. In fact, they, in a manner held the town invested, and that so closely, that the senior member of the council, though residing only at the distance of half a mile from Roseau, was obliged to take shelter there with his family, and to request that a detachment of regulars might be sent for the protection of his estate. They followed this up by offering a reward of two thousand dollars for the head of the governor, carrying off the slaves who remained in obedience, putting to death those who attempted to escape from them, and making their camp an asylum for deserters, from the troops in garrison.\n\nIn this state of things, it was absolutely necessary to adopt decisive measures. Governor Ainslie, therefore, put the military force of the colony in motion, for the purpose of hunting down the maroons, in the woods, and mountains, which were their places of retreat. This was a toilsome and inglorious sort of warfare, and it\ncontinued for several months. At length, however, it was crowned with success; nearly the whole of the maroons being either killed in combat, taken prisoners, or compelled to come in and surrender.\n\nLittle or no notice of this war would, in all probability, have been taken in England, had not the governor, in the course of the contest, put forth a proclamation, one part of which could scarcely fail to provoke censure. This paper, after offering pardon to those who will lay down their arms, proceeds to state that \"the Rangers have orders to take no prisoners, but to put to death men, women and children, without exception.\" It is to be supposed, and it would be uncharitable not to suppose, that this menace was never intended to be acted upon, but was merely thrown out in the hope of intimidating the maroons into submission, by alarming them for the safety of those whom they naturally held dear. There can, nevertheless, be no doubt that it was flagrantly impolitic, nor that it was calculated to fix a stain upon the British character. In the Parliament the conduct of Governor Ainslie was severely canvassed; and the planters of Dominica were even said to have carried on hostilities against the maroons for the sole purpose of obtaining slaves by capture, since they could no longer procure them by the means of importation. From this charge, however, the planters seem,\nby a statement which they made public, to have vindicated themselves in a satisfactory manner. It is indeed obvious that, without risking their lives and properties, they could not allow the maroons to increase their bands, and to fix themselves firmly in the centre of the island. In consequence of the discussion which took place, the governor was called home, to give an explanation on the subject, and as, during his administration at Grenada as well as at Dominica, he had, in more than one instance, acted at least indiscreetly; he was not permitted to resume his authority in the colony of Dominica.\n\nThe insurrection in Barbadoes is the last occurrence which now remains to be noticed. This calamitous event took place on Easter Sunday, the 14th of April, 1816. The revolt broke out in St. Philip's parish, shortly after sun-set, and it extended, in the two following days, to the parishes of Christ Church, St. John and St. George. A conflagration, upon a high ridge of copse wood called Bishop's hill, in the parish of St. Philip's, was the first signal. Shortly after, the canes upon eight or nine of the surrounding estates were set on fire. Some few of the rebels were furnished with fire arms, and a scanty supply of ammunition, and the remainder were armed with swords, bludgeons, and such rude weapons as they had been able to procure. Their approach was announced by the beating of drums, the\nblowing of shells, and other discordant sounds. They demolished the houses of the overseers, destroyed the sugar works, and fired the canes. Their fury seems, indeed, to have been exercised rather upon inanimate objects than upon animated beings. Sixty estates were more or less damaged; many of them to a considerable amount.\n\nAs soon as the news reached Bridge-town, martial law was proclaimed, and the regulars and militia were called into the field. The insurgents had certainly formed no plan of operations on which to act, in case of their being attacked. They seem to have thought that this was a dispute between them and their masters, in which no part would be taken by the regular troops. In consequence of this absurd belief, they were more occupied in wandering about, to spread devastation around them, than in preparing for battle. It is no wonder, therefore, that they were speedily routed by the military force which was sent against them. Several hundreds of them were slain; and many of the most criminal of the prisoners were brought to trial, and paid the penalty of their crime.\n\nAt the moment of the explosion, Sir James Leith, the governor, was absent at Guadaloupe. On his return home, which he hastened as much as possible, he took what may be called the singular step of publishing an address to the slave population. The sentiments expressed in this\naddress, conciliatory and humane as they were, did honour to the feelings of the writer. The language was remarkable, inasmuch as it distinctly held out a hope, that the period, though far distant, would arrive, when the system of slavery would cease to exist. \"It is,\" said the governor, \"not necessary to go into the nature and origin of slavery, in order to decide on the impracticability of its abolition, where it actually exists, excepting by a wise and unremitting system of amelioration, by which it will gradually produce its own reformation. By such means alone, and not by the attempt of a rash and destructive convulsion, has slavery imperceptibly, safely and happily changed, in every country where it had ever existed, but has now ceased, from the beginning of the world to the present time.\" Few of the promoters of the abolition had said as much as this; none had said more.\n\nBy the planters and their agents this revolt was attributed entirely to the introduction of the slave registry bill into the British Parliament. It is stated, on their part, by Mr. Went, a gentleman of Barbadoes, who assisted in the examination of many of the prisoners, that \"a free-coloured man, named Joseph Pitt Washington Franklin, aided by three or four other coloured free men, had for several months previous attended the nocturnal meetings of the slaves on\nseveral of the estates where the insurrection began, with newspapers which they said were English, and had been received from England; containing the information that a law had been passed there, making them free, and that they had only to demand their manumissions, which he said had arrived, but were withheld from them by their owners, under the advice of the attorney-general of the island, but which the governor, Sir James Leith, had power on his arrival to force their owners to give them; that he recommended them to endeavour to obtain this manumission by setting fire to the canes, &c.; if then withheld, to proceed to the destruction of the buildings, assuring them, that as their freedom had been given to them by the king, the king's troops would not be employed against them. A standard was taken from a party of the insurgents by the commandant, Colonel Codd, containing the figure of a general officer, whom one of the witnesses described as intended for the king, passing a crown to the hands of a black man, who has, hanging on his arm, a white woman. In a scroll, beneath these figures, is the following motto, in broken English:\u2014\"Brittanie are happy to assist all such friends as endeavoursance.\" This witness told Mr. Went, in explanation of the motto, \"that Great Britain would assist the slaves, if they would endeavour to obtain their liberty themselves.\" This gentleman adds, \"that he\nhas no difficulty in asserting, that the insurrection arose from the introduction of the slave registry bill into the House of Commons,\" and he logically declares that \"he is supported in this assertion by the confessions of very many of the prisoners, who declared to him, that they should never have thought of doing as they had done, if they had not been informed that they had been made free in England; for they were very well treated by their owners, and very happy.\"\n\nNow, admitting the veracity of the witnesses, it is manifest that all this proves nothing more than that the meaning of a proposed law had been wickedly mis-stated to the negroes, and that, in consequence of this mis-statement the negroes had broken out into revolt. But what has this to do with the question of the law itself, or what valid argument against the law can the planters deduce from such premises? The slave registry act contained not a sentence which could be construed to indicate an intention of emancipating the slaves; and it was, therefore, guiltless of the melancholy catastrophe which it is said to have occasioned. The planters may not, perhaps, perceive the glaring absurdity of their reasoning, if reasoning it may be called; but the common sense of the rest of mankind cannot fail clearly to see, that it goes to this monstrous extent, that the Parliament must never listen to any proposition relative to the situation of the slaves,\nand that all British writers must be prohibited from touching upon this delicate subject; because their intentions may possibly be misrepresented in the West Indies, and such misrepresentation may possibly be productive of another revolt. If, in deference to this new tropical principle, nothing is to be uttered or written, but that of which the sense is incapable of being perverted by designing men, the pen and the tongue may slumber in a long repose. It is, to say the least of it, unwise in the planters to broach doctrines which not only extinguish all sympathy, but likewise inevitably give birth to the feelings of contempt or of indignation. After having performed their duties to those who are under their control, let them trust their cause to the candour of their countrymen, and they will not stand in need of a more powerful advocate.\nSUPPLEMENT\n\nTO THE\n\nHISTORY OF ST.

As the character and origin of the sable chief are but slightly touched on by Mr. Edwards, it is necessary that the reader should be made better acquainted with them, before he proceeds in the narrative. Toussaint was born about the year 1745, in the north of St. Domingo, on the plantation of the Count de No\u00e9, at no great distance from Cape Fran\u00e7ois. Only three circumstances are known respecting the early years of his life. These are his unalterable patience, his mildness to brute animals, and his attachment and inviolable fidelity to one female, whom he had chosen as his wife. The regularity of his conduct attracted the notice, and won the good-will of M. Bayou de Libertas, the bailiff or manager of the plantation. Through the kindness of this benevolent manager, or, as some\n\n* Vol. III. p. 426.\naffirm, through his own unaided efforts, he learned to read and to write, and obtained a sufficient knowledge of arithmetic; acquirements so uncommon in a slave, that they made him the wonder of his companions. M. Bayou now took him from the field; and gave him the place of his postillion; a place comparatively respectable, in which he could both acquire money, and find leisure to cultivate the talents that he possessed. His reading became tolerably extensive, and his ideas proportionably enlarged. His situation, too, was again ameliorated, by further promotion.\n\nWhen the insurrection broke out, in 1791, Toussaint was eagerly solicited to act in concert with them, by several of the leaders who were his friends. It is probable that gratitude to his benefactor was the cause that prevented him from yielding to their solicitations. That he did not yield is certain. The flame of revolt, however, soon extended so widely, that the white planters were compelled to fly before it. Among those who lingered latest in St. Domingo was M. Bayou. His flight was indeed so long delayed, that it would at last have been impracticable, had not Toussaint secured it, though with some danger to himself. Nor did he content himself with merely saving the life of his benefactor. He shipped with him a quantity of colonial produce, sufficient for the supply of his\nfuture wants; and when M. Bayou was finally settled at Baltimore, Toussaint seized upon every opportunity to make further remittances.\n\nThere was now nothing to prevent Toussaint from fighting under the standard of his countrymen. He accordingly joined Biassou, one of the negro chiefs, and was appointed his second in command. It was not long before Biassou, whose cruelty was equal to his courage, was degraded from his authority, which he had abused; and Toussaint was appointed in his stead. The death or resignation of the other chiefs, and the superior talents of Toussaint, eventually raised him to the rank of principal leader of the negro army.\n\nThe war carried on by the negroes against the whites, for the recovery of their freedom, had not long been terminated, by the complete attainment of its purpose, before another war broke out of a different nature. This second war was waged by the partisans of royalty against those of democracy, and the numbers on each side were, perhaps, nearly equal. Toussaint espoused the monarchical cause, and was one of its most strenuous and valuable defenders. So highly were his services estimated by the Spanish government, with which, as one of the allies, he acted in concert, that he received from it the rank of general, and other honours. He soon, however, discovered that the great object of most of the\nplanters who fought on the side of monarchy was merely to rivet once more the chains of his noble brethren; and he, therefore, wisely resolved to withdraw his powerful aid from a cause which was intended to be converted into an instrument of treachery and oppression. The result of this was, that he and his followers joined the republican banners, and were gladly received by General Laveaux, who is supposed to have done much towards bringing about this juncture, and to whom Toussaint continued ever afterwards to be firmly attached. Disinterested, honourable and brave, Laveaux did, indeed, merit the friendship which was felt for him by his new companion in arms.\n\nThe person of Toussaint was manly. He was above the middle size, with a penetrating eye, a striking countenance, and with manners alike calculated, as occasion might require, to conciliate affection, or command respect. Active in all his movements, he was an excellent horseman, travelled with astonishing rapidity, slept little, and indulged still less in the pleasures of the table. He had a strong memory, an acute understanding, and an indefatigable industry. Personal revenge for injuries done to him he never gratified, he committed no acts of tyranny in his public character, perfidy he detested, and even his enemies were compelled to acknowledge that his word was always religiously held sacred.\n\nSuch was the man in whose hands was the\nsupreme authority over the French part of St. Domingo, after the departure of the British. For a while, indeed, his rival, Rigaud, who was at the head of the mulattos, maintained a sanguinary contest with him for supremacy, but was at length entirely defeated, and expelled from the island. The commissioners, sent by the Directory, still continued there, but, though they were always treated with that external deference which seemed to be due to them, on account of the nominal rank which they held, they were, in fact, mere cyphers, without the shadow of influence of any kind, and were forced to lean upon Toussaint for support, instead of exercising, as they were intended to do, any control over his actions.\n\nHaving no longer an enemy to contend with, Toussaint now turned his attention to heal the wounds which had been inflicted on his country by a long and obstinate war. Cultivation, and its attendant commerce, became the prominent objects of his care. The ports were opened to foreign vessels, which were invited to traffic for articles of colonial produce. Great Britain immediately sanctioned a trade between Jamaica and St. Domingo, and a similar step was shortly afterwards taken by the president of the United States.\n\nNo vestige of slavery, of course, any longer existed. But the blacks, nevertheless, were not allowed to waste their lives in a mischievous\nTHE HISTORY OF ST. DOMINGO.\n\nindolence. They were employed as hired servants, and, that no disputes might arise, their remuneration was fixed by law at a third part of the crops; a rate which could not fail to give an ample reward to their labours. No civil courts as yet existed, and consequently idle vagrants, like deserters, were subject to a court-martial, which, however, could sentence them to no severer punishment than serving in the army. The beneficial result of these arrangements was speedily visible. The plantations were again brought into a fertile state, the sugar-works and distilleries were rebuilt, and, in little more than a year, the exports of St. Domingo were raised from the lowest ebb, to one third of what their extent had been in the most prosperous periods. Another striking proof of general improvement was shown in the population, which, from its enjoyment of numerous additional comforts, was increasing with wonderful rapidity.\n\nSociety assumed in this new and anomalous kind of republic a more polished aspect than was to be expected from the nature of its constituent parts. Among the rich classes, there was much splendor and luxury, not wholly without taste, and a considerable degree of politeness and attention to etiquette. Among the poorer, there was a spirit of kindness, hospitality, and attachment to domestic life, and little propensity to the commission of crimes. Books were not uncom-\nmon in the cottages of the labourers. Dramatic exhibitions and music were encouraged, the churches were re-opened, and public worship was performed, with all the dazzling ceremonies of the Romish communion.\n\nThe military establishment which, at the time when the British quitted the island, was about forty thousand men, was soon swelled to more than double that number. The troops were excellently disciplined, and there seemed to be no want of skill on the part of their commanders. Many of their manoeuvres were admirably adapted to the peculiar nature of the ground on which they were to be made, and they were executed with a celerity and precision that would not have disgraced an European army. Though, when not on duty, the soldiers and officers were on a footing of perfect equality, yet, in the field, a proper military subordination was strictly observed.\n\nHaving now an interval of leisure, Toussaint resolved to make a tour round the island, for the two-fold purpose of visiting the various posts, and also of taking possession of the city of Santo Domingo, which still remained under the Spanish authority, though the rest of the colony had been given up to the French, in pursuance of the treaty of Basle. His reception, as he journeyed through the territory over which he ruled, was of the most flattering kind; young and old, of all classes,\nhurrying to meet him, and vying in their expressions of esteem and fidelity. The Spanish governor, Don Joachim Garcia, at first refused to deliver up the capital of the Spanish part of the island to any but native French troops. He was, however, soon convinced of the inutility of resistance, and the keys of the city were accordingly put into the hands of the negro chief. Having accomplished this important object, and made in his progress a variety of beneficial regulations, as well civil and commercial as military, Toussaint returned to the Cape, where he was universally hailed by the loudest acclamations.\n\nIt was now, for more than one reason, become necessary that a regular form of government should be established in St. Domingo. Independently of the manifest impropriety of allowing a free people to remain under military rule, there were circumstances in the conduct of France, which made it wise to put the seal to the liberty of the island. It was by no means difficult to perceive that the successful general, who had seized upon the reins of authority over the republic, was no friend to the state of things existing at present in the West Indian colonies. The new constitution, which was framed after the triumph of Buonaparte over the Directory, shut out from the French senate the representatives of St. Domingo; an ominous exclusion, which naturally proved offensive in no common\ndegree. It was also believed that the consuls had an intention, as was afterwards shewn to be the fact, of restoring slavery in the Windward Islands, a scheme which could leave little room for doubt that the same measure would be extended still further at a convenient opportunity. Toussaint, therefore, resolved to defeat this plan, by forming a constitution, which should place the freedom of his country upon a solid foundation.\n\nIn this great and beneficial work he was aided by many Europeans of talent, whom his liberality had drawn around him. Among these was M. Pascal, a descendant of the family of the celebrated mathematician and author of the Provincial Letters, the Abb\u00e9 Moli\u00e8re, and an Italian ecclesiastic of the name of Mariniti. When their labours were completed, the result of them was submitted to an assembly of representatives, summoned from every district in the island. The form of constitution was unanimously approved of, and it was accordingly promulgated, with due ceremony, on the first of July, 1801. By this constitutional instrument the supreme executive power was entrusted to a governor-general, who was also to have the command of the land and sea forces, and the power of proposing the laws to the central assembly. His sway was to last only five years, with the sole exception in favour of Toussaint, that he should hold his office for life, and should have the privi-\nlege of nominating the person who was to succeed him for the next five years after his decease. The right of nominating was thenceforth to belong to the central assembly. This assembly was to consist of two deputies from each department to sit five years, and its fiat was necessary to give validity to the acts which were to be proposed by the governor-general. The island was, in truth, to enjoy a virtual independence, but a sort of paramount sovereignty, and the exclusive right of commerce with the inhabitants were assigned to France, whose future authority was, it seems, to be rather that of guardianship than that of absolute dominion. Still, her supremacy was unequivocally admitted, and the sanction of her assent was asked for the changes which had taken place.\n\nShortly after these important arrangements had been completed, a melancholy event occurred, which must have been a severe trial to the feelings of Toussaint, and which, with unparalleled baseness, was converted into a theme of calumny against him, by the very class of men in whose behalf he had done what nothing but a high sense of duty could have induced him to perform. General Moise, who was his nephew, his friend, and second in command, revolted, and prevailed upon several officers, and a part of the army, to join him in his revolt. Their object,\nhowever, was not to deprive Toussaint of his authority, but to put to death all the whites, many of whom they did actually murder in cold blood. Their insurrection was speedily crushed, and Toussaint, inexorable to treachery and barbarity, was, in this case, deaf to the cries of relationship and friendship. Moise and thirty of his guilty companions were brought before a court-martial, by which, their crime having been clearly proved, they were sentenced to death. The governor did not think it proper to interpose his clemency, to save men who had shown none, and they were in consequence publicly executed at the Cape. On this occasion, Toussaint issued a long address to the people, to explain his conduct; and to impress on their minds the absolute necessity of industry and education, and of a strict performance of domestic, moral and religious duties. The execution of Moise was, nevertheless, subsequently blazoned forth to the world by the French, as being an act of the most unprovoked and atrocious tyranny.\n\nThat Toussaint, while he was laudably anxious to secure the freedom of his native land, was at the same time sincerely desirous that France should procure from St. Domingo every colonial and commercial advantage which it could afford to her, there seems to be no reason whatever to doubt. That he should cherish a wish to retain\nthe high station which he so well deserved; and to which he had been raised by the unanimous voice of his countrymen, was naturally to be expected, and the wish was prompted by an ambition of no dishonourable kind. There was doubtless no one who could so effectually as himself complete the work which he had so wisely begun. But, further than the retention of his authority, and the preventing of a return to the former order of things, he assuredly did not intend to go. His language was always warmly in favour of the mother country, if so that country may be called; he had formally acknowledged his subordination to her government, and he had given a sort of pledge for his fidelity, by sending his children to France for education, an example which was followed by several of his generals.\n\nBut a conditional occupation, a modified sovereignty, was not the object of the first consul. He was surrounded by colonial proprietors, who were irritated by their sufferings and losses; and eager to recover all their ancient tyrannical power, that they might satisfy their thirst of vengeance. Their importunity was loud and incessant, and they represented the conquest of the colony as being a work of certain and easy accomplishment. The pride of the persons in authority also came in aid of these clamours. It seemed to them, that there was something of\ndisgrace in being dictated to by men who had so recently been in the most servile of all conditions, and who were still looked upon with a scornful eye, as belonging to an inferior order of human beings. But it is probable that, above all, one idea had a predominating influence in the mind of the French ruler. On the restoration of peace, a numerous army would become useless abroad, and therefore formidable at home, and great numbers of officers, whom it would be next to impossible adequately to reward, and yet dangerous to treat with neglect, would be left wholly unemployed, and might, perhaps, feel disposed to exert their talents and courage in overthrowing that form of government which had so recently been established. A war in St. Domingo would find employment for these restless spirits; for the purpose of carrying it on, it would be easy to select that part of the army which was least to be trusted; and even defeat would have one beneficial effect, that of furnishing an additional opportunity to thin the ranks of the disaffected, by dispatching as reinforcements all those who were of doubtful allegiance.\n\nThe signing of the preliminaries of peace with England at length offered to the first consul an opportunity of carrying his plan into execution. In the harbours of Brest, L'Orient, and Rochefort, twenty-six ships of war, and a crowd of\ntransports, were equipped, and an army, consisting of five and twenty thousand men, the whole of them chosen soldiers, was embarked with all the apparatus of military slaughter. It was in vain that the colonial deputies who, although divested of their representative character, still remained in France, entreated the government to pause before it excited the suspicions and irritated the passions of the blacks, by sending over a force which was manifestly too numerous to be intended for any other purpose than that of bending the colony once more under the yoke of slavery. Their prayers and remonstrances were heard with silent disdain. At the same time, as if to leave no room for doubt, as to the manner in which the troops were to be employed, all the enemies of Toussaint, and even those whom he had banished for the greatest crimes, were collected together, to form a part of this ominous expedition. Writings of a nature qualified to awaken all the fears of the negroes were also profusely circulated, and were at last tolerated, and perhaps encouraged. General Le Clerc, the brother-in-law of the first consul, was appointed captain-general, and authorized to supersede Toussaint; General Rochambeau, who governed the colony in 1793, and was notoriously hostile to the liberty of the blacks, was made second in command.\n\nIn order to obtain a sure footing in the island,\nthe semblance of pacific intentions was, nevertheless, to be preserved for a while. A proclamation was, therefore, addressed to the inhabitants of St. Domingo, in which they were told that, \"whatever might be their origin or colour, they were all French, all free, and all equal, before God, and before the republic,\" and they were fraternaly invited to embrace the new comers, and to rejoice to see again their friends and brothers of Europe. Yet even here, through the thin veil of simulated kindness, a peremptory and menacing spirit was plainly visible. It was declared, that the captain-general had brought with him \"numerous forces to protect them against their enemies, and the enemies of the republic,\" and it was added, \"that whoever shall dare to separate himself from him would be a traitor, who should be devoured by the anger of the mother country, as the fire devoured the dried canes.\" The proclamation, of course, did not specify who were the enemies who could not be kept down without an army of twenty-five thousand men, but in case any one, as was naturally to be expected, should say \"these forces are destined to ravish your liberty from you,\" it instructed the people to answer, \"the republic will not suffer it to be taken from us.\"\n\nThis proclamation was accompanied by a letter, from the first consul, to Toussaint. The\nletter was not an unartful composition. It spoke briefly of the services of the sable chief; it professed esteem for him on behalf of the writer, it held out to him the prospect of rewards and honours, and it asked the assistance of his counsel, influence and talents, for the captain-general. Yet there was occasionally a tone of haughtiness and menace, which shewed that, in the other parts of the epistle, the real sentiments of the author were greatly at variance with his language. The hints respecting the \"necessary forces to make the sovereignty of the French people be respected,\" and likewise about \"the cruel war\" which would be the consequence of disobedience, could not possibly be mistaken. That the letter might produce the stronger effect, it was to be presented by Coisonon, the preceptor of Toussaint's two sons, who was now sent over with them, and who was to deliver it to the father, at the same moment in which he restored to him his children.\n\nHow far Toussaint had lately speculated on the probability of so formidable an armament being dispatched from France, or to what extent he had carried his preparations for resistance, are points which have given rise to much dispute, but which never have been, and probably never will be, ascertained. It is asserted, on the one hand, that he had clearly foreseen, and fully\nprovided against the hostile measures of the first consul; while, on the other, it is maintained, with no less pertinacity, that he was not aware of the storm which was ready to burst upon him, and, that such was his confidence in the policy or the gratitude of France, that he even imprisoned one of the deputies of the colony who, on his recent return home, had spread reports which had a tendency to excite, in the minds of the blacks, suspicions as to the real designs of the French government. From various circumstances, the latter opinion appears to be that which is the most probable. It is certain that, when the armament did arrive, he was by no means in such a state of preparation as, from his known prudence and his resources, he might have been expected to be, had he obtained timely notice of the full extent of his danger.\n\nIt was on the twenty-ninth of January, 1802, that the French squadron arrived off the peninsula of Samana, whence it steered its course towards Cape Fran\u00e7ois. On the route thither, General Kervezeau was dispatched, with a part of the ships and troops, to take possession of the city of Santo Domingo. It was next arranged that General Rochambeau should proceed to Fort Dauphin, with one division; General Boudet to Port-au-Prince, with another; and the captain-general, with the remainder, to Cape Fran\u00e7ois, the capital of the colony.\nThe division of Rochambeau, having a shorter distance to pass over, was the first to effect its landing. The disembarkation took place, on the third of February, in the bay of Mancenille, not far from Fort Dauphin. It is said, by the French, that they were violently opposed, and that they were compelled to come to extremities with the blacks, before they could accomplish their mission. On the other side, it is contended that they sent no summons, but wantonly attacked the negroes, who had run in crowds to see them come on shore, and had no suspicion that hostilities were intended. Be this as it may, the invaders were completely successful in that quarter, as the whole of the forts were in their possession by the close of the day.\n\nWhile this was going on, Le Clerc arrived off Cape Fran\u00e7ois, and prepared to disembark the troops. Christophe, who commanded there, immediately sent an officer on board, to inform the French general that no disembarkation would be suffered, till instructions arrived from Toussaint, who was then in the interior; and that an attempt to land by force would occasion the burning of the town, and the leading into captivity of the white inhabitants. Le Clerc endeavoured to intimidate Christophe; but the latter, in spirited language, replied to him, that he would perform his duty. A deputation from the whites then went on board, to implore Le Clerc to suspend\nhis hostile movements, and thus save their property and their persons. To this prayer, however, he refused to listen. As soon as he was informed of Rochambeau's success, he disembarked his army near Point du Limb\u00e9, a few miles to the westward of the Cape. Knowing that, as the whites were universally inclined to join the invaders, the town was not tenable, Christophe executed his threat of setting it on fire, and then retreated without loss, taking with him, as hostages, about two thousand of the inhabitants.\n\nThe French were equally fortunate on the remaining points of attack. Kerveveau was received at St. Domingo without opposition. At Port-au-Prince, the division of Boudet accomplished its object, on the fifth, after a trifling resistance on the part of the blacks; and General Humbert, who, after the capture of the Cape, was dispatched to Port de Paix, by Le Clerc, became master of the town and forts with little difficulty. All the French divisions had thus obtained a footing in St. Domingo. In the course of a few days they were reinforced by the arrival of 2300 men from Toulon.\n\nPreviously to pursuing his operations in the interior of the country, and perhaps in the hope that his formidable force, and the vigour which he had displayed, had inspired such terror as to render them unnecessary, Le Clerc thought it\nproper to try what effect these circumstances, the sight of his two sons, and the letter of the first consul, would produce upon Toussaint. Coisnon was accordingly sent on this errand, with instructions to press the instant journey of Toussaint to the Cape, and to bring back the children, in case he could not succeed. When he reached Ennery, the residence of Toussaint, the sable chief was absent in a distant part of the island, whence he did not return till the second day. Coisnon availed himself of this delay; to work upon the feelings of the wife and mother. Toussaint met his children with rapture, and they shed tears in each other's embrace. For a while he was shaken by their solicitations, and the tears of their mother. But, at length, confirmed in his original suspicions by the conduct and language of Coisnon, who over-acted his part, he disengaged himself from the clasp of his wife and sons, took the preceptor into another apartment, and said to him, \"Take back my children, since it must be so. I will be faithful to my brethren and my God.\" Unwilling to risk another interview with his children, he then mounted his horse, and rode to the camp. A correspondence was subsequently opened with him by Le Clerc, but it did not accomplish its object.\n\nThis having failed, Le Clerc determined upon a vigorous prosecution of hostilities. As a pre-\nliminary, he issued a proclamation, by which he outlawed Toussaint and Christophe, the former of whom he denominated \"an insensible monster.\" At the same time he promised, that all cultivators who had taken up arms, should be considered as \"children who had strayed,\" provided they promptly returned to their plantations; that liberty should be given to the people of the island; and that the soldiery who would abandon Toussaint should be received into the French army. Every other means which he could devise was also employed to shake the fidelity of the chiefs and followers of Toussaint. They were not only assailed by the seduction of praises, promises and rewards, but he was held up to their hatred, as a man who was wantonly plunging them into all the perils and horrors of war, for no better purpose than to gratify his own malevolent feelings, his ambition and his interest.\n\nThese arts were not without their intended effect. The indolent and the timid dreaded the consequences of war, and were, therefore, willing to believe that it was unnecessary; the credulous confided in the assurances of the French, and, of course, believed the same; and those who thought themselves neglected by Toussaint, or who had been punished by him for their crimes, were glad of an opportunity to take vengeance, by connecting themselves with his enemies. The result of these feelings was some immediate defections\nfrom the standard of the black leader. Among\nthe first of those who deserted him were Gene-\nrals Ag\u00e9 and Clerveau, the latter of whom, a\nmulatto, commanded in the department of Cibao.\nThis example was shortly after followed by Ge-\nneral Laplume, to whom had been entrusted the\ndefence of the southern quarter of the island.\n\nLe Clerc put his troops in motion on the sev-\nenteenth of February, the same day on which he\nissued his proclamation. While he and Rocham-\nbeau moved onward, from the Cape and Fort\nDauphin, into the interior, General Boudet was\nto perform the same operation from Port au\nPrince; and General Debelles was to attack, and\ndrive back upon Gonaives, the black general,\nMaurepas, who still held an entrenched position\nnear Port de Paix, and had repeatedly defeated\nthe division of General Humbert. Le Clerc\nsoon found that the task which they had to ac-\ncomplish was by no means an easy one. \"One\nmust,\" said he, \"be acquainted with the country,\nin order to form a competent idea of the difficul-\nties that are to be struggled with in every en-\ncounter. I experienced nothing in the Alps to\nbe compared with them.\" Of these local ob-\nstacles the blacks made a judicious use. They\nconcealed themselves in the woods and defiles,\nfell upon the heads and flanks of the advancing\ncolumns, and, when repulsed, effected a safe\nretreat to their inaccessible hills. In this way\nthey harassed and weakened the enemy, without exposing themselves to any serious defeat.\n\nThe French, however, as was to be expected from their numbers and superior tactical skill, succeeded in forcing back their sable antagonists, and penetrating some distance into the country. The divisions from the Cape and Fort Dauphin reached Plaisance, Dondon, and St. Raphael. General Christophe, after a gallant resistance, was under the necessity of retiring from the strong position of Marinalade, in consequence of the loss of the important post of the Morne at Bospen, which is said to have been traitorously surrendered by the officer who was entrusted with its defence. The chief of the district of Plaisance likewise betrayed his trust, and went over to the French with five hundred men.\n\nOn the side of Port au Prince, the invaders were at first not equally fortunate. Boudet marched to Croix des Bouquets, which, on his approach, the negroes deserted and set on fire. While he was preparing to continue his rout, his attention was suddenly called off in another direction. Dessalines, who commanded in this quarter, made a feint of retiring to the Montagne des Grands Bois; but, by a rapid march, he passed the Montagne Noire, and fell upon Leogane, which he burnt, before the French could arrive to oppose him. This done, he withdrew to Jacquelin. The defection of General\nLaplume obliged him, however, to quit this part of the country, and retreat to Grands Bois. Boudet then moved forward, and took possession of St. Marc, or rather of that part of it which remained undestroyed.\n\nDebelle was, at the outset, not more lucky than his predecessor, Humbert, had been. He attacked the entrenchments of Maurepas; but, after a desperate contest, he was defeated with heavy loss. Anxious to remove this hostile division from its station on his right flank, Le Clerc prepared to march in person, at the head of a large reinforcement, in order to co-operate with Debelle. But this movement was rendered unnecessary. A negociation had already been opened with Maurepas, and the designs of the French had been represented to him in the fairest colours. Deceived by their protestations, he now consented to join them, with his four thousand men, on condition that the promises made by the proclamation of the captain-general should be faithfully observed.\n\nLe Clerc, meanwhile, continued, though slowly, his progress. On the 21st of February, one of his divisions attacked Ennery, which was defended by Christophe. The position was carried by the assailants, and the black general was compelled to fall back to Bayonnai, having, however, had the satisfaction of cutting off a French corps. Being pursued to Bayonnai, by\nthe division of Salm, he withdrew from that post on the following day, and retired to the Morne, leaving a part of one of his magazines in the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe French had not yet come to an engagement with the blacks under Toussaint in person. They were now to meet him. He was posted in the Ravine \u00e0 Couleuvre, a position of remarkable strength, which he had still further secured by abatis and other means of defence. His regular force consisted of fifteen hundred grenadiers, twelve hundred other troops, and four hundred dragoons; to which were added about two thousand cultivators, who were stationed on the wooded eminences, where they could be most useful in opposing the progress of the enemy. The contest was long, and both sides displayed much bravery and skill. The French themselves confessed, that the troops of Toussaint fought with great courage and obstinacy, and that it was a combat of man to man. As usual they claimed a victory, and asserted that the black chief was driven from the field, with the loss of eight hundred men. The battle was, in fact, a drawn battle; Le Clerc retiring to Gonaises, and Toussaint to the banks of La Petite Riviere.\n\nThough Le Clerc had not yet achieved much by the sword, he had, by other means, made no small progress in accomplishing his purpose. In the various actions which had taken place, Tous-\nTHE HISTORY OF ST. DOMINGO.\n\n... had undoubtedly sustained a considerable loss of regular troops; not, however, sufficient to prevent him from keeping the field; had this been his only loss. But it was trifling in comparison with that which arose from the desertion of the chiefs and troops who fought under his standard. The example of Clerveaux and Laplume became, as it were, infectious. It was daily followed by other officers and bands, who either went over to the enemy, or retired to their homes. The negroes, indolent by nature, began, in fact, to grow tired of a war that deprived them of the comforts to which they had been lately accustomed; and which, besides, many of them believed to be persisted in by their leader for his own benefit, in direct opposition to their interests and repose. The French had not yet undeceived them, as to the fate which was intended for them.\n\nThe ranks of Toussaint were, by this means, thinned in such a manner that, by the end of February, he was no longer able to keep the field; his remaining force consisting principally of cultivators, who were badly armed, and worse disciplined. Yet he determined still to hold out, in the hope that the designs of the invaders would soon be unmasked, and that he should then see his countrymen eager to atone for their misconduct, by renewed and more vigorous efforts. Though not able to make head against the enemy...\nin general engagements, he was able to harass, alarm, and weaken them, by incessant movements and attacks. He availed himself of his thorough knowledge of the fastnesses, to burst unawares upon the French, to cut off their small and straggling parties, and to retire beyond the reach of pursuit as soon as he had stricken a blow. A war of this kind, though it affords but little scope for description, is exceedingly wearisome, disheartening, and destructive to those against whom it is carried on.\n\nOne strong position, however, the blacks still retained, and this Toussaint was resolved should be defended as obstinately as possible. It was the fort and Mornes of Crete \u00e0 Pierrot, between Port au Prince and St. Marc, and about eight leagues distance from the latter place. Dessalines was entrusted with the defence of this last hold. In the beginning of March, Le Clerc removed his head quarters to Port au Prince, in order to be nearer to the scene of operations. Nearly the whole of the French army was employed either in the siege, or in occupying an extensive chain of posts, to prevent the escape of the besieged, or the introduction of succours. The French generals now began to give a loose to their love of cruelty. Six hundred negroes were surrounded and every one of them bayonetted by General Hardy; a similar slaughter was made at Trianon by General d'Henin; and a\nthird instance was shortly afterwards added to the number, by General Salins, who with a strong division surprised a small negro camp, and put to death every individual who was unable to effect his escape. Rochambeau, at the same time, carried fire and sword through the surrounding villages, murdering indiscriminately men and women, whether armed or unarmed. These acts of barbarity did not, however, pass entirely unpunished. In more than one encounter, the columns of the French were met by Dessalines; were routed, and pursued with heavy vengeance. The invaders at last succeeded in circumscribing him within the limits of the fort. Their attacks were vigorously pushed on, but they were so strenuously opposed that they advanced with extreme slowness. Finding, nevertheless, towards the end of March, that the place would speedily be no longer tenable, Dessalines sallied forth with the majority of his forces, penetrated the enemy's lines, and made good his retreat. Three days afterwards, the remainder of the garrison attempted, in like manner, to break through the beleaguering army. But the besiegers were now on their guard. Only a small part of the garrison was successful in opening its passage; the other part was hemmed in, and massacred without mercy. The reduction of Crete \u00e0 Pierrot is said to have been purchased by the assailants at the expense of three thousand men, and several of their best generals.\nThe fall of Crete & Pierrot seems to have been considered by Le Clerc as a circumstance which was decisive with respect to the subjugation of the blacks, and which, therefore, rendered it unnecessary any longer to conceal his real intentions. The soldiery had already shown in what manner they were disposed to act. Thus assured of the temper of his army, and believing that resistance was at an end on the part of his enemies, he issued an order, by which he restored to the proprietors, or their attorneys, all their ancient authority over the negroes belonging to their estates.\n\nNever was so important a step taken with so little foresight as was displayed in this instance. The order given by Le Clerc opened the eyes of every class of the negro population. The cultivators discovered that they were again enslaved, and the negro soldiers had reason to believe that the promises which had been made to them would be no better kept than those which had been made to their unarmed brethren. The soldiery, however, could not immediately resent this treachery by an appeal to arms; for they had been broken into small parties, which were kept asunder and closely watched. Opportunity, nevertheless, was all that was wanting, to rally them once more round the standard of Toussaint.\n\nThis was the state of things to which Toussaint had looked forward, and, now that it was arrived, he hastened to turn it to advantage.\nDescending with several hundred men from his fastnesses, and joining Christophe, who was at the head of three hundred regular troops, he marched rapidly towards the north of the island, collecting at every step his partisans, who were in great numbers, and eager to punish the perfidy of the French. His force speedily became formidable. Having routed the division of Desfourneaux, at Plaisance, he passed through Dondon and Marmelade, drove in the enemy's posts in all directions, and halted within a mile and a half of Cape Fran\u00e7ois. General Boyer, who commanded in the town, was thrown into the utmost consternation, by the sudden approach of the black army. The ships in the harbour were hauled on shore, that their broadsides might play upon the troops of the sable chief, and batteries were hastily erected. With all the military force that he could muster, seconded by twelve hundred seamen and marines from the fleet, Boyer made a sally, but was driven back in confusion, under the walls of the place. The Cape was soon closely invested, and would have been lost, had not the division of Hardy arrived, by forced marches, to its succour. The captain-general followed by sea from Port au Prince, having previously given orders to his troops to abandon the posts in the interior, and concentrate their forces in the north. The approach of the whole of the French divisions at length induced\nToussaint to withdraw, to a position in the mountains of Hincha; well satisfied with having rescued the south and the west from the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe terror which they had felt, and the loss of men and of credit which they had sustained, were not the worst consequences which arose to the French from this invasion of the north by Toussaint. Hitherto the troops had continued in excellent health. But the scene was now to be changed. By the crowds which had taken shelter in Cape Fran\u00e7ois a contagious disorder was generated, which rapidly spread among the soldiers, thinning their ranks, and dispiriting the survivors. Powerful reinforcements arrived frequently from France, but, powerful as they were, they barely sufficed to fill the chasms which were daily making in the army by disease, incessant toil, and the ravages of the sword.\n\nLe Clerc was now convinced that he had been too precipitate in throwing off the mask. Difficult as it must have seemed to him to be, once more to deceive the blacks, he resolved to try how far it was possible for him to work upon their credulity. Accordingly, on the 25th of April, he issued a proclamation, couched in the most insidious and equivocal terms, apparently promising liberty and equality to all the inhabitants of St. Domingo, without regard to colour, and holding out to the blacks the prospect of their\nhaving a share in the government of the island. In this wily composition, he called for the counsel and opinions of all parties, in order to prevent him from pursuing, through mere ignorance, measures which might be detrimental to the welfare of the colony; and he did not fail indirectly to intimate, that whatever erroneous steps he had taken had been the consequence of his want of acquaintance with the wants, the interests, and the character of the people. This proclamation was immediately sent to the camps of the negroes, and profusely distributed in all quarters.\n\nAstonishing as the fact may appear to be, it is, nevertheless, true, that Le Clerc had not miscalculated, with regard to the readiness of the blacks to be entrapped by the same snare, in which they had already once been caught. They read, and they believed; thus proving, as to themselves, the correctness of what has been asserted of the unlettered of other countries, that every thing which appears in print is supposed by them to be stamped with the character of truth. It must, at the same time, be remembered as some apology for their credulous conduct, that it was not unnatural for the blacks to imagine, that the severe chastisement which they had recently inflicted upon French perfidy, would have the effect of deterring the captain-general from again indulging in the violation of his promises.\n\nFeelings of this kind, assisted by the love of\nrepose, and the dislike of enduring hardships, induced the blacks to regard with disgust a prolongation of the contest. Liberty was all that they wanted, and that, they were of opinion, was now secured. It was idle, therefore, to expose themselves, without an object, to toils and dangers. Defections began to take place to a great extent. Even those who, on the former occasion, had remained constant, were now won over by the seductions of the enemy. Christophe was one of these. He entered into a negociation with Le Clerc, which ended in his submitting to the authority of the French republic. This step was also taken by Toussaint's brother, Paul L'Ouverture, who was at the head of two thousand troops.\n\nChristophe, however, did not abandon his companions in arms, without making some stipulations in their favour. He obtained a general amnesty, and the preservation of his own rank, and that of all the negro officers. But he did not stop here. He likewise insisted on the same terms being granted to Toussaint and to Dessalines; and to this article, unpalatable as it must have been, Le Clerc was compelled to give his assent. A treaty was, in consequence, entered into with the two chiefs; a peace was concluded; and, by the beginning of May, the French were in quiet possession of the whole of St. Domingo. Dessalines retired to St. Marc, and Toussaint\nto one of his plantations, which was situated in the neighbourhood of Gonaives.\n\nThe tranquillity thus restored might have been lasting, had the captain-general been capable of acting in an honourable manner. But treachery seemed to be his element, out of which he could not exist. Toussaint was the first victim of it. Early in June, the Hero man of war, and the Creole frigate, anchored, in the dead of night, off Gonaives, near the residence of the negro chief. Several boats were then dispatched on shore, with troops, headed by General Brunet and Ferrari, the aid-du-camp of Le Clerc. While Toussaint and all his family were asleep, his house was surrounded, and a file of grenadiers penetrated into his chamber, and summoned him to surrender. Resistance would have been unavailing; and he, therefore, submitted. He asked but one favour, and that was refused. \"I will not,\" said he, \"resist the power which you have obtained over me; but my wife is feeble, and my children can do no harm. Suffer them, then, to remain at home.\" His pleading was in vain. All the members of his family were dragged on board of the frigate, which immediately put to sea. Two of the black chiefs, in the vicinity of Gonaives, endeavoured to save their leader, by an attack upon the escort, but they were defeated, and the loss of their lives was the penalty of their fidelity.\nThese two perished speedily. A fate probably less prompt and more terrible, was reserved for other friends of Toussaint. A hundred persons, against whom no heavier charge was brought than that they were his confidential partisans, were seized; some of whom were put on board La Mulron frigate, which was bound to the Mediterranean, and the remainder were distributed among the ships of the squadron. What became of these unfortunate men has never been made known. It has been surmised, and not improbably, that their captivity was terminated by their being thrown into the ocean; a summary mode of execution, which was certainly resorted to by the French in many other instances.\n\nIn justification of the step which he had taken, Le Clerc accused Toussaint of having intended to excite an insurrection among the working negroes, and to raise them in mass. The only proof which he condescended to produce was a letter, written by the negro chief to one Fontaine, which, unfortunately for the veracity of the captain-general, proved directly the contrary of what he asserted, and proved, likewise, that, in violation of the promises which had been so recently given, attempts were already making to reduce the negroes once more to a state of bondage.\n\nDuring the voyage, Toussaint was closely guarded in his cabin, and was not permitted to\nhave any intercourse with his family. His last and brief interview with them took place at Brest, on the deck of the ship, and was so heart-breaking as to raise compassion in the bosoms of even the sailors. His family was conveyed to France, and what was its subsequent fate is a matter of uncertainty. Toussaint himself was hurried to the castle of Joux, whence, on the approach of winter, he was removed to Besan\u00e7on, where he was confined in a dungeon, the floor of which is said to have been covered with water. His death was announced to the public on the 27th of April, 1803. It was the natural consequence of that slow torture which was inflicted by cold, and damp, and inaction, upon a man who had been accustomed to continual exercise, free air, and a torrid climate. Thus perished Toussaint L'Ouverture, a man worthy to be held in honourable remembrance for his courage, his talents, and his virtues, and especially for those virtues which are least often found in persons holding authority, namely, forgiveness of injuries, a strict adherence to his word and to truth, and a temperate exercise of power.\n\nAs if, now that Toussaint was removed, there was nothing left to be feared, Le Clerc amused himself with promulgating a system of government. It was, however, for the greater part, little more than a servile copy of some of the regulations which had been established by his sable\npredecessor, and its existence was so ephemeral,\nthat to notice it any further than to say that\nmartial law was the basis of it, would be a waste\nof time.\n\nTo the blacks, who were doubtless supposed\nto be too broken in spirit to resent their wrongs,\nthe grossest injustice, breach of faith, and cruelty\nwere shown. The negro troops were separated,\ncarefully watched, disarmed, and treated, in a\nmanner which betrayed an intention of acting to-\nwards them with still more harshness; and, at\nthe same time, attempts were perpetually made,\nto oppress and enslave the cultivators of the soil.\nThe chiefs, on frivolous pretexts, or on no pre-\ntext at all, were arrested and slaughtered in va-\nrious ways. General Maurepas, the brother-in-\nlaw of Christophe, was invited to the Cape by a\nflattering letter; but, when he arrived in the har-\nbour, with his family and four hundred of his\nmen, he was seized by the myrmidons of Le\nClerc. They were proceeding to tie bullets to\nhis feet, and to throw him into the sea; but he\nbroke from them, and exclaiming \"Robbers! it\nis my property that you want; you shall not have\nthe honour of drowning me;\" he plunged into the\nwaves. His children and his soldiers were pre-\ncipitated after him. The news of this massacre\nwas carried to Christophe, by one of the blacks,\nwho had been fortunate enough to disengage\nhimself from the bullets, and swim to land; and,\nalmost at the same moment, the body of Maurepas, which had been mutilated by a shark, was found upon the shore. Another chief, named Charles Chevalier, was hanged with his wife, who possessed a truly Roman soul. Seeing that her husband manifested signs of weakness at the sight of the apparatus of death, she reproachfully said to him, \"What! do you not know how to die for liberty!\" then, having uttered these words, she flung herself from the platform, and quickly ceased to exist.\n\nLe Clerc miscalculated entirely, as to the patience and timidity of those who were the victims of his tyranny. He had no reason to doubt the courage of the blacks; and, had they been the most dastardly of mankind, he ought to have known that there is a point at which even cowardice itself forgets to fear. There was, in truth, now no resource for the blacks, except in an appeal to arms, and it was obvious that their liberty could be secured by nothing less than the destruction or expulsion of the French. The chiefs were, indeed, by this time, well aware that they were marked out for sacrifice; and the other classes were equally aware that, if they valued their freedom, they must defend it by the sword. Insurrections consequently broke out in every quarter, and new leaders, as brave and active as the old, appeared in the field. Nor were the original leaders of the blacks at all tardy in per-\nforming their duty. As soon as they had made the needful preparations, Christophe, Dessalines, and Cleveaux again raised their standards, and their re-appearance was the signal for general revolt.\n\nFrom this period the war assumed a character of unmitigated ferocity, at which humanity shudders. It was not merely a war of extermination, but of torture, and refinement in barbarity. It was not sufficient for the French to kill, if they could not glut their rage and revenge upon their enemies, by every mode of inflicting agony that a sanguinary imagination could invent. The prisoners were drowned, or stifled by the fumes of sulphur, or shot on the brink of a deep pit, into which the dead and the wounded were indiscriminately thrust, or they were massacred, by hundreds, or exposed, naked and fettered, to be torn to pieces by hungry blood-hounds, which were imported for the purpose from Cuba, and carefully trained. The ground was in many places covered with mangled, decaying bodies, and the air was poisoned by the pestilential exhalations from these masses of corruption.\n\nSo many crimes were not, however, suffered by Divine justice to escape without being punished. During the summer of 1803, the situation of the French was such, that it would have been pitiable, had they not forfeited all claim to pity. The same devouring plague which had before\nTHE HISTORY OF ST. DOMINGO.\n\nthinned the ranks of the British army, now exercised its ravages upon those of the French with more destructive fury. The invaders laboured, in truth, under many disadvantages. Unaccustomed to the climate, they were worn down by intense heat and incessant toil; and the contest was, besides, of so undignified and hateful a nature, that, instead of elevating the mind by the prospect of glory, and thus giving strength to the corporeal frame, it depressed and deadened the spirits, and consequently rendered the body more accessible to the influence of contagion. It is no wonder, then, that the grave was hourly receiving innumerable victims. In one of his dispatches, General Boyer has enabled us to form some idea of the situation of the troops. \"The heat,\" says he, \"was excessive; it became impossible for us to make any movement. The lowest Mornes presented obstacles to us proportioned to the inconveniences of the temperature. The number of the robbers increased. Our hospitals were filled with sick, and every day the sickness made new havoc. The robbers calculated its progress with a secret joy.\" Returning to the subject, in another part of his letter, he adds, \"the sickness has made dreadful ravages; the oldest men do not remember so sickly a year.\" Such was the mortality that, great as were the reinforcements which, before the ports were closed, arrived in St. Domingo, and they have been es-\ntimated at from three to five thousand men monthly, they did not suffice to supply the place of those who had fallen by sickness or by the sword. Nor were sickness and the sword the only causes which contributed to diminish the number of the invaders. Desertion, even among the white troops, and especially among the Poles and other foreigners, were frequent and extensive; the humane part of the soldiery feeling a shame and disgust at being converted into instruments of baseness and cruelty.\n\nTo endeavour to trace the various encounters which occurred, would be a fruitless and a sicken ing task. Even where the operations of war are seen tricked out with all the pomp and circumstance of military science, the monotonous narrative of daily slaughter gives birth to painful ideas; but, when they are shown in all their naked deformity, it is impossible that the description of them should excite any thing but loathing. The conflict between the blacks and the whites was not of that kind which bears the name of regular war. It consisted chiefly of a succession of petty combats, of ambuscades, of surprises, in which the French were sometimes victors, more often vanquished, but in which success itself was of no avail to them. When hard pressed, the negroes sought refuge in the Mornes, whence, as soon as their enemies had departed, they again poured down and resumed their former stations. By\nthis kind of tactics, however, seconded by disease, the French army was so weakened that, before the end of October, it was driven into the fortified towns, and had lost Port de Paix, Fort Dauphin, and other important posts.\n\nIn the midst of this disastrous state of affairs, the captain-general, Le Clerc, died on the first of November, and was succeeded by Rochambeau, who was then at Port au Prince, but who hastened to Cape Fran\u00e7ois, in order to assume the command. Before the new captain-general could arrive, the blacks, having been informed of the death of Le Clerc, and hoping that it had disheartened the garrison, made an attack upon the Cape. In this, though they fought with great courage, they were defeated. Desirous, on his side, that some act of vigour should give lustre to the commencement of his new career, Rochambeau determined to remain no longer on the defensive. In pursuance of this resolution, his troops took the field, defeated, in one quarter, a black division, which was blockading the Mole, and, in another, recovered Fort Dauphin, after a sharp engagement. This, however, was the last gleam of their good fortune, and it was a transient one. By the beginning of 1803 they were again cooped up within the scanty limits of their fortified towns, and were as closely beleagured as ever by their sable antagonists.\n\nDessalines was now invested with the chief\ncommand of the black army, which received daily accessions of strength. The principal part of his force he drew into the plain of the Cape, for the purpose of straitening the quarters of the French. In March a battle took place, in the neighbourhood of Acul. It was commenced by the French, and was obstinately fought on both sides. At first, the assailants had the ascendancy, but, towards night, the blacks succeeded in repulsing them on all sides. Irritated by this defeat, Rochambeau ordered five hundred of his prisoners to be put to death. Some of these unfortunate men were only mutilated by their executioners, and were left on the field all night, to perish in agonies. Their cries and groans were heard to a considerable distance. Informed of this barbarous proceeding, Desalines directed five hundred gibbets to be raised, selected all the officers whom he had taken, and as many of the privates as were necessary to make up the number, and hung them up, before break of day, in sight of the French camp. He then made an impetuous attack upon the enemy, broke their lines, and drove them in disorder under the walls of Cape Fran\u00e7ois.\n\nThe contest might, nevertheless, still have been indefinitely protracted, had the sea continued open to the French. But an event now happened by which that was closed to them, and an end was consequently put to their every hope.\nThis was the renewal of the war between England and France. In the latter end of June, a British squadron appeared off the island, and formed a rigorous blockade. Animated by this fortunate circumstance, the blacks held their enemies more closely invested than ever on the side of the land. The horrors of famine were in a short time added to those of disease and the sword. The French were reduced to feed on horses, mules, asses, and on the very dogs which they had brought from Cuba, for the purpose of tearing in pieces alive and devouring the blacks. One by one, the garrisons of the forts, as already has been shewn in the History of the War, implored the protection of the British; and, at length, with sullen reluctance, Rochambeau took the same step, and the last French standards that floated in St. Domingo were hauled down from the walls of Cape Fran\u00e7ois and of St. Nicholas Mole. After a struggle, scarcely interrupted, of twenty-two months, the blacks enjoyed the triumph of compelling the remnant of their oppressors to leave them in possession of their liberty, and of their native soil.\n\nThus ended, in utter defeat and shame, and almost annihilation to the force of the invaders, a war which they had carried on with a ferociousness disgraceful to themselves, and shocking to humanity. It was not, however, as Lyons and La Vendee could attest, the first time that\nFrench armies had indulged in such horrible barbarities as those which were practised in St. Domingo; though the dear-bought experience which they had gained at home might have taught them, if any thing could teach the sanguinary and obstinate, that the natural consequence of driving men to despair by cruelty and oppression is, to render their resistance interminable as long as life remains. The dreadful scenes which took place in St. Domingo have already been incidentally touched upon; and a concise but striking picture of them, which has been drawn by a French author, will serve to make them known to the reader, in all their horrible perfection.\n\n\"If we consider,\" says he, \"only the crimes of the blacks against the whites, we shall look upon them as monsters. But if we call to mind, that they have been drowned by thousands, in vessels upon Carrier's construction; that they have been hunted down like wild beasts, by dogs taught to pursue them; that they have been thrown to be devoured alive by those cruel animals; that, after having lain down their arms in pursuance of military treaties, they have been hanged, burned, and slaughtered by grape-shot; that they have been transported to Europe, for the purpose of being placed in the first line in battle; that they have been plunged into dungeons, there to perish by hunger, or in torments;\"\nand that, after having had their liberty guaranteed to them, they have been sent by ship-loads to be sold in the continental colonies; if we call all these things to mind, we can only groan over the cruel effect of the passions and of the spirit of revenge; and the philosopher will see in the chaos of crimes, and in the narrative of so many frenzied actions, only an atrocious and bloody page in the history of the human heart!\"\n\nThe time was now at hand when these cruelties were to be avenged by cruelties of a nature almost equally base and atrocious. Toussaint, in this situation, would have enjoyed the pleasure of forgiving and protecting; but the gloomy and sanguinary mind of Dessalines was inaccessible to any feeling of so noble a character. The unhappy white colonists were destined to pay with their lives for the late terrible events which had taken place. The blow was, however, for a while suspended, and every thing was done to lull them into security, and even to increase the number of the victims. Aware that it was impossible for them to send off their property without its falling into the hands of the English, by which they would be reduced to poverty, and hoping that Dessalines would act in the same spirit that Toussaint had done, the planters determined to remain under the government of the negro chieftain. They had, at first, reason to believe that they had acted wisely. Dessalines issued pro-\nclamations, assuring men of all colours of being indiscriminately protected, inviting back such white proprietors as were disposed \"to renounce their former errors, and abjure the injustice of their exorbitant pretensions,\" and declaring that they should be received as brothers, with esteem and friendship. Nay, so far did these papers carry their deceptive language, as to lament that some murders had been committed on good and humane landholders, \"contrary, said Dessalines, to the wishes of our hearts.\"\n\nBut, not many weeks had elapsed before the real intentions of Dessalines were made perfectly obvious. By a proclamation, in the true French revolutionary style, fraught with interrogation, exclamation, invective, and dark suggestions, he stimulated his countrymen to stain their hands in the blood of the whites, and \"to ensure by a last act of national authority,\" for this was the name which he gave to assassination, \"the permanent empire of liberty in the country which had given them birth.\" Every line of this detestable production breathed rage and slaughter. It was followed, in February, by another, less objectionable in its terms, but which, as it ordered judicial proceedings against the actors and accomplices of the massacres perpetrated under Le Clerc and Rochambeau, was undoubtedly a breach of the complete amnesty which he had promised to grant.\nIt was the object of Dessalines to excite the black population to take on itself the task, and share the guilt, of exterminating the whites. In this he failed. The blacks did not participate in the malignity and fury by which he himself was animated. But, though his subjects were deaf to his exhortations, he resolved that his victims should not escape. The storm at length burst upon the devoted planters, whose flight he had taken especial care to prevent, by ordering a strict search of every vessel that sailed from his harbours. The military force was employed and disgraced in the performance of his hateful purpose. All the towns were successively visited by him, and the French inhabitants were put to the sword before his eyes, with the exception of a few surgeons, priests, and others, who, during the recent war, had acted towards the blacks with acknowledged humanity. Neither sex nor age was any protection, provided the victim were French. Guards, however, were placed over the houses of all other whites, with positive injunctions to prevent even the slightest violence from being offered to the inhabitants.\n\nThat nothing might be wanting to complete the darkness of his character, he added perfidy to cruelty. As the massacre had been expected, several hundred persons had secreted themselves. They were now invited forth by a proclamation, which declared that the national vengeance was\nsatisfied, and they might, therefore, depend upon perfect security, on condition of their coming to the parade to obtain tickets of protection. They obeyed this deceitful mandate; but, instead of receiving the promised tickets, they were led to the place of execution and murdered. The rivulet which passes through Cape Fran\u00e7ois was literally reddened with their blood. Christophe and the majority of his companions disapproved, in silence, of these horrible deeds; but two black officers, who had the boldness to express their disapprobation, were punished for it, by being compelled to hang two Frenchmen, who were then in the fort.\n\nThis act was claimed and vaunted as his own, by Dessalines, in a furious address to the inhabitants of the island. The sole ground of defence, which it brought forward, was, that some of the French had engaged in plots; an accusation which, perhaps, was true, but which could not justify the means that he employed, and the wide slaughter of the innocent, and of women and children. It was in his power to bring conspirators to punishment in a proper manner. The most remarkable passage, however, in this curious paper, was one which contained an impudent and cowardly insinuation against the character of Toussaint. In private, Dessalines is said to have pleaded the absolute necessity of gratifying his troops with the blood\nof their enemies, as the real motive which prompted him to his barbarous conduct.\n\nPreviously to this event, Dessalines had been invested with the supreme dignity. A meeting of the chiefs and generals took place on the first of January, 1804, and their first step was to renounce forever all connection with France, and to pledge themselves, by the most solemn oaths, to perish rather than to yield to her dominion. Dessalines was appointed governor-general for life, and was entrusted with the power of enacting laws, making war and peace, and nominating his successor. That nothing might remain that could remind them of French sovereignty, they abolished the name of St. Domingo, and restored to the island the name of Hayti, which was its aboriginal name.\n\nIn order to recruit the population of the country, Dessalines, on his accession to power, held out encouragement to the returning of such negroes and mulattoes as had been taken from the island; and he offered, to American captains, a reward of forty dollars, for each person whom they conveyed in their vessels. He likewise expressed his readiness to open his ports to English slave ships, and to give the people of Jamaica the exclusive privilege of selling negroes in Hayti. The blacks so imported were, however, to be employed only in the military service; and, on his being censured for this scheme, he pleaded,\nthat, as negroes would still continue to be torn from Africa, it was better that he should make freemen and soldiers of them, than that they should be doomed to perpetual bondage in the British and other colonies.\n\nAt the period when the wretched fragments of the French army in the western quarter were expelled from their last holds, at the Cape and the Mole, the Spanish part of the island acknowledged the authority of the conquerors. Persuaded, however, by their priests, as it is said, or, more probably, disgusted and terrified by the brutality of Dessalines, the Spaniards subsequently retracted their submission, and espoused the cause of the French. The city of Santo Domingo, the fortifications of which, though intrinsically bad, are strong enough to keep at bay an unskilful assailant, was still in the possession of the French, who were commanded by General Ferrand. From that city Dessalines resolved to dislodge the enemy. Having previously made a tour round the coast, to examine and strengthen every point, he issued a proclamation, addressed to the Spaniards, threatening them with his utmost vengeance, if they persisted in their opposition; and he then marched to give weight to his threat with twenty-two thousand men. He laid siege to Santo Domingo, but he was unable to make any impression upon the works, which were obstinately defended; and the arrival of a French\nsquadron, with reinforcements, induced him to consider his enterprise as a hopeless one, and to retire homeward with his baffled forces.\n\nThat General Ferrand displayed courage and talent in the defence of Santo Domingo is indisputable, but that he was destitute of prudence and humanity is made obvious, by a proclamation, which he thought proper to issue against those who furnished the blacks with supplies, and which, even from a French general, must be considered as an extraordinary production. Were it not for the date, it might easily be mistaken for one of the compositions of that committee of public safety which, in the years 1793 and 1794, covered France with scaffolds and blood. An air of ludicrousness is at the same time thrown over it, by the circumstance that, at the period when it came forth, the British vessels were masters of the sea, and Ferrand himself was a sort of prisoner within certain bounds. \"All individuals whomsoever,\" says this summary decree of proscription, \"who are found on board any vessel, or vessels, allies or neutrals, bound to any ports in Hispaniola occupied by the rebels, shall suffer death. Those found on board any vessel, allies or neutrals, coming out of any ports in Hispaniola, occupied by the rebels, shall suffer death.\" The last clause is a very fit climax to such a mass of spiteful and absurd barbarity as this paper displays. \"Those found,\" it says \"at two leagues\nfrom any port on the coast of Hispaniola, occupied by the rebels, on board of allies or neutrals, shall suffer death.\" The author of this proclamation died in a manner which was worthy of him. Having been defeated by the Spaniards in the year 1808, he blew out his brains, in the dread of falling into the hands of those who were closely pursuing him.\n\nThe failure of Dessalines, in his enterprise against Santo Domingo, did not diminish the confidence which was reposed in him by his black countrymen, the Haytians, as they will henceforth be called. Of this, shortly after his return, they gave to him a signal proof. On the eighth of October, he was crowned, with great pomp, as emperor of Hayti, by the name of James the first. A new constitution was, at the same time, promulgated, purporting to be the production of twenty-three persons, who were the legally chosen representatives of the people. Though not without obvious defects, it had much in it that was praiseworthy; and, had it been properly administered, it might have ensured the happiness of the Haytians. Among other things, it established a toleration in religious affairs, the equal operation of the laws, and the inviolability of the property and the dwellings of the citizens. It gave to the emperor numerous privileges of high value, and the dangerous power of making the laws; but it decreed that, in case of his attaching to\nhimself any separate military force, under the name of guards of honour, or any other name; he should be deemed to be at war with the community, and should be removed from the throne.\n\nDelivered from the scourge under which they had lain so long, the Haytians now began to turn their attention to the arts, and enjoy some of the comforts of civilized existence. Religion was treated with due respect, marriage was encouraged, and schools were established in almost every district. The cultivators, though in certain cases allowed to remove, worked, in general, on the estates to which they had formerly belonged, but their labour was not urged beyond their strength, and it was paid for with liberality. A majority of them were females; the late sanguinary war having considerably decreased the number of adult males. Estates, as having been confiscated, were mostly in the hands of the government, by which they were let out at stated rents. When, however, a mustee or mulatto, though illegitimate, could prove his relationship with an old white proprietor, he was admitted as the heir of his property. The sugar works having been nearly all destroyed, coffee was the chief article of produce, and, in the year 1805, thirty millions of pounds of it were grown.\n\nIn the year just mentioned, the population of Hayti appears to have consisted of about four hundred thousand souls. The regular army,\nwhich, though badly clothed, was well disciplined and armed, was fifteen thousand strong, one-tenth of which number was cavalry. Besides this, there was a sort of militia, formed of all the males capable of bearing arms, who were annually embodied and trained four times, during several days. In case that a peace with England should put it into the power of France to renew her attacks, it was resolved by the Haytians to destroy the towns, and withdraw to the Mornes; and, with a view to this, they fortified, with great assiduity and skill, all the most commanding positions, collected large magazines in the interior, and extensively planted the ravines and slopes of the hills with yams, bananas, plantains, and other articles of food. Many of the forts were situated on conical hills, the circuit of which was cultivated as a provision ground, and could be swept by the fire of the cannon, so as to prevent an enemy from interrupting the garrison in their obtaining the supplies which were furnished by the soil. Particular care was taken to supply these positions with water, the want of which had been severely felt at Crete \u00e0 Pierrot.\n\nThe reign of Dessalines was not of long duration. Ferocious, unenlightened, full of jealousy, and caprice, he had little more to recommend him than the merely animal qualities of activity and courage. Some of his decrees on the subjects of legislation and commerce are sufficient\ntestimonies of his lack of knowledge and talents. But, had ignorance been his only demerit, he would, in all probability, have continued for many years to be the peaceable possessor of the throne. His cruelty was the cause of his downfall. Without proof of guilt, without even the form of a trial, he scrupled not to shed the blood of his people, whenever he was prompted by his passions or his fears. The offspring of tyranny is conspiracy; and by conspiracy Dessalines perished. Unable any longer to endure his barbarity, and having likewise reason to believe that he was, at that moment, meditating an extensive proscription, the leading officers of the state and of the army formed a plan to depose the tyrant. Their measures were taken with so much secrecy, that he who was the object of them, had not a suspicion of the danger which was impending over his head. On the 17th of October, 1806, the conspirators put their scheme into execution. Dessalines was surrounded by his enemies, at the head quarters, and, while he was endeavouring to escape, he received a mortal wound, of which he immediately expired.\n\nThe death of Dessalines not only put an end to the empire of Hayti, but likewise produced a division of it, and a civil war. In the north, the reins of government were assumed by Christophe, who, for the moment, contented himself with the modest title of chief of the government of Hayti.\nIn the south, Petion seized the opportunity of asserting his claims to at least an equal share of the vacant authority. The capital of Christophe was Cape Fran\u00e7ois; that of Petion was Port au Prince.\n\nChristophe, who is believed to have been born in Grenada, was the friend of Toussaint, and not wholly unlike to him in character. He was brave, tolerably skilful, attentive to his moral duties, hospitable and generous; with a respectable share of natural talents, and more dignity of manner than was to be expected from one whose early life had been spent under circumstances of a painful and unpropitious kind. At the time when Dessalines fell, Christophe was the second in command.\n\nPetion, who, under the late government, held the third rank, and was commander-in-chief at Port au Prince, was infinitely superior to his rival in acquired advantages. He was a mulatto, who had received his education in the military school at Paris, had lived long in polished society, was amiable in his manners, mild in his disposition, and fond of literature. As a military man he possessed a high reputation, and he was considered as the best engineer in St. Domingo.\n\nOne of the first acts of Christophe was to remove the restraints upon trade which his predecessor had so unwisely imposed. Complete security to persons and property was promised\nto all who would visit the island for the purpose of commerce. The new chief had soon a favourable opportunity of propitiating the favour of the British cabinet, and he did not neglect it. In the southern part of St. Domingo some ill-disposed individuals had opened a correspondence with a disaffected party in Jamaica, and they hoped to excite a revolt in the latter colony. This plot was discovered by Christophe, who instantly arrested those by whom it was carried on. Pleased by this instance of his good faith, the British ministry issued, in February 1807, an order of council, by which English merchantmen bound for Buenos Ayres and La Plata, were permitted to dispose of their cargoes in any of the ports of the blacks, to take on board the produce of the country, and either to return with their freightage to any port of the united kingdom, or to ship it in neutral vessels, to be sold in the settlements of hostile powers, and to bring, in neutral vessels, the proceeds of the sale into any harbour of Great Britain or Ireland. This step was beneficial to both parties, but especially to the Haytians, for whose staple articles it opened a safe and extensive market.\n\nThe imperial authority being abolished, it was thought necessary that another constitution should be framed. Accordingly a council, which consisted of the generals and the principal citizens, was held at Cape Fran\u00e7oise; and the result of its\nlabours was a constitution, which was promul-\ngated on the 17th of February, 1807. By this\nact the higher powers of government were en-\ntrusted, for life, to a chief magistrate, with the\ntitle of president and generalissimo of the land\nand sea forces, and the right of administering the\nfinances, making peace and war, concluding trea-\nties, proposing laws to the council of state, and\ngiving his final sanction to them. On the presi-\ndent was also conferred the privilege of choosing\nhis successor, but only from among the generals,\nand in a prescribed manner. Christophe was\nappointed the first president.\n\nThe council of state, which was the other\nbranch of the government, was to be com-\nposed of nine members, of whom at least two-\nthirds were to be generals. Its business was to\nbe, to receive the propositions of laws from the\npresident, to give them a proper form, to fix the\namount of taxes, to sanction treaties, to settle the\nmode of recruiting the armies, and to take an\nannual view of the receipts, the expenditure, and\nthe resources of the country.\n\nEvery individual was declared to be free,\nslavery was for ever abolished, central schools\nwere ordered to be established in all the divisions,\nand, though the Roman catholic religion was\nproclaimed to be that of the state, a full toleration\nwas extended to all other religions. On the\ncountry being in danger, every Haytian, between\nthe ages of sixteen and fifty, was liable to be called into the field. At the same time, the framers of this code wisely made known their resolution not to give any disturbance to the possessors of the neighbouring colonies, but to confine their military efforts strictly to the preservation of their own territory.\n\nIt would not be difficult to criticise this production of the black law-givers, and to demonstrate its faults; but candour must own, that it was not without such a share of merit as to render it by no means discreditable to its authors, and even that, all circumstances considered, it was as good as at that period could be expected, or, perhaps, could be executed, in the disturbed and semi-civilised situation of the Haytian people.\n\nOn the day of his accession to the presidency, Christophe addressed to the army and people a proclamation, which was worthy of praise for its sound sense, and its moderate and dignified language. It was energetic without being bombastic, and firm without being haughty or boastful. It concluded in the following words:\n\n\"After having re-established religion, defeated immorality, restored manners, and encouraged agriculture and trade, we shall have still great labours to encounter. We must not neglect the use of arms. The enemy watches our movements, and observes our proceedings. We have as yet no guarantee of the affections of our friends.\"\nWe must bind the latter to us by treaties; we must be ready to meet the former in the field. Abandoned to ourselves, our resources are in ourselves. They are in you, soldiers, who are ready generously to spill your blood, sooner than yield to a haughty enemy your liberty, which is the reward of your courage! They are in you, inhabitants and industrious cultivators, from whom the state derives its wealth! It is your union, your submission to the laws, which are to be the cement and bond of our independence.\n\n\"The line of politics which foreign powers will pursue with respect to us, is not yet manifested. Whatever it may be, let us place ourselves in such a situation, that, without holding out any defiance to them, we may, at the same time, have nothing to dread from those who may entertain hostile intentions.\n\n\"Let those who wish a political connection with us, or who would enjoy the advantage of our commerce, find an equitable reciprocity. To the rest let us offer battle and death.\n\n\"At the same time that we are occupied with these thoughts, let us never forget that the safety of a free people is best maintained by arms. Its cultivation employs a part of our fellow-citizens: let us, however, remember that we are all soldiers, and that they have been warlike nations alone who have been able to preserve their liberty. Let us call to mind, that a handful of Greeks,\nTHE HISTORY OF ST. DOMINGO.\n\ndevoted to their country; confounded the rage of a million of barbarians, who endeavoured to wrest from them their liberty. Let us swear to observe our sacred constitution, to cause it to be observed, and to perish sooner than allow it to be violated in the smallest degree.\"\n\nIt was amidst the din of war that the new constitution had its birth. The two rivals for power carried on the contest against each other with the most determined hatred. Christophe had, at first, the ascendency. On the first of January, 1807, he totally defeated P\u00e9tion, in a desperate battle, which was fought at Cibert. The vanquished chief saved himself with great difficulty, and was pursued to Port au Prince. Christophe immediately laid siege to the city, which for some time he closely pressed; but, either baffled by the superior skill of P\u00e9tion, or, as he affirmed, finding it necessary to return to the north, in consequence of the plots which were there carrying on, and the number of conspirators in his own army, he raised the siege and retired to Cape Fran\u00e7ois.\n\nThe war between the two chiefs, was, however, continued for some years with unabating fury, though with balanced success. Neither party was sufficiently strong to overpower the other, or even to obtain any decisive advantage. The theatre of the contest was chiefly confined\nto two points; the one was the north-western peninsula, where the troops of Petion held the posts of Port de Paix and Cape Nicholas Mole; the other was the central country, on each side of the Artibonite, including the towns of Gonaiives, Artibonite, Arcahaye and St. Marc, the latter of which was struggled for with great pertinacity. At length, after repeated efforts, Christophe succeeded in expelling the enemy from the north-western peninsula; Port de Paix being first reduced, and subsequently, at a long interval, the important post of Cape Nicholas Mole. It was not till the month of October, 1810, four years after the commencement of the struggle, that the Mole was surrendered. This conquest secured the authority of Christophe over the whole northern part of the island. Even this, however, was not accomplished without many obstinate conflicts, and much bloodshed.\n\nAs the enemy had derived great advantages from their naval superiority, Christophe strenuously exerted himself in the creation of a maritime force. His exertions were crowned with success. At the period when the Mole capitulated, his fleet consisted of one frigate of 44 guns, nine sloops of war, eleven brigs mounting from 14 to 22 guns, and a number of schooners, each manned by about one hundred men. It was mainly by the assistance of this\nsquadron, which prevented the garrison from receiving succours, that he was enabled to accomplish the reduction of the Mole.\n\nFrom the epoch of the capture of the Mole the war, though it still existed in name, ceased to exist in fact. The rivals seem to have discovered that nothing was to be gained, and that much might be lost, by perseverance in hostilities; as every wound which they inflicted upon each other, only rendered them less capable of opposing the common enemy, who, sooner or later, would repeat his attacks upon the liberty which they had so hardly acquired. By a sort, therefore, of tacit agreement, each party desisted from assailing his antagonist; and, though no regular peace has yet been concluded, nor so much as a truce made, not a hostile act has been committed during the last eight years. The river Artibonite, which runs through the heart of the Haytian territories, seems to form the boundary of the two negro states.\n\nWith a policy which cannot be too much commended, Christophe, on the breaking out of the war between Spain and France, dispatched succours to the Hispaniolan Spaniards, who had taken up arms; and these succours enabled Don Juan Sanchez Ramirez to undertake offensive operations against the French garrisons, which occupied the city of Santo Domingo and other posts. It was, in truth, an object of no small\nconsequence to the negroes, that the French should be driven from their strong holds in the Spanish division of St. Domingo; it being well known that the enemy designed ultimately to avail themselves of those holds, for the purpose of raising and training a native force, which might put it in their power to contend once more, and under better auspices, for the sole possession of the island.\n\nFor a moment St. Domingo appeared to be on the eve of being disturbed by the restlessness of fresh competitors for authority. Rigaud, notorious for his opposition to the British, and afterwards to Toussaint, landed at Aux Cayes, on the seventh of April, 1810. He is said by some to have been invited over by a faction, which accused Petion of want of energy; by others he is affirmed to have been an agent of Napoleon. Almost as soon as he set his foot on shore he commenced his intrigues. He did not, however, live to accomplish the mischief which he designed, and which he was so well calculated to perform. His decease took place not long after his arrival. In the mountains of the centre of the island, another candidate for power started up about the same time, in the person of Philip Dos, who had been the friend of Toussaint. His leading principle is asserted to have been the renouncing of all war, except for the purpose of self-defence. As nothing has since been heard...\nof him in this country, it seems probable that he failed in his project of establishing an independent government.*\n\nEither to Christophe himself, or to his subjects, it now appeared that the title which he bore was too humble for the station which he held. The council of state was in consequence assembled, to deliberate upon the propriety of investing the ruler of northern Hayti with the name of sovereign. In order to give as much weight as possible to the result of its deliberations, the council invited to its meetings the principal military and naval officers, and such of the citizens as, from influence or talent, were the most worthy of being consulted upon this important occasion. In this convocation it was decided that Christophe should be declared king, and that the monarchy should be hereditary in his family, excluding females, and giving to the monarch the privilege of adoption from the family of any of the princes, in case of his remaining without heirs male. An order of nobility was likewise to be established. Such regulations as were rendered necessary by the new state of things\n\n* The papers and histories, of the period here treated of, mention vaguely the attempt of Philip Dos to establish a third state. But, after all, there is, perhaps, no foundation for the story. If the attempt were really made, it seems probable that the person who made it was a seceder from the party of Petion, and that he was bought over to relinquish his design and espouse the cause of Christophe.\n\nVOL. V.\nwere also made, but the constitutional act of 1807 still continued to be, in other respects, the law of Hayti. These changes were announced to the people, by the council of state, in a sensible and well written address, assigning the reasons which had induced the assembly to prefer the kingly form of government to every other form. It was on the fourth of April that the proceedings of the council were formally communicated to Christophe, who thenceforth assumed the regal title, with the name of Henry the First.\n\nThe creation of four princes, seven dukes, twenty-two counts, thirty barons, and ten knights, was the first act of sovereignty which Henry performed. A great majority of the peers were, of course, military and naval officers; the remainder belonged to the civil department. Domains, inalienable and descending to the eldest male, were granted for the support of their dignity. Though the edict, by which this hereditary nobility was created, pointed out the army and the navy as the chief sources whence the ranks of the nobles were in future to be recruited, it nevertheless declared that all persons who had done important services to the country should be eligible to obtain rank, and that virtue and talent should be considered as having the most valid claims. The dress of the nobility was fixed by another edict; and, though it was perhaps deficient in taste, it was at least abundantly splendid. As a further\nreward and stimulus to bravery, a military order, to be called the order of St. Henry, was also established, with all the accustomed apparatus of grand crosses, commanders, knights, ribbons, stars and inscriptions, and moreover an annual pecuniary allowance to each of the members.\n\nThe household of the king was framed upon an extensive scale, and, indeed, presented to the view such a formidable list of officers, and such a display of pageantry, as might, in that kind of merit, have contested the precedence with any European court. The black race has been always said to be fond of finery, and, in this instance, it afforded strong testimony to the truth of the assertion.\n\nThe coronation took place on the second of June, in the most gorgeous manner, at Cape Fran\u00e7ois, in the midst of the army and of the deputations from all parts of the north of Hayti. The ceremony was performed in the Champ de Mars, to which spot Henry and his consort were drawn in a carriage, by eight white horses. Nothing was omitted which could render the scene as magnificent as possible. Like Napoleon, he put the crown upon his own head, before he gave it into the hands of the archbishop to be replaced there. To the sumptuous dinner which was given, on this occasion, all the English and American merchants were invited. The health of the newly crowned sovereign having been drunk by\none of the British officers, Henry, in his turn, gave as a toast, \"my dear brother, George the Third; may his life be preserved by the great Ruler of the universe, and may he oppose an invincible obstacle to the unbridled ambition of Napoleon, and remain always the constant friend of Hayti!\" The rejoicings were continued for five days, during which period nothing was thought of but processions, reviews, and feasts, dancing and singing, fireworks and illuminations. At length, on the seventh of June, the civil and military deputies returned to their homes, the people resumed their ordinary occupations, and the monarch was left at liberty to direct his attention to the duties of government.\n\nHoping, perhaps, that the inhabitants of the south would be seduced by the splendour of royalty, Christophe addressed to them a proclamation, offering a full amnesty, and holding out to them the promise of peace and prosperity under his mild dominion. His appeal to them was, however, made in vain; and, fortunately for his subjects, he had too much good sense to attempt to enforce it by arms. Instead of drawing the sword, he wisely occupied himself in ameliorating the laws, encouraging agriculture, and raising fortifications in the interior, to stop the progress of any invader who might chance to effect a landing. New palaces were built, a city, called Sans Souci, intended for the future capital, was\nTHE HISTORY OF ST. DOMINGO.\n\nfounded, and many other works of utility or ornament were commenced. As if to obliterate, as far as possible, the vestiges of every thing which could remind the natives that France once ruled there, the name of Cape Fran\u00e7ois was changed to that of Cape Henry; and to ensure a ready compliance with the change, the very effectual mode was adopted of ordering all letters to be destroyed which were directed to the city under its former denomination.\n\nThe southern part of the island, under Petion, still adhered to the republican institutions. But it was in a no less flourishing condition than the northern division, and its chief laboured diligently to promote every plan which could conduce to the safety and comfort of those who had selected him as their leader. The military force was carefully kept up, the laws were duly administered, and strenuous exertions were made to disseminate instruction among all classes of the people.\n\nNothing which is worthy of notice occurred in the Haytian states, till the restoration of Lewis the Eighteenth to the throne of France. This event revived the hopes of the ex-colonists, who immediately began to besiege the ministry and the chamber of deputies. To the latter they presented a petition, which was referred to a committee to report upon. The chairman of the committee was General Desfourneaux, who\nhad once served in St. Domingo, and the report which he brought up furnished a curious proof how far the desire of gain can prompt men to go, and how far that for which they eagerly wish, can render them blind to the obstacles which are opposed to them. This report seemed to consider it as almost certain that Christophe and Petion would gladly acknowledge the sovereignty of Lewis, in which case they, and other black chiefs, were to be rewarded by marks of honour, and pecuniary advantages. As, however, the blacks might possibly resist, it was recommended to send a sufficient military and naval force to occupy the colony. At all events it would, it was added, be proper to send thither an army strong enough to put the proprietors in possession of their estates, and secure them in that possession. It was also suggested that various laws would be necessary, as well with reference to the blacks who were already there, as to those who must thereafter be imported.\n\nThese last words were of ominous import; they clearly shewed that the old system was again to be acted upon. There can, indeed, be little doubt that the French cabinet looked forward to the renewing of the black population by fresh cargoes from Africa, and that this was the unworthy motive which induced it so pertinaciously to contend for the privilege of carrying\non, during a period of five years, the detestable traffic in slaves. It is but too probable that many of the leading men in France sanctioned all the schemes of the ex-colonists, were well aware that their object could not be attained by negotiation, and would not have shrunk from attempting to recover the colony, even at the dreadful price of exterminating the whole of the negroes and men of colour by whom it was now inhabited. There is, in truth, no way of vindicating their understandings but at the expense of their hearts; for it seems impossible that they could seriously believe that men who, for nearly twenty years, had enjoyed freedom and property, and in many instances rank and power, would voluntarily submit to grovel in their former degraded condition, and bare their backs to the scourge, merely to gratify those whom they at once detested as having been their oppressors, and despised as being vanquished and fugitive.\n\nThe black rulers, meanwhile, had been looking forward to the issue of the contest in Europe with no small anxiety. It was quite apparent that affairs were in such a situation, that a peace was not far distant; and as France, under any sovereign, was likely to be hostile, it behoved them to be prepared for the worst. In both divisions of the island, therefore, defensive measures were vigorously pursued.\nThe news of the downfall of Napoleon was received with pleasure, as it was probably hoped that, instructed by adversity, a Bourbon would be less ambitious, and less prodigal of the blood of his subjects, than the deposed emperor had been. In a dispatch, dated on the 10th of June, which Henry's secretary for foreign affairs addressed to M. Peltier, the secretary declared his master's readiness to admit French vessels into the Haytian ports, and to come to a good understanding with the restored monarch; but, at the same time, he explicitly stated that Henry would treat with France only on the footing of perfect independence.\n\nThe Haytians were not long before they perceived that monarchical France was not more disposed than imperial France had been to view them with a friendly eye. In order to rouse all their energy, Henry, on the 15th of August, addressed to them an animated proclamation, which while it still held out a hope that France would act in an amicable manner, called upon the people, in the event of hostilities, to strain every nerve for the maintenance of their cherished liberty. No fear, not even a doubt, was expressed as to the result of the conflict; and the French were forewarned that, if they chose to wage a war, it must be a war of extermination, as no quarter would either be given or received.\n\nThis was followed, on the 18th of September,\nby a manifesto, from king Henry, which was so excellent a composition that it would not have disgraced the pen of the ablest European diplomatist or minister. It retraced the events which had occurred in Hayti, since the period of the government of Toussaint, eloquently depicted the cruelties of which the French had been guilty, and solemnly protested that the Haytians would rather bury themselves under the ruins of their country, than suffer the smallest infringement of their political rights. Energetic as was the language of this state paper, it was, nevertheless, uniformly temperate and dignified.\n\nIn the south, as in the north, every Haytian was resolved to perish sooner than again to become a slave. The arsenals were filled with torches, and public notice was given that, on the landing of the enemy, the cities, and every thing in them which was not portable, were to be given up to the flames, and the inhabitants were to retire to the mountains. \"Look at the example of Moscow!\" was the general cry. \"Had Moscow not been destroyed, Napoleon would still be the despot of Europe.\" It was among the hills that the Haytians resolved to make the stand for their independence, and all the strong holds which they had erected there were immediately filled with ammunition, and with cured provisions.\n\nPreviously to drawing the sword, the French\nministry appears to have thought that it would be decorous to try if the blacks could not be persuaded into slavery. Three commissioners, to make the trial, were appointed by Malouet, the minister of the colonies, who was known to be a deadly enemy to the freedom of the negroes. His agents were happily chosen. The first was Dauxion Lavaysse, once a revolutionist, always a \"measureless liar,\" a man in whom folly and knavery seemed to contend for the mastery; the second was Colonel Franco Medina, a native of St. Domingo, a traitor, who had served in the black army, and betrayed his trust to Le Clerc; the third was one Draverman, an individual who, as nothing is known of him, was probably less wicked and obnoxious than his fellows.\n\nLavaysse did not choose to trust himself in the hands of the blacks, but securing himself at Jamaica, he sent to Henry, on the first of October, a letter, which was a truly senseless production; an odd compound of cajoling and of menace. Among other things, he laboured to convince Christophe that it was better for him to be \"an illustrious servant of the great sovereign of the French, than a chief of revolted slaves.\" The insult which the last words of this sentence offered to the black race, proves how well qualified this envoy was for the delicate duty which he had to perform. Nor did his absurdity end here. In case of non-compliance with the sort of sum-\nmons which was now sent, he threatened the Haytians that the slaves, which France was then purchasing on the coast of Africa, would be converted into soldiers to exterminate them; and lest this threat should not be sufficiently formidable, he reinforced it by an impudent falsehood and calumny, which was only not wonderful as coming from him. \"Do not,\" he said, \"deceive yourself, general. The sovereigns of Europe, although they have made peace, have not returned the sword into the scabbard. Doubtless, you are not ignorant of what everybody in Europe knows, although a thing not yet diplomatically published\u2014that the principal articles of the compact which all the European sovereigns have just signed, on their royal honour, is to unite their armies, if need be, and to lend each other all necessary aid, in order to destroy all the governments which have been the offspring of the French revolution, whether in Europe, or in the new world. Know also that it is Great Britain, who is the centre of and principal party to this convention, to which, a few months sooner or later, every government will find it necessary to submit: every government and every potentate that shall refuse so to submit, must expect to be treated as traitors and robbers.\" With this curious epistle, Lavaysse enclosed a copy of a letter which he had already dispatched to Petion upon the same subject.\nTo conduct the negociation Medina was sent to Cape Henry by Lavaysse. As this emissary was unfurnished with any credentials from the French government, he was arrested on his landing, and his papers were seized. Those papers are said to have fully established the fact, that to spread discord and revolt among the Haytians was the real object of his pretendedly pacific mission. He was, therefore, sent for trial as a spy, before a special military tribunal.\n\nThe letters of Lavaysse were laid by Henry before an extraordinary council which was convoked for the purpose, and which was desired to deliberate calmly on their contents. The council answered by an unanimous address, drawn up in the most spirited language, expressive of utter abhorrence of the French, and offering their lives, their properties, and every thing that was dear to them, for the service of their sovereign and their country. Both in this address, and in the reply which Henry's secretary gave to Lavaysse, the calumny against England was indignantly pointed out, and was censured as such with deserved severity.\n\nWith Petion, Lavaysse was not more successful than with Christophe. He was, indeed, invited to Port au Prince, politely received, and patiently listened to; but nothing farther could he obtain, though he endeavoured to win over his bearers by violent invectives against the\n\"Corsican, the bashaw Le Clerc, and the other robbers who were sent to Hayti, in the year 1802, by the usurper.\" In vain did he blasphemously assure them that Lewis, \"like the Divinity of whom he was the representative,\" saw with equal affection all his subjects, of whatever colour they might be. The general assembly which had been called together to receive his propositions, unanimously rejected them, on the 21st of November; but, with a spirit of liberality which cannot fail to be admired, the French agent was informed that, wishing to re-establish commercial relations with France, and to testify respect for the character of Lewis the Eighteenth,\" the Haytian republic was willing to fix the basis of a pecuniary indemnity for the losses which the French colonists had sustained, and must continue to suffer, in consequence of the separation of Hayti from France.\" This offer was the more generous, inasmuch as it was certainly not prompted by any feeling of fear. Thus terminated the mission of Lavaysse, who took his departure from the island in the beginning of December. The circumstances of the negociation, and the result of it, were officially communicated to the people and the army by Petion, in an address, which did equal honour to his head and his heart, as it displayed a happy mixture of calmness and firmness, of solid reasoning and of polished diction.\nAs soon as they became known in Paris, the proceedings of Lavaysse were formally disowned by Lewis the Eighteenth, who declared him to have been merely authorised to collect such information as was necessary for the guidance of the French government. There is, however, not the shadow of a doubt that, though the monarch was kept in ignorance of the fact, the minister, Malouet, did give secret instructions to his agent, to play the part which he so awkwardly played.\n\nThis method having failed, the French cabinet determined to resort to force, and, accordingly, preparations were made for an expedition, which was intended to sail early in the year 1815. The return of Napoleon, however, saved the Haytians from this meditated attack. He himself, after having abolished the slave trade, endeavoured to prevail on them to become once more a colony of France; but his propositions were unhesitatingly and scornfully rejected. Short as was his reign, it was, nevertheless, productive of beneficial consequences to the Haytians. The government of the Bourbons was speedily re-established, but, by putting an end to the slave trade, he had deprived it of one of its most formidable weapons. Were conquest even practicable, it would be of little utility to conquer a colony of which the possession must be obtained by rendering it a desert, and to cultivate the soil of\nwhich, myriads of slaves could no longer be torn from their native land. The idea of employing force seems, therefore, to have been given up. Still, however, there was a lingering, though foolish hope, that something might yet be accomplished by other means. In July, 1816, several commissioners, all of them ex-colonists, and all of them said to be obnoxious characters, were appointed to administer the civil and military affairs of St. Domingo. They approached the coast in an American vessel, and, that they might not be outdone in absurdity by their predecessors, they sent on shore letters addressed to Monsieur General Christophe. Their letters were, of course, returned unopened. In a second attempt they were not more successful. Convinced by these two rebuffs that nothing could be done, they at length bent their course to Europe, having gained only the vexation of their disappointment, and the contempt of those whom they were commissioned to seduce.\n\nSince that period Hayti has remained in that state of tranquillity which furnishes few materials for the historic page. Early in the year 1818 Petion died, and was quietly succeeded, as president, by General Boyer. His death is said to have been voluntary; he having taken the strange resolution of obstinately refusing every kind of medicine and nourishment. The cause which induced him to act in this singular manner re-\nmains unknown. For a while this event seemed likely to destroy the peace of Hayti, as it was believed to be the intention of Christophe to avail himself of this opportunity to attempt the subjugation of the Haytian republic. Fortunately for humanity, if such were ever his intention, he speedily relinquished it, and both divisions of the black dominion have since continued in undisturbed repose.\nLETTER CONCERNING HAYTI.\nMY LETTER CONCERNING HAYTI.\n\nI FROM MY LETTER TO MR. VASTEY, OF HAYTI, I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT HE IS KING A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR. THE NAME OF THE KING IS JOSEPH. I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM, AND I AM NOT INFORMED WHERE HE IS. MR. VASTEY HAS BEEN AWAY FROM HOME FOR ABOUT A YEAR, AND HIS FAMILY IS IN GREAT DISTRESS. HE HAS SENT THEM A LETTER, BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO BE TOLD,\nLETTER CONCERNING HAYTI.\n\nThe latest information which has been received in England, concerning Hayti, is contained in the following letter, which is extracted from the twentieth number of Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. As the Editor of that work states the Letter to have been addressed to a friend of his \"by a naval officer of high character,\" it is probable that the details which it gives are generally correct. It is, therefore, inserted here, as a supplement to the sketch of the History of St. Domingo.\n\nH. M. S. \u2014 Port Royal, Sept. 1, 1818.\n\nMY DEAR SIR,\n\nI promised you, if I could give you any information from Hayti, I would send it. I am just returned from paying the king a visit at Cape Henry. I send you, by Lieutenant Bunce of the marines, in the Pique, all the Haytian publications; and I am sure you will be pleased to hear that the Baron Vastey is compiling a very full history of King Henry, from his earliest days, with a large appendix of original letters and papers. Mr. Steevens wished to have the documents sent him to complete a history, but the king desired him to be told, that he wished one of his own subjects to have the\ncredit of writing it, but that it should be sent him after publication, with whatever other documents he might wish. I told Baron Dupuy (who is everything at the Cape, what you may call the king's factotum, and certainly far the ablest man he has), that I hoped they meant to give a true and fair account of the king's early years, before he became a conspicuous character. He answered, that the king, when Baron Vastey and he were speaking about the history, said, \"my desire is, that it may, in what regards my life, be a plain and clear statement of facts, and that those who knew me in early life, when they see those facts in the book, may vouch for their truth.\" If they really do this, it will not only be curious but valuable, for few more extraordinary characters have appeared.\u2014He has risen from a slave at St. Kitts, where he was born, to be a steward in one of Count D'Estaing's fleet, and from that to uncontrolled power and riches, beyond what any individual almost ever possessed. When in good humour he calls himself an Englishman.\n\nTo account for my kind and friendly reception at the Cape, it is necessary to say that since my former visit in 1814, the king has always remembered me.\n\nStrong impressions have gone out all over the world against this man, of his tyranny, cruelty, avarice, and injustice, both to his own subjects, and those strangers who reside as merchants in his dominions\u2014but always remember one thing in reading accounts of his atrocities, that there are three sets of men whose interest it is to hold him up as a monster. The republicans, his neighbours, they have more justice on their side than the other two\u2014the proprietors of slaves and advocates for slavery all over the world\u2014and the merchants who trade with him; they do it, to keep others, by fear, away, that they may monopolise the trade. This was the first cause of our opening a correspondence, and that has had the desired effect in a great measure.\n\nIn 1814, I was sent by Admiral Brown to visit Cape\nTHE HISTORY OF ST. DOMINGO.\n\nHenry, for the purpose of ascertaining the true state of our commerce with Hayti; for there were strange reports in circulation, both to windward and at Jamaica. It was said that neither the persons nor the property of our merchants were safe; that on the most trivial occasions he threw them into prison, and seized and confiscated their property\u2014in short, such was the impression upon me, that I actually thought that my person was endangered by landing. However, I ventured, and once on shore, I remained all the time the ship lay there, and certainly was not a little astonished to find myself, after all, in the midst of a gentlemanlike well-informed set of merchants. And the following report, which I gave Admiral Brown, will show you the state of that body of men:\u2014\"According to your orders, I first of all communicated privately with the principal merchants, and then with these in a body at a public meeting. Their answer was unanimous. (Some of them, at that time, had the experience of eight years.) 'We conceive our persons and property under the protection of the king to be as safe as at Kingston, unless the French land an expedition, and then he has given us notice that all property, public and private, will be burnt with the city, but that he will give every protection to our persons, and we have the most perfect confidence in his promises.' And they added, 'we hope the admiral will send a man of war frequently to pay us a visit; it gives consequence here.'\" Such, in 1814, were the sentiments I found the merchants impressed with, and such they are, at this moment; nor could I hear of one act of injustice that could fairly be attributed to the king. He is sharp in his dealings, and in making them fulfil their contracts. But it is almost needless to mention how far a merchant adventurer will go for gain, and how necessary it is to watch them. They have now nearly given up attempting to take him in by outward show. He has too good judges about him; and being a good one himself, and when they\nleast expect it, seeing every thing, it would be a bad job for them to bring bad goods. I was asked by one of the principal merchants in Kingston, who had lost a good deal by the trade with Cape Henry, and who, of course, attributed that loss to the king, will you tell me of one man, Captain \u2014\u2014\u2014 who has made money by trading there? I answered, will you tell me, Mr. Pavishaw, of one merchant that ever made money by sending his goods to a market where double its consumption is thrown in annually, and from which there is no other outlet, except by re-shipping your goods back to England?\n\nIn the following remarks, I intend just to write you what I have seen myself or heard from the best authority. It would be presumption in me to venture to give the character of this most extraordinary man,\u2014so you must draw your own conclusions from the facts.\n\nThe king is in his person what in England you would call a fine portly looking man, about five feet ten inches. He is now growing stout, and on horseback, where he certainly looks the best, has much the appearance of old George. His dress, except on state days, is very like the Windsor uniform, without lace or star. He is quite black, with a manner and countenance, when in good humour (and I have never seen him in any other), very intelligent, pleasant and expressive\u2014his features are much that of his countrymen\u2014his nose rather long, but flat at the nostrils\u2014his lips are not thick\u2014his eyes, except when in a rage, rather small, but quick\u2014his forehead, which gives so much character to his countenance, high\u2014when I saw him last, his hair was gray, and until he remarked it to me himself (for I thought he wore powder), I did not observe that it is now grown quite white. I am told by those who have seen him in one of his gusts of passion, that it can only be compared to a hurricane for its fury; but fortunately the fit now comes very seldom, and does not last long. A friend, who has seen a great deal\nof him, said me he one day saw him in one\u2014his form absolutely dilated, his countenance changed; and his eyes became enlarged and rolled in his head. He looked like a demon\u2014it was over in five minutes, expending itself in words, and he was then as quiet as a child. None but the queen dare go near him in those paroxysms.\n\nSince my last visit, he has entered into a close and intimate alliance with Mr. Wilberforce and his party. His three great advisers for the improvement of his subjects are Messrs. Wilberforce, Stevans, and Clarkson. He has many others, amongst whom is Sir John Sinclair.\n\nHis avowed intention is a religious, moral, and political change. How far he is sincere, and how far he possesses talents capable of bringing about so great a change, time will best show. He appears to me a man possessing strong powers of mind, attended with strong passions. He is wholly without education, and even now can read very badly, and can only write enough to sign his name. But to make up for that, he has been brought up in the school of danger, difficulties, and intrigue, where his deep policy and knowledge of human character have shone as conspicuously as his courage and talent as a soldier.\n\nIt is his mind, and his alone, that governs all; he has the ablest men of his kingdom employed about his person, but they are mere executors of his will. One proof of his being neither a very changeable or cruel man, is, that almost all the great officers of the palace, who were there four years ago, are there now; and they bear, generally speaking, the characters of good and just men. And if he is in himself cruel to his subjects, he takes care to punish with the greatest severity that crime in others.\n\nThere is one striking part of his character,\u2014he never forgives a fault. He even sent his own son, the prince royal, a prisoner to the citadel, to show he paid no regard to high rank. But before you judge too severely of him for this,\nthink who he has to govern\u2014a set of slaves brought up without any principles of either religion or morality; and who have, in the sanguinary and dreadful contest for liberty, been accustomed, by the example of their enemies, to all sorts of butcherous and dreadful crimes. And well did their cruel and faithless masters, generally speaking, deserve their fate\u2014Till this spirit, by time, &c., dies away. I think he is the only man who can govern them, to do them real and lasting good.\n\nThe gentleman before mentioned, who has certainly had the best opportunity of seeing him in private life, says that he is a most affectionate father of a family, and that his children in his presence are under no fear or restraint. He has in his palace several little children, the orphans of old officers of his\u2014they are always running about the rooms, when he has no business, and feeling his pockets for bon-bons.\n\nWhen Dr. Burt was bleeding the princess royal, he came into the room and took the basin, and when Dr. Burt wished to relieve him from it, he said, Remember I am a father. There are many other little traits of a good and affectionate heart in domestic life. I only give these telling anecdotes to show you that the man is not a devil in a human shape. He is very much attached to the queen, who, by what every person says of her, deserves it. She is said to be of a most amiable character, and her charities are most extensive\u2014she is plain in her manners, and quite jet black.\n\nHer two daughters, as the lady told me that attended them as preceptress for a year (an American lady), are very accomplished, speaking English well\u2014in their manners particularly engaging and affable to all about them\u2014they are sixteen and eighteen.\n\nWhen I left Port Royal this last time, I was told by a captain of a man of war, that the strangers were confined within the Barricane except on Sunday, and then they were allowed to go out to dinner to a small place they had about\nTHE HISTORY OF ST. DOMINGO.\n\nfour miles from town. What did I find\u2014that strangers were allowed to go out at all times as far as 18 miles without a passport; they were allowed to go out shooting; in short, that they did as they liked. They asked the king for permission to take a house in the country to dine at how and then he immediately gave them a place, 4 miles out of town, called Haut du Cap, an excellent house, beautiful gardens, and 100 acres of fine land for pasture, or any use they chose to put them to. One of his courtiers, some time afterwards, wanted to buy it, and he said, it was no longer his, he had given it to the strangers. I told the strangers that the king ought to take it from them they kept it in such bad order.\n\nHe is now building a college at Sans Souci, where it is his intention to have professors of the different sciences from England. They, like all beginners, were too sanguine, and thought that nothing else was necessary than to have out all kinds of learned doctors. They were going to teach their boys Latin, Greek; in short, they were at once to rival our colleges. However, as this mania wore off, Baron Vastey, who has the management, began to see that he was all wrong, and that they must creep and walk before they could run, and now they are proceeding on rationally, until the college is built. He has established four schools under Englishmen on the Lancasterian system\u2014one at Cape Henry, Sans Souci, Gonaives, and Port au Paix.\n\nMr. Gulliver, at Cape Henry, came out two years ago\u2014he was a monitor at one of the establishments in the city road\u2014he is a very clever fine young man, and deserving the good opinion the king has of him\u2014his school has 177 boys. I was much astonished at the wonderful progress that was made by many in spelling, reading, writing, and arithmetic\u2014they did sums in addition in the most perfect manner above 400 millions. It is from this school he takes his masters for the small towns and villages, and the cleverest of those, of\ngood connection, are sent to learn Latin and Mathematics with Mr. \u2014\u2014, the clergyman, who is, I believe, a good teacher. It will be as well to mention to you now the opinions of the professor of anatomy, Dr. Stuart (a man in whose judgment I should place the most perfect reliance, and who is really a truly public benefit to the whole kingdom), and Mr. Gulliver, upon the natural capacities of the blacks.\n\n\"There is no doubt that they are quick at learning the early rudiments of education, and have wonderful memories, but the grand question, it appears, still remains to be solved, viz. how far they have powers of reasoning, &c.\" You will understand what they mean. Many mulattoes are found very able men\u2014both Barons Dupuy and Vastey are so; also Count Lemonad, the secretary. I was delighted to see a little flat-nosed beetle-browed black boy, about 11 years old, get above all the big fellows at the first going off, and keep the head of the class throughout the whole trial; from his accuracy and perfection in every change of subject, he deserved it. Mr. Gulliver has them in great order, and, I am sorry to say they require it, for they are brought up, notwithstanding every thing, very loose in their principles. The king, if he wishes thoroughly to succeed, must form the girls into schools, and so try to mend them. He has, in his late journey through his dominions, married them wherever he went by ranks, carrying a clergyman with him. This is what may be called a rough commencement of his moral system.\n\nSans Souci is the next school,\u2014this is more select, the schoolmaster, a young Aberdeen collegian, is said to be of very considerable talents, and to have got a regular college education. He is also tutor to the prince-royal. This youth's character is so differently represented that I do not know what to think of him\u2014he is not yet 15 years old, very large they say, quite as large as his father\u2014not wanting in talent, but prefers being on horseback to studying Euclid\u2014liberal of\nhis money when he has any\u2014in short, he may turn out anything yet for what people know.\n\nGonales\u2014the master of this place is dead, and an excellent riddance, by all accounts of those that knew him, it is. He was a most detestable canting hypocrite, but possessing considerable talents. He was secretary to one of the missionary societies. I was told by an English gentleman from Gonales, that people are not very sorry for him.\n\nPort au Paix\u2014this is another bad bargain. The king found him drunk at 12 o'clock in the day amongst his scholars. He is certain of dying, I think, this season, from all accounts. The king has paid each of these teachers monthly 100 dollars, but the two good ones he has said shall go home independent.\n\nMr. ________, the clergyman, was usher at a school at Plymouth. He was ordained about a week before he left England, and makes up in zeal, &c. &c. what he wants in sense. I believe he is not a bad schoolmaster, but to bring about a reformation in religion, it requires something very different\u2014he has so well managed his matters in three months, that none of the merchants or indeed anyone visit him, and even the ladies have given up going to hear him preach. Mrs. ________ instructs the young ladies.\n\nDr. Stuart, the professor of anatomy, is come out with Mrs. Stuart\u2014he appears a man about 38, and very clever\u2014he has taken charge of the hospitals, and no one, not even the governor, dare ask him a question\u2014he orders what he takes, and it is immediately given him\u2014in short, he says, that there is nowhere in Europe a more liberally endowed hospital\u2014if a common soldier requires two bottles of wine a day, he has it, and good. The king went round the hospital when I was there. I saw Dr. Stuart just after it; he was perfectly astonished. He said there was not an individual that he did not know by name; his character, his regimen,\ndisease, and every thing about him; and whenever he came to a blackguard (and the Doctor said every one he singled out had been a troublesome patient), he gave him a confounded crack on the head with his cane, saying\u2014\n\nthere were above 300 in\u2014the soldiers were all delighted to see him, and cut jokes\u2014not so the officers, they looked frightened\u2014the wards for the officers are really elegantly fitted up, and he sends them of all ranks there, from a duke downwards.\n\nWhen I arrived here, I sent to him at his palace at Sans Souci to beg an audience. I wished very much to have gone out there. I am wrong. He first sent to know if I had any particular business with him; if I had, he would see me, but he had not recovered from the fatigue of his journey; at the same time an order came in to ask for every attention as his friend. I sent out to say I wished to see him very particularly\u2014an answer to this brought an excuse, at which I was very much vexed\u2014however, two of his principal officers came in immediately afterwards from him with a fine message, that if I was going to stay till Wednesday the king would be in town; of course, I staid, and on Thursday morning had a long audience. He was in high good humour, and received me as an old friend\u2014we were obliged to speak through Baron Dupuey, as I cannot speak French well enough, and he wont speak English. We conversed a great deal upon the changes that had taken place since my last visit. In answer to something complimentary which I had said of his schools, he said, \"My wish is that my fellow-citizens may be made capable, by education, of enjoying the constitution I intend for them; and if I live long enough, the world will see that this has always been nearest my heart, and occupied all my thoughts; but I must have time; we require it.\" He has offered, through England, twenty millions of dollars to France to make an independent peace, guaranteed by England, but without the guarantee, he would not give 20\n\ndollars. It will be seen that the treasures of the treasures of the wilder side of the food is given to him. He said, when they are certain, certainly the people themselves, liberties and the world.\n\nIn the treasury and I know of hoards of treasure can liberty be citadel. Upon the enough should a minority to\n\nOn not seeing you come I will go pulling the largemen state.\n\nSans Souci, pa-try, palace with 1 they say,\ndollars, and till that is done, all his towns and the country will be kept in the present ruinous state; for if they make the trial, the hour they land they will find themselves in a wilderness, without a house to cover them, or a morsel of food but what they bring with them. When I mentioned to him the talent which I thought I saw in the boys, he said, with a smile,\u2014I think we shall be able to prove that we are capable of thinking and acting for ourselves. He certainly is bringing that great question to a fair trial, whether the negroes possess sufficient reasoning powers to govern themselves, or, in short, whether they have the same capacities as white men. And he is the only man, I think, in the world who could have given it so bold a trial.\n\nIn conversation one day with Baron Dupuy upon his treasures, he said, \"It is true I do possess immense treasures, and I know men think I am hoarding it for the mere pleasure of hoarding; but they are mistaken; and whenever that treasure can be of use to my fellow-citizens, in procuring them liberty and independence, it is ready to come down from the citadel.\" What a pity that such grand plans should depend upon the life of one individual, but I hope he will live long enough to give stability to his government and system, but should anything happen to him now, all would go in a minority to perfect ruin and barbarism.\n\nOn my taking leave, I said I had only one thing to regret, not seeing Sans Souci and Citadel d'Henry: he said, when you come back you shall come out to me at Sans Souci, and I will go with you myself to the Citadel, but I have been pulling down a great deal, and making alterations and enlargements, and I don't like to show things in an unfinished state.\n\nSans Souci, which, in my last visit, was merely his country palace, is now become, I am told, a handsome town, with a larger population than Cape Henry. The palace, they say, has undergone great alterations and improvements,\nand you may guess his magnificence when I tell you that the furniture for his grand hall of audience and state is expected daily from Paris, agreed for at one million of francs, and a German (for he will not allow a Frenchman to come) is to have 5000 dollars to fit it up.\n\nThe Citadel is hardly to be described. It appears from the sea at the distance of 15 miles, when clear of clouds, like one of those enchanted castles in old romances. It is built on the rocky pinnacle of the highest hill, said to be 1,500 feet above the level of the sea. He is now enlarging it, and I was told, but I do not believe it, that it will contain 90,000 men. I should guess 8000. He has a very handsome palace in it. Here are all his treasures. He is now building strong martello towers on the adjoining hills, which will give him a great command of hill country for raising food for his army. Except by treachery, I think it impregnable. There is no want of water, for it is always in the clouds.\n\nThe governor of Cape Henry, the Duke of Marmalade, a regular old black fellow, but an excellent and upright man, gave the officers and me a grand dinner. I took 13 of them and we sat down 36. We had two Dukes, three Counts, and four Barons, and all the strangers who had asked me to dinner. He gave us a most gentlemanlike dinner, with an elegant desert and good wine, and we drank all our toasts standing with three times three. They were very moderate, but this is not natural; they like a glass of wine. But the king might send for any of them, as they were all of his staff.\n\nBy the time you have got this far, I think you will be as tired of reading as my fingers are of writing. I send this through Mr. ______.\n\nAnd believe me,\n\nvery truly, yours,\n\n* * * *\nP.S. Did I mention that the king is determined to change the language from bad French to English? In consequence of the schools, those who do speak English speak it most correctly. They wish to annihilate every trace of a Frenchman.\n\nAPPENDIX.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nVOL.

Ordered by the House of Commons of the United Kingdom to be printed, 5th July, 1815.\n\nPREAMBLE.\n\nWhereas the illicit and clandestine importation of slaves into British colonies, wherein slavery is established by law, and the holding and detaining in slavery there of such negroes, mulattoes, and mustees, as by reason of such illicit importation, or otherwise, are lawfully entitled to their freedom, cannot be effectually and certainly prevented, without some better provision than the laws in force within the said colonies have made for ascertaining the number, and identifying the persons of the slaves now within the same, and of the future issue of the female slaves, upon whom, by the laws of the said colonies, the condition of slavery descends:\n\nAnd whereas by reason of the intercourse between the said colonies, and the frequent passage and removal of slaves from one British colony to another; and the frequent transfers of property in slaves within the said colonies, by sale, mortgage, and otherwise, made by and to persons resident in the united kingdom, and for other reasons, the necessary provisions and regulations for the purposes aforesaid cannot be fully and effectually made by the separate interior legislatures of the said colonies respectively, but only by the authority of Parliament.\n\nENACTMENTS.\n\n1. There shall be established in every colony, now or hereafter under the jurisdiction of the Crown in the West Indies, a registry of slaves, which is established by law, for the purpose of registration and recording the names of all negroes, mulattoes, and mustees registered or held in slavery at any times (that is to say) in the West Indies or in America, or in the island of Jamaica, and in the several parts of the same, respectively, and which shall be provided always, by the authority of the legislature of the leeward islands, comprising the supreme executive assembly thereof, and shall be taken to be a court of record, and that all negroes, mulattoes, and mustees so deemed to be slaves, and registered in the said registry, shall be deemed to be slaves in the same government, and shall be established as aforesaid.\n\n2. It shall be lawful for the owner of slaves in every colony, without the fault of any superior governor, lieutenant-governor, &c., to enter into such registry within such colony, and to pay the registrar, so to do, and the superior governor, &c. shall take cognizance thereof, and in council, (the members thereof being present), \"I A.

Z.\" willingly or knowingly, or by any false or fraudulent entry in the registry of slaves, or by any entry of such false or fraudulent entry, immediately give notice thereof to the governor, or lieutenant-governor, at the time being; and\nhereafter under the dominion of his Majesty, his heirs, &c., in the West Indies or America, or elsewhere, in which slavery is established or permitted by law, a public registry, for the registration and enrolment of the names and descriptions of all negroes, mulattoes, and mustees, and all slaves shall be registered or returned for registration, within the following times (that is to say) in every such colony in the West Indies, or in America, Jamaica excepted, within the term of in Jamaica, within the term of and in all more distant parts of the world, within the term of to be respectively computed from the passing of this act: Provided always, that every such island within the government of the leeward Charibbee islands, or any other government comprising more islands than one, as has a separate legislative assembly and courts of law of its own, shall be deemed and taken to be a separate colony for the purpose of this act: and that all other islands within such governments shall not be so deemed and taken, but the slaves therein shall be registered in the registry of the nearest island within the same government in which a public registry shall be established as aforesaid.\n\n2. It shall be lawful for his Majesty to appoint a registrar of slaves in each and every of the said colonies; and in default of any such appointment, &c. it shall be lawful for the governor, &c. to appoint some fit and proper person, resident within such colony, to be registrar of slaves therein, which registrar, so to be appointed by his Majesty, or such governor, &c. shall take the following oath before such governor, &c. in council, (that is to say),\n\n\"I A. B. do solemnly promise and swear, that I will not willingly or knowingly make or permit, or suffer to be made, any false or fraudulent entry, erasure, or obliteration, in the registry of slaves to be committed to my charge; but if any such false or fraudulent act shall become known to me, will immediately give notice thereof to the governor, lieutenant-governor, or civil commander in chief of this colony for the time being; and will in all respects faithfully and uprightly\nperform the duties of the office of registrar of slaves for this colony.\u2014So help me God.\n\nAnd every person so appointed to the said office of registrar shall become bound by bond or recognizance, with two sufficient sureties, in the penal sum of \u00a3100, with condition for the faithful performance of all the duties of his office.\n\n3. The governor, &c. shall provide a proper and convenient house or building within or near to the chief town of the colony, for the sole purpose of the registry.\n\n4. The registrar shall provide two large blank paper books, or sets of books, for the purpose of the registry; one of which books shall be entitled \"Registry of Plantation Slaves,\" and the other \"Registry of Personal Slaves.\"\n\n5. As soon as conveniently may be, after the passing of this act, his Majesty's principal secretary of state for the colonial department shall cause a sufficient number of copies of this act, printed by his Majesty's printers (and which are hereby declared to be legal evidence thereof in all courts of justice,) to be officially dispatched and transmitted by different conveyances to the governor, lieutenant-governor, or civil commander in chief of every colony under the dominion of his Majesty, in which slavery is established, or permitted by law: and immediately after the receipt of any such official dispatch, with any such copy of this act, every such governor, lieutenant-governor, or civil commander in chief, shall cause the same to be publicly notified in the most effectual manner in the colony under his government, and shall express in such notification the particular day at, or before which, the owners or possessors of slaves within the colony are to return lists or schedules of the slaves owned or possessed by them, pursuant to the directions hereinafter contained; and shall, for the fuller and speedier information of all persons within the colony, cause this act to be reprinted and published there, unless a sufficient number of copies hereof, for the use of the colony, shall have been transmitted to, and received by him as aforesaid.\n\n6. On or before the day mentioned in the notice given by the governor, lieutenant-governor, or civil commander in chief, who shall then be in possession of the same, whatever slaves or slaves, respectively making up or list in writing, they then bein possessed, thereupon, the plantation or more plantations of the same person, or persons, slaves, the names held and cultivated division of the land, and whether cotton, or stock, the same shall be made the present owner, as well as of the same, making such person as proprietor, manager, or owner of any such plantation prior to such notice, mention the name whose tenure or person making or belonging to, called \"person\" in writing, or name and description of other person or persons slave or slaves, right or charge.\n6.

B.\" (inserting the proper name of the plantation) or of C. D., the owner of personal slaves, as the case may be; and the said list shall be divided into as many sections as there are different families to be inserted therein, and each section shall be entitled, \"The Family of A. B.\" (inserting the name of the superior relation) or where there are only brothers or other relations of the same degree, the name of the elder individual; and each of the said schedules shall also contain two other lists, in one of which shall be inserted the names of such male slaves, and in the other the names of such female slaves, as have no wives or husbands, parents or children, brothers or sisters, among the slaves of the same plantation, or the same owner or owners; which lists shall be respectively entitled, \"General List of Male Slaves,\" and \"General List of Female Slaves,\" on the plantation A. B. (inserting the proper name of the plantation,)\nor \"belonging to C. D.\" as the case may be; and all the slaves attached or belonging to the same plantation, or the same owner or owners, shall be named and described in the said schedule respectively, and in the particular lists or sections to which they respectively belong, in the manner and form following; (that is to say,) the schedule or paper containing each of the said lists shall be divided into eight perpendicular columns of convenient breadth, respectively entitled at the heads thereof; names, surnames, colours, employments, age, stature, country, and marks; to which shall be added in the lists of families, a ninth column of convenient breadth, entitled, \"Relations;\" and, the more clearly to distinguish the description of each particular slave, as many horizontal lines, with convenient spaces between them, shall be drawn across the said perpendicular lines or columns, as are equal in number to the number of slaves to be inserted in each list; and in the first of the said columns shall be inserted the name of baptism of each slave, if he or she shall have been baptised, and if not, the name by which he or she has been usually called and known; in the second of the said columns shall be inserted the surname, or second name of the slave, if he or she has ever been called or known by any surname or second name; and if not, then in cases of family slaves included in the said lists of families, the name of the superior relation; and in the cases of slaves who are included in the said general lists of males and females, such name as the owner or party making the return, shall think fit to insert therein, as the surname by which the slave and his lawful issue, or her natural issue and their descendants respectively, shall thereafter always be called: provided nevertheless, that in cases of family slaves, the owner or party making the return may also give, if he thinks fit, some other family name, instead of that of the superior relation, so as no two families on the same plantation, or belonging to the same owner, shall have the same surname in the said schedule or return; but for all the purposes of this act, the surname by\nwhich each slave shall first be returned or registered, shall continue for ever after to be the surname of such slave, and of his lawful issue if a male, or her natural issue if a female, and of their respective descendants, and shall not afterwards be changed; in the third of the said columns shall be inserted negro, mulatto, or musket, as the case may be, or such designation of intermediate shades of colour (if any) as are in use within the colony; in the fourth of the said columns shall be inserted the particular trade, occupation, or ordinary employment of the slave, specifying in the cases of mechanics, artisans, or handicraftsmen, the particular art or business in which he or she is usually employed; in the case of domestic slaves, the particular domestic service or department in which he or she is usually employed; and in cases of ordinary plantation slaves, describing them as labourers only; and in the fifth of the said columns shall be inserted the age of the slave, according to the best of the knowledge and belief of the owner or other party making the return; in the sixth of the said columns shall be inserted the exact stature in feet and inches, by actual measurement of the slave, which measurement, in cases of infant slaves, or such as have not clearly attained their full growth, shall be repeated prior to every triennial return hereinafter directed to be made; in the seventh of the said columns shall be inserted, not only whether the slave is an African or Creole negro, but if an African, the name of the country or district of Africa from which he or she was brought; and, if a Creole slave, the island or colony in which such slave was born, or from which he or she was brought, according to the best of the knowledge or information and belief of the owner or other party making the return; and in the eighth of the said columns shall be inserted, whether the slave has any, and what scars and marks on the face or other parts of the body, such as African slaves commonly have, and which are usually called country marks; or any such brands or marks as are used in some colonies for distinguishing the owner's property,\nor has any apparent bodily singularity, defect, or deformity; all which shall be specified with convenient certainty, so as at least to mention the part of the face or body wherein the marks, brands, defects, or other singularity appears; and lastly, in the further column, to be added as aforesaid in the lists of family slaves, shall be inserted the relation that the slave bears to the superior relative or slave by whose name the family section of the list to which he belongs is entitled as aforesaid, with such further particulars of genealogy or family connexion as the owner or party making the return shall think fit to add; and at the end of the said returns respectively, shall be summed up and set down in words at length, the whole number of slaves then belonging to the plantation for which, or to the owner or owners of personal slaves on whose behalf, such returns are made. And for the better ascertaining of the proper form of such returns of slaves as are hereby required to be made, so that no person may pretend ignorance thereof, a form or example of such returns is contained in a schedule to this act annexed, to which all persons are required, so far as shall be found practicable, to conform; and at the time of notifying and publishing this act in any colony as aforesaid, public notice shall be given by the said governor, lieutenant-governor, or civil commander in chief, in such manner as to him shall feel most fit and effectual, that a form or pattern of the returns hereby required to be made may be seen, and a printed copy thereof, with blanks to be filled up according to the rules aforesaid, obtained at the registrar's office, to be appointed as aforesaid; and printed blank copies of the said forms shall accordingly be provided by the registrar, and delivered to all persons applying for the same, at a price not exceeding five shillings for each printed copy.\n\n7. Every person making and subscribing any schedule, shall personally deliver the same, either to the said registrar, or to the person by him appointed to receive returns or schedules, in the proper district of the colony in which the\nparty making the same shall reside; and shall at the same time take the following oath, which the said registrar, and every person by him appointed, is hereby empowered and required to administer.\n\n\"I, A. B. (name the deponent) do solemnly swear, that the schedule or return now by me delivered to be registered, contains, as I verily believe, a just, true, and full return, account, and description of all the slaves now attached or belonging to the plantation therein named, [or, belonging to the owner or owners therein named,] and being within this colony; and that the said return is made by me, according to the best of my knowledge and belief, truly, and without fraud, deceit, or evasion.\u2014So help me God.\"\n\n8. From and after the day appointed, no return shall be received; except in such special cases as in this act are afterwards provided for.\n\n9. As soon as any schedules shall have been received by the registrar, he shall proceed to register the same with all convenient speed. Governors may enlarge the time for completing the registration of returns. Proviso, that before any extension of time, the whole number of slaves returned to be ascertained on oath by the registrar, before the governor.\n\n10. Returns or schedules shall be entered in the books of registry, in a prescribed manner and form.\n\n11. Slaves within a certain number shall be registered in one book, when the number is greater, in a set of books.\n\n12. When the books are filled, new books shall be opened, and in what manner.\n\n13. Indexes of plantations or owners' names shall be prefixed to each book.\n\n14. No erasures shall be permitted in the register book.\n\n15. Office copies of the registered lists or returns shall be delivered to the owners.\n\n16. When all the returns are registered, notice thereof shall be given, and of the means of supplying omissions within a limited time.\n17. Governors shall have power to direct returns to be received and registered after the limited time, in certain cases.\n\n18. The end of the term of office every registrar shall proceed finally to close and authenticate the primary or original registration of all the slaves in the colony, for which he acts, which shall thenceforth be called \"The Original Registry of the Slaves of such Colony,\" in manner prescribed; and shall subscribe his name, and affix his seal of office; and below the said signature shall write the following affidavit; setting forth that he has twice carefully examined and compared all the preceding entries, &c., &c.; and that he is enabled thereby to depose, and does depose, that the preceding original registry of slaves is in all respects correctly and faithfully made.\n\n19. Alphabetical indexes of notes of registered slaves shall be made and entered in general index books.\n\n20. Duplicate books of the original registry shall be prepared and transmitted to England.\n\n21. Triennial returns of slaves shall be hereafter made, and how.\n\n22. Triennial returns shall be delivered on oath.\n\n23. The registrar, on the receipt of triennial returns, shall forthwith proceed to correct, enlarge, and continue pursuant thereto, the former registry of the plantation slaves and personal slaves, to which such returns respectively shall relate, in manner following: (that is to say,) the said registrar shall, in the first place, carefully compare such returns, and the names and descriptions of slaves therein contained, with the original registry of the slaves of the same plantation or plantations respectively, and of such other plantation within the colony, from which any of the said slaves may be stated to have been newly purchased or transferred, or of the same owner or owners of personal slaves, and of any former owner or owners thereof, under whom the present owner or owners thereof shall derive his or their title; and also, with all in-\ntermediate continuations and corrections of the said original registry by former triennial returns, so as to ascertain, not only that the whole number of slaves mentioned in the said returns corresponds with the original and former entries of slaves belonging to the same plantation or plantations, owner or owners respectively, (having regard to all former continuations and corrections) but also that the descriptions of all slaves of such triennial returns named and described, correspond with such former descriptions thereof, (if any,) as are in the said books of registry contained, except so far as such descriptions are in any particular stated to have been altered in respect to stature or bodily marks, since the last registered returns; and, in case there shall be found any apparent inconsistency between any such triennial returns and the said original or former triennial registries of slaves, belonging to the same plantation or plantations, owner or owners respectively; or if, in the case of any slave or slaves returned as newly acquired by purchase or transfer, succession or reversion, from any other plantation or plantations, or former owner or owners within the same colony, there shall not appear in the return of the same period for such other plantation or former owner or owners, a corresponding entry of the same slaves, as deducted by sale or transfer, determination of estate, or otherwise, from the last registered stock of such other plantation or plantations, or former owner or owners, the registrar shall give notice thereof to the owner or owners, or other party or parties making any such return or returns, and require him or them to attend before him the said registrar, to explain or remove such apparent inconsistency or defect; and until the same shall be accordingly done to the entire satisfaction of the said registrar, by an examination upon oath, if necessary, (which oath the said registrar is hereby empowered to administer) the said registrar shall not proceed to register any such triennial returns so apparently defective or erroneous; but the party or parties refusing or omitting so to explain, and, if necessary, to correct the same, shall, for all time to come, be deemed to have omitted to make such defective or erroneous returns, and, in case of any enquiry thereon, shall state the reason why no such return was made.\n\n24. Immediately after each examination, the registrar shall cause to be not in the said books of registry, which shall state the name or description of each slave, the said number so last returned in the original book of registry, the same \"not returned,\" eight hundred and thirty-three, and shall subsequently be stated in any subsequent return, if the slave has been sold or otherwise permitted, or to be removed, shall write in the said book of registry and opposite the name of any such permitted slave or slaves, in the space of the same book, the word \"deserted,\" as the case may be, then proceed to make a return of any of the members of the former and last registered stock belonging to the said owner or owners of persons who have been last registered in the said book thereof from the same plantation, owner or owners.\nshall, for all the purposes of this act, be deemed and taken to have omitted to make any return for the period to which such defective return relates; saving, nevertheless, to him or them, such remedy by appeal, as is hereinafter provided, in case of any error or misconduct herein by the said registrar.\n\n24. Immediately from and after such comparison and examination, as aforesaid, every return which shall be found to be not inconsistent, &c. shall be registered in the said books of registry, (that is to say) when any such returns shall state that there has been no alteration in the number or descriptions of the slaves, since the last returns for the same plantation; or the said owner or owners of personal slaves, the said registrar shall carry forward the whole number so last returned to a new folio or double page in the said original book of registry, and shall enter and insert under the same \"no alteration by return of the year one thousand eight hundred and \"; as by return dated , and shall subscribe his name to such entry; but as to slaves stated in any such triennial returns to have died, or to have been sold or otherwise transferred, or to have been manumitted, or to have permanently deserted, the said registrar shall write in the column of corrections of the said original registry and of every intermediate triennial registry, wherein the name of any such deceased, sold, transferred, or manumitted slave or deserter shall have been inserted in the proper space of the said column, opposite the name of such slave, the word \"dead\" or \"sold, transferred, manumitted,\" or \"deserted,\" as the case may be; and the said registrar shall then proceed to sum up the number of all slaves, which, by any of the means aforesaid, have been deducted from the former and last registered account of the stock of slaves belonging to the same plantation, or to the same owner or owners of personal slaves, as the case may be, since the said last registered returns, and shall deduct the whole number thereof from the last registered account of slaves of such plantation, owner or owners, and shall carry forward the\nAPPENDIX.\n\nremaining number thereof to a new folio or double page of the proper book of registry, making a written reference thereto at the foot of the folio from which the same is carried, and subscribing the same with his name; and in such new folio or double page, and in as many successive folios as may be necessary, shall be afterwards inserted the names and description of all slaves mentioned in the same triennial returns to have been newly added to the former registered stock by any of the lawful means aforesaid; distinguishing not only the several families and all other particulars, as in the said original registry, but also the particular mode of acquisition of every such newly added slave, by the word \"born, purchased, returned, imported,\" or such other brief designation as may be applicable to each case.\n\n\u00a75. At the end of the registration of each triennial return, the whole number of slaves then belonging to each plantation or owner shall be summed up and entered.\n\n26. Omissions of returns from accidents, or unavoidable impediments, or defaults of persons, not the absolute owners, are to be supplied.\n\n27. General accounts or abstracts of triennial returns shall be made out by registrars, and authenticated on oath, and transmitted to England.\n\n28. If returns are unduly received, or refused for registration by the registrar, parties aggrieved may appeal to the governor, and from him to the king in council, giving security, &c.\n\n29. Penalties shall be levied on the registrar, his deputies, and clerks, for making or permitting any false or fraudulent entries in the books of registry, and for fraudulent erasures, &c. and for such offences by other persons.\n\n30. If any person, making any original or triennial return of slaves, shall falsely and wilfully insert therein any name or description of any slave, or pretended slave, belonging to any plantation, or owner, &c. knowing that such slave, &c. as shall be so named, &c. doth not in fact belong, at the time of making such return, offending shall be punished as if falsely returned; and no person shall be held to any slave which shall be returned, actually in the service of the aforesaid person represented by such return, who shall not be able to prove that he was such as was returned; the prosecutor shall give satisfaction for return, in the penalty of \u00a3100, fraudulent or willful.\n\n31. The certificate of the\n\n32. Registration of slaves from sterling nations in the colonies.\n\n33. Registration of slaves in the colony for whom they are employed.\n\n34. And whereas the colony is now annually preventing the importation of slaves brought into the colony under pretence of their being employed there to regulate the number of slaves and importations of slaves from another, and the importing of slaves shall be permitted.\n\n35. If any person, now or hereafter, shall bring into his colony, now or hereafter, or his heirs, or successors, any slaves, or such slave shall be brought into the colony, under the pretence of his successors, the owner of such slaves shall first send the same back from which such slave was brought.\nof making such return, to such plantation, &c. any person so offending shall forfeit, for every slave, or pretended slave, so falsely returned, the sum of . Provided, that no person shall be liable to any such penalty, in respect of any slave which he shall prove to have been, at the time of the return, actually employed upon the plantation, or in the service of the asserted owner, to which the same were represented by such return to belong; although he or she shall not be able to prove that the property in such slave or slaves was such as was stated in the return, except when the prosecutor shall give evidence, beyond the falsification of the return, in the point of property, to show that the same was fraudulent or wilfully false.\n\n31. The certificates of registrars shall be evidence.\n\n32. Registrar to be entitled to certain fees, to be reduced from sterling money into current money of the respective colonies.\n\n33. Registrars shall not own slaves; and shall reside in the colony for which they are appointed.\n\n34. And whereas it is necessary or expedient, for effectually preventing the fraudulent introduction and registration of slaves brought from Africa, or foreign colonies, under pretence of their having been brought from a British colony, to regulate the manner in which the exportation and carriage, and importation of slaves, sent from one British colony to another, and their registration under this act, shall hereafter be permitted. Whenever any slave shall be sent from any colony, now or hereafter under the dominion of his Majesty, his heirs, or successors, in which a registry of slaves shall have been established pursuant to this act, with intent that such slave shall be removed to, and remain in some other colony, under the dominion of his Majesty, his heirs, or successors, the owner, or other person sending any such slave, shall first send to and lodge in the registry of the colony, from which such slave shall be sent, a declaration in writing,\nsigned by the owner of such slave, or by some person by such owner empowered and authorized in that behalf, setting forth the registered name and description of such slave, and declaring that the same is meant to be exported from that colony, and to be sent to and remain in another British colony, therein specified, and desiring a certificate thereof; and if it shall thereupon appear to the registrar, that the slave named and described in such declaration, is duly registered in his office as the property of the owner, by whom or on whose behalf such declaration is made, he shall forthwith register the exportation of such slave, in the proper book or books of registry in his office, by writing in the column of corrections of the said original registry, and of every triennial registry wherein the name of such slave shall be registered, the words \"Exported to...\" (naming the colony,) and shall deliver to the said owner, or such other person empowered and authorized by him, an extract certified by him, the said registrar, of the name, &c.; which certified extract shall be produced to the collector or other principal officer of his Majesty's customs, at the port at which any such slave shall be shipped; and shall be by such collector or other principal officer, indorsed with his own name and hand-writing, and shall be annexed to the clearance or permit to be given for the shipment of such slave; and shall, on the arrival at the port in any other British colony, to which the same shall be destined, be produced also to the collector or principal officer of the customs, at such last-mentioned port, who shall examine the same, and also shall ascertain, by personal inspection, whether the negro, mulatto, or other person, agree in bodily description with the slave, mentioned in such certificate and clearance; and if not, shall refuse to admit the same to an entry, but in case of such agreement, shall indorse such certificate with his name and hand-writing; and the said certificate, so indorsed, shall be forthwith produced to, and left with the registrar\nfor slaves of such last-mentioned colony, and shall be by him filed in his office, as his necessary warrant for registering such slave, as newly imported, &c.\n\n35. Penalties shall be levied, for exporting or sending slaves from one British colony, under an alleged or actual destination, to another, without certificates from the registrar.

In this capacity many letters and papers of importance have been submitted to my inspection, and sundry examinations of persons taken before me; from whence, and some other very authentic and well selected information, communicated to me by some intelligent friends who resided many years on the spot,* I have stated the following particulars, which, I trust, not only prove, beyond all contradiction, the right of the British crown to the sovereignty of this delightful and most valuable country, but also show, that such advantages will naturally result to our revenues, com-\n\n* For the description which follows of the country, and its native inhabitants, I am principally indebted to the Rev. Mr. W******, who resided some years on the Musquito shore, and which I give chiefly in his own words, because I cannot hope to add perspicuity or force to his very satisfactory and elegant account.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nmerce, and navigation, from its further settlement and improvement; such easy channels be opened, from our possession of it, of attacking the Spanish dominions in time of war, and such grateful returns be made to the private adventurer for whatever sums may be expended in its cultivation, as well deserve the most serious attention of government. Lest, however, it should be supposed, that my duty, as one of his Majesty's council requires me to suppress every information which I have received on this occasion, I think it necessary to premise, that I have stated no one fact or circumstance, but what is of public concern to the inhabitants of Great Britain, and of common notoriety on the Musquito shore. But, though I have strictly observed this rule, throughout the whole of this paper, I think myself, at the same time, free to declare, that neither in my capacity above-mentioned, nor otherwise, have I yet met with any information, reasoning, or occurrence, whatever, which either ought to, or can, in the smallest degree, invalidate or weaken the account which I am about to give.\n\nWith this plea I proceed:\u2014and, first, in regard to the right which Great Britain has to the dominion of this country, the following facts appear to me to be clear and incontrovertible; namely, that the native Indians of this country have never been conquered by, nor did they ever submit to, the Spanish government;\u2014that the Spaniards had never any settlement among them;\u2014that, during the course of upwards of one hundred years, they have maintained a strict and uninterrupted alliance and friendship with the subjects of Great Britain:\u2014that they have made a free and formal cession of the dominion of their country to his Majesty's predecessors, acknowledging the king of Great Britain for their sovereign, before the American treaty concluded at Madrid in 1670:\u2014that this cession of the Indians to the British crown was accepted on behalf of the king of Great Britain, has been frequently and very formally repeated by the natives;\u2014and finally, that this accumulation of\nAPPENDIX.\n\nBritish right was not impaired by the last treaty of peace. These positions, I say, appear to me certain and indisputable.\n\nThe first two are admitted by the Spaniards themselves. In regard to the next, namely the alliance of the natives with the subjects and crown of Great Britain, and their submission to its government, previous to 1670; the following circumstances, which, I presume, may be abundantly confirmed by original papers now in the plantation office, are recorded by Sir Hans Sloane, who was himself present in Jamaica, when the Musquito king, in person, applied to the Duke of Albemarle, governor of that island, in the reign of James the Second, to renew his allegiance, and to crave protection.\n\n\"The memorial and substance,\" says Sir Hans, \"of what he (the Musquito king) and the people with him represented to the Duke of Albemarle, was, that in the reign of Charles the First, the Earl of Warwick, by virtue of letters of reprisal, possessed himself of several islands in the West Indies; particularly that of Providence (since called by the Spaniards St. Catalina), which is situated 13\u00b0 10' N. lat. lying east from Cape Gracias-a-Dios (vulgarly known by the name of the Musquitos) between thirty and forty leagues; which put the said earl upon all ways and means of future correspondence with the natives of the said cape, and neighbouring country; and, in some little time, he was so successful as to gain that point, and prevailed with them so far as to persuade them to send home the king's son, leaving one of his people as hostage for him, which was Colonel Morris, now living at New York. The Indian prince going home with the said earl, staid in England three years, in which time the Indian king died, and the natives having in that time intercourse and commerce with those of Providence were soon made sensible of the grandeur of his Majesty of Great Britain, and how necessary his protection was to them; upon the return of the said Indian prince, they persuaded him to resign up his authority and power over them, and with them unani-\n\nously declare allegiance to Great Britain. They have ever since been under the supreme command of the Duke of Albemarle.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the treaty was signed in the following manner:\n\n\"The king of Great Britain shall have, hold, and possess the said countries, isles, and places situated in the West Indies, under the said king, and his heirs and present holders, and their successors, in any colour or form whatsoever, ever to be understood concerning the same, by the last treaty of peace.\"\n\n\"His Britannic Majesty shall fortifications be built at the mouth of Honduras, as part of the provisions of the treaty.\"\n\nFrom ignorant articles ever raised, no apprehension has arisen any doubt of this country, the Musquito shore being ever esteemed as appears by every bay or gulf of N. lat. 21\u00b0 0' Cape Honduras, Cape Hondu\nniously declare themselves the subjects of his said Majesty of Great Britain; in which opinion,\" continues Sir Hans, \"they have ever since persisted, and do own no other supreme command over them.\"\u2014Hist. of Jamaica, 1st Edit., vol. i. p. 76.)\n\nIn the month of June, 1670, the famous American treaty was signed at Madrid, of which the 7th article stands as follows:\n\n\"The king of Great Britain, his heirs, and successors, shall have, hold, and possess, for ever, with full right of sovereign dominion, property, and possession, all lands, countries, islands, colonies, and dominions, whatever, situated in the West Indies, or in any part of America, which the said king of Great Britain, and his subjects, do at this present hold and possess; so that in regard thereof, or upon any colour or pretence whatever, nothing may, or ought, ever to be urged, nor any question or controversy moved, concerning the same, hereafter.\" Let us now refer to the last treaty of peace, of which the 17th article is as follows:\n\n\"His Britannic Majesty shall cause to be demolished all the fortifications which his subjects shall have erected in the Bay of Honduras, and other places of the territory of Spain, in that part of the world, within four months after the ratification of the treaty;\" &c.\n\nFrom ignorance, as it would seem, that the first of these articles ever existed, or from some most unaccountable misapprehension and misconstruction of the second, has solely arisen any doubt of his Majesty's just right to the sovereignty of this country; for, it must be remembered, that the Mosquito shore is no part of the Bay of Honduras, nor was it ever esteemed as such by the Spaniards themselves, as plainly appears by every chart of this coast in use among them. The bay or gulf of Honduras extends from Cape Catoche, in N. lat. 21\u00b0 0' W. lon. 86\u00b0 30' (reckoning from London), to Cape Honduras, in lat. N. 16\u00b0 and W. lon. 85\u00b0 55'. From Cape Honduras to the northern branch or mouth of the Lake\nNicaragua, commonly called St. John's River, in lat. about 10\u00b0 25', lies the sea coast of the country commonly called the Musquito shore; a country on which the Spaniards never had any footing, claim of occupancy, or possession, from the beginning of the world to this day. If they had, they relinquished it by the first of the foregoing articles; for the native Indians of this country, who had happily preserved their freedom and independency, amidst the general carnage and desolation which the Spaniards had spread over the territories around them, had already applied for and obtained the British protection; acknowledging the king of England for their sovereign, as we have already shown; so, that in fact, they were included in the very words of the above article, being at that time, to all intents and purposes, subjects of the British crown. This, their submission to the sovereignty of Great Britain, was not only most solemnly renewed, by the Musquito king in person, to the Duke of Albemarle, when governor of Jamaica, as before stated; but it is a fact, not to be denied, that they have made it a point to give, to almost every succeeding governor, fresh assurances of their allegiance; in consequence of which, Great Britain did, for upwards of a century, afford them protection; and has for many years constantly distributed annual presents among their native chieftains. In the year 1741, a regular establishment of troops, under the command of a superintendent, was fixed there; and an administration of justice, by magistrates and courts of quarter session, was constituted in 1744, which continued to subsist under the auspices of government, till the last peace, when the troops and military stores were removed, and orders given to dismount the guns, and dismantle the fortifications which our people had built, for the protection of themselves and their faithful friendly allies, the native Indians, who were now to be exposed to the implacable resentment of a power from which they had every thing to dread, and by which, but for our protection, they had long ago been exterminated. These unpolitic orders were given, in the notion that Honduras; an attempt at a harsher name for it, neither is it the capital of the world; the discovery of the benevolent grace of even (which is the king of England) to whom the conclusion was extended, in a manner of this kind, the Spanish crown subjects of Great Britain, ring dictates the allegiance to which.\n\nHaving thus referred to the sovereigns, best of all things, consent of its subjects, the best accorded.\n\nThe sea coast of Honduras to St. John's river, and if the districts behind it possesses an extent as the kingdom.\n\nOf the province of Black River, Honduras, four leagues fields, about Cias-a-Dios.\n\nFrom Bl\norders were evidently grounded on a most unaccountable notion that the Musquito shore was part of the Bay of Honduras; an astonishing instance of inattention, to call it by no harsher name. As it is no part of the Bay of Honduras, so neither is it any part of the territory of Spain in that part of the world;\" for admitting the Spanish claim of prediscovey of the whole of this coast, aided as it was by the benevolent grant of Pope Alexander the Sixth, and admitting even (which I have shown is not the case) that the subjects of England had no intercourse with the country previous to the conclusion of the American treaty in 1670, will it be pretended, in a nation so enlightened as ours, that circumstances of this kind are sufficient to justify the pretensions of the Spanish crown to enslave a free people, who, if not the subjects of Great Britain, are, by the laws of God and the unerring dictates of human nature, free at this day, to yield allegiance to what power they please?\n\nHaving thus briefly shown, that the right of Great Britain to the sovereign dominion of this country is founded on the best of all titles, namely, the unrestrained and spontaneous consent of its free and ancient inhabitants, I shall now give the best account I am able of the country itself.\n\nThe sea coast, as before described, extends from Cape Honduras to the northern branch of the Nicaragua or St. John's river, a space of one hundred and eighty leagues; and if the distant mountains, which bound the Spanish territories behind, be considered as the inland line, Great Britain possesses an extent of country here, more than half as large as the kingdom of Portugal.\n\nOf the present British settlements, the three principal are Black River, about twenty-six leagues, nearly east, from Cape Honduras; Cape Gracias-a-Dios in lat. 14\u00b0 54', about fifty-four leagues, nearly E. S. E. from Black River; and Blewfields, about seventy leagues, nearly south, from Cape Gracias-a-Dios.\n\nFrom Blewfields to Black River the country is generally\nflat for many miles from the sea coast; but it rises into hills much sooner to the westward of Black River, and to the southward of Blewfields.\n\nEvery variety of animal and vegetable nature, for use or beauty, for food or luxury, has been most liberally bestowed on this country. It is everywhere plentifully watered; and the soil is almost everywhere fertile in very uncommon degree, and capable of producing, in the utmost perfection, whatever is produced between the tropics. The cotton bush, the cocoa or chocolate-nut, and vencilloes, flourish spontaneously all over the country. Indigo, too, is a native, and appears to be of the same sort with that of the neighbouring province of Guatimal, which is accounted the best of any. The sugar-cane arrives here to as great perfection as in any of the islands; and the quantity of mahogany and sarsaparilla, annually exported from hence to Great Britain, renders the settlement already an object of no small importance in the scale of her commerce and navigation. The rivers and coasts abound with excellent fish; and the finest turtle, both for food and shell, is found here in greater plenty than in any part of the known world. To which it may be added, and it is a circumstance of no small utility in an infant settlement, that the mouths of many of the principal rivers produce a prodigious quantity of oysters, both of the mangrove and flat species; of the latter sort, there are banks that appear inexhaustible; so that with respect to food, the inhabitants of this country seem almost to be exempted from the general curse entailed on our first parents.\n\nIn 1770 there were, exclusive of the natives, about fourteen hundred inhabitants, subjects of Great Britain, of whom two hundred and six were whites, about as many more of mixed blood, and about nine hundred slaves. Of these, one hundred and thirty-six whites, one hundred and twelve mixtures, and about six hundred slaves, were at or within a few miles of the Black River; which, however, is, in almost every view, one of the most ineligible situations for a capital;\nand, indeed, it became the first settlement chiefly on account of what causes this ineligibility: its nearness to one extremity of the shore, and there being only about six feet water on its bar, having rendered this river the readiest and safest retreat for our logwood cutters, who were driven from the Bay of Honduras in 1730.\n\nBlewfields has very greatly the advantage over Black River in several respects, and bids fair to become a place of importance. There is generally twelve or thirteen feet water at the entrance of the harbour. The Bluff, an extensive rocky eminence, of very easy defence, has naturally almost every requisite for a town, and presents so bold a bank to the harbour, that vessels of any burden may lie close to it when they load; and several noble rivers, after having watered some of the richest land, perhaps, in the world, empty themselves in the vast lagoon of which this harbour is part. But it is full of worms, and much too far to the southward.\n\nThe harbour of Cape Gracias-a-Dios is formed by an arm of the sea, large enough to hold the navy of Great Britain, and open only from E. by S. to S. S. W. from which points the wind seldom blows there. The inhabitants live on the edge of a very large savanna, perpetually covered with the most fattening pasturage, and bounding on the river Wanks,* which arises very near the South Sea, and after successively passing the Spaniards, Indians friendly to the Spaniards, Indians friendly to us, and Musquito Indians, rolls over a shallow bar into the sea at this cape.\n\nThe strength of current, and various course of this river, and many other obstructions to measurement of distance, make it very difficult to ascertain the breadth of the continent; but mules have been brought down to the cape, from a place supposed to be considerably more than a hundred\n\n* Or Vaukes; called also Yare, and Yowra, and Cape river, and said to be full of falls. The Black river of the text is the Rio Tinto of the Spaniards. The Boca del Toro, and Chiriqui Lagoon, subsequently mentioned, are not to be found in the ordinary English maps.\u2014T.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nleagues up the river, from whence it is said to be only two days' ride through the woods to the Spanish city of Leon.\n\nThere are several small settlements between this cape and Blewfields, and one still further to the southward.\n\nThe Musquito Indians, properly so called, and who have been so justly remarkable for their fixed hereditary hatred of the Spaniards, and attachment to us, were formerly very numerous, but they were much reduced some years ago by the small pox. Their present number is from seven to ten thousand fighting men, formed into different tribes, both by nature and policy; by nature, from the general distinction of pure Indians and Samboes; by policy, as living and acting under several chieftains, called king, governor, general, and admiral, each of whom has a different territory, and nearly independent jurisdiction, though the king has an imperfectly defined supremacy both in power and dominion.\n\nThe general's people are Samboes, and stretch from Black River to near Cape Gracias-a-Dios. The king's chief residence is about twelve leagues south of the cape, his people are also Samboes, and his immediate precinct reaches to the cape, and runs far up the country. The governor's precinct joins to the king's, and extends between twenty and thirty leagues to the southward, till it meets the admiral's. The people under these chieftains are pure Indians.\n\nThe Samboes are supposed to derive their origin from a Guinea ship, which, it is said, was wrecked on the coast above a century ago. Certain it is, that their hair, complexion, features, and make, clearly prove an African ancestry; from whom they have also inherited some of the worst characteristics of the worst African mind; for they are generally false, designing, treacherous, knavish, impudent, and revengeful.\n\nThe pure Indians are so called, because they are free from any mixture of negro blood; and their general conduct gives a very favourable idea of Indian nature. They are seldom guilty of positive evil, and often rise to positive good, when positive good does not require much exertion of mind.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nTheir modesty, docility, good faith, disposition to friendship and gratitude, ought to engage equally our regard and protection; for the same virtues that render them amiable, will be likely to bring on their destruction from the enterprising ambition of the Samboes.\n\nThe proper management of those heterogeneous people, watching over, guiding, and tempering the Sambo restlessness, and giving encouragement and activity to the inoffensive, but indolent disposition of the pure Indians, seem to be some of the most important objects of our policy.\n\nThe British settlers have hitherto been employed chiefly in cutting mahogany, digging sarsaparilla, getting tortoise-shell, and purchasing skins of the Indians, of which the far greater part has been shipped to England in British vessels. The exports in 1769 were about 800,000 superficial feet of mahogany, 200,000 lbs. of sarsaparilla, and 10,000 lbs. of tortoise-shell. There is also a small trade with the bordering Spaniards, and a few mules are occasionally sent to Jamaica.\n\nBut a little encouragement would soon rouse a more extensive and liberal spirit; the spirit of cultivation, which, even in the present state of the colony, has begun to exert itself with the fairest appearance of success; a little industry would soon discover an almost inexhaustible variety of woods, gums, and dyes, and the country abounds in very valuable ship-timber.\n\nMuch, however, remains still to be done, before much benefit can be derived, either to the colony or to the mother country, from what has been done already. Of the motives which have hitherto prevented the British ministry from giving form and permanency to the settlement, and affording it that open countenance and full support under which it would certainly and rapidly rise to a place of the first importance, it becomes me, perhaps, to pronounce with caution; but, I hope, I shall not offend in observing, that the dubious and unavowed plan of conduct with which government has conducted itself, in regard to this colony, ever since the con-\nAPPENDIX.\n\nclusion of the last peace, neither tends to its speedy increase, nor much redounds to the honour and dignity of a great and powerful nation. Either the native Indians have purchased our protection by the cession of their country, and an uninterrupted allegiance of upwards of a century, or they have not. If they have, and the contract was reciprocal; if the fullest protection and support was repeatedly promised them, on the part and by the authority of the British crown; if, in consequence thereof, they have hitherto received our people with open arms, have constantly encouraged and assisted them to the utmost of their power, always considering our enemies as theirs; if, by these means, they have incurred the implacable resentment, not only of the Spanish nation, but also of many powerful Indian tribes, in alliance with that crown, and entailed inevitable destruction on themselves and their children, in case we now desert them; and finally, if the many advantages above stated are likely to accrue to our commerce and navigation from the possession of this country; if these, I say, are facts notorious, (and no person I am persuaded, who has any knowledge of the subject, will attempt to prove the contrary,) it will, perhaps, be difficult to assign a reason which bears even the colour of plausibility, for the neglect and disregard which is now shown to these poor, friendless, and affectionate people, and to the interests of the British settlers among them, who, indeed, are now daily decreasing; and if the present system, with regard to them, is much longer pursued, must either quit the country or perish in the ruin that seems to await them.\n\nConsidered in every point of view, the desertion of this colony appears impolitic and extraordinary. The easy means of attacking the Spanish dominions in time of war, and even shaking her vast empire in South America to the foundation, by the way of the lake of Nicaragua, afford so mighty a prospect of conquest, wealth, and glory, to the British arms, that I cannot persuade myself government has ever been rightly informed in a circumstance of so great importance. I have\nbeen assured, if I am not greatly deceived in my recollection, that a vessel of thirty tons has sailed up to the entrance of this lake, which very vessel afterwards made a voyage to Jamaica. From the interior boundary of the lake, to the nearest part of the South Sea coast, the distance does not exceed ten or twelve leagues, through a level country; it is true, indeed, the entrance into the river, from the harbour of St. John's, is somewhat obstructed by a bar, on which there are only five feet water; but the inconvenience resulting from hence may be cured surely, in a great measure, in case an armament is sent there, by constructing the transport vessels, for conveying troops up the lake, with flat bottoms. The harbour above-mentioned, called St. John's, is very capable of containing from ten to fifteen ships of war, with shallow water births of about three fathom; and there is room enough for one hundred sail of transports besides, which will lie perfectly secure from the north and south winds, the only dangerous winds on the coast.\n\nThe harbour of Cape Gracias-a-Dios has been mentioned already; but the finest harbour in all the continent, from Honduras to Porto Bello, is undoubtedly the Boca-del-Toro, a place not only capable of containing the whole navy of Great Britain, with good anchorage throughout, but which has within it many excellent harbours, sheltered from the wind at every point of the compass; it commands a tract of country one hundred miles in extent, and joins a lagoon, called the Chiriqui lagoon. The rivers that empty themselves into this lagoon are indeed little known to any people, except our Musquito Indians, who say they have traced some of them quite back to the Spanish settlements. They aver, that there is a lagoon on the South Sea coast, right opposite to the Chiriqui lagoon, and that these lagoons have a communication with each other, by means of some of the rivers above-mentioned: certain it is, than from a hill on the interior banks of the Chiriqui lagoon, there is a spacious prospect of both seas. The navigation into the harbour we\nAPPENDIX.\n\nare now speaking of will be attended with no kind of difficulty to ships of the largest tonnage; the smallest depth being five fathoms.\n\nBut the lake of Nicaragua, beyond all dispute, presents the most obvious and certain channel of attacking the Spaniards with success in the richest of their South American settlements; and for this reason alone, if for no other, it is an object of the greatest importance to Great Britain\u2014I was going to add, of more value than even the possession of Gibraltar itself.\n\nB. EDWARDS.\n\nJamaica, 10th Nov. 1773.\n\nThe occasion of Governor Johnstone's laying the above Memorial before Parliament, was the seizure of the sloop Morning Star, (Alexander Blair and Dr. Charles Irving owners,) by two Spanish guarda-costas, at the settlement at Black river, 1776. Lords North and George Germaine were of opinion, that the act complained of was not a Spanish aggression, but an act of piracy committed by a privateer of the revolted British colonies.\u2014E.\nJAMAICA,\n\nA DESCRIPTIVE AND DIDACTIC POEM,\n\nBY THE LATE\n\nBRYAN EDWARDS, ESQ.\nADVERTISEMENT.\n\nThis little Poem is imperfect in every sense of the word. It is presumed, however, that the subject of it is as happily adapted for descriptive and didactic poetry, as any that can be imagined. The magnificent scale whereon natural objects in this part of the globe are in general formed, the beauty and novelty of the scene, could not fail to supply an able artist with many new, striking, and picturesque images.

Nothing can be more beautiful or delicious than a grove of these trees, which now grow spontaneously and in great abundance in the parishes of St. Ann and Trelawny. It is peculiar to Jamaica.\n\n\u2020 The botanic name is Poinciana. It is commonly known by the name of Barbados' pride. Sir Hans Sloane calls it Sena spuria, arbores spinosa, or bastard sena, and it has nearly the same virtues as the Alexandrine sena, and resembles it in the pod. The flowers are transcendently beautiful, and make an elegant red syrup of a purgative quality, and the root affords a scarlet dye.\n\n\u2021 Commonly called the China rose; but improperly. It is the Hibiscus mutabilis, or changeable rose, of Linnaeus. Early in the morning it is of a most perfect and beautiful white; about noon it assumes a rose colour; and becomes of a deep red at night, when it contracts and dies.\n\nSpreadeth Array'd\nHer flow'rs Their virgins\nOur morn\n\nBut transe\nThe vision\nThe cool,\nNor twili\nOmnipote\nFrom the\nInto thin\nAscends all\nYet, thou\nIn fierce ef\nLifts the\nFar nobler\nA verdant\nO'er many\nBounds the\nThe sail of\nBut shine th\nAlmighty n\nEven on th\nReveal'd, an\nAnd stems o\nTo whom ev\nTh' immorta\nAnd far-fam\n\n* A line from Mr. Long's poem.

Airy shapes,\nOft visible to contemplation's eye,\nRoam in the midnight hour these sacred shades;\nNor unobserv'd while now the starry train\nBurn with diminish'd lustre; for, behold,\nThe radiant moon bids meaner glories fade.\nNo cloud her course obscures, and high she towers,\nGuiding in awful majesty through heaven\nHer silver car, triumphant o'er the dark.\n\nSure 'tis illusion and enchantment all!\nFor still fond fancy, through the shadowy glade,\nSees visionary fleeting forms: still hears\n\n* These are the fire-flies, which abound in the interior parts of the country, and to a stranger have a wonderful and singular appearance. They consist of different species, some of which emit a light resembling a spark of fire, from a globular prominence near each eye; and others from their sides, in the act of respiration. They are far more luminous than the glow-worm, and fill the air on all sides, like so many living stars, to the astonishment and terror of a traveller unaccustomed to the country. In the daytime they disappear.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nSounds more than human. Once a gentle race\nOwn'd these fair valleys. From the birth of time\nThese groves, these fountains, and these hills were theirs.\nPerhaps e'en now their spirits delighted haunt\nTheir once-lov'd mansions. Oft the pensive muse\nRecalls, in tender thought, the mournful scene,\nWhen the brave Incotol, from yonder rock,\nHis last sad blessing to a weeping train\nDying bequeath'd. \"The hour,\" he said, \"arrives,\nBy ancient sages to our sires foretold!\nFierce from the deep, with Heaven's own lightning arm'd,\nThe pallid nation comes! Blood marks their steps;\nMan's agonies their sport, and man their prey!\n\n\"What piercing shrieks still vibrate on the ear!\nTh' expiring mother lifts her feeble arm\nIn vain to shield her infant; the hot steel\nSmokes with their mingled blood; and blooming youth,\nAnd manly strength, and virgin beauty, meet\nAlike th' untimely grave; till fell revenge\nIs cloy'd and tir'd of slaughter. See, full gorg'd,\nThe vulture sickens o'er his waste of prey,\nAnd, surfeit-swell'd, the reeking hound expires!\n\n\"Yet pause not, Spaniard! whet thy blunted steel;\nTake thy full pastime in the field of blood!\nBut know, stern tyrant, retribution's hour\nEre long shall reach thee. Though this once-lov'd isle,\nFor crimes yet unaton'd, dread Zami thus\nTo desolation and to death consigns,\nAnd thou the instrument of wrath divine;\nIn yonder orb, now darken'd in his course,\nRead thy own doom, more dreadful! With the slain,\nThe murderer falls! Th' oppressor and th' oppress'd\nMingle in dust together! Where are now\nThy blood-polluted glories? Ah! too late,\n\nLearn, who art heir of all our woes,\nGives to his children more\nMore manly souls.\n\n\"So perish all\nOf mad ambition's pow'r,\nThat make the world their spoil.\nO my assur'd soul,\nOne little spark\nAt those burning gates\nBy sharp pang Death's toil\nDeath's toil\nThere, with the dead\nThrough pain and woe\nRepose in peace\nAnd when the sun\nUnenvied gleams\nThe fragrant air\nThe burning flame\nSwell the loud sound\nFill every ear\nMeantime, our blood\nOur blood flows on\nThe hurricane\nAnd ocean roar\nOr leave them there\nThe sport of heaven\nWhen the pale moon\nPresent th' image\nTo those that see\nSweet native land\nOur great rest\n\n* Podium in all parts of Martyr relates an excellent as\nLearn, when avenging Heaven presumptuous guilt\nGives to its own fell purposes a prey,\nMore mark'd its fate, more terrible its fall!\n\n\"So perish the false triumphs and vain hopes\nOf mad ambition, and remorseless pride,\nThat make weak man the murderer of man!\nO my associates, dry those scalding tears!\nOne little moment, and we shall arrive\nAt those blest islands, where, from guilt refined\nBy sharp affliction, we no more shall feel\nDeath's torpid grasp, and agonizing pang!\nThere, with our lov'd forefathers, shall we rove\nThrough palm'y shades; in limpid fountain bathe\nRepose in jasmin bowers at sultry noon;\nAnd when cool evening tempers soft the air,\nUnenvied gather, from his unpruned bough,\nThe fragrant guava*. On our cheeks no more\nThe burning tear shall linger, not a sigh\nSwell the light bosom; but immortal joy\nFill every thought, and brighten every eye.\nMeantime, those happy interdicted shores\nOur blood stain'd foes shall seek; but seek in vain:\nThe hurricane shall rave, the thunder roll,\nAnd oceanwhelm them in his deepest tide,\nOr leave transfix'd on the hard pointed rock,\nThe sport of howling winds. How shall we laugh\nWhen the pale coward slaves we view remote,\nPresent th' uplifted hand, th' imploring eye,\nTo those their cruelty denied to breathe\nSweet native air! Their conscious groans shall fill\nOur great revenge: our wondrous wrongs repay!\"\n\n* *Pseudium fructicosum*, commonly called the guava. It grows spontaneously in all parts of the island, and to most people is a very agreeable fruit. P. Martyr relates, that it was in high esteem among the natives. The seeds are an excellent astringent medicine in fluxes.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nINSCRIPTION\n\nA BURIAL GROUND FOR NEGRO SLAVES.\n\nOn a plantation in Jamaica, belonging to Mr. Edwards, his negroes had chosen for their burial ground, a retired spot, in a grove of pimento or allspice. It was a place extremely solemn and singularly beautiful; and Mr. Edwards directed, that, in case of his death in Jamaica, he should be buried in the midst of them. As the ground was exposed to the intrusion of cattle, he caused a fence to be raised round it, and inscribed these lines on the little wicket at the entrance.\n\nStranger! whoe'er thou art, with reverence tread;\nLo! these, the silent mansions of the dead!\nHis life of labour o'er, the wearied slave\nHere finds, at length, soft quiet in the grave,\nView not with proud disdain the unsculptured heap,\nWhere injured innocence forgets to weep,\nNor idly deem, although not here are found\nThe solemn aisle and consecrated ground,\nThe spot less sacred\u2014o'er the turf-built shrine,\nWhere Virtue sleeps, presides the Power Divine.\n\nO CLEAVE!\n\nI'll give thee ear\nTo what I say:\n'Tis but a word.\n\n\"Pray, sir,\" said he,\nThat's all right,\n\"For God's sake.\"\n\nBy him who\nBy him who\n\"Ah, sir, sir,\"\nAnd by\n\"By him who\nWith whom\nConvicted\nAnd by\nTHE VOW.\n\nO clear that cruel, doubting brow,\nI'll call on mighty Jove\nTo witness this eternal vow;\u2014\n'Tis you alone I love!\n\n\"Pray leave the god to soft repose,\"\nThe smiling maid replies,\n\"For Jove but laughs at lovers' vows,\nAnd lovers' perjuries.\"\n\n\"By honour'd Beauty's gentle power!\nBy Friendship's holy flame!\"\n\"Ah! what is Beauty but a flower,\nAnd Friendship but a name?\"\n\n\"By those dear, tempting lips,\" I cried.\nWith arch, ambiguous look,\nConvinced, my Chloe glanced aside,\nAnd bade me kiss the book.\nINDEX.\n\nAbercrombie, Sir Ralph, appointed to the command in the West Indies, iv. 52.
