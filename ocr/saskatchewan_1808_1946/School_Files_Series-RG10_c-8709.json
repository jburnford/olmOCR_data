This creates a great deal of work, writing and visiting the school to find out the goings and comings of the Indians from this Agency. Due to the fact that the Indians from the various Reserves of this Agency take their children to Edmonton without notifying this office, we do not have any record officially of who is there. At the beginning and the end of the year, we get a list from the Principal as we have to report to Family Allowances. Despite our efforts, late arrivals usually are not listed and often result in overpayments in Family Allowances.\n\nI would suggest that a separate quarterly report be prepared for the children from each Agency attending this school, and sent to the interested Agency. Mr. G. H. Gooderham, Regional Supervisor Indian Agencies, has taken up this matter in the past, but none of his instructions were carried out.\n\nH. N.

E.J. Staley, Principal of the Edmonton School,\nfor his information.\n\nIt is noted that the applications for\nadmission are dated March and that most of the physical\nexaminations were conducted in April, whereas 4 pupils\ntook up residence in January, 2 in February and 5\nin March. Many of these pupils are well over the age\nfor admission, and should, therefore, have been in\nresidence since September. It is hoped that the normal\nprocedure for admission at the beginning of the next academic year will be implemented.\n\nBernard F. Beary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\ncc Reg.Sup. G.H.

Taylor,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\n\nSchool Attendance - Frog Lake Reserve\n\nThe Inspector of Schools in his most recent report, comments on the poor attendance of many pupils at the Frog Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIt is understood that there are on the reserve a number of pupils who use as an excuse for their poor attendance the distance of their homes from the school.\n\nThe new school as sited will not obviate this excuse. It is considered, accordingly, that steps should be taken to arrange for the attendance at appropriate residential schools of those children whose homes are beyond the legal limit for pupil-travel. The attendance of those within a reasonable radius of the Day school should be enforced in the usual way.\n\nThere may be still accommodation for Roman Catholic pupils at the Onion Lake Residential school. For children of other denominations it is possible that accommodation still exists at the Edmonton residential school. Please make early investigation of the accommodation available and of the children for whom it should be arranged and take action accordingly.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nMARCH 1949\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Edmonton Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child\nEnglish name Genevieve Nancy CARDINAL\nAge 11 yrs Born Oct. 19th, 1937\nName of Band Saddle Lake\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid #181\nFather's full name and No Louis CARDINAL Jr. #181\nMother's full name and No Dora\nParents living or dead LIVING\nState of child's health Good\nReligion United Church of Canada\nDoes applicant speak English Yes\nPreviously attended school for years\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI recommend the admission of the above child, who is of good moral character and is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nAgent\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

E. Staley,\nPrincipal,\nEdmonton Indian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nMy dear Mr. Staley:\n\nMy deliberations on your problems led me to prepare this statement of the potential school population at Rocky Mountain House (Sunchild Cree Band) from which you have received into residence one pupil. To-day I met a headman of the band, Louis Sunchild, who wants to discuss with Mr. Goderham the possibility of sending more of the band's children to Edmonton. Enquiries are being made concerning the time-factor as it is getting rather close to the Christmas vacation.\n\nYou may have seen some of the newspaper articles that have recently appeared concerning the aborigines of this area. In addition to the children who appear in the attached statistics there are a number who would be eligible if their parents were to come into treaty. The Presbyterian and Mennonite missionaries are doing some work among these people, and on one occasion I met Rev. F.W. Benke at Rocky Mountain House.\n\nConsideration is being given to erecting a new day school in the Rocky Mountain House area. It seems, however, that your school and these Indians might co-operate in working out problems of the present and immediate future.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nC.A.F. Clark\nEducational Survey Officer\n\nCopy to: Calgary; Morley\nOffice of the Indian Agent\n\nHobbema Indian Agency\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nHobbema, Alberta\n14 November, 1949\n\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch\nO T T A W A, Ontario\n\nRe: Residential School Attendance and Family Allowances Payments\n\nWith reference to your 80-1 of November 8th, I beg to inform you that difficulty was encountered to some extent at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, Hobbema, due to failure of the Principal in the 1948 - 49 term to submit form I.A. 1069, Admission and Discharges. During the present school term, 1949 - 50, no difficulty has been encountered at this school.\n\nThe matter of such reports from the Edmonton Indian Residential School is completely unsatisfactory. As you are aware, this school draws pupils from several Agencies, including Hobbema. Fifty or more pupils regularly attend from this Agency. It is only with great difficulty that we find out which pupils are or are not attending. Within the past year the Principal, Reverend E. J. Staley, has been good enough to submit a list of those in school. However such a list is unsatisfactory, as I have recently found a case at this school, where a child reported returning from the Residential School in June, 1949, was actually a truant since December 20, 1948. You will see that an overpayment for July and August was made and a great deal of corrective correspondence follows.\n\nIt appears neither the St. Paul Agency (Saddle Lake Agency) or the Hobbema Indian Agency receives either form I.A. 1069 or the quarterly report, or departmental admissions or discharges report, and never have, from this school. The entry or discharge from this school never comes to our knowledge directly. I believe this quarterly report is forwarded directly to Ottawa without copies being sent to the Agencies concerned which you will see puts no responsibility on the Agencies concerned regarding school attendance.\n\nI would therefore recommend and suggest that a quarterly report and departmental admission and discharge report concerning the children from the Hobbema Indian Agency be sent through this office and that the Principal be requested to complete form I.A. 1069.\n\n(Sgd.)

Jones,\nSuperintendent of Welfare,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Family Allowances \u2014 your file 80-3\n\nI have your letter of November 8th regarding the problem of reporting admissions and discharges of Indian children at residential schools in this province.\n\nThe Edmonton Indian Residential School is the one that was involved in this discussion. It receives pupils from the Saddle Lake, Hobbema and Edmonton Agencies.\n\nWe have previously asked the Principal of the school to provide copies of his quarterly report to the three Superintendents concerned. We are in receipt of a copy of Mr. Woodsworth's letter of November 14th, file 112-10-4, which indicates that he is still not receiving a copy of the quarterly report. In a discussion with Superintendent Robertson several days ago, it was discovered that he was not receiving from the Principal the monthly report of admissions and discharges (form 41).\n\nI left for Edmonton on Tuesday this week intending to see the Rev. Mr. Staley, Principal of the school, and the three Superintendents concerned before attempting to answer your letter of November 8th. However, illness forced me to abandon the journey and return to Calgary.\n\nI notice that Superintendent Robertson has asked you to supply the Rev. Principal with some No. 41 forms. If Mr. Staley will complete these forms at the end of each month, one for each agency and send them to the respective Superintendents for signature, and if he will supply the Superintendents with copies of the quarterly return, there should be no further difficulty.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Messrs. Robertson, Woodsworth and Taylor and the Rev. Mr. Staley.\n\n(signed) G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nPer: R. F.

As you are aware, this school draws pupils from several Agencies, including Hobbema. Fifty or more pupils regularly attend from this Agency. It is only with great difficulty that we find out which pupils are or are not attending. Within the past year, the Principal, Reverend E. J. Staley, has been good enough to submit a list of those in school. However, such a list is unsatisfactory, as I have recently found a case at this school where a child reported returning from the Residential School in June, 1949, was actually a truant since December 20, 1948. You will see that an overpayment for July and August was made and a great deal of corrective correspondence follows.\n\n\"It appears neither the St. Paul Agency (Saddle Lake Agency) nor the Hobbema Indian Agency receives either form I.A. 1069 or the quarterly report, or departmental admissions or discharges report, and never have, from this school. The entry or discharge from this school never comes to our knowledge directly. I believe this quarterly report is forwarded directly to Ottawa without copies being sent to the Agencies concerned which you...\"\nwill see puts no responsibility on the Agencies concerned regarding school attendance.\"\n\nA supply of the necessary forms I.A. 1069 have already been forwarded to Mr. Staley. In view of the fact that you are located so close to this school, would you be kind enough to call on Mr. Staley and explain the problem to him.\n\nPlease request Mr. Staley to show at the top of form I.A. 1069, where \"Agency\" appears, the name of the Agency from which the child comes, rather than the Agency in which the school is located. A copy of the form should then be sent to each of the Indian Superintendents concerned after completion of columns 1, 2, 3, 4 and, if possible, 5. The Indian Superintendents on receipt of their copy of the form will complete the last three columns and forward to the Regional Director for action.\n\nThe above procedure ensures that each Superintendent, with children attending the Edmonton School, receives prompt advice of the admission and discharge of such children and can then relay this information to the Regional Director for the necessary adjustments in Family Allowances payments.\n\nYour co-operation in ensuring that Mr. Staley is fully aware of the procedure to be followed in using this form, particularly in regard to children attending from outside Agencies, will be very much appreciated.\n\nPlease forward a brief report of your conversation with Mr. Staley at your convenience.\n\nH. M. Jones,\nSuperintendent of Welfare.\n\nG.C. B. F. Neary, Esq.\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.\nH. N. Woodsworth, Esq.\nW. K. Taylor, Esq.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nE.\n\nRe: Edmonton Residential School\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a letter received from Mr. Woodsworth of the Hobbema Agency and copy of a letter received from Mr. Bettle in regard to reporting of admissions and discharges at the above noted school.\n\nWe are also enclosing a copy of our letter sent to Mr. Robertson of the Edmonton Agency, requesting him to interview Mr. Staley and explain the proper procedure to be followed in completing Form I.A. 1069.\n\nH.

Neary,  \nSupt. of Indian Education.\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Edmonton Residential School\n\nThe Principal of the Edmonton Residential School phoned long distance yesterday to complain bitterly about the possible removal of pupils from his institution to a day school at Goodfish Lake, Saddle Lake Agency. He stated that Dr. Dorey was very much disturbed about this rumour and asked him to ascertain if there were other pupils to replace the Goodfish Lake children, for it was his understanding that the pupilage at his school would be kept up to the number that are now attending.\n\nIt is realized here that this institution has been properly staffed to care for and properly instruct 160 pupils. The Principal has employed qualified teachers at the going salary plus board and lodging, as understood. Major Clark's report should indicate that everything in this respect is highly satisfactory. It is obviously very disorganizing and a difficult situation to face in and when a number of pupils are removed in the middle of their school year. I must add also that I had told Mr. Staley before the commencement of the school year that the attendance would be in the neighbourhood of 160 for this year.\n\nI informed Mr. Staley that the whole situation would be carefully surveyed and when I had more facts available I would report to you in the hope that some assurance of correcting this be given either by admitting pupils from other points or by extra financial assistance. I immediately took steps as follows:\n\n(1) The Superintendent of the Saddle Lake Agency has been advised to report on what children from the Goodfish Lake must still attend the Edmonton Residential School. It is our surmise that there would be a few who will be too far distant from the day school and in grades higher than will be taught at it, to return to Edmonton.\n\n(2) I got in communication with Superintendent (a) J. E. Pugh in regard to children from the Stony Reserve. As you are aware, the residential school can only accommodate about 80 pupils and there are at least 140 of school age on the reserve. Surely there are some parents who would voluntarily send their children to Edmonton. Mr. Pugh doubts it but is canvassing the situation. Unfortunately we haven't accommodation for all the children that are not in attendance and therefore we cannot put pressure on some and not on others, can we?\n\n(b) Then I asked Mr. Pugh in respect to the\nCol. B. F. Neary.  \nDecember 13, 1949.\n\nto the situation on the Sunchild Cree Reserve. There are 26 children of school age according to the latest report and none of them are getting any education. The Assistant Agent has been required to canvass the possibility of getting some of these to voluntarily attend the Edmonton School. Mr. Pugh will be there on Wednesday to see what has been done and possibly do some canvassing himself. As these Indians are still pagans, I would like to be instructed as to whether we can compel them to attend any particular school. Of the total who are of school age, some will be physically unfit, while others are too old to start as beginners in residential school, and it is my surmise that if we compel those others, they would total about the same as will be taken out of residence to Goodfish.\n\nThe foregoing is the only way that I see of keeping up the pupilage at Edmonton. I would like to have your immediate reply to this stating:\n\n(1) If the parents should be compelled to send their children to the Edmonton School from either the Stony or Sunchild Bands, or both.\n\n(2) What alternative you have to offer for the position in which the Edmonton School may be left if a number of pupils are taken out to the day school with no replacements.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\n\nGHG:IDF\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Bldg.,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nEdmonton Residential School - Pupilage\n\nReference your 110/6-1-2 of December 13\n\nYour letter crossed mine of December 12 in the mail. The Edmonton Residential School will continue to give trouble in maintaining its pupilage. The point which you have raised concerning the Goodfish Lake children indicates that there are some who should not be discharged at Christmas as they will be too far away from the Day School to walk daily.\n\nWe can put pressure on the children of the Stony Reserves and on the Sunchild Reserves but in the long run we are merely making trouble for both the Department and the management of the school. If the school were closer to both these Reserves, then we would be in favour of exerting such pressure. Due to the distances involved, it is suggested that only voluntary enrolment be contemplated. The Sunchild Cree Indians, purely from a welfare and health point of view should be persuaded to send their children to Edmonton pending the completion of their own Day School.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nRocky Mountain House, Alberta,\nNovember 30th., 1949\n\nTo the Minister... Clerks of Session\n\nThe Synod of Alberta\n\nFathers and Brethren:\n\nAt the recent meeting of the Synod, permission was given to circularize the Congregations within the bounds, on behalf of the non-treaty Chipewa Indians who live in the western part of our province, mainly in the area out from Rocky Mountain House.\n\nWe are hoping that as many churches as possible will hold White Gift services or make some appropriate collection of food and/or clothing for these people who are in considerable need.\n\nThe clothing should be warm, clean and serviceable. The food should consist mainly of the staples, such as - flour, cereals (rolled oats, Red river and the like) tea, sugar etc. Some persons may prefer to make a contribution of money; out of such monies the shipper could prepay the freight or express, and the balance could be sent to me and with it I will purchase food or clothing here. All shipments should be prepaid, as I have no funds with which to meet such expenses.\n\nThe matter of distribution entails several difficulties since these Indians are nomadic, and live mainly by hunting and trapping. They aren't localized in any way and are hard to reach. However, the majority of them come to town around Christmas and distribution can be made then. We assure you we will do our utmost to make suitable distribution of your gifts to these needy people. Perhaps the time is not too far away when they will enter into 'treaty' and be cared for and supervised by the government.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.G. Marsh.\nSuperintendent of Indian Education:\n\nNon-Treaty Chippewas:\n\nAttached is a copy of a circular that was given me by the Rev. H. G. Marsh during a recent discussion at Rocky Mountain House. Mr. Marsh told me that his contacts with these people are actually few and slight, the \"contact man\" being Mr. Henry Steffel.\n\nI have previously suggested that some of the children might be received by Edmonton Residential School. We give similar privileges to the \"non-treaty\" Sioux. Our field officials might use the opportunities presented by the Christmas season to do some recruiting. Louis Sunchida told me that his people\u2014the nearby Sunchida Cree\u2014might be persuaded to send some children to Edmonton.\n\nCopy to: Regional Supervisor, Calgary Superintendent, Morley Assistant, Rocky Mountain House\n\n[Signature]\n\nCAT Clark\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Betty Jay Curry\nEnglish name:\nAge: Thirteen (13) yrs.\nName of Band: Montana\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 22\nFather's full name and No.: Edward Curry #22\nMother's full name and No.: Victoria Curry #22\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health: Fair\nReligion: United Church of Canada\nDoes applicant speak English?: Yes\nPreviously attended school for years\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI recommend the admission of the above child, who is of good moral character and is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Pupilage, Edmonton Residential School\n\nFurther to your correspondence, and particularly yours of the 15th of December, the Superintendents of the Edmonton, Stony-Sarcee, Hobbema and Saddle Lake Agencies made a drive for pupils to attend this residential school for the balance of the school year, with very poor results:\n\n(1) Mr. Robertson of the Edmonton Agency stated that there is only one family from which there might be recruits but there is a dispute as to whether they are R.C. or Protestant and from what I know of it these children cannot be forced to attend the Protestant School, so no pupils can be expected from that Agency.\n\n(2) Superintendent J. E. Pugh got no response from the Stones at Morley, nor did he and his assistant get any volunteers among the Treaty and Non-Treaty Indians at Rocky Mountain House. It is believed that with some pressure, pupils can be obtained from the Sun Child-Gree Band. The Principal of the Morley School is opposed to recruiting for Edmonton as he thinks he should have more pupils in his Residential School. Mr. Pugh and I are of the opinion that the School is now at capacity. As a result we did not use any pressure.\n\n(3) Superintendent Woodsworth has recruited 2 and a possible third.\n\n(4) As stated in a letter to you regarding the Goodfish Day School, Superintendent Taylor has recruited 2 pupils off the Saddle Lake Reserve and 1 off the Goodfish.\n\nFrom the foregoing you will note that the total recruited is 6, at best. However, it is expected that a number of the Goodfish children will return and that there will be a very slight reduction in the total pupilage.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. H.

Dorey,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nEdmonton Indian Residential School\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nPlease find attached a copy of a self-explanatory letter to the Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School. With the non-payment of Family Allowances to children who are attending residential schools, it is obvious that our Principals must be very careful in reporting the admission of children. A great deal of confusion has been caused by our Principals not reporting this information to the Indian Superintendents concerned. The result has been the overpayment of Family Allowances to the Indian parents and when this is discovered, steps have to be taken to recover these sums. A great deal of ill will has been caused and I am sure that you will appreciate the need for this matter being forcibly brought to the attention of this Principal.\n\nIdentical letters have been sent to Principals of schools operated by other denominations.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDear Mr. Staley:\n\nMary Tomenaguk - Road Island\n\nThe Department has approved the admission of the above Eskimo girl to your school. She has recently been discharged from the Charles Gassell Hospital and her maintenance will be the responsibility of the Northwest Territories Administration. At the end of each quarter, you can submit to the Northwest Territories Administration, Department of Resources and Development, a quarterly Return listing the name of this Eskimo girl and any other Eskimo patients who might have been admitted to your school in the meantime. The Quarterly Return is to be completed in exactly the same way as for Indian children.\n\nIt is very likely that other Eskimo children may be admitted to your school after discharge from the Charles Gassell Hospital. I would suggest that Mr. Robertson and yourself might discuss this matter with Dr. Falconer so that you will know ahead of time concerning these Eskimo students.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Drummond dated January 14, all concerning Mary Tomenaguk from Reed Island.\n\nIt is our understanding from Mr. Drummond's letter that you feel it would be preferable to send Mary to the Indian Residential School near Edmonton, presumably until next summer when, if well enough, she might be sent to join her family at Reed Island. If this is your recommendation, it will be in order to arrange for Mary's admittance to the Indian Residential School, and this Administration will be responsible for the child's maintenance while at this school. It is assumed that you will examine this child again in the spring, and advise both Indian Health Services and this Administration what action should be taken at that time.\n\nIncidentally the statement in the first paragraph of Mr. Drummond's letter to the effect that this Administration had advised you there would be no opportunity of placing this girl in the Protestant School at Aklevik is not understood, as we do not appear to have any information to this effect. Perhaps this advice was received from some other source.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd: R.A. GIBSON,\n\nR.A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\n\nDr. W.L.

The offenses mentioned were repeated petty thefts.\n\nIt might be worth investigating the possibility of having this boy assigned to Edmonton Residential School. There might be a chance to do something with him there this summer while only a fraction of the pupilage is in the school.\n\nYou would have to give the Rev. E.J. Stacy all the facts in the case and get his concurrence before requesting Departmental approval for the move.\n\nC.A.F. Clark\n\nCopy to Superintendent of Education.\nJuly 5, 1950.\n\nReverend H.B. Gibson,\nUnited Church Mission,\nGod's Lake, Man.\n\nMy dear Mr. Gibson:\n\nYou may already have heard from the Reverend Dr. Dorey of your Church that he is going to explore the possibility of getting a contingent of residential school pupils from Manitoba to complete the enrolment at Edmonton Residential School.\n\nI do not wish to seem to anticipate action by the proper Church authorities in this matter. You will understand that my official interest is to get adequate schooling for the maximum number of Indian children with the minimum of expense to the tax-payers and the least possible difficulty to the religious denominations involved. Another reason for writing you in this matter is that I had marked the file containing your letter of April 19, 1950 for attention today after returning from places west of Manitoba.\n\nReference to your copy of that letter will show you that therein you nominated 23 children for admission to a residential school. At that time you had in mind the school at Brandon. It may turn out now that you will be among those whom Dr. Dorey will request to find pupils for Edmonton.\n\nIt seems to me that in finding these pupils we ought to try to give the Principal who will receive them as early notice as possible of all the information possible regarding the educational condition of the child. In regard to the\n23 pupils mentioned in your letter I note that you have given information concerning the number of years (or months) that the child has been in school. May I suggest that if possible you add one more item\u2014an indication of the child's competency in English. This may help the Reverend Principal at Edmonton to plan the organization of his classes and may serve to indicate the need for different teaching methods and supplies.\n\nSubject always to Dr. Dorey's instructions, it seems to me that it would be helpful for those concerned to receive a compilation of prospective pupils showing the name, age, sex, treaty number, previous schooling and competency in English. The Departmental officials, through whose offices the formal applications for admission should pass, will probably wish to review such compilations so as to ensure that we are not robbing any Day schools of pupils who can and ought to attend them.\n\nAs I do not know what mail service you are getting now, nor the date when a doctor might be available this summer to examine any prospective pupils, I am enclosing a number of application blanks which have to be completed (in duplicate) on both sides before the form is submitted to the concerned Agent for his recommendation. I gather from your letter that you have assisted in the preparation of these forms on previous occasions. As these children have a long journey in prospect, any irregularities in the admission procedure would be a cause of regret.\n\nIf it is any comfort to you in attempting the task of persuading parents to permit their children to travel so far, may I say that we have pupils who make the journey from Churchill and York Factory to Prince Albert; likewise from points in the Yukon to Lesser Slave Lake in Alberta; and again from Northern British Columbia by rail and steamer to schools on Vancouver Island. In your area, I suppose, the\nmost difficulty would arise in getting the children to the railway. I assume that this would be a matter of planned plane-loads and I understand that your missionaries have had plenty of practice in coping with such arrangements.\n\nMay I extend my wishes for success in this venture. I regret that I can give it only momentary attention as there are situations elsewhere that are equally demanding.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nC.A.F.C.\n\nG.A.F.

Clark,  \nEducational Survey Officer,  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Clark,\n\nThank you for your letter of July 6th. We were indeed pleased to have the opportunity of placing some of our children in a good Residential School. In past years we have experienced a great deal of difficulty in getting children into St. Georges at Lytton and the Alberni Indian Residential School, although Mr. Caldwell at the latter establishment, has been very kind and considerate of our needs.\n\nWe still have about thirty children whose home environment requires that they be sent to a Protestant Residential School, and we have forwarded application forms to parents of these children. In the near future we shall correspond with the Reverend Principal of the Edmonton Residential School informing him exactly how many children we will be sending. I do not think we shall require any advertising material to induce parents to send their children along. We have here the best possible recommendation for the establishment in the form of 3 or 4 former pupils. They stand out among their fellow Indians on the Reserve.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nsgd. J.V.

Staley,\nPrincipal,\nEdmonton Indian Residential School,\nEDMONTON, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are advised by the Department that as a result of action taken by the Departmental officials, we are assured that 30 pupils from Babine Indian Agency and 30 pupils from Skeena Indian Agency will be sent to the Edmonton Residential school.\n\nIn addition to this there will be 53 pupils available from the Hobbs Indian Agency and 54 pupils from the Saddle Lake Agency.\n\nHowever, there will be a day school erected on the Saddle Lake Reserve this year which will take 30 out of the 54 pupils from that Agency. It is expected that this school will be completed by Christmas, so that the 30 pupils will return to the Edmonton Residential school in September, along with the 24 others from Saddle Lake.\n\nThere may be 2-3 pupils attending from the Edmonton Indian Agency, but we are not counting on them.\n\nIn other words, you should have about 165 pupils in September, and we shall ascertain from the Department whether or not the 30 children from Saddle Lake Agency will be withdrawn from your school at Christmas if the day school on the Saddle Lake Reserve is ready and a teacher is available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nfor: G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nc.c. Mr. Robertson, Mr. Woodsworth,\nMr. Taylor\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAttn: Superintendent Education\n\nRe: Pupilage, Edmonton Residential School\n\nI am attaching copy of a letter sent to the Reverend E.J. Staley, Principal of the Edmonton Residential School, which covers the points mentioned in your Army Message of August 16th.\n\nI have added the following note to copies of the letter which have been sent to Superintendents Robertson, Woodsworth and Taylor:\n\n\"Please try to do everything you can to get these pupils into the Edmonton School promptly in September. You should advise all parents that if their children return to the school the first week of September, Family Allowances will be paid on behalf of the children, for the month of September. If they do not return promptly, Family Allowances will not be paid.\"\n\nIf the Saddle Lake Day School No. 2 is ready by Christmas, should the 30 children which it will take out of the Edmonton Residential School enrolment be accepted into the day school, or should they be returned to the Edmonton Residential School until the end of June, 1951? If they are returned to Edmonton, then the day school will not be able to operate until September, 1951.\n\nfor G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRE: Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nReferring to your telegram of August 16th in regard to the above.\n\nAs instructed, I have advised Mr. Staley that he can expect 60 pupils from Babine and Skeena Agencies. In this connection I would advise that Mr. Staley requests that these pupils do not arrive prior to September 6th as the repairs now being done will not be completed prior to that date.\n\nIn regard to prospective enrollment for the coming year, Edmonton Agency will possibly have 4 pupils. Mr. Taylor advises that Saddle Lake Agency expect to send in 54 pupils provided Saddle Lake Day School #2 does not open. If it should open, they will have 24 for Edmonton School. Hobbema Agency advise that they expect to have 53 pupils. This would make a total of 111 from Alberta Agencies.\n\nE.A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nPO Box 70, Vancouver, BC.\n\nREFERENCE YOUR SIGNAL OF THE 21 INSTANT INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM SUPERINTENDENT ROBERTSON INDICATES THAT 60 PUPILS FROM BABINE AND SKEENA AGENCIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COMPLETE THE ENROLMENT AT EDMONTON RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL. -stop- IF THERE ARE VACANCIES FOR ADDITIONAL CHILDREN LATER IN ACADEMIC YEAR YOU WILL BE ADVISED -stop-\n\nPP/ST\n\nCONFIRMATION:\nPHONED TO: 61\nPHONED BY: ST\nTIME: 2.30PM\n\nBernard F.

Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to my letter of July 19th in connection with obtaining pupils for the above school, we have now received from Indian Commissioner Arneil definite assurance that 60 children from the Babine and Skeena Agencies will be sent to Edmonton.\n\nWe have also received a letter from Superintendent Robertson at Edmonton regarding the children from Reserves in Alberta who will attend the Edmonton School. This letter reads in part as follows:\n\n\"In regard to prospective enrollment for the coming year, Edmonton Agency will possibly have 4 pupils. Mr. Taylor advises that Saddle Lake Agency expect to send in 54 pupils provided Saddle Lake Day School #2 does not open. If it should open, they will have 24 for Edmonton School. Hobbema Agency advise that they expect to have 53 pupils. This would make a total of 111 from Alberta Agencies.\"\nI might add that the Saddle Lake #2 School will not be ready for the reception of pupils until after Christmas, and in the meantime, we are advising Mr. Robertson that the children who will eventually attend that school should enrol at the Edmonton School for the period September 1st to December 31st, 1950.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nAugust 30th, 1950.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\n405 Post Office Building,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School. Your File 110-23-16\n\nWe received your letters of the 21st instant with reference to the probable enrolment at the above school for the coming academic year.\n\nThe children who will subsequently attend the Saddle Lake #2 School should return to the Edmonton Residential School at the beginning of the 1950-51 term and remain there until the Saddle Lake #2 School is ready to receive pupils, which we hope will be early in 1951.\n\nBernard F.

E.J. Staley,\nPrincipal,\nEdmonton Indian Residential School,\nEDMONTON, ALTA.\n\nDear Reverend Staley,\n\nI enclose copies of Application for Admission Forms for a party of children from this Agency, leaving here on September 7th.\n\nWe are very glad indeed to have the opportunity this year of sending away all those children who should be in a Residential School. For several years past we have had to confine our admissions to a very limited accommodation at Alberni and Lytton, although we have always received excellent cooperation from the Principals of these schools.\n\nIn selecting the children to go away our criterion has been their home environment. We have been guided entirely by what is best for the child rather than convenience of the parents, with the result that in most cases these children come from poorer than average homes. They are perhaps not the kind of material you would prefer to have, but if your excellent Institution can build them into worth while citizens and give them a chance in life, that is a great deal more than could have been expected had they remained on their Reserves. I am sure we are going to see wonderful changes in them on their return. No doubt it will take you some little while to sort them out, but if there is any information or assistance we can give you regarding their home background, please do not hesitate to write.\n\nWith kind regards and best wishes to you and your staff.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.V. Boys,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA. ONT.\n\nEnclosed are Application for Admission Forms for a number of children to the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Copy of our letter to the Reverend Principal is attached hereto. This will explain the reason for the large number of admissions from this Agency this year.\n\nIn all cases it was necessary that these children be sent for institutional care and training.\n\nI trust that the Applications may have your approval.\n\nJ.M. Boys,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJVB/pbj\nEncl.\nSeptember 14, 1950.\n\nMr. J.V. Boys,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHazelton, B.C.\n\nRe: Edmonton Residential School, Your File 151/25-2-5\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, the Department approves the admission of the undermentioned children to the Edmonton Residential School. It is noted that you have forwarded copies of the application forms to the Rev. Mr. Staley, Principal of the Edmonton School.

Davis, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n536 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Schools Nelson House\n\nOn September 26th I left for Nelson House and had a meeting of the band on the 27th, 90% of the members being present.\n\nI stated my reason for the meeting and asked all the members present who had children who were not attending school if they wished to make application for the children to attend residential schools, but was unable to get a single application. They stated that they had never instructed anyone to write the Department saying that they wished to do so. However they did say that they sent a petition requesting a U.C. Residential School to be established at Nelson House to my office with Assistant Agent J. Arnfinson, and I have this petition in this office at the present time.\n\nWith regard to their petition, I explained to them that there wasn't suitable land on the Nelson House Reserve for a residential school. They then suggested that there was a suitable location at Beaver Dam Lake, about 40 miles west of Wabowden between Nelson House and Wabowden. They said the reason for requesting a residential school was that they had no suitable place to leave their children when they went trapping.\n\nAt treaty time considerable discussion took place regarding the schools at Nelson House and the members present at the band meeting requested that we should try and change the academic year to June 1st to March 31st so that the children would have holidays during April and May. This would help bring up the average attendance of all children attending school, as every family goes to their trap line during these two months.\nI am of the firm belief that what is needed on these northern reserves is a boarding house where the parents could leave their children instead of a residential school.\n\nThere has been considerable interference by both the Priest and the U.C. Minister at this particular reserve. This reserve has received more attention than any other in this Agency, having an Assistant located there, but due to outside interference the Indians are encouraged to press for more and more all the time.\n\nI think it would be in order for me to request the Department to forward a letter to the above mentioned parties and advise them that I am quite capable of attending to the affairs of the Indians situated at Nelson House.\n\nE. Law,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nUpon receipt of your wire, dated September 25th, regarding sending children to Edmonton Residential School, I immediately got in touch with Superintendent Law; and he went in to Nelson House by a small plane and had a meeting with the Indians.\n\nNone of these Indians wish to send their children away to a boarding school, but they would like a boarding school at home - which most Indians do - so they will have their children near home and cared for without cost to themselves. This request is pretty general throughout the north, and I would take little notice of it. I have written to you under separate cover, regarding an extra room for the day school at this point.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nencl.\nRSD/ES\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRE: Voucher 734/50\n\nReferring to your letter of the 2nd instant, file 753-10 (El) in connection with the above voucher, the correct amount should be $27.35. The railway receipt was included at $1.85 instead of $8.85.\n\nCorrected voucher is returned herewith.\n\nE. A.

The last seven children listed are now at Brandon Indian Residential School, as per your letter, file 576-10 (E1), dated October 3rd.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nPupils 0242, 0244, 0248, 0252, 0254 and 0276 have also been dropped on the September Return and the note for the June Return shows them to be in hospital. It is presumed that you intend to have these pupils discharged from residence. Please forward your application requesting authority for the discharge of these pupils.\n\nOn the June Return, Louise Lightning was given No. 0342 and on the September Return this girl was given 0373. Please advise which number you wish to use permanently.\n\nOn the September Return you have shown pupil No. 0342 in residence as of January 1, 1950 and pupil No. 0343 as in residence from September 1, 1950, while grant for twenty-five days was claimed in each case. Please explain.\n\nPupils 342 and 343 entered the residence of September th while grant was claimed for thirty days each. Please correct either the date or the number of days.\n\nThe Return shows pupils No. 0235 and 0267 as having been in residence for eighty days. Please advise if these pupils returned late to school and the dates they returned.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOctober 19, 1950\n\nRev. E.J. Staley,\nPrincipal\nEdmonton Indian Res. School,\nEdmonton, Alta.,\n\nI have the September Quarterly Return for your school which is being returned for adjustment. In order to avoid hardship on the school we are forwarding a part payment of $8,000 pending the adjustment of the Return.\n\nWhen forwarding the Quarterly Return to the Department it is customary to enclose the admission and discharge forms with the Return in order that the two may be compared for the admission of new pupils and the discharge of those pupils not returning to residence. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you would forward these admission and discharge forms when returning your adjusted Per Capita return.\n\nOn checking the September Return, it is noted that the following pupils have been dropped while full grant was claimed for them on the June Quarter:\n\n| No. | 217 | 240 | 278 | 318 |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n|     | 221 | 273 | 301 | 308 |\n|     | 0259| 0286| 0289| 0296|\n|     | 333 | 0243| 0330|\n\nIt is presumed that these children did not return to residence after September 1. In cases of this nature, the school is entitled to a grant of sixty-two days covering July and August; therefore, you should insert the names of these pupils on the September Return and claim sixty-two days for each.\nCredit Advice\n\nOctober 5th, 1950.\n\nThe following remittance has been received from Indian Agent F.

Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nPearl and Peggy MOWATT\n\nFurther to my telegram of 22nd November and your letter of 29th. Our reason for sending these two girls to Edmonton last fall was that at that time their mother had been in and out of hospital several times and their father was suspected of active tuberculosis. There are eight children in this family, seven of whom are girls, all considerably younger than Pearl and Peggy.\n\nPearl was ready to enter Grade 3 this year having passed Grade 8 at Hazelton Indian Day School last year to the satisfaction of both her teacher and the principal of the Provincial High School at Hazelton. Because no high school facilities are available to her at Edmonton she has been obliged to take grade 8 again this year. The parents, both of whom have recovered their health, complain that the children are not receiving a satisfactory education. In view of Mr. Anfield's report following his recent visit there is reason to believe that the complaints have some foundation.\n\nUnder the circumstances I feel that it would be better to allow the children to come home.\n\n\"B.M. Hobbs\"\n\nfor J.V. Boys,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Edmonton Residential School - Mowatt Children\n\nI attach, for your information, a copy of a letter received from Mr. J.V. Boys, Superintendent of the Babine Agency.\n\nIt will be noted that at the time of the admission of these children to the Edmonton School, there were reasons which justified this action. These reasons are no longer applicable.\n\nIt is unfortunate that there is no opportunity for Grade 9 instruction at the Edmonton School but in view of the Department's comments, no action is being taken to secure discharge of these children.\n\nEnclosure\n\nW.S.

Woodsworth,\nSupt., Indian Agency,\nHobema, Alta.,\n\nYour file 112/25-2-753\n\nReferring to your letter of January 22nd in connection with Freda Buffalo and the Rowan children, it is noted that one of the children is six years of age and the parents in all cases are living.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Edmonton Residential School is over the authorized pupilage already and a day school on the Samson Reserve is operating, it would be appreciated if you would advise why these children should receive institutional care.\n\nWould it be possible to postpone their admission until September, when it is felt that there may be more room at the school due to discharges.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Citizenship and Immigration\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Admissions - Edmonton Indian Res. School\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 29, file 753-10 (E.6), I beg to advise you that Freda Buffalo, treaty number 342 Samson Band and Joseph and Jenson Roan, treaty number 307 Samson Band are in attendance at the Edmonton Indian Residential school, and have been in attendance since January 9th, 1951.\n\nIn the case of Freda Buffalo; she was sent to the Edmonton Indian Residential School by her father who already has had his six older children in that institution. The two who have been discharged and Frank, who is still in school, have attained high school levels of education. He is anxious for Freda to do the same.\n\nThis child did not enter school in the fall term due to family problems necessitating her presence at home. It is impossible for her to attend the Samson Day School due to the fact that her parents live seven miles away.\n\nRegarding the Roan boys, I beg to advise you that their mother placed them in the Edmonton Indian Residential school where their sister is already in attendance. The mother wished the boys to start together for companionship, so she states. As the family resides permanently at Pigeon Lake, they could not attend day school here. The family is very large and very poor. It appears to me that the mother is wise in her choice and I recommend her action. There is incidence of t.b. in the family which also makes institutional attendance more advisable than day school, as the boys can be checked regularly at the nearby Camsell Hospital.\nI have contacted the Reverend E. J. Staley, Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, and he informs me that due to recent discharges, there is room in his institution within the authorized pupilage.\n\nMr. Stealey further advises that 15 pupils have been discharged to attend Day school at Saddle Lake Indian Agency and seven to Rocky Mountain House. It would appear therefore, if I am to follow instructions received from the Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Mr. Goodenham, that we must endeavor to recruit every available child who could qualify for school attendance at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nH.

However, it should be kept in mind that the authorized enrolment for the Edmonton Residential School is 153 pupils. Should some serious illness break out at the school or a fire, and the school is over the authorized pupilage, the Department is open for severe criticism. Furthermore, there are only sufficient funds voted to pay per capita grants for 153 pupils in the Edmonton school. If this figure is increased, some other school will have to suffer or the Department might be forced to pay for the authorized pupilage only.\n\nIn view of the above information it would be appreciated if you would keep these points in mind when considering future applications for admission to this school.\nIn view of the information you have provided, the Department approves the admission of the following children to the Edmonton Indian Residential School:\n\nEdna Laura Twins,\nJensen Rowan\nFrances Rowan\nFreda Eliza Buffalo.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nActing Superintendent of Education.\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

As you know, residential schools do not close until the end of June.\n\nOur residential schools in Eastern Canada have always been obliged to keep a number of children during the summer holidays, due to unsuitable home conditions. In the case of those children whose home conditions are satisfactory, we have allowed them to go home on leave, but the parents are expected to pay the cost either way.\n\nPossibly the Superintendents of the Agencies from where these children come made some promise to the...\nparents regarding summer holidays, and if so, we do not appear to have any such correspondence on our file.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would give the matter your early consideration and advise what action you consider should be taken.\n\nPP/ST\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\nRev.

School,\nEdmonton, Alta.,\n\nThis refers to your March Quarterly Return for the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that pupils who have been absent from school during the whole of the December Quarter have been dropped entirely from the March Return.\n\nIn order to keep our records up to date and to avoid future difficulties, it is imperative that the necessary data on these pupils should be shown on Form I.A. 411, when pupils are discharged from a residential school.\n\nWhen the pupils are shown on this form, we are prepared to consider their discharge. The discharge of every pupil should be approved by this office before his or her name may be dropped from the Return.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nMay 28, 1951.\n\nTo the Principal,\nEdmonton Indian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Staley:\n\nWill you please advise by return if your statement to me still stands that you do not wish children from B.C. to return to the E.R.S. next year. In our discussions last fall you seemed to feel that these children would not adapt themselves to life on the prairie, but it may be that following a full ten-month period at the school, conditions have clarified and you may have a different opinion.\n\nThis situation should be clarified without delay as we have requests from parents that their children remain at the school during the summer months this year. I would like to have your opinion as to whether you keep any children in or not. The regulations of the Dept. are that if parents are unable to pay the fares, or if home conditions are unsatisfactory, children should be retained at the school. Would you be good enough to write to me at once regarding these matters, so that plans for the coming year may be finalized. I would also like to know if any specific date has been set for the departure of these children from Edmonton and also if the school is prepared to assist with their meals on the way home by taking basket food supplies on the train in charge of the escort from the school. I would be pleased to hear from you regarding these matters.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nP.S./ay\nAttached hereto is a copy of a letter received by the Rev. E.J. Staley, Principal of the Edmonton Residential School from Mr. E. Anfield, Superintendent of the Babine Indian Agency. Mr. Staley turned this letter in to the Edmonton Agency office from where it was forwarded to this office with a covering letter which states that Mr. Staley was very concerned about its contents and felt that it was completely out of his power to handle and asked that it be passed on for consideration and reply. He pointed out that he had no money to assist these pupils and had intended to follow his usual policy of sending all pupils home for the holidays and closing the school for the holiday months.\n\nCorrespondence on your file indicates that Mr. Staley has been very ill and away from the school for some time. Apparently he recently returned and it is not known whether or not he proposes to remain after the end of the school year. As has been reported by this office and Inspector Waller this school has virtually ceased to function as an institution of education and some definite action must immediately be taken in respect to the manner in which it is operated in the future.\n\nI have suggested that this is an opportune time to seriously consider that it be operated as a Departmental school, but as I do not know what is to be done about it, it is impossible for me to make a suggestion in respect to the disposition of the pupils from B.C. From what I know of the existing conditions I see no alternative but to arrange for their return to their homes at the end of the school year.\n\nAwaiting your instructions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.H.

For your personal information I may say that I feel Mr. Anfield should have written a different type of letter. However, there is no question that the children will have to go home for holidays, as Mr. Staley is sick and it is doubtful if arrangements could be made to have any large number of the children remain at the Edmonton School during the months of July and August.\n\nIn my letter of April 19th I wrote you regarding a letter we had received from Superintendent Robertson. Until we received Mr. Anfield's letter of May 28th, we had no further information regarding the movement of children from British Columbia to their homes at the end of June, and consequently, we were under the impression that you had the matter in hand.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would let us know exactly where it stands and what arrangements are being made.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nJune 2nd, 1951.\n\nMr. G.H.

Parents were contacted in the usual way and fares have been coming in during the past week or so. I attach herewith 2 cheques and list of children for whom money has been received. Further sums will be forwarded to you as received, and it is hoped that most of the children from this Agency will be able to leave Edmonton on Friday June 8th.\n\nIt is unnecessary for me to point out to you that responsibility for returning these children on vacation is that of the school. Last year the Department did authorize payment of the fare of an escort from the school for this purpose in all residential schools in British Columbia, where children proceed in large parties, to their homes for the summer. My interpretation is that the Department's circular for this year cancels any possibility for such an authority for this year. It is noted in your wire that your school is completely closed during the summer, and that it will not be pos-\nunable to retain any pupils therein, during the summer months.\n\nThe Department has ruled repeatedly that children whose home conditions are unsatisfactory or whose parents are unable to pay their fares are to remain in the school during the summer vacation. It is also my understanding that the Department pays per capita grants for all school pupils for 12 months per year, thus taking care of the maintenance of such children who are unable to return home, for the reasons mentioned herein.\n\nThese matters are all covered by Departmental policy and have been for many years, and I am sure that with your long experience in this work, must be well known to you.\n\nI should also mention that Mr. J.V. Boys, Indian Superintendent at Hazelton, was contacted regarding movement of children to his Agency from Edmonton. Mr. Boys informed me that so far he had only been able to collect one or 2 fares and this would be remitted to you immediately. I understand that Mr. Boys will be writing to you direct regarding children for whom no fares can be collected, or whose home conditions are unsuitable. For your information I should mention, also, that Mr. Boys is in process of being transferred to another Agency and dealings regarding the Babine children will likely be carried out by the Assistant at Hazelton, Mr. Appleby.\n\nIt is hoped that this somewhat lengthy letter will clarify the point raised in your telegram of May 30th.\n\nP.

Anfield's letter of June 1st to the Principal, a copy of which is attached, that satisfactory arrangements are being made although some difficulty in financing transportation for some of the pupils is being encountered. I am asking Mr. Anfield to keep me informed of the arrangements made.\n\nSince writing the above we have received a copy of Supervisor Gooderham's letter of June 6th and confirmation of my Army Signal message in this connection is attached. This office was not aware that, as would appear from Mr. Gooderham's letter, the school management was more or less disorganized, presumably due in part to the illness of the Principal.\n\nNormally we would require the parents of the pupils to provide transportation to their homes for the summer months and return to the school in the Fall but as it seems likely that the pupils will not be returning to Edmonton in the Fall I doubt if we can reasonably expect the parents to pay their fare home. Mr. Anfield has been successful in collecting the fare for most of his pupils but as it apparently is quite out of\nthe question for any pupils to remain at the school during the summer the Department should provide transportation for the others. It is disturbing to note that this school has virtually ceased to function as an institution of education and in view of this it is felt that the pupils should be returned home as soon as arrangements can conveniently be made.\n\nW.

As a result, departmental officials communicated with Indian Commissioner Arneil and arranged to send a number of children from British Columbia agencies to the Edmonton School. As a consequence, the Edmonton School has been able to draw its full per capita allowance during the academic year just closing.\n\nHowever, many of the children from British Columbia come from broken homes, and in the past it has always been found necessary to retain a certain number of children in the Edmonton School during the months of July and August. However, field officials now inform me that it will not be possible to follow the same procedure this year, and if so, we will be obliged to return all the children from British Columbia to their homes, and it is doubtful if we will be able to induce them to return to the Edmonton School in September.\nAs you can see, the situation is rather serious both from the school's standpoint and ours. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would let me hear from you as soon as possible, intimating if it is your intention to appoint a new Principal, and if so, the approximate date on which he will take charge of the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nCALGARY JUNE 12 1951\n\nP PHELAN\n\nPRINCIPAL STALEY EDMONTON I.R.S.

If such is the Department's wish, it is expected that we will have some difficulty in securing the return of these children because of the very poor reputation of this school among the natives of the Babine and Skeena Agencies. Although there are a large number of children needing institutional care in these areas it will be difficult to make up the quota of 60 allotted last year. Mr. Anfield informs me that a number of the parents of the pupils who have been enrolled have already requested a discharge or transfer of their children. It appears that unless there has been a radical change in the management of the school there would be considerable difficulties similar to those which arose last year if B.C. pupils are to be admitted.\n\nThe Department's instructions will be appreciated.\n\nW.

As a matter of fact, the authorized pupilage at this school is 153, but we have been allowing grant for the extra number.\n\nYou will recall that there was some complaint on the part of some of the children from British Columbia last year, regarding conditions at the Edmonton School. Your own report regarding your inspection of the Edmonton School on May 15th and 16th indicated that several changes would be necessary in order to assure that conditions during the coming academic year would be better than they have been during the past year.\n\nCertain sections of your report were forwarded to Dr. Dorey, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church in Canada in June.\nRev. Dr. Macdonald of the United Church Missionary Society, interviewed the Director and myself last week, and he appeared to be rather vague regarding the present condition of the Rev. Mr. Staley's health.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you could find it convenient to spend one day this week at the Edmonton School, and on your return to Calgary let me know if you consider Mr. Staley is able to carry on for the coming academic year, and if the United Church authorities have issued any instructions to Mr. Staley regarding possible changes arising out of your report.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nP.O.

I think it could be safely said that from this Agency we will secure 20 children at least and efforts will be made towards that end.\n\nIt is presumed that the Hazelton Agency has been similarly notified. I will work in conjunction with Mr. Jutras as to transportation arrangements.\n\nThere is a point that will have to be settled however, in this matter of the 30 children from this Agency in residence in June, so many of these, 16 through their parents paid cash fares to bring their children home. The balance were apparently taken care of by the Department. This action has undoubtedly got around and I would like a directive as to whether or not the Department intends to assist in transportation for pupils of this school returning to Edmonton for further studies.\n\nIt is of course understood that new admissions will be charged to the Department in the usual way.\n\n(Sgd.)

Mr. Anfield has made a correction in the number of children who will be available from his Agency for enrolment at this school; the figure 20 in his letter of August 10 should read 30 or 40.\n\nI shall appreciate the Department giving a decision on the point raised in the fourth paragraph of Mr. Anfield's letter. This office is aware that the Department has already ruled that pupils returning home from Residential Schools for summer vacation will not receive any Departmental assistance to cover the cost of transportation. This has been the policy with regard to Protestant children from the Skeena and Bahine Agencies for some time but apparently the action of the Department in paying for some of the children to return home from the Edmonton School last June has given rise to the impression that certain groups were being discriminated against. The Department will appreciate, of course, that the distance involved will make the cost to parents considerable. If the Department is anxious to have this school operate to capacity it is felt that perhaps some allowance might be made in this particular case.\n\nW. S.

However, on the other hand we are anxious to have the Edmonton School with its full enrolment, and while not wishing to place any unnecessary burden upon you, I feel that the best way is to leave it in the hands of Mr. Anfield and yourself to secure as much help in regard to the cost of transportation from the parents as possible.

Due to his condition his earnings are not sufficient to pay board and room for the children near a school and the children were kept at the pole camp, and had not attended school since September.\n\nLattie Children\nThere are nine children in this family between the ages of one and sixteen years. The father, Dick Lattie, works in the woods, and the distance to the logging camp makes it impossible for him to come home more than once per month. The mother has no control over the children and they run the streets of Hazelton till all hours of the night getting into trouble and making general nuisances of themselves. It was felt all along that these children should be in school and arrangements were made for their admission after pressure from the local citizens, including the R.C.M.P.\n\nThese two cases were thoroughly discussed with the local teachers and Mr. Davey, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., and it was felt that their admission was in the best interest of all and should not be delayed.\n\nIn closing I would advise that the Edmonton School has since opened and the Hillis and Lattie children were sent along with the other\nthirty three children from this Agency. It was thought that the Department would approve their admission in view of the home conditions.\n\nM. G. JUTRAS\nIndian Superintendent\n\nMGJfbh\nNovember 20, 1951.\n\nMr. M.G. Jutras,\nSupt.

Please verify this.\n\nOur records also indicate that the above-mentioned children were admitted to the Edmonton residential school which is a United Church school, several years ago; yet the applications for admission showed the religious denomination to be Roman Catholic, and that these children were admitted to the Edmonton school due to limited space in the Ermineskin school.\n\nIn view of the above information, the Department is prepared to approve the admission of the four children to the Ermineskin school as grant-earning pupils. Please advise the Principal of the Ermineskin school to enter these pupils' names on the March Quarterly Return and claim grant for them from the date of their admission to the school.\n\nWould you advise this office as soon as possible whether these children are at school and if so, when they were admitted also whether they are of the same family.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nFebruary 12, 1952\n\nMr. H.N.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 21st regarding the transportation of British Columbia children from the Edmonton school to their homes and later returning the children to the Edmonton school if this is necessary, you are advised that the Department is prepared to bear some of the transportation costs.\n\nThe respective Indian Superintendents should make every effort to collect transportation costs from as many parents as possible.\n\nYou will note that we are instructing Mr. Woodsworth to the effect that the children must not leave the Edmonton school prior to June 25 which is the official closing date of all our schools.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 27, 1952.\n\nMr. H.M. Woodsworth,\nSupt., Indian Agency,\n405 P.O. Bldg.,\nEdmonton, Alta.,\n\nI have a letter from Mr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia regarding the transportation of British Columbia children from the Edmonton Indian Residential School to their homes for the summer vacation.\n\nThe Department is prepared to pay some of the transportation costs for the return of these children if it is necessary to return the children to the school at the end of the summer holidays. You should contact Reverend Stanley and ascertain from him the number of children who will be returning to their parents and advise him to proceed with making the necessary arrangements for their transportation.\n\nIt should be clearly understood that the Department will not tolerate returning the children to their homes prior to June 25 at the earliest. We do not want a repetition of last year's incidence where the children were returned early in the month of June and reached their respective reserves before the day schools were closed.\n\nWhen the necessary arrangements have been completed and a definite date for their departure from Edmonton has been established you should contact the respective Indian Superintendents in British Columbia in order that they may be prepared to receive the children when they arrive at their destination.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nApril 25, 1952\n\nSir,\n\nIndian Residential Application for admission of the undermentioned child into the United Church of Canada, Kispox Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: W.B.G.H.T.

This situation is most unsatisfactory and will put us in a very awkward position in that many of the children were sent to the school because of poor home conditions. As a matter of fact some of the children are orphans while others have no father and the mother is in Miller Bay Hospital. To place them in other homes is next to impossible as many families spend the summer months on the fishing grounds.\n\nI would strongly recommend that some steps be taken by the Department to keep those children in school during the summer months if at all possible.\n\n\"M.

Working in conjunction with the Skeena Agency it has been established that accommodation is available for these children.\n\n1. Adams, Thomas Russell, age 13, #10 of the Masset Band\n2. Adams, Carol Isobel, age 8, #10 of the Masset Band\n\nThese children are at the present time being moved about from one house to another. The mother is dead and the father who is engaged in the fishing industry is unable to properly care for them. Their admission is recommended.\n\n3. Davis, Austin John, age 12, #95 of the Masset Band\n\nThis boy is one of two, who, due to unsatisfactory family conditions has been a problem during the past year. The mother of this child has been married 3 times as has the stepfather. A sister of this boy has recently returned from the girls Industrial School. Admission is strongly recommended.\n\n4. Wiat, Clive (Bright) age 11, Masset Band\n\nThis is an orphan living with his grandmother a widow who is almost blind. This boy with Austin John Davis, listed above has also been a problem during the past year. There is no home supervision and his admission is also strongly recommended.\nWilliams, Noel, age 13, #171 Masset Band\n\n6. Williams Larry, age 7, #171 Masset Band\n\nThese boys, brothers, have had no adequate home supervision for several years since the death of their mother. The father, John Williams has re-married recently and the situation as regards these boys has by no means improved. Their admission is recommended.\n\n7. Parnell, Verna Marjorie, age 6, #119 Masset Band.\n\nApplication for admission in this case is made for economic reasons. The father Earl Parnell suffered an injury which has temporarily prevented him from carrying on his usual fishing activities. The family is large (5 minor children). Admission is recommended.\n\n8. Brown, Lois Rebecca, age 14, #44 Masset Band.\n\nThis girl has developed into a problem child, careful investigation of family situation has caused me to suggest her admission to Residential School for a year. I believe the change to Residential School life with its accompanying discipline is the answer in this case and will forestall trouble with this girl. Admission of this pupil is urgently recommended.\n\n9. Parnell, Dolly, age 12, #112 Masset Band.\n\nReason for this application is simply one of unsatisfactory home conditions, drunkenness prevails in this home and the girl should be removed from these surroundings for the present time. The application is recommended.\n\n10. Collison, Clarence, age 12, #61 Masset Band.\n\nThe father of this child is dead and the mother is forced to work to support the rest of the family. Admission of this child would relieve the present economic situation and provide badly needed supervision for this boy. Admission is recommended.\nPryce, Bernice Sarah, age 11, #63 Skidegate Band\n\nThe father of this child is a long term patient at Miller Bay Hospital. The step-mother works and the child is left to herself. She is clear in so far as X-Ray and T.B. tests are concerned and her admission is recommended.\n\nForms have been completed for No. 1 and 2 and are attached hereto. Despite regulations as set out in the recent circular regarding admissions to Residential Schools, it is impossible to have application forms completed on time in many cases. In this particular instance, there is no doctor at Masset or in the vicinity, thus the children will not be examined until Saturday, August 30th when they arrive in Prince Rupert. They then leave for Edmonton on Monday, September 1st. Forms will then be airmailed.\n\nSince I have been relieving Mr. Anfield in the Skeena Agency for the past 3 weeks I would request that a wire be sent to him approving admission of these children subject to satisfactory medical examinations. I will have returned to Masset by that time and he has very kindly agreed to attend to the final details for me.\n\nJ. A. Findley\nIndian Superintendent\n\n/s/\ns.o. Principal, Edmonton\ns.o.

Barnes\n[INDIAN AFFAIRS]\nPrincipal\nEdmonton Indian Residential School\nEDMONTON, Alberta\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Mr. Philip Phelan Superintendent of Education, in which he advises that the Department approves the admission of the following children to your school, as grant earning pupils:\n\nStanley GREEN, Number 377 Samson Band\nAllan Leslie POTTS, Number 86 Montana Band\nMarietta Doris POTTS, Number 86 Montana Band\nLaura TWINS, Number 39 Louis Bull Band.\n\nIn regard to Phylis Edna Strongman, number 81 Montana Band, they have declined approval of admission and have stated as follows:\n\n\"It is noted that Phylis Edna Strongman is of the Roman Catholic faith, while the Edmonton School is United Church. In view of this fact, this girl's admission to the Edmonton School is denied. If for any reason this girl has already been placed in the Residential School, she should be immediately returned to her parents. It is noted that she previously attended the Montana Day School. Under the circumstances she should return to this school.\"\n\nIn view of the foregoing, it is requested that Phylis Edna Strongman be returned to Hobema to her parents as ordered by Ottawa.\n\nJ. R. Wild\nSuperintendent\nHobema Indian Agency\n\nJRW/ehm\nOctober 14, 1952.\n\nMr. H.R. Woodsworth,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\n403 P.O. Bldg.,\nEdmonton, Alta.,\n\nAttached I am returning the September Quarterly Return for the Edmonton Indian Residential School as there are certain discrepancies on the Return which will make it impossible for us to have the account passed by the Treasury officials and if the Return was paid as presented the school would be definitely jeopardized as many of the pupils who were in residence during the month of June were omitted from the September Return.\n\nOur circular of July 23rd clearly indicated that the school is entitled to sixty-two days grant for the months of July and August for pupils who were in residence during June. On checking the September Return for this school we have noted that the following pupils were in school during June but were omitted on the September Return, consequently the Principal has neglected to claim sixty-two days grant for them: 320, 321, 346, 350, 351, 378, 383, 274, 0298 and 0351.\n\nIt is quite possible that these children returned during the month of September and the school is entitled to more than the sixty-two days grant, however, this matter should be reviewed and the proper grant claimed for them.\nThe following children were entered on the September Return for the first time: #257, 364, 0406, 0407, 0408 and 0409, although we have no information as to who these children are and why grant should be claimed for them. If these children are re-admissions this fact should be shown in the Remarks Column indicating the date they returned to school and the proper number of days claimed.\n\nPlease advise the Principal that we are sending to the Treasurer of the United Church of Canada a part payment of $5,000. on the September Return. The balance will be forwarded when the amended Return is received.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Joseph\nEnglish name: John\nAge: 7 years\nName of Band: Ojibway\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 870\nFather's full name and No.: Thomas Henry (Band #199)\nMother's full name and No.: Jane (Band #370)\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Protestant\nDoes applicant speak English?

Pupil #346 was in attendance and was omitted on the September report and now has been added to the Register.\n\nFive pupils which were entered for the first time in September, that is 364, 0406, 0407, 0408 and 0409, were actually in attendance for the entire school year for 1951-52; pupil #257 was in attendance in 1950-51 but did not attend 1951-52 and has returned to this school this year.\n\nIn the final analysis therefore, the school was apparently paid for four more pupils than were in attendance in the June term.\n\ncontinued...\nThe Administration of the Edmonton Residential School during the past school year appeared to have been very lax. At the request of Mr. Barnes a report is being made by our Treasury Auditor and his report will shortly be available.\n\nI must record the fact that pupils at this school come from three Agencies in British Columbia and four Agencies in Alberta. As all reports and returns are submitted for signature of Superintendent of the Edmonton Indian Agency, Mr. Woodsworth, it is next to impossible for him to check and as a result he must rely on the accuracy of the return as submitted by the Principal of the School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.H.

In view of this fact this girl's admission to the Edmonton School is denied. If for any reason this girl has already been placed in the Residential School, she should be immediately returned to her parents. It is noted that she previously attended the Montana Day School. Under the circumstances she should return to this school.\n\nPlease advise.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nIndian Affairs Branch\nEdmonton Agency\n\n403 Post Office Bldg.,\nEDMONTON, Alberta.\nNovember 19, 1952.\n\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School\nPupil No. 0393 Edna (Phyllis) Strongman\nMontana Indian Reserve\n\nWith reference to your 753-10 (E6) letter of November 12, 1952, the Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, Mr. F. Barnes, was advised that you have disallowed the thirty day grant for the above mentioned Indian child.\n\nMr. Barnes informs me that Edna (Phyllis) was brought into the school by the United Church Missionary, Mr. Kay, of Hobbema along with other pupils for admission from that Agency September 4, 1952. Your instructions to Mr. J.R. Wild, Supt., Hobbema Indian Agency, were carried out according to Mr. Barnes under protest and Phyllis was removed from the Edmonton Indian Residential School October 4, 1952, when her mother Emily Strongman came and escorted her home.\n\nThe removal of this child from the Edmonton Indian Residential School according to information presented to this office by Mr. Barnes and Protestant Missionaries at Hobbema appears contrary to the wishes of Mrs. Strongman. According to these missionaries Mrs. Strongman has never been a Roman Catholic and does not wish to be so listed, or have her children so listed. The following facts were reported which are for your information:\n\n\"John Strongman and Emily Littlepoplar were united in marriage December 19, 1939, in the manse of the United Church in Hobbema. Reverend A.J. Law and Reverend J.F. Woodsworth were officiating Ministers.\"\n\ncont'd..\nThe above were married by Ranne. Witnesses were Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Louis of Hobbema.\n\nEvidently of recent months John Strongman separated himself from Emily and has taken a common-law wife, unknown to this Agency, and it has been reported that Emily is seeking support from John for her children. Accompanied by her father Fred Littlepoplar, Councillor Samson Band, Emily has taken steps to have her husband support the children and also to have her name placed on the Protestant list and that of Edna (Phyllis) in particular. Evidently all her children are in her custody. I gathered this support and definition of religious status is being sought through a legal firm in Wetaskiwin.\n\nIf the religious status of Edna (Phyllis) is ruled as Protestant by the Department, it is hoped the Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School will receive the thirty day per capita grant resulting from the presence of Edna (Phyllis) at the school.\n\nH.N. Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent.\nNovember 12, 1952\n\nMr. H.N. Woodsworth,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\n403 P.O. Bldg.,\nEdmonton, Alta.,\n\nWith reference to the September Quarterly Return for the Edmonton Indian Residential School, please be advised that we have disallowed the thirty days grant claimed for pupil # 0393 Phyllis Strongarm as the application for admission received for this girl indicated that she is of the Roman Catholic faith while the Edmonton School is United Church. We have not received a decision on this application, consequently the grant is disallowed until a ruling is given.\n\nFor your information we have written Mr. J.R. Wild on September 24 advising him of this situation and instructed him as follows:\n\n\"If for any reason this girl has already been placed in the Residential School, she should be immediately returned to her parents. It is noted that she previously attended the Montana Day School. Under the circumstances she should return to this school\".\n\nPlease advise what action has been taken in this regard.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nHobbema, Alberta, December 3, 1952.\n\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan\nSupt. of Education.\n\nRe: Edna Phyllis STRONGMAN\n\nReference is made to your letter of November 29th written under File 753-10 (E6):\n\nIn reply to the last paragraph of your letter it is wished to advise that the original information indicated that this child was a Roman Catholic and was obtained from the mother Mrs. Emily Strongman who stated that this child was Roman Catholic when she made application for the admission of Edna Phyllis to the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nAll the records at this Office show this child to be of Roman Catholic faith. A further check was made with the Roman Catholic Mission and they have produced Certificate of Baptism which indicates that Edna Phyllis was baptized on the 28th day of May, 1944.\n\nIn view of the above information we feel that we were justified in indicating on the application for admission to Edmonton Indian Residential School that this child was of Roman Catholic faith.

Father Latour, Principal, Ermineskin Indian Residential School, I beg to advise you that Paul Adams and family are listed in the treaty books in this Agency as Protestant.\n\nThe admission forms were signed by the Father of the children, Paul Adams, and witnessed by Mr. J. D. Bristow, Assistant, Indian Agency, Wabamun Indian Reserve. Their admission to the Edmonton Indian Residential School was approved by departmental letter, file 753-10 (E6) dated September 19, 1952.\n\nI am informed the children have for some time been cared for by guardians, Mr. and Mrs. George Bearhead, TN 57 Paul's Band. These elderly people were unable to care any longer for the children. On the advice of the Agency nurse, Miss G. G.

Graves, Agency Nurse, Charles Camsell Indian Hospital, has interviewed Mrs. Adams. I was unable to do this as the hospital is quarantined. Miss Graves advises that Mrs. Adams states that she and Paul Adams were married in the R.C. Church, Rocky Mountain House on or around April, 1943. The oldest boy, Chester, she states, was baptized R.C. by the same priest who married them at the Rocky Mountain House hospital. Her other children she states being, Lester Norman and Elizabeth were baptized R.C. by a priest from Edmonton who she thinks was Rev. Fr. Gamache.\n\nPaul Adams insists he is Protestant as his family are so listed in the Agency records. It would appear, however, that despite the listing the wife and children are R.C.\n\nH. N.

The applications requested the admission of these children to the Edmonton Indian Residential School. The religious denomination was indicated as \"Protestant (United Church)\".

It would be appreciated therefore, if you would arrange to secure the original copy or certified extracts from Church documents indicating that the Adams' were married in a Roman Catholic Church and that the children were baptized Roman Catholic as indicated.\n\nWhen these are received, you will be further advised.\n\nNo action should be taken on the transfer of these children until a decision has been reached and you have been advised to that effect.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nRev.

Findley,\nIndian Supt.,\nMasset, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Findley:\n\nRe: Rose White and Lois Brown\n\nI am sorry to have to dismiss these two girls from my School but it seemed the only course open to the Matron and myself under the circumstances, since they have been at this School they have shown at times a spirit of rebellion to rules and regulations as well as a lack of respect and courtesy to various staff members.\n\nRecently they have been involved in having some boys come to their dormitory during the night. I hope something can be done for them but this school is not a place of correction such as they require.\n\nTwo Alberta boys were sent home yesterday and one or two more may have to go today as well as a girl or two. The whole matter is not yet settled.\n\nIn future I wonder if you could screen your students a little more closely when they have so far to come? I had travel warrants issued for their passage to Prince Rupert and have wired Mr. Anfield to have them met there tomorrow evening and sent on to Masset.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"F. Barnes\"\nPrincipal\nQueen Charlotte Agency.\n\nMasset, B.C.,\nNov. 12, 1952.\n\nMr. F. Barnes, B.SC., B.Ed.,\nEdmonton Indian Residential School,\nBox 186,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nIt was with some surprise that I received a phone call from Mr. Anfield advising me of the return home of Rosie White and Lois Brown. These girls had not been particularly troublesome at other schools or at home. Rosie was spending her second year at Edmonton and it was our belief that she was completely settled and happy.\n\nI am beginning to be of the opinion that the Dolly Farnell case had some bearing on these two. It may be that they saw the opportunity of also being sent home if they misbehaved.\n\nI do not wish to appear critical of your actions, since I appreciate quite well the problems with which you have to contend. I trust there will be no more trouble but would ask that should the unforeseen happen, that you forward me a report before taking action in sending pupils home. Due to distance and difficulties involved in travel it makes it most inconvenient if we are advised after the action has been taken. I seriously request this consideration.\n\nWhile appreciating your statements regarding the school not being a place of correction, I suggest that as far as pupils from this Agency are concerned, they are not sent with that purpose in mind. However, as you will I am sure agree strict discipline in many of these cases is not out of the way.\n\nc.c. Mr. Anfield\n\nJ.A.

I have attached a copy of a letter from Mr. Barnes as well as a copy of my reply in this connection.\n\nEarlier in the term a Masset girl, Dolly Parnell, was sent home and being advised ahead of time we were in accord with the proposed action.\n\nHowever, the first intimation of the return of the two girls, was a phone call from Mr. Anfield that he had received a wire to the effect that they were on their way to Prince Rupert. He had no previous knowledge of the matter either.\n\nBoth Mr. Anfield and I agree that despite reasons, we should be notified of any such proposed action ahead of time in order that we may consult and consider the matter. Hasty action in sending pupils home may not be the answer to school problems which arise.\n\nFrom Mr. Barnes' letter it appears that there had been considerable trouble at the school with, as he states, several others involved. The two girls in question have never been troublesome before and in Rosie's case this was her second consecutive year at the school. She, a brother and younger sister even remained there during the summer months and letters to her mother indicated they were quite happy. Incidentally the father of these children has been in and out of jail several times over the past few years.\nWhen Mr. Anfield phoned me about the girls' return, it was too late to take steps to at least delay the action and a warrant was issued for them to return to Masset. If they had waited in Prince Rupert until our regular steamer, it would have involved 10 days room and board.\n\nJ.A.

The two girls in question have never been troublesome before and in Rosie's case this was her second consecutive year at the school. She, a brother and younger sister even remained there during the summer months and letters to her mother indicated they were quite happy. Incidentally the father of these children has been in and out of jail several times over the past few years.\nWhen Mr. Anfield phoned me about the girls' return, it was too late to take steps to at least delay the action and a warrant was issued for them to return to Masset. If they had waited in Prince Rupert until our regular steamer, it would have involved 10 days room and board.\n\nJ.A. Findlay,\nAgency Superintendent.\n\nJAF/da\nDecember 26, 1952\n\nMr. F. Barnes,\nPrincipal,\nEdmonton Indian Res. School,\nEdmonton, Alta.,\n\nDear Mr. Barnes:\n\nI have recently been informed that a number of Indian children have been expelled from the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Our records do not indicate any report or comments received from you regarding these cases. In one instance, the Indian Superintendent advised that two of the girls from his Agency were expelled from the Edmonton Residential School. As these girls had never been troublesome before and as they had been in the Edmonton school for two years he felt they were well established in their academic studies.\n\nIt is the Department's policy to be fair to both the Indian Superintendent and the Principal in that we are anxious to assist the Principal in the management of the residential school and often children who are in a residential school have no home to go to and it is often difficult for the Indian Superintendent to arrange for the children's keep when they leave a residential school.\n\nAs this Branch is responsible for all children attending residential schools, it is essential that no pupils be discharged or expelled from a residential school until authority has been obtained from the Department.\nAs our records are very sketchy regarding the expulsion of pupils from the Edmonton Residential School during the present academic year, it would be appreciated if you would forward this office a full report indicating the names of the pupils expelled, the reason for their expulsion and the Agency where the children have been returned.\n\nIt is possible that we will receive inquiries regarding this matter and it would be appreciated if you would forward this report as soon as possible and give complete details.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nEDMONTON INDIAN RES.

Box 188\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA\n\nDecember 31, 1952.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nIn reply to your letter of 26 inst. #753-10 re expulsion of four children from this School may I say that it comes to me rather as a shock. I note in previous records where children have been dismissed by both my predecessors at their discretion. In fact, one of the children which was dismissed had previously been dismissed by Mr. Staley without permission. It is difficult to understand why a Principal with my experience and qualifications should not have the same prerogative.\n\nFour children were dismissed Nov. 5 and 6. They were: Rose White and Lois Brown of Masset; Francis Buffalo, Hobbsma and Francis Makokis Saddle Lake. I am sorry that you did not write about this as it would have showed up in my December Return.\n\nWhen I arrived here the acting Matron complained that Rose White was a bad influence in the School and that she swore at her when corrected. I talked to Rose and she promised to do better. In September, Miss MacDonald came as Matron and Mrs. McIlwraith as assistant. Both of these ladies have years of experience with Indian children. Before a month was up both of these ladies complained that Rose White and Lois Brown were a bad influence in the School and incorrigible. In spite of this they talked with them and tried to influence them for the better.\n\nLate in October we found that two of the girls and some of the boys had become involved in promiscuous relations and had broken the rules of the School by the girls inviting the boys up to their dormitory at night and letting them in the fire-escape door. The girls were to blame, of course, for going. By this time Miss MacDonald had to know that action had to be taken at once so we decided to send home the ring-leaders. She picked the two girls and I picked the two boys. If the Masset Agency is not happy with regard to our actions then I am sorry but we had to keep Alberta children out of the School this Fall because of no room so it might be best if no Masset children were sent to the school. I know that I would wish a Principal of mine to act likewise if I were in my former position of Inspector of Schools and had a Principal in charge of a dormitory housing both boys and girls. The final visit was made on November 4 so then we acted immediately. I cannot and will not tolerate such behavior in any school or which I am in charge.\n\nIf I have been wrong in what I have done it is only because of ignorance since I have only been in the Indian Service for five months but I have acted as I felt you would wish me to under the circumstances. Please do not forget that Ottawa is a long distance from here and we must be given some opportunity to use our own judgment or the Schools cannot operate efficiently. I have understood that the Schools operated under the School Act of each respective Province. If I am wrong in this please advise. The Alberta Act states that a Principal shall dismiss any\nJanuary 8th, 1953.\n\nMr. Findlay Barnes, B.Sc., B.Ed.,\nPrincipal,\nEdmonton Indian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Barnes:\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of December 31st and I regret that this has caused you so much concern.\n\nThe department understands the many difficulties presented in endeavouring to operate a residential school, and wishes to be helpful and to support our principals wherever possible. I appreciate that in many cases we must accept the recommendation of the principal and our field staff. However, the department has a responsibility to the children and their parents, as well as the Superintendent of the Agency to which they belong, and for this reason the department requires that the Superintendent of the Indian Agency be consulted, wherever possible, before a child is expelled and that the principal submit a report immediately following any action taken.\n\nI note that you have made reference to the Alberta Act with respect to the responsibilities of a principal concerning discipline. The 1952 revision of the Act, Section 366, reads as follows:\n\n\"(1) A teacher may suspend from a class or from school a pupil who is guilty of open opposition to authority, wilful disobedience, habitual neglect of duty, the use of profane or improper language, or other conduct injurious to the moral tone or well-being of the school.\"\n(2) The teacher shall report any suspension immediately to the principal if in a graded school.\n\n(3) The principal of the school, or the teacher in the event of there being no principal, shall\u2014\n\n(a) prepare forthwith a written report of the suspension setting out all the circumstances; and\n\n(b) send the report\u2014\n\n(i) to the board by which the teacher is employed; and\n\n(ii) to the superintendent, if any; and\n\n(iii) to the attendance officer.\n\n(4) The board may take such action as it deems necessary with regard thereto.*\n\nThe policy of the department in requiring principals to report immediately and not to take hasty action without receiving full information concerning all the circumstances, is in keeping with the spirit of the Alberta Act.\n\nI believe the reason for this requirement will be apparent when you know that it is the department's policy to give priority to the admission to residential schools of children whose home conditions are unsatisfactory. For this reason, among your pupilage there will be many children from broken homes, children who are orphaned and other underprivileged children whose discharge from the residential school presents considerable difficulties to the Superintendent of the Indian Agency concerned. In the case of Rose White, for example, her home conditions were so unsatisfactory that she had to remain at Edmonton during the past summer holidays. The sudden unexpected return of a pupil such as this may mean that she has to be returned to these unsatisfactory home circumstances, or that the Superintendent has no home for her. It is not the policy of the department to use our residential schools as institutions for correction, but we do wish them to\nserve pupils who, if left in their home environment, are likely to run into difficulties with the law. The department agrees that a principal cannot permit one or two pupils to undermine the discipline of his school, but before action is taken, there should be consultation with officials knowing the home circumstances. In some cases the use of the long distance telephone would certainly be warranted.\n\nIt is noted that the boys gained admission to the girls' dormitory through the fire escape door. This, of course, must not be locked, but this occurrence could be prevented by the placement on the door of a simple switch to close a battery-operated alarm system when the door is opened. The bell should be located in the Supervisor's room or where the opening of the door would be signalled to the staff.\n\nMay I say that I appreciate the frankness with which you wrote to me and the motives which led you to enter the service of our Indian people. I have learned of some improvements which you have already instituted at Edmonton, and I wish to assure you that the department values the contribution which you have already made through these to the cause of Indian education.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nJanuary 20, 1953.\n\nMr. H.H. Woodsworth,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\n405 P.O.

In the meantime, no action should be taken on placing him in any school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nNovember 17th, 1952\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Edmonton Indian Residential Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child .....................................................\nEnglish name ..............................................................

He was placed there with his two brothers by the Charles Camsell Indian Hospital. The grandmother was unable to care for the children and the mother was in the Camsell Hospital with T.B., as was Norman for sometime and until December 1952. The three children in the Edmonton Indian Residential School would have faced serious problems regarding care and the action of the Charles Camsell Hospital is appreciated.\n\nMr. F. Barnes, Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School took Norman knowing of the dispute over religious status. His action prevented the child being completely neglected. As you are aware the father and grandmother wish the children to attend the Edmonton Indian Residential School, the mother evidently opposes this.\n\nI recommend there is no other solution at the moment than leave Norman in the Edmonton Indian Residential School and, or, until the religious dispute is settled.\n\nH.N.

Bldg.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nWith reference to the December Quarterly Return for the Edmonton Indian Residential School, it is noted on checking the Return that the Principal has made several errors due to the fact that he is not familiar with the preparation of the Quarterly Return. It is our intention to bring certain facts to his attention for his guidance when preparing future Returns.\n\nForm I.A. 411 which accompanies every Quarterly Return should include the names of pupils who were not on previous Quarterly Returns, and it is intended to drop from future Quarterly Returns. During the Quarter there usually are a number of children who enter the residential school for the first time. The practice has been to add the names of these children at the end of the Quarterly Return under the girls and boys section as the case may be and include their names on Form I.A. 411. It is often decided during the Quarter that certain children should be discharged from the school but grant should be claimed for the quarter for which the Return is prepared; consequently these children are usually entered on Form I.A. 411 under the discharged group and their names are included on the Quarterly Return and grant claimed for them for the period they were in school during the Quarter. These children's names will be omitted from future Quarterly Returns.\nOn checking the December Return for the Edmonton School, it is noted that the Principal has included on Form I.A. 411 a number of children who were absent during part of the September Quarter and returned to school during the December Quarter. Please advise the Principal that it is not necessary to show the names of those children on Form I.A. 411. We are returning Form I.A. 411 for the necessary changes. It is necessary that the Principal insert the pupils' register numbers in all cases on the Return and on Form I.A. 411.\n\nIn several instances it is noted that the children were absent from residence for hospitalization, attending a funeral or other reasons. In such cases, the Principal must indicate the reason for absence and the date the pupil left the school and later returned to school.\n\nWith reference to pupil # 0356, the Principal has claimed thirty-one days grant and has indicated \"hospitalized last of September\". We have disallowed the grant as it is not clear the date this pupil was admitted to hospital. If the school is entitled to grant for this pupil, the Principal may claim grant for her on the March Return.\n\nPlease advise the Principal that he has made an error in addition on Page 3. The total for this page should have read 7320 rather than 5438.

Attached find form I.A. 411 submitted by Mr. F. Barnes, Principal, Edmonton Indian Residential School, completed as instructed.\n\nH.N. Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa, February 11, 1953.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Edna Phyllis Strongman\n\nThis family is from the Hobbema Agency in the Province of Alberta.\n\nAttached (marked \"A\") is an application signed by the mother requesting the admission of this girl to the Edmonton U.C. Indian Residential School. The application states that the family is of the Roman Catholic Faith. Mr. and Mrs. John Strongman were married in 1939 in the Manse of the United Church in Hobbema (Marriage Certificate marked \"B\" is attached).\n\nSuperintendent Wild states:\n\n\"In recent months John Strongman deserted his wife Emily and has taken on a common-law wife. This person is not known by the Hobbema Agency. It has been reported that Emily is seeking support from John for her children. Accompanied by her father, Fred Littlepoplar, Councillor, Sampson Band, Emily has taken steps to have her husband support the children and also to have her name placed on the Protestant list and that of Edna Phyllis in particular. Evidently all her children are in her custody.\"\nEdna Phyllis was baptized a Roman Catholic (Certificate of Baptism marked \"C\" is attached). The mother was baptized in the United Church Faith, (Certificate of Baptism marked \"D\" is attached). Regarding the father's religious connections Superintendent Wild states:\n\n1. The parents of John Strongman are listed as Roman Catholic.\n\n2. John Strongman is listed as Roman Catholic.\n\nIt would be appreciated if a ruling were given on Mrs. Strongman's request that her child be placed in the Edmonton U.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nDirector.\n\nAttach:\n\nMFT/HD\nCOPY\n\nOttawa, February 19, 1953.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO MAJOR MACKAY:\n\nReference your memorandum of February 11th, 1953, concerning Edna Phyllis Strongman, whose mother has applied for admission to the Edmonton U.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that, although the father is stated to be of the Roman Catholic faith, the marriage was performed before a U.C. Minister. Consequently, it cannot be said in this case that the mother, before marriage, would have agreed to educate her children in the Roman Catholic faith. No explanation is being given on the circumstances under which this child was baptised by the Roman Catholic Church. The father having deserted his wife, it would appear that the responsible parent is the mother who is not of the Roman Catholic faith and, consequently, I am of the opinion that the request of the mother for the admission of her daughter to the Edmonton U.C. Indian Residential School should be approved.\n\n(Sgd) Laval Fortier.\nREGISTERED MAIL\n\nFebruary 20, 1953\n\nMr. J.R. Wild,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alta.,\n\nPlease be advised that it has been ruled that Phyllis Edna Strongman may be admitted as a grant-earning pupil at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease arrange to have this girl placed in the above-mentioned school and instruct the Principal that he may claim grant for her from the date she entered the school.\n\nAttached, I am returning Certificates of Baptism for Phyllis Edna Strongman, Emily Little Poplar and Registration of Marriage for John Strongman and Emily Little Poplar.

She had lost the sight of her left eye when a child, and she had some enlarged glands on both sides of her neck which had not broken down. She remained at the school during the summer holidays. She complained of not feeling well on September 12th, and she was sent to bed by the Matron, and I examined her that morning at the school. Temperature was normal and pulse 80. She complained of a slight pain in her chest. Examination of her heart revealed some leakage in valves. I advised keeping her at rest and under observation. Between one and two o'clock that day I was called urgently to the school to see her. I was at the school in approximately one half hour and found her to be in very serious condition. She was suffering from Dyspnea, pain in chest, coughing slightly; she was cyanosed, very weak and pulse 140. Saved her life by administration of Morphine and Strychnin and sent her to the hospital. X-ray report in hospital was that her heart was enormously enlarged both to right and left and lungs were congested. She did not run a high temperature at any time. Her pulse rate the first two or three days was between 140 and 160 and respirations as high as 55. Her lung condition cleared up considerably. With rest, Digitalis and Morphine she remained fairly comfortable. Her liver increased in size and she later developed edema in the lower extremities and abdomen and a nephritis.\n\nDuring the past three weeks she had increased pain and was failing in strength.\n\nOn November 5th she developed a low grade erysipelas on her face.

Yes.\n\nDid they follow out your professional instructions? Yes.\n\nIf in either respect, you consider them to have been at fault, it is required that you express your carefully considered views as follows:\n\nG.R. Williamson M.D.\nI regret to report that Isaac Bird, pupil No. 202, of the Edmonton Indian Residential School died very suddenly at 9:10 A.M. Sunday morning. I was advised of his death by Rev.

Monday afternoon.\n\nThe father and brother of the deceased pupil arrived from their reserve by train Monday morning and both attended the inquiry. The Principal Mr. Woodsworth stated that at 5 A.M. Sunday morning the Matron Miss McDonald was called by some of the other pupils and that she at once called him and that when he arrived the boy was rigid, the Doctor had been called and the boy was given first aid until the arrival of the Doctor. Mr. Woodsworth stated that the boy came around and knew those around him, but afterwards had one or two attacks. The Doctor arrived at the school about thirty minutes after he was called and had the boy taken to hospital. Mr. Woodsworth also states that the boy was put to bed Saturday afternoon for his afternoon rest and that he ate a good dinner and supper on Saturday and that when he went to bed at about 7 P.M. Saturday night that he appeared to be in good health, the boy had not complained of any pains or of not feeling well. Doctor Williamson stated that upon his arrival at the school the boy was in a semi-conscious condition, he took the boy to the hospital in his car accompanied by Miss McDonald the Matron of the school, he arrived at the hospital about 5:45 A.M. the boy's pulse and heart rate was 72. Doctor Williamson stated that the boy did not complain of any pain but that it was quite possible that he was in pain. Doctor Williamson also stated that he had not seen the boy for about two weeks before when he examined a T.B. gland on the right side level of collar bone. The father of the boy stated that the boy had been subject to fits all his life, and that he had suffered with his stomach a great deal.\n\nPlease find enclosed Memorandum of inquiry into the cause and circumstances of the death of this pupil.

School.\n\nI left my home at about 10 A.M. on Saturday January 24th 1942. I live about two and one half miles from the scene of the accident. I was going to assist my son to build a barn; he lives one and one half miles from St. Albert, Alta. When I got to the bottom of the hill I saw it follow the road running East and West. I saw two boys coming down the hill on two small bob sleighs, and when I saw them I applied my brakes and one of the boys came under my car between the front and hind wheels; the other one stopped about one or two feet in front of the front wheel of my car. I jumped out of my car and picked up the boy that had gone under my car; he was about eight or ten inches from the back of the car. I put the boy into my car on the back seat and my wife held him until I got to Dr. Perier's at St. Albert, when we got to Doctor Perier's place I called the doctor right away, the doctor came out to see the child right away, the doctor then ran into the house to put on his overcoat and then came along with me to the hospital with the child; when we got to the hospital the child was put on a stretcher and was taken up to the operating room, that is all I know about it. My drivers License is No.15267.\n\nSigned. Jos Rouault\n\nWitness.\n\nG. G. Leight,\nIndian Agent.\n\"I am 55 years of age, and on June 26th, 1948 I left my farm 3 miles east of MacLaren to go by my own place near MacLaren, driving my Plymouth sedan Alberta license plate 7066, and accompanying me was my wife Mrs. V. McMillan.\n\nI was driving along the road about 30 miles per hour, and arriving at the intersection of the road leading south to the Indian School. Then that accident happened. I just saw three or little boys sliding down with a slight slope to my car, just in the middle of the road. I put the brake on, but all at once one of these boys went under the car between the front wheel and the hind wheel, and I opened the door, and got back behind the car, and I find the little boy lying there, so I picked him up, and I put him in the car and came to the aid of MacLaren, with his help, to hospital.\n\nThen I flew to the rope they were about 30 feet ahead of my car, the boy that went under the car also, from the south road and swung just beside my car; the other boy turned a little side.\n\nI was pretty near into the corner before I saw the boys, the boys were travelling somewhat faster than I was, so fast as I think.\n\nThe accident took place about 10:10 or 10:15 am, in whether was clear, and about a little later my wife was sitting in the front seat close to me.\n\nI have driver's license No. 18897\n\nThen I had the little boy in my arms, the other boys came close with their mother.\n\nThe other boy that went west and I stopped at the same time, and he stepped just in front of my car, about 2 feet in front of the car.\n\nMy car is insured for accidents.\n\nWitness: J.J. John / Upde. Joseph McMillan.\n\nG. C. Leight, Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Winterburn Agency,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\nCopy for your information.\n\nEdm. 26-1-48\nWHB/CH\n\nCommanding Edmonton Sub-Div.\nAt approx. 11:45 AM of the 26th Inst., a phone call was received by the author from Dr. ROULIN of St. Albert, from the Blackfoot Indian Reserve, Edmonton, that she had heard a young Indian boy from the above school had been hit by a car near the school, which is situated 2 miles East and 1 mile South of St. Albert, and that there was no chance of the boy living.\n\nOn receipt of this information I immediately accompanied by Const. Thomas Tapp, Detached to Highway Patrol, with Police car No. 1867, proceeded to watch the boy to investigate this matter. On arrival at the scene I met Const. Dr. ROULIN, and from him learned that one Joseph ROULIN, a farmer residing 5 miles East of St. Albert, whilst driving his car into St. Albert, had been in an accident with his car, and a sleigh upon which the above described was slung, on the highway 2 miles East of St. Albert; that the top of the boy's head was badly crushed in, brain matter was protruding, and the boy was bleeding badly from the brain; that there was no hope of his recovery, and his death would be expected at any time. Dr. ROULIN had brought the boy to the Dr. Office at St. Albert, and from there he had been brought into the hospital by the Dr. and Dr. ROULIN in ROULIN'S car, which vehicle was in the hospital grounds, and ROULIN waiting for us in the hospital.\n\nI then contacted ROULIN, and from him learned the bare facts of the accident, which were to the effect that he was driving West towards St. Albert on the highway running East from St. Albert, when on arriving at the 2 mile point East of St. Albert, the South Road leading to the Indian School from that corner, as he arrived at the intersection, the Indian Boy, had come from the south road onto the East Road, on a small sleigh turned in due North Easterly Direction towards his car. He ROULIN had fully applied his brakes, and turned to his right to avoid the boy, but the boy had gone underneath the car between the front and rear wheels, and he suspected had been run over with the rear wheels, as he had the car stopped practically as soon as the boy hit the car, but when he got out and ran back, the boy was lying at the back of the car, just beside the rear of the right rear fender. He had then picked up the boy, and rushed him to Dr. ROULIN'S office; and from there to the hospital.\n\nBefore leaving the hospital, I thoroughly examined ROULIN'S car which was a 1946 Plymouth sedan, and found it to be in perfect shape, the brakes in same being in perfect condition, even, and full holding pressure also to save time, and as this accident had taken place fairly an hour or more by this time, and I wanted to examine the scene before all marks were obliterated, I requested Const. Richards to proceed to the hospital and take pictures of the car, as Dr. ROULIN was proceeding with me to the scene of the accident, and the Dr. himself returning to St. Albert, with ROULIN'S car.\n\nPatrol was made to the corner above noted and the scene of the accident investigated, which resulted in the following picture of the accident being found.\n5. The deceased along with the following Indian boys, namely, Richard Norman, Gordon Snowchild, James Johnson, Oscar Hudson, Billy Lapinack, Howard Skinner, Bobbie Stember, Billy Johnson, and Herbert Harris, all boys residing at the Indian Residential School, Rama's Baral, and all between 9 and 15 years of age, were sleighing down a steep incline on the highway which runs from South to the Indian School, from the East and West Highway, East of St. Albert, from the 2 Mile Corner, from which corner the highway South has a steep upgrade for approx. 700 feet, and both roads being covered with snow a coating of ice, makes a great allusion slide for the boys, the bad feature being that they do not stop before reaching the East and West Highway, but cross over onto the North Highway, and down into the field on the other side of the East and West Highway, sometimes they turn to the East or West, and continue along that Highway. At the South East corner, running to the South and to the North, there is heavy and high brush, making this corner absolutely blind, and any person proceeding West, can not see anything on the South Highway until he is right up in line with the North and South fence lines, and since the boys were close to the ground, the situation is very much worse.\n\n6. The deceased was the first to start down, with Oscar Jackson being the second, and the others starting a second or so later. The deceased on reaching the corner, turned to the East, and arrived at the intersection, was practically at the same time as Richard Norman, who was proceeding his sleigh about 30 miles per hour, although the track would tend to show that his speed was slower than that, but on stopping the boy immediately applied his brakes hard, and turned his sleigh to his right (to the North), the car stopping just as the right front wheel rested on the shoulder of the highway. The boy were riding small horse made sleighs, with steel runners and the deceased was riding being one of the largest, and a rather heavy sleigh, with wide steel runners, and as the road was a steep down grade, long, and covered with ice, the speed of these sleighs could be I would judge about 30 mph. Which speed would naturally intend to keep the sleigher's head down to break the wind, and therefore no watch ahead would be kept for cross traffic, indeed this point was backed up by questioning the other boys later, as they admitted that they did not look for traffic, but when going down the hills, they were obliged to each other to keep clear of each other owing to their speed, and once reached the bottom nearest together, they would split to clear each other's sleigh. The deceased and Jackson therefore split, which resulted in the sleigh the deceased was riding not the horse on just about the last line of the intersection, on the North side of the highway with the sleigh meeting the car, that above the front end of the left running board, the sleigh rope caught only the frame of the left running board, which stopped it there, and the boy kept on going, underneath the running board, which his head cleared, but the frame of this car provides towards the ground, about 4 to 6 inches lower than the running board, and his head would therefore smash against this frame, which of course caused the injuries he received, smashing the top of his skull in, this then stopped his forward movement, and the car still proceeding ahead for a few feet more, the rear wheels (\"off\") passed over his legs, breaking same, the car stopping just after this, and the boy's body stopping where it did just to the rear of the car, nearer the right rear wheel.\n\n7. The other boy Jackson also kept proceeding across the highway, and he stopped about 2 feet in front of the car, both his sleigh and the car stopping at practically the same second, Norman at the time thought that this boy was also under the car, but luckily this did not happen although it was a very close call.\n\n8. From the top of the hill, the boys can not see an part of the East and West road, and here again the situation is the same as when proceeding West, the corner to the East is blind until one is just about at the fence line, making in other words a very bad, and dangerous corner, at any time, without including the matter of children using\nI am 69 years of age, and on June 26th, 1948 I left my farm 5 miles east of Shellburne to go to my own place near Shellburne, driving my Plymouth sedan Alberta, license No. 69-375, and accompanying me was my wife Mrs. V. M. McMillan.\n\nI was driving along the road about 20 miles per hour, and arriving at the intersection of the road leading south to the Indian School. Then that accident happened. I just saw these two little boys sliding down with a sleigh close by my car, just in the middle of the road. I put the brake on, and all at once one of these boys went under the car, between the front wheel and the hind wheel, and I opened the door, and saw both behind the car, and I find the little boy lying down, and I picked him up, and I put him in the car and came to the R.C.A.F. at Shellburne, with him, to Edmonton.\n\nThe first time the boys they were about 30 feet ahead of my car, the boy that went under the car ran from the north west and west east towards my car, the other boy almost a little more.\n\nI was going very fast before the accident, but after the boys, the boys were travelling considerably faster than I was, so fast as I was I didn't see them.\n\nThe accident took place about 10:10 or 10:15 a.m., the weather was clear, and a little foggy, my wife was sitting in the front seat close to me.\n\nI have a driver's license No. 18867.\n\nThen I had the little boy in my arms, the other boys came close with their sledges.\n\nThe other boy that went west and I stopped at the same time, and he stepped inside in front of my car, about 5 feet in front of the car.\n\nMy car is insured for accidents.\n\nWitness J.

This would be approximately 14:00 p.m. I therefore contacted Mr. SMITHWAITE, Chief Coroner, giving him all particulars of the accident, and he informed me that he did not think that an Inquest would be necessary, but asked that Mr. ROBINSON, who is coroner for St. Albert, would proceed out to the scene of the crash and investigate same; give him a report, and if his report was as mine, the investigation would be all that was necessary and Inquest would not be required.\n\nMr. ROBINSON was therefore contacted, and he proceeded to the scene, examined all tracks etc., and reported to Mr. SMITHWAITE, who instructed Mr. SMITHWAITE, after receiving this report that an Inquest would not be necessary, as the accident was purely accidental, and no blame could be placed on ROBINSON.\n\nThe body of the boy on instructions of Mr. WOODSORTH was taken over by ROBERT & MERRILL Undertakers, and is being held by them pending final instructions of Parish from Mr. LAIGHT, Indian Agent, in whose district the School is situated.\n\nThe boy's parents are of the Saddle Lake Indian Reservation, his father being Francis SHAW of that Reserve, and he has been notified of the matter by the Agent at that point, by Mr. Laight, and it is in accordance with the Indian Act, for an enquiry to be held by the Indian Agent into such matters, this enquiry will take place at 10:00 am on Monday the 26th Inst., at the \"main School,\" with Mr. LAIGHT presiding, the writer will be in attendance, on request of Mr. LAIGHT, when such my evidence of investigation will be submitted, such request granted by instructions received.\n\nThe deceased is 10 years of age, has been at the School since 1896, and his father is a full blood Indian.\n\nReference to the plan, tracks of the car show for a long ways back, and show that gradually easing over to the right of himself, determined with slight brake pressure being applied, thus as they came about reach the North and South fence line, the brake was fully applied, which makes up the statement of ROBINSON, that was he close near each fence he slows down, drives over to his right side of road, in order to protect himself and others should any traffic be coming on to the highway, and of course was just at the corner the boy rushed into view, he carried out the action already described.\n\nThe two gateways marked in the bottom of the plan, is the two gates used by the boys to continue the slide down the hill after crossing the East and West highway. Indeed the last gateway is really part of the fence taken down by them in order to make a longer slide.\n\nOwing to the foregoing therefore I respectfully submit that this accident was purely accidental, that no blame can be attached to the car driver, that no infractions or offenses was committed by him, and the matter be concluded by this report, as far as we are concerned.

Knight\nChairman\u2014Indian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that Joe Stamp, age 11 years, pupil No. 216, Edmonton Indian Residential School, died on January 24th, in the Misericordia Hospital in Edmonton, from the result of sliding under the motor car of one Jos. Rouault, of St. Albert, Alta.\n\nJoe Stamp was the son of Zaccias Stamp, of the Saddle Lake Indian Agency.\n\nI was advised of the accident at 11:35 A.M. by the Rev. Mr. J.F. Woodsworth, Principal of the school, and at 12:15 P.M., Mr. Woodsworth advised me that the boy had died. I arranged for an inquiry to be held at 10 A.M. Monday January 27th, 1942. On Sunday January 25th, I was advised by Mr. W.P.B. Pugh, Indian Agent, Saddle Lake Agency, that it would be impossible for the boy's father to reach Edmonton until the 2:15 train on Tuesday January 27th; I therefore changed the time for the inquiry to take place at 3 P.M. Tuesday January 27th.\n\nThe inquiry was attended by Zaccias Stamp, father of the boy, Dr. R. Porier, M.D., who had attended the boy, Corp. J. Muir, R.C.M.P. Police, Mr. Jos. Rouault, Rev. Mr. Woodsworth, Principal of the school, Mr. W.P.B. Pugh, Indian Agent, Saddle Lake Agency and myself.\n\nCorp. Muir produced a drawing of the scene of the accident also photos showing the position of the car when it came to a full stop, and other photos showing the condition of the road at the time of the accident. The photos are enclosed herewith and the drawing is being forwarded under separate cover to the Department. Corp. Muir explained the drawing and photos, and stated that the driver of the car had done everything possible to avoid the accident and that no blame could be attached to Mr. Rouault. I did not take a statement from Corp. Muir at the inquiry as he handed to me a copy of his report on the case and I considered that sufficient; this copy of Corp. Muir's report is attached to Form No. 414.\n\nA statement was taken from Mr. Jos. Rouault at the time of the inquiry and a copy is attached to Form No. 414. Doctor Porier's and Mr. Woodsworth's statements are embodied in Form 414.\n\nThe father Zaccias Stamp was given an opportunity to ask any questions when the statements were given, at the end of the inquiry I asked him if he was satisfied with the evidence given and he replied that he did not blame anyone but the school. I explained to him that I had given instruction that the boys were not to be allowed to toboggan down any hill on the public roads, and he was quite satisfied.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

It appears that the boys have been in the habit of using one of the roads near the school for a toboggan slide. At the foot of the hill another road crosses this road at right angles and unfortunately young Stamp arrived at the corner at the same time as an automobile. For your information I attach a copy of a letter which is being forwarded to the Rev. Principal of the Edmonton School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo.

Young Stamp came down the slide as the car of Joe Rouault, St. Albert, approached.\n\nRouault, according to Dr. Richard Paterson, who operated on the boy, and almost had his car stopped when the sled crashed between the front wheels and wheel. The boy's head struck the car frame, and the rear wheel.\n\nThe accident occurred about 10:35 a.m., and the boy was taken to St. Albert General Hospital and then into hospital at Edmonton, arriving at 11:00 a.m., but young Stamp died an hour and a quarter later from a fractured skull.\n\nNo hearing will be held.

It is apparent that the driver of the car, Joseph ROUAULT, is blameless in this unfortunate accident, and so the Chief Coroner has decided that no inquest is necessary.

KELLY\nSUIT.\nCommanding Edmonton S/D.\nSTATEMENT OF JOSEPH ROUAULT, R.R. 2 St. Alberts taken on above date.\n\n\"I am 59 years of age, and on Jan. 26th, 1942 I left my farm 5 miles East of St. Alberts to go to my son's place near St. Alberts, driving my Plymouth Sedan Alberta Lie No. 63-383, and accompanying me was my wife Mrs. V. ROUAULT.\n\nI was driving along the road about 30 miles per hour, and arriving at the intersection of the road leading south to the Indian School. When that accident happened, there were these two little boys climbing down a slight slope to my car, just in the middle of the road, past the bushes, and all at once one of these boys went under the car, between the front wheel and the hind wheel, and I opened the door, and ran back behind the car, and I find the little boy lying down, and I picked him up, and I put him in the car and came to the Dye at St. Alberts, with him to Dr. BORRIER.\n\nWhen I first saw the boys they were about 30 feet ahead of my car, the boy that went under the car came from the south road and swung East towards my car, the other boy turned a little West.\n\nI was pretty near into the corner before I saw the boys. The boys were travelling considerably faster than I was, as fast as I think.\n\nThe accident took place about 10:10 or 10:15 a.m., the weather was clear and Road a little icy. My wife was sitting in the front seat close to me.\n\nI have driver's Lie. No. 15547\n\nWhen I had the little boy in my arms, the other boy came close with their weights.\n\nThe other boy that went west and I stopped at the same time, and he stopped just in front of my car, about 2 feet in front of the car.\n\nMy car is insured for accidents.\n\nWitness J.J.

KELLY\nSupt.\nCommanding Edmonton Sub-Div.\nRe: Joe STAMP - Indian School, Edmonton\nSudden Death of Cont (3)\n\nPara. 8 Cont.\n\nOF CHILDREN USING, the highway for sliding, the addition of which made the highway a dangerous place for any traffic to travel on, at no matter what speed the vehicle was travelling, thereby placing any vehicle operator in a very bad spot.\n\n9. Photos, and measurements were taken by the writer and a plan drawn, and attached hereto, are copies of photos, and plan which alone shows that his accident was purely accidental, and no blame whatever can be laid against BOUQUET.\n\n10. Whilst interviewing the boys at the Indian School I was informed by phone by Mr. WOODSWORTH, J.P., Principal of the Indian School who was at that time at the Hop, that the boy had died; this would be Approx. 1400 p.m. I therefore contacted Dr. BRAITHWAITE, Chief Coroner, giving him all particulars of the accident, and he informed me that he did not think that an Inquest would be necessary, but asked that Dr. ROBERTS, who is coroner for St. Albert, proceed out to the scene of the accident and investigate same, give him a report, and if his report was as mine, the investigation would be all that was necessary and Inquest would not be required.\n\n11. Dr. ROBERTS was therefore contacted, and he proceeded to the scene, examined all tracks etc., and reported to Dr. Braithwaite. He was instructed by Dr. Braithwaite, after receiving this report that an Inquest would not be necessary, as the accident was purely accidental, and no blame could be placed on BOUQUET.\n\n12. The Body of the boy on instructions of Mr. WOODSWORTH was taken over by HOWARD & McBRIDE Undertakers, and is being held by them pending final instructions of Burial from Mr. LAIGHT, Indian Agent, in whose Dist. the School is situated.\n\n13. The Boys parents are of the Saddle Lake Indian Reservation, his father being Zacarias STAMP of that Reserve. He has been notified of the matter by the Agent at that point, by Mr. Laight, and as it is necessary under the Indian Act, for an Enquiry to be held by the Indian Agent into such matters, this enquiry will take place at 10.00 am. of Monday the 26th Inst. at the Indian School, with Mr. LAIGHT presiding, the writer will be in attendance, on request of Mr. LAIGHT, when my evidence of investigation will be submitted, such request granted by instructions received.\n\n14. The Decedent is 10 years of age, has been at the School since 1939, and his father is a full blood Indian.\n\n15. Reference to the plan, tracks of the car show for a long ways back, and show them gradually easing over to the right of highway, with slight brake pressure being applied, then as they reach about reach the North and South fence line, the brake was fully applied, which backs up the statement of BOUQUET, that when he comes near such corners he slows down, drives over to his right side of road, in order to protect himself and others should any traffic be coming on to the highway, and of course when just at the corner the boy rushed into view, he carried out the action already described.\n\nThe two gateways, marked in the bottom of the plan, is the two gates used by the boys to continue the slide down the hill after crossing the West and East Highway, indeed the East Gateway is really part of the fence taken down by them in order to make a longer slide.\n\n16. Owing to the foregoing therefore I respectfully submit that this accident was purely accidental, that no blame can be attached to the car driver, that no infractions or offenses was committed by him, and the matter be concluded by this report, so far as we are concerned. Further report will be submitted on conclusion of the Enquiry to be held by Indian Agent LAIGHT.\n\n17. Chief Coroner Dr. BRAITHWAITE requested that a copy of our report be forwarded to him, attached hereto is extra copy.\nThe deceased along with the following Indian boys, namely, Richard MORGAN, Gordon CROWCHILD, Oscar JACKSON, Billy LAPTACK, Howard STEINER, Bobbie STEINER, Dick CURRIE, and Herbert RABBIT, all boys residing at the Indian Residential School, Edmonton Rural, and all between 9 and 13 years of age, were sleighing down a steep incline, on the highway which runs South to the Indian School, from the East and West Highway, East of St. Albert, from the 2nd Corner, from which corner the highway South has a steep grade for approx. 100 feet, and both roads being covered with snow, a coating of ice, making the sleighing extremely hazardous for the boys, the bad feature being that they do not stop before reaching the East and West highway, but cross same, over the North Ditch, and down into the field on the North side of the East and West Highway; sometimes they turn to the East or West, and continue along that Highway. At the South East Corner, running to the South and to the East, there is heavy and high Brush, making this corner absolutely blind, and any person proceeding West, cannot see anything on the South highway, until he is right up in line with the North and South fence line, and since the boys were close to the ground, the situation is very much worse.\n\nThe deceased was the first to start down, with Oscar JACKSON being the second, and the others starting a second or so later. The deceased on reaching the corner turned to the East, and arrived at the intersection, practically at the same time as BOUULT arrived there with his car. BOUULT was proceeding his stated about 30 miles per hour, although the trucks would tend to slow him down, his speed was slower than that, but on seeing the boy he immediately applied his brakes hard, and turned his car to his right (to the North), his car stopping just as his right front wheel rested on the shoulder of the highway. The boy were riding small homemade sleighs, with steel runners and the one the deceased was riding being one of the largest, and a rather heavy sleigh, with wide steel runners, and as the road was a steep downhill grade, long, and covered with Ice, the speed of these sleighs would be I would judge about 30 m.p.h., which speed would naturally tend to keep the sleighs going down to break the wind, and therefore no watch ahead would be kept for cross traffic. Indeed this point was backed up by questioning the other boys later, as they admitted that they did not look for traffic, but when going down the hill, they were pushing each other to keep clear of each other owing to their speed, and reached the bottom nearly together, they would split to clear each other sleighs. The deceased and JACKSON therefore split, which resulted in the sleigh the deceased was riding met the BOUULT car just about the East line of the intersection, on the North side of the highway, and the sleigh meeting the car, just about the front end of the left running board, the sleigh rope caught onto the front of the left running board, which stopped it there, and the boy kept on going, underneath the running board, which his head cleared, but the frame of this car protrudes towards the ground, about 4 to 5 inches lower than the running board, and his head would therefore smash against this frame, which of course caused the injuries he received, smashing the top of his skull in, this then stopped his forward movement, and the car still proceeding ahead for a few feet more, the rear wheels (\"eft\") passed over his legs, breaking same, the car stopping just after this, and the boys body stopping where it did just to the rear of the car, nearer the right rear wheel.\n\nThe other boy JACKSON, also kept proceeding across the highway, and he stopped about 2 feet in front of the car, both his sleigh and the car stopping at practically the same second, BOUULT at the time thought that this boy was also under the car, but luckily this did not happen although it was a very close call.\n\nFrom the top of the hill, the boys can not see an part of the East and West road, and here again the situation is the same as when proceeding West, the corner to the East is blind until one is just about at the fence line, making in other words a very bad, and dangerous corner, at any time, without including the matter of children using\nAt approx. 11:00 AM of the 26th Inst., a phone call was received by the writer, from Dr. FORRIER of St. Albert, from the Misericordia Hosp., Edmonton, that the above named young Indian boy from the above school had been hit by a car near the school, which is situated 2 miles East and 1 mile South of St. Albert, and that there was no chance of the boy living.\n\nOn receipt of this information I immediately accompanied by Const. INTERS, went to Highway Patrol, with Police car Code No. 8247, proceeded to stated Hosp. to investigate this matter. On arrival at the Hosp. I contacted Dr. FORRIER, and from him learned that one Joseph ROUAULT, a farmer residing 5 miles East of St. Albert, whilst driving his car into St. Albert, had been in an accident with his car, and a sleigh upon which the above deceased was sleighing on the highway 2 miles East of St. Albert, that the top of the boy's head was badly crushed in, brain matter was protruding, and the boy was bleeding badly from the brain, that there was no hope of his recovery, and his death could be expected at any time. Mr. ROUAULT had brought the boy to the Dr.'s office at St. Albert, and from there he had been brought into the Hosp. by the Dr. and Mr. ROUAULT in ROUAULT's car, whose vehicle was in the Hosp. Grounds, and ROUAULT waiting for us in the Hospital.\n\nI then contacted ROUAULT, and from him learned the bare facts of the accident, which were to the effect that he was driving West towards St. Albert, on the highway running East from St. Albert, and on arriving at the 2 mile corner East of St. Albert, the South Road running to the Indian School from the corner, as he arrived at the intersection, the Indian boy, had come from the South Road onto the East road, on a small sleigh turned in North Easterly direction towards his car, he ROUAULT had fully applied his brakes, and turned to his right to avoid the boy, but the boy had gone underneath the car between the front and rear wheels, and he suspected had been run over with the rear wheels, as he had the car stopped practically at same time the boy hit it, but out of sight, he came out and ran back, the boy was lying at the back of the car, just inside the rear of the right rear fender. He had then picked up the boy, and rushed him to Dr. FORRIER's office and from there to the Hospital.\n\nBefore leaving the Hosp. I thoroughly examined ROUAULT's car which was a 1941 Plymouth Sedan, and found it to be in perfect shape, the brakes on same being in perfect condition, even, and full holding pressure, also to save time, as this accident had taken place fully an hour or more by this time, and I wanted to examine the scene before all marks were obliterated, I requested Const. Richard's to proceed to the Hosp. and take pictures of the car, as Mr. ROUAULT was proceeding with me to the scene of the accident, and the Dr. returning to St. Albert with ROUAULT's car.\n\nPatrol was made then to the corner above noted and the scene of the accident investigated, which resulted in the following picture of the accident being found.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS\n\nOUR FILE NO. 42-3637-1 H 1\n\nOTTAWA, March 3, 1942.\n\nReferred by direction of The Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nTO:\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nGAV/BT\n**RE FUNERAL OF Joseph Stamp**\n\n| Item                  | Description       | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|--------|\n| Casket x 5'           |                   | $20.00 |\n| Rec.

Leight's report of the Court of Enquiry held into the accidental death of a pupil by the name of Joe Stamp, son of Zac Stamp No.281 J. Seenum's Band. It is a matter of record that this same Indian Zac Stamp had his daughters die at the Edmonton School some two years ago of natural causes. You will well understand the attitude of this Indian when this boy met with the accidental death while toccoganing on a road off the Edmonton School premises, the boy running into a car and died within two hours.\n\nI proceeded to Edmonton on Jan 27th with Zac Stamp to attend the Court of Enquiry so that I would obtain a first hand knowledge of the accident at the same time assure myself that Stamp was satisfied that it was a pure accident and that he would not have any resentment towards the school authorities. I am of the opinion that Stamp is aware that all was done to assure him of very fair Court of Enquiry and that an Indian's rights have been respected.\n\nI asked Stamp what he would like done with the corpse and he stated he would like to have the same sent back to Saddle Lake for burial. I mentioned to him that this was not in accordance with the department's instructions but that I thought under these most extenuating circumstances (and I can assure the department they were) the department would pay the account.\n\nI am satisfied that all of the Indians are satisfied that Stamp received courteous treatment and that no ill feelings are felt towards the Edmonton School. I might also mention that Mr. Woodworth was very kind and considerate.\n\nIn regards to the voucher in my favor in the sum of $2.00, as Stamp was hard pressed for cash I gave him this to assist in his out of pocket expenses and the payment rests entirely with the generosity of the department. I would however ask you to make payment of Howard & McBride's Ltd.

Church, I beg to recommend that Esquimau's School, in addition to being a day school, be also admitted by the Department as a boarding school.\n\nOwing to the distance that some of the members and adherents of this Church reside from the day school, it is impossible for them to send their children.\n\nIf children are to be compelled to attend school, I think that reasonable accommodation should be provided for them.\n\nI would more urgently recommend this form of school from the fact that on several occasions I have endeavoured to dissuade the\n\nThe Assistant\nIndian Commissioner\nRegina,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCoehtoie\nCatholics from building a day School on the northern part of Swampy's Reserve, where they associate Methodists are pretty equally divided as you are also aware.

Clark\nIndian Agent\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Erminskin Boarding School, I beg to state that I consider that it is very much to be deplored that there appears to be a hitch about the money grant which we expected would be forthcoming for the maintenance of the school.\n\nFrom your letter No. 010, of the 1st March, I took it for granted that arrangements were being made by you to put this school on a per capita basis, and as the Church had secured the services of an excellent staff of teachers and as it was very noticeable that the children were making very rapid progress, especially in the English language, and also such work as will be a permanent benefit to them after they leave the school, I assisted Rev Father Gabillon in selecting, from those families who live at too great a distance to attend the day school, to the number of twelve pupils.\n\nNow the school have on their hands those twelve pupils without any means of clothing them, and only receive a very small portion of the provisions required for them to live on, from the Department.\n\nWith\n\nThe Asst Indian Commissioner.\n\nRegina.\nWith these facts before you, I hope that you will see your way clear to supply the school with the ordinary money grant, which the promoters expected; however should you not be able to do this, then it seems to me that the Department should grant them a sufficient amount of clothing and provisions which would be the equivalent of the per capita grant, until the money is forthcoming.\n\nI understand that this has been done in other parts of the Territories under similar circumstances.\n\nI am, etc.\n\nsgd D.L. Clink.\n\nInd.

In the meantime provisions may be issued to an amount equivalent to a per capita grant of $50, as was done in the case of other schools similarly situated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Supt.-Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nIndian Agents Office,\nHobbema Agency, March 10th 1896.\n\nRef: Letter 26th February 1896 No 015.\n\nI beg to say that I regret very much that our application for the increased number of pupils for Ermin-skins Boarding School was too late to be placed in the Estimates, could you not have it placed in the supplementary Estimates.\n\nA new building is, I understand, to be erected in the spring which will accommodate considerably more than forty pupils.\n\nThe staff will be quite able to take charge of even more than the number asked for. There is probably no other school, of this class, nearer the line of Railway, in the Territories than this one, hence we will in all probability have from time to time a large number of distinguished visitors from the East.\n\nNow when you consider that we will have the building and the staff and that the Government has to feed and clothe those children in any case, why not add them to the school and have a proper training that they may have a better chance in life.\n\nYours, etc.\n\nsgd D.L.

These nuns, in order to procure what was necessary for their boarding pupils, have been obliged to incur considerable debt, and declare that they can no longer continue this system. They pray you then to arrange that the grant which you allow them be made in money instead of being in kind.\n\nYou have heard, yourself, in what manner they are obliged to live, they and the children who are intrusted to\nto them, it would only be right that the Department granted at least to their school the means of supporting viz:- what they grant to other institutions of this description, $72.00 in money per child, each year.\n\nI trust, sir, that you will do all in your power to grant their request.\n\nYours, etc.\n\nsgd J.O. Perrault, Priest.\nOTTAWA 18th July 1896\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from the Rev. Father Perrault, Principal of Brimskin's Boarding School, Bobbema Agency asking for a money grant for this school; and in reply I beg to say that an item was included in the Estimates for this year to provide for 20 pupils at $72 per cap: but the Department is at present unable to say whether the same will be passed by Parliament or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nstrong physique.\n\nThe improvements therefore that I think are most urgently needed are:\n\nI.

A chance to play in all kinds of weather outside of both school-room and dormitory E.G. In a well furnished gymnasium.\n\nThese additional privileges, with what they have, and all properly used, should, I think warrant a far greater degree of health among children attending that institution than could be found among those on the Reserves.\n\nHoping this may commend itself to you and the Department I remain, etc.\n\nsgd E.M. Sharpe M.D.\nin the rooms. The ventilation is very poor. In the school room the only means for it are the doors and windows, while in the bedrooms there is only one window for each. This is kept open at night during the summer, but owing to the strong draughts, that a wind may cause that mode of ventilation is not always desirable, while in winter it is quite objectionable.\n\nIf those beds were filled, and the windows closed, as they would likely be, at least in the coldest weather, by morning the rooms must contain such foul air as to very much increase the susceptibility to tuberculosis.\n\nI found present fifteen pupils (6 boys and 9 girls) but was told there were often more. They are kept in the school room five hours each day (9--12 & 1--3.30, less 2 recesses of 15 minutes each) In cold weather they are in the building about all the time. Now I think this is a great drawback to any school. I remember when a boy in a country school, that when we could not play outside doors during recess and at noon we made the school room very dusty. How much worse must it be for children who have to live in that house all the time. If they play they raise a dust, just the thing to cause weak lungs and if they don't play they suffer for want of that exercise necessary to develop a good strong\nstrong physique.\n\nThe improvements therefore that I think are most urgently needed are:\n\nI. More room in sleeping apartments.\n\nII. A better means of ventilation E.G. A pipe from each room to acupola and controlled by a trap or grate.\n\nIII. A chance to play in all kinds of weather outside of both school-room and dormitory E.G.

Sharpe M.D.\nIn July 25th I visited the Reserves of Hobbema Agency, and as you requested (No 0130) I send you a report of the R.C. Boarding School from a hygienic standpoint. The school is nicely situated on elevated ground with good surroundings. The building is a wooden structure about thirty feet square, finished inside with wooden ceilings and walls. In the first flat were two large rooms, one for school purposes and furnished with homemade desks and benches. The other room was furnished as a reception room. Upstairs there were four rooms for sleeping apartments containing in all twenty-five beds. In the boys' room there were twelve beds in girls seven, a third one contained three beds for nuns, while in the fourth were three beds and washing accommodation. All was clean tidy and well kept. The ceilings downstairs were a very good height, but in the upper flat they are too low for so many to be sleeping.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, No. 117201/I, re arrears of provisions due to the Ermineskin Boarding School and to say that I beg to recommend the payment of the same.\n\nThe vouchers are returned in their unopened form under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to draw your attention to Voucher 16 Vote 7, Hobbema Agency, for the year 1897-98, which is for a payment to the Rev.

Owing to a shortage in the supplies it was found impossible to carry out this arrangement in its entirety. The School Authorities submitted a Voucher for provisions, etc., the value of which was equivalent to what they would have received had the Department issued the supplies, and their claim being just the Voucher (which amounted to $187.27) was paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Auditor General,\nOttawa.\nExcl.\n\nOttawa 8th December, 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith copy of the statement showing supplies issued to Erminskin's Boarding School, July 1st 1895 to July 1st 1896, and also copy of the statement of supplies issued to that Institution from 1st July 1896 to 1st July 1897; and I have to request that you will explain why the School has taken credit for the four pupils in 1896-7, as a cash grant was drawn during July 1896 for 20 pupils, which is the maximum number with which the Department can be charged.\n\nIt is observed that for 1895-6 the School has only taken credit for 20 pupils, while there appears by the Return to have been 31 in attendance.

The ventilation has been installed according to the demands of the Department.\n\nThe Sisters have a separate hospital for pupils who might be attacked by infectious diseases, and it seems to me that the school has a right to the increased grant.

However, as you are aware, one of the requirements for a school of this class is that it shall be built on a stone or cement foundation, with a light and airy basement the full size of the main building with a cement floor, and another is that there shall be a modern heating apparatus, hot water, steam or hot air. The condition of the foundation timbers of the present building is such that the Department doubts whether it is practicable to place a proper foundation under the structure. If, however, you will submit plans showing how it is proposed to put in this foundation and heating plant; then, if considered satisfactory, the Department will upon your assurance that the work will be at once undertaken and carried continuously to completion allow the grant of $125.00 and will make this grant payable from the first of April, last.

Moulin, O.M.I.\nHobema 1st October 1915\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThis year, after the holidays, we had many new children at the Boarding School. As you may see by the last report, we have an average attendance of 49 and would have so, had the little Eliza Johnson, adopted child of the councillor Saddleback been admitted in time.\n\nWe have yet one more pupil, which makes our number 51. Some Indians are also willing to place their daughters at school, and in the first of December I could have two or three more pupils. But we are only authorised for fifty.\n\nDear Sir, you have visited yourself our school, the reports of the Inspectors have always been very favorable, often highly satisfactory. In consideration of this, could you not, Dear Sir, grant us the favor to be authorized by the Indian Department to receive in our Boarding School sixty (60) pupils instead of the present number of 50 fifty, consequently to receive the grant of money for all the children who would then be admitted to the school by the Department.\n\nI think also we have the cubic air space required for sixty or near sixty children. We have two class rooms, one = 44 x 24 x 12 ft., a second 22 x 22 x 12 ft.\n\nBoys Dormitory 44 x 24 x 12 ft. Girls Dorm. 48 x 44 x 9 ft.\n\nHope, Dear Sir, to receive from the Indian Department a favorable answer to my request for the benefit of our B.

Not long ago I visited this school and saw that the Rev. Principal had to refuse children because he was authorised for 50 only. You know as well as myself, how hard it is generally to induce Indians to bring their children to school, and it seems a great pity to have to refuse them when they are well disposed.

Father Grandin for an increase in pupilage at the Ermineskins Boarding School I beg to say that a similar application was made last October by the Rev. Father Moulin, the Principal of the school, which was not allowed for lack of funds. Since then the Birtle and Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding schools have been allowed to take an additional number of grant earners.\n\nReports received show that the Ermineskins School is doing good work and a memorandum prepared by Mr. Chene shows that there is ample accommodation for the additional number of pupils asked for, both in the class-rooms and dormitories.\n\nThere are four reserves in the Hobbema Agency and the total number of children of school age is 143. There is an improved day school on the Samson's Reserve, but there are no day schools on the other three reserves.\n\nFather Grandin asks that the pupilage be increased from 50 to 60 or at least to 55. There are 50 now enrolled and the school can accommodate 63. Would\nthe Department allow an increase of five, making 55 pupils allowed for this school.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nApril 5th 1916.\n\nDear Father Grandin,\n\nThe best we can do for the Ermineskin school is to grant an increase of five pupils and I have given instructions to that effect. I am sorry that our funds are so limited this year that we cannot increase the pupilage to any greater extent.\n\nWith best wishes, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

School.\nIndian Office Winnipeg,\nOct. 4th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nWhen I returned to Red Deer I called on Inspector Markle and the following morning September 12th, I took the train for Hobbema where Dr. Welker of Letaskiwin met me and we went through the Institution there. This Institution struck me as being about the most unique one that I have ever come across in my travels. It is thoroughly up-to-date without having bread mixers and washing machines, so the children can be educated into the ways which will be the most beneficial for them for their future environment.\n\nO.I.Grain.\nHonored Sir,\n\nLast year, on the recommendation of Rev. Father Grandin O.M.I., you authorized us to receive in our Boarding School 55 pupils, 5 more than previously.\n\nI am this year again compelled to make you a similar request and beg from your kindness to give us the grant for 60 pupils. We have already them present in our school, and if authorized I will forward you the forms for their admission with the certificate of the Doctor.\n\nI am sure you know how sometimes it is a hard question to have the Indian children at school; therefore when they are anxious to come I cannot but be pleased to accept them.\n\nI may say, the way our school is kept (cleanliness and the devotion of the Rev. Sisters to the children) is certainly a great inducement for the Indians to have their children at our school.\n\nWith the hope to have soon a favorable answer to my demand\n\nI remain, Honored Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nP.

This allows plenty of room for the additional number asked for.\n\nThe school is doing good work and Mr. Inspector Markle in his last report, which was made on the 26th ultimo, states as follows,- \"Class work is satisfactory.

The Doctor gave instructions to have the cases quarantined in the ward adjoining the school.\n\nThe school was visited by the Doctor on the 1st of March, and all pupils in good health, the cases of measles developed since that date.\n\nI might also report that there are a few cases of measles on the different reserves, also a few cases of illness of long standing. The Doctor has visited all cases reported, and who have requested medical attendance.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nErminston Boarding School\nHobema 20th November 1920\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nA few days ago we had the visit of our Inspector Mr. Christiansen from Regina. He told us that the new compulsory law for schooling the Indian children was to be put in force and therefore all the children from 7 to 15 years of age would have to go to school.\n\nOur Boarding School (Erminston P.) is only authorized for 60 pupils as you may know by the reports. Even if all the children of age for school belonging to our denomination (R. Cath.) are to come to school we will have to find or make place for about 50 more children at the present we have our full number even 61 present.\n\nIf really this new law is to be executed we should be advised by the authorities and as my superior told me:\n\nWill the Indian Department grant us authorization for one hundred (100) or more pupils provided we build an addition to our present Boarding School?\n\nWe would be ready and willing to make such an expense if we are made certain that the Indian Department will grant us such an increase in the number of our pupils and if the department will also oblige all children of school age and good health to come to school.\n\nIt will be a very good step for the advance of the Indians.\n\nPlease, Honorable Sir, accept my most respectful salutations.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev.

In reply I beg to say that it is not possible for me to make a definite promise at the present time. This large increase would involve a considerable sum of money which would have to be provided by Parliament, as the vote for Indian Education as it now stands would not bear this extra call upon it. I shall, however, endeavour to have the necessary funds provided at the next session of Parliament and if successful will communicate with you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. P. W. Moulin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nErmineskin's Boarding School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nRegina, December 7th, 1920.\n\nTo W.M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHere there are 33 girls and 27 boys. Examination of these children showed none requiring surgical or hospital treatment. There are no cases of suppurating glands of the neck or other parts and though fully 50% have enlarged glands of the neck they would not be looked upon as requiring anything more than good hygienic surroundings, food and fresh air to become cured. There are no children in the school who should be sent home though four boys and three girls are found to be below par in general condition, are anaemic and have enlarged glands, but I believe the extra care now being given them viz; extra diets of milk and eggs, cod liver oil and iron tonics, and their being kept out of doors as much as possible, should be sufficient to bring them up to a standard of good health. The eyes are in good condition, though in the case of four pupils the usual bathing with Boric acid solution and the occasional use of Argyrol are necessary to keep them in good condition. Two pupils have blindness of one eye from infantile infections and two others have partial blindness for the scar of an old ulceration of the cornia long ago healed.\n\nThe teeth of all are passably good, and none are showing signs of any active involvement of the lungs.\n\nThe General health, weight and color of the pupils of this school are fully up to the standard.\n\nThe building itself is an old one but fairly good, is kept very clean and is fairly light and airy.\nThe dormitories are now somewhat crowded. Thirty-three now sleep in one room where the maximum capacity should be 28. The windows are very small though fairly numerous and the ceiling is a foot or two lower than is desirable. There are several fairly good balconies but they are not used as much as they should be. The addition of a modern building to the one now in use is very desirable as the present capacity is overtaxed and there are still a number of children on the reserve not attending school. The present building is too good to be condemned but in time should be replaced by one more modern.\n\nF. A. Corbett, M.D.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask., Dec. 5, 1920.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe situation at Hobbema is very satisfactory, although the School and Dormitories are not what you would call ideal; however, I do not consider the children's health is in any way impaired through attending the School. The building is old, but kept spotlessly clean - and above all, the children are well clad and well fed - I understand there are between forty and forty-five Roman Catholic children still on the Reserves at this Agency, who are not attending School. A request was made to have additional accommodation provided. This matter will no doubt have to receive the attention of the Department at an early date, as educational facilities will have to be obtained.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nCommissioner.\n\nDeGroot, Sec.,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nHonourable Sir James Lougheed,\n\nI beg to send herewith important reports from the Indian Commissioner and Doctor F. A. Corbett, of Regina.\n\nWhen I was in Regina last summer I had an interview with Doctor Corbett, and it was arranged that he should make these inspections. Doctor Corbett is greatly interested in the welfare of the Indians, and his report justifies the inspection.\n\nI regret extremely that it is possible to draw such a comparison between the Protestant and Roman Catholic schools. The Crowfoot, Arminekin's and St. Albert schools are all conducted by the Roman Catholic Church, and the Old Sun's and Sarcee are conducted by the Church of England. The comparison does not hold good over the whole field, however, as we have excellent protestant schools in other parts of the country. The Anglican schools in the diocese of Calgary have always unfortunately been badly managed.\n\nThe conditions at the Old Sun's school are disgraceful, and the principal and medical attendant are worthy of serious censure for allowing such health conditions to exist.\n\nAs you are personally aware of the general conditions at the Sarcee reserve, this additional information with reference to the school and the Indians there will be of special interest. If this land is to be saved at all we must take vigorous measures and I would propose to turn the school into a hospital and to treat the whole reserve as a hospital area. These Indians have a large reserve and more of it should be turned into cash as soon as possible and used for their benefit, and the funds we have on hand should be fully used.\n\nIt would be advantageous if Doctor Corbett could continue his inspections and visit all our reserves and schools, but as he has a large practice in Regina, I do not think we could expect him to spend the necessary time in making inspectorial visits.\n\nI should like to discuss these matters with you.\n\nDuncan G. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\n548486\n\nOttawa, February 15, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nRev. Father Moulin, Principal of the Indian Boarding School on Ermineskin's Reserve, has asked if it would be possible to have the Department pay for the erection of a telephone line from the school to the Agency headquarters, which would then give him connection with the Rural System.\n\nThe material used in connection with this work would be fifteen posts and sufficient wire for three-quarters of a mile of line.

(Since last spring only 1922 we have been authorized to take 70 pupils, 10 more than before for what I am very thankful.) If all the children of school age belonging to our denomination, i.e., R. Catholics, are to come to school, we will have to make place for about 50 more pupils. If this law is to be put in force we should be advised by the authorities and then will the Indian Department grant us authorization for about 100 to 120 pupils provided we build a sufficient addition to our Boarding School?\"\n\nWe were at the time thinking of enlarging the school. We were speaking of\nbuilding in order to accommodate 25 to 30 more pupils.\n\nSince then, speaking with his Grace, the archbishop of Edmonton, R.R. O'Leary who is our superior, he encouraged us to build a certain addition if the Indian Department be willing to give us, when we are ready, the grant for about 100 pupils.\n\nFurthermore, he said it would be better and more just to ask the Indian Department to build at its own expense as it is for the interest and the advancement of its wards, or at least to grant us a certain sum for the building.\n\nIn fact, after an examination of the number of R.Catholic children of school age, I find that on Louis Bull's Reserve there are 8 children of our denomination, and only 3 are enrolled in our Boarding School.\n\nOn Eymunski's Reserve there are about 48 children, only 17 in the school; some of the others are coming as day scholars although we have no day school authorized for them.\n\nOn Jamson's Reserve there are about 46 children of ours, and 34 of them only at school.\n\nFrom Montana Band on 9 catholic children 5 only are in.\n\nTotal: 89 children in school and about 69 out of school.\n\nHonorable Sir, I expose these facts and desiderata to you, with the sincere hope that something in the near future will be done in order to give more\naccommodation to a greater number of children; or the Indian Department will encourage us to build and assure us that we will be authorised for such a number as a hundred pupils, or yet better, that the Indian Department will grant us a sum for building purposes with authorisation to receive as many pupils as we can take in the school, or if necessary after taking up by pupils without authorisation, if you so desire, I shall myself will build a new house (School).

I have noted your request that the Department either enlarge the building at the Ermineskin Boarding School or arrange for a greater pupilage, in the event of the Church Authorities erecting an addition. I have also learned that there are a large number of Roman Catholic Indian children in the vicinity, that could be recruited for the institution.\n\nIn reply I regret to state that, as there are so many pressing claims on the Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education, it will not be possible for this Department to undertake building operations at Hobema at the present time. However, it is our earnest wish that there be a development in the work of educating the Indian children of Canada, and I am pleased to inform you that the pupilage of the Ermineskins Boarding School will be increased from 70 by any number up to 30 for which you may see fit to provide accommodation. Our inspectors will report on any new building that you may erect for the purpose of educating the Indian children, and you will be informed at that time of the exact pupilage allowed.\n\nI wish to add that every reasonable assistance will be given by our officers in recruiting pupils, if more accommodation is added by the Church Authorities.\n\nThis Department wishes you, the staff and the pupils of the Ermineskin Indian Boarding School the compliments of the Season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Moulin, D.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Boarding School,\nHOBEMA, ALTA.\nDear Sir,\n\nAlthough it was quite a while ago since I had your kind letter, I will not forget to thank you and the Indian Department for your willingness to increase the number of pupils in the Erminieton Boarding School, when the said school will provide for their accommodation.\n\nRecently I have seen my superiors and when the spring will be here we will start the enlarging of our school: 30 x 45 basement, main floor, 2 stories and attic. We hope to be ready in the month of August to receive a larger number of Indian children.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\nYours very thankfully and sincerely.\n\nRev. P.P. Moulin\nPrincipal of Erminieton B.D. School.\nOttawa, July 20, 1923.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the present building activity at the Ermineskin Indian Boarding School. I have noted that the cost of the addition, which is being erected by the school authorities, will be about $5,000 more than was planned at the outset.\n\nI believe that the Deputy Superintendent General is favourably disposed towards assisting with capital expense, when funds can be found or provided for the purpose. I wish to suggest that all accounts and tenders be kept in order and that a statement concerning the activity, generally, be prepared. This could be brought to Dr. Scott's attention when you return from the West.\n\nI am pleased to state that the Department can arrange to grant an increase in pupilage in the immediate future, and I shall communicate with the Indian agent, with a view to arranging for such increase without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\n697 Mobermot Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, July 20, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has learned that an addition is being constructed at the Ermineskin Indian Boarding School. I should be pleased if you would indicate the nature of the addition and the extra classroom and dormitory accommodation for both boys and girls. This information is needed, so that we can intelligently increase the pupilage at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. G. Askey, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask., June 14, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nErmineskin Boarding School.\n\nThe church authorities are building a new addition to the school; work had commenced at the time of my visit to the reserve. The size of the new building is 35 x 45; three story, with full size basement. The ground floor of this building is to be utilized for two classrooms; the second floor for Boys' dormitories, and the third floor for the Girls' dormitories. The building will be modern-steam heated, running water, and electric lights. The estimated cost is $15,000.00.\n\nI examined the classroom work, and according to the register there are twenty-five children in grade one, twenty-four in grade two, nine in grade three, and nine in grade four, and six in grade five. I might say that this is an exceptionally well-conducted school. The building throughout is well kept and everything in perfect order. The children look healthy and are well-fed and well-clothed. The classroom work is good. The children in the senior classes, especially, are bright and alert, more so than in any other Indian classroom I have visited. I have no hesitation in saying that the school is doing a good work among the Indians.\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\u2014 In compliance with the instructions of your letter No. 112-1-I dated the 20th instant, referring to the addition which is being constructed at Ermineskin's Boarding School. I have the honor to report as follows:\n\nThe addition is a frame building 34 x 45 - three stories and basement. In the basement there will be a furnace room and play room for the children.\n\nFirst floor, two class-rooms 22 x 34 each. Second floor has a dormitory for boys, 34 x 45, and the third floor has a dormitory for girls, 34 x 45.\n\nThe present school provides accommodation for 70 pupils, and with the addition it should be sufficient for at least one hundred pupils.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 7, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 7 of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the addition provided by the Ermineskin Indian Boarding School.\n\nI have to inform you that, as from October first, next, the pupilage at this school will be increased. Per capita grant will be allowed up to, and including, 100 pupils, based upon the total actual attendance. Please inform the principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. G. Ankey, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nOttawa, August 7, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the pupilage at the Ermineskins Indian Boarding school has been increased to 100, as from October first, next.

A lien could be secured on the property in order to protect the rights of the Government.\n\nI enclose the accounts for the general contract and for the Plumbing and Heating and take the liberty of heartily recommending that a generous course be followed in this instance.\n\nHoping that a favourable answer will be given to the present request, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nNot a school\nThat I had visited\nas on the school trip\nIn 1920 the Rev. Principal of the Ermineskins Indian Residential School signified his intention of erecting an addition to the building and asked the Department to increase the pupilage. Favourable consideration was promised. In 1922 the Principal indicated that he had been requested by Archbishop O'Leary of Edmonton to ascertain if the Department would bear part of the capital expense and he suggested that, if we could not, he would like a definite promise of an increased pupilage. A per capita grant for 100 was promised if the addition was erected by the Church Authorities.\n\nLast year Father Guy drew your attention to the financial condition of the school. They had commenced an addition and found that the bills would run to at least $15,000, which was $5,000 more than they had intended. Financial assistance was requested. The Department required that all accounts and tenders be kept and that a statement concerning the activity be prepared.\n\nFather Guy has now presented accounts totalling $16,706.68 which refer to expenditure on the new wing. These bills have apparently been paid by the school management. The Oblate representative requests that we reimburse the Sisters of the Assumption, who appear to be the owners, and take a lien on the property to protect our equity. Father Guy suggests that this school be purchased by the Government eventually. As the main building is not modern I had not considered it as one the Department should purchase. When the school was built in 1897 and in following years the Department met capital expense amounting to more than $4,500.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, March 6, 1924.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th ultimo, with reference to a grant to assist the Erminekins Indian Residential School. I regret to inform you, in reply, that the appropriation for this fiscal year has been completely assigned and I am unable to give your request favourable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Jos Guy, O.H.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nRegina, Sask., April 3rd 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Scott;-\n\nI have just returned from the Province of Alberta, where I have been for nearly three weeks. I visited the Blood, Peigan, Sarcee, Blackfoot, Hobbema and Edmonton Agencies, and eight Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nHOBBERMA AGENCY.\n\nI visited the school, which is under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. I found everything in first class shape, the children well fed, well clothed and healthy. Since my last visit here the school has been almost doubled in size, and the building is now all that we require. I spoke to the Reverend Father of the necessity of giving the boys more outside training. There is no farm in connection with the Institution. I pointed out to the principal that if he would farm even 80 acres, and did it well and in a modern way, it would be a great benefit to these boys who are in their teens. The Father assured me he would do something in this line at an early date. The Government should arrange to have a piece of the Indian Reserve set aside for this purpose. It does not necessarily mean it should be bought. The Indians have more land than they can use. Let the school authorities have a quarter section.\n\n(Sgd.) W.M. Graham,\n\nIndian Commissioner,\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 22, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to refer to that portion of your general letter of the third instant, concerning the advisability of releasing a quarter section of the Indian reserve for the benefit of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. I should be pleased if you would take steps to have a suitable quarter section set aside for this purpose. A Resolution of the Band in Council should be secured, if possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., June 18th, 1934\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that when I visited the Ermineskin School last Fall, I found that the school had been teaching practically no Agriculture. This struck me as being entirely wrong, to have boys of 15 and 19 years of age discharged from the school and knowing absolutely nothing about plowing or the growing of grain. They might just as well have been attending day school, because they would get a certain amount of farm training at home.\n\nI understand that these Indian Boarding Schools are for no other purpose than for teaching the boys to become useful to their parents when they return home, and have a certain amount of knowledge of how to carry on farming.\n\nI discussed this matter with Father Moulin, the Principal, and he said that he would be glad to start a farm if they could get the land. I never thought for a minute that there would be any doubt about getting all the land he required, as this has never been questioned at other reserves. I instructed the Agent to see the Indians and get them to agree to hand over a certain amount for the purpose mentioned.\n\nDuncan J. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nIt appears now that Father Moulin told them he was not particular about undertaking the work of running a farm, as he was no farmer, and could not stand the expense of engaging an instructor, buying machinery, etc., and besides the boys had plenty of work at the school. This statement was made by the Indians to the Agent, who in turn went to Father Moulin who corroborated it; a most extraordinary action for the Principal to take, in my opinion.\n\nIs it your intention to insist on a certain amount of farming instruction being given at these schools or not? The matter should not end here.\n\nFor your information I may say that this school has four acres of garden, and 120 acres of pasture land.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, June 28, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Department that the older boys, pupils of the Ermineskins Indian Residential School, are receiving very little training in farming and other outside work. We understand that at present there are 4 acres of garden and 120 acres of pasture land in connection with the school. The question of having the Indians release one quarter section of the reserve for the benefit of the school is receiving consideration.\n\nI am sure you will see advantage to the boys after leaving the school in having a good general knowledge of farming operations, the care of stock and the raising of crops. The Department would therefore emphasize the value of a training in this work to the older boys and I have to request that this matter receives your attention and that you will make every effort to give the boys a good practical training in farm work. We are requesting the Indian Commissioner to endeavour to arrange with the Indians to set aside a quarter section of reserve land for the use of the school, in order that farming work can be carried on for the benefit of the school and for the instruction it will give to the boys.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you, outlining the plans which you can undertake to carry out the Department's wishes in arranging that the boys will receive a practical training in farming operations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. P. P. Moulin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nErmineskins Indian Res. School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nOttawa, June 28, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your No. 604-11A of the 18th instant, regarding the instruction the boys are receiving in farming at the Ermineskin Residential School. I am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter that is being directed to the principal in the matter. I note that you have instructed the agent to have the Indians set aside a certain amount of land from the reserve for school purposes. It is considered that a quarter section at least should be obtained from the Indians, if possible. I agree with you that it is very important that the Indian boys receive a practical training in farming operations, in order that they may have a certain amount of knowledge of farming to carry on after they leave school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nA few days ago I received your letter of the 28th of June requesting me to state what we could do for a better training of our older boys in farming and taking care of the stock.\n\nFor a few years past I have been thinking this question over knowing fully well the benefit that our boys could gain by it, the better renown of our school and as a means also to keep with us all our children.\n\nRecently the Indian agent by order from the Indian Commissioner asked the Indians to lease for 5 years the land for the use of the school. When I heard of the 5 years lease I told him I was not anxious about it at all and even would not accept it for only 5 years but as long as the school would be there. Moreover as the land asked for was in the settlement of some Indians it was voted down by the members of the Band.\n\nReally at the present time I do not see the possibility of going into the expenses of a farm. You know that last year we went into debts to the extent of $16,000.\nWe need a modern laundry system. Last year the washing by hand took nearly two days every week to the prejudice of the school work. We have asked and are yet asking the Department to grant us a more modern system of a Laundry.\n\nIt is why, dear Sir, we can not for the present go into other expenses for farming purposes, buying stock, of machineries, of fencing land.\n\nBut I may say, as soon as we can see clear through our debts we will take in hand this training of our pupils, even if we can not get land from the Indians we will take on our pasture 40 to 50 acres for this farming purpose.\n\nAlso if the Department would grant us the necessary implements, maybe we could very soon carry out the wishes of the Indian Department and our earnest desire to give our older pupils a very good training in all farm work.\n\nWith my regretful oblations,\n\nI remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. P. P. Moulis, A.M.,\nPrincipal, Erminville Residential School.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK. July 25, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter file 1-1 of the 28th ultimo with copy attached of the letter written by the Department to the Rev. P.P. Moulin, O.M.I., Principal of the Brineskins Indian Residential School, Hobema, to the effect that it is the wish of the Department that the boys attending that school should get practical experience in farming.\n\nI note that the Principal has been asked for a plan outlining what he intends to do in carrying out the wishes of the Department. As it is nearly a month since the latter has written, I presume a reply has been received by this time. I shall be pleased to hear what suggestions the Principal had to offer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.H. Craig,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C.

The Rev. Father Moulin has indicated his willingness to give some instruction to the older boys, but states that he is unable to meet the expense incidental to initiating such training. Some $15,000 debt was incurred last year in the erection of new buildings and the Rev. Principal hesitates to undertake a new activity without assistance. He is prepared to commence farming some forty or fifty acres of their present pasture, if the Department will grant implements and stock.\n\nI am favourably disposed to assisting the school management with this new activity and I should be pleased if you would make a recommendation concerning what equipment and stock should be supplied.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\n\nREGINA, SASK., August 16th, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, No. 118-1-1 with reference to the farming instruction at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nI note that Father Moulin has indicated his willingness to give some instruction to the older boys, but states that he is unable to meet the expense incidental to such training.\n\nI think I had better wait until I go to the Ermineskin reserve myself next, or till the Inspector makes a visit there, because if we are going to grant any assistance we want to have it thoroughly understood that the work will be carried on with zest, and if the Father is indifferent about it we had better not begin.\n\n40 acres of land to begin with is too little, and I do not think it would be wise to put in a full line of equipment and stock unless we are prepared to do farming on a fairly decent scale. The season is fairly well advanced and nothing can be done in this matter until next Spring.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW. M.

The building was clean from basement to garret. The matter of taking this school over by the Department is under consideration. I doubt very much whether satisfactory work can ever be carried on with these old buildings, and it appears to me that the money that would be spent on this old school, with an addition, would be better applied in building a new, modern school. The Principal of the school concurs in this. However, I had no opportunity of discussing the matter with Archbishop O'Lary, but it should be thoroughly investigated before any purchase is made. I know I have your instructions to do this, but I thought it wise just to let you know the condition of the building before going any further in the matter.\n\nThe school, as you know, started a small farm two years ago, and this year they have thirty acres of wheat, and a fine field of oats. A small amount of breaking has been added to this farm this year; about eight acres.\n\nOn the whole, I would say that this school is obtaining good results.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOctober 4, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 17th ultimo, regarding the Ermineskin's Indian residential school, I note that you consider it advisable to erect a new building in the not too distant future.

Gen of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nFour years ago, it was a question of selling the Ermineskin Residential School to the Indian Department, and Mr. Graham of Regina came to see the buildings.\n\nAs they were wood buildings and partially old, he was not in favor of buying them but said that it was only a matter of a few years before the Indian Department would build another school with all modern conveniences; then, is the Indian Department decided to do it in the near future?\n\nAt the present time we have 120 pupils in the School (number we are authorized for). There are moreover on our Reserves about 40 pupils of our faith, who should be in School. In 1922 the Rev. Sisters built an addition at their own expenses ($15,000) the accommodation is yet rather small and we consider that we will have to do something ourselves if the Indian Department does not intend to build us another school.\n\nCould we then be authorized to have the grant for 160 pupils? If the Indian Department will authorize us to take that number, we would consider the means of building another addition to the school. We would make it quite spacious and if possible in Brick.\n\nWith respectful salutations\n\nI remain, Honorable Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal of the Ermineskin Residential School.\nJanuary 28, 1929.\n\nDear Father Moulin:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to increasing the accommodation at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. At the present time, the Department is not disposed to recommend the appropriation of funds for a new building. Further, the advisability of increasing the present accommodation is in doubt, as I understand there is plenty of accommodation for Indian children at the residential school at St. Albert.

He recommended to enlist our Indian children for Saint Albert School. It is a very hard proposition, as you know very well.\n\nI am not to refuse the children that the parents are bringing to us. In the past years, I had too much hardship to make them understand a little, the great benefit of a good education.\n\nWe have already a few more pupils than the number we are authorized for; 120; and after Easter, many others will be brought to our school.\n\nWould you please, authorize us to take 130 children in our Residential School?

Could it not be possible to have at least four or five more? We have over 135 now and moreover every day we give instruction in our school to four children of Mr. John White, the interpreter at the Indian Agency, for which we receive nothing.\n\nYou advise me to follow the instructions of the Deputy Superintendent General and recruit children for the St. Albert School, where it seems, as they stated recently to some of our staff, that they have no limit to their pupilage.\n\nI beg to say that, if the Rev. Sisters of St. Albert would go and recruit on the Reserves of Edmonton Indian Agency, also keep their children well in school till they are 16 or 17, they would then fill their school easily.

School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nREGINA, SASK., Feb. 14th, 1930\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report that while at the Hobbema Agency I inspected the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. At the time of my visit there were 117 children in residence, and as an addition had been built to the school last summer, which had been financed by the Church authorities, they informed me that as soon as the necessary beds, etc., were received they would have accommodation for 145. As there had been some reports to the effect that there were a number of children of school age on the reserve who were not attending school I went thoroughly into the matter with the Principal and the Agent and instructed them that as soon as the addition was ready they should personally recruit these children, in order to bring the number of pupils up to the maximum for which they had accommodation.\n\nI also gave instructions that if any Protestant children of school age were found on the reserve they should be sent to Edmonton. I believe there are 39 children now at Edmonton from this agency. From what I gathered I believe Mr. Askey is doing all he can to recruit children for the different schools. The time will probably come when he will have to take stronger measures to send some of the children to school, as I heard him talking to several of the parents, and from the conversation-\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nconversation I could tell that they had no intention of sending their children to school if excuses would keep them out. You are aware that down on the Blood Reserve if the Agent did not take strong measures only about half the children would be attending school, as the Indians there had just made up their minds that they were going to beat the Government to it. I am fully conversant with what I am talking about as I have had the actual experience there, and I am of the opinion that it is sometimes necessary to take a strong stand in regard to this matter as I do not think there is any excuse for Indians keeping their children out of school where the school is on the reserve. Of course, where the children have to be sent miles away from the agency it throws a different light on the matter, because I can understand that Indian parents have the same aversion as white people to sending their children a long way from home.\n\nI found everything around the school in A1 condition; the children are well cared for and everything around the place was clean and tidy as it always is. The work in the classrooms is also good. The only thing that I am worried about at this institution is fire. It is a long rambling building, two and a half storey, all of frame, and if a fire were to start in it, it would go up like powder, but evidently they have all the fire protection that can be arranged for in a building of this nature. If a fire did start it would not be a question of getting it extinguished, but rather a question of getting the children out. Fire drill is held regularly, and Mr. Askey takes a great interest in it and visits the school quite often for this purpose. The new addition and repairs put on by the Church authorities this year amounted to between seven and eight thousand dollars.\n\n-They have-\nThey have 12 cows at the school. This, in my opinion, is not a sufficient number for an institution that has 145 pupils, besides staff, and as you will realize, there are always times when some of the cows are not giving milk. The quantity of milk they are receiving at the present time is very small, but they had a number of cows that would freshen shortly. They only have stable accommodation for 12 cows, and I do not suppose the Sisters feel that they are in a position to buy any additional cows or build an addition to the barn. I noticed also that their pig pen is very small, and does not provide sufficient room for the pigs that they wish to raise, but I was told that they could not finance the erection of a better pig sty at the present time.\n\nI may say that in my opinion this institution is doing good work in the agency. I saw a number of young women and men on the reserves that had been discharged from the school and they were certainly a good recommendation for the institution.\n\nWhile at the agency I was approached by the Missionary, Rev. Mr. Cantlin, the Farming Instructor at the Agency, Mr. McLeod, and Mr. Kramer, with regard to a Day School that has just been opened in the Village. At the present time there are ten children attending this school - three children of the Missionary, one from each of the Farming Instructor's homes, and the other five from the village - children of Elevator men, etc. They are having great difficulty in financing this school, and asked me to take up with the Department the matter of giving a grant to the school. I may say that although there are only two children of school age at the agency now we might, in the changing of staff, have employees there with more children, and it is certainly of great benefit to have a school so\nnear at hand. The only promise I made these people, however, was that the matter would be submitted to you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK. Feb. 18th, 1930\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, in the Hobbema Agency, which was inspected by Mr. Inspector Christianson.\n\nYou will note that at the time of the Inspector's visit there were 117 children in residence. You will also note that there are 39 children from this agency attending the Edmonton School. There are still, however, several children of school age on the reserves who are not attending school, and I do not believe they will ever be sent to school unless steps are taken by the Department to have them taken there by force. On every occasion I have been in Edmonton I have spoken to the Principal of the school there about getting these children into school but he has not had 100% success. I know these children could be sent to school if the Department would agree to have a police officer accompany the Inspector or the Agent when they go out to recruit them.\n\nThe children at the Ermineskin's School are apparently well cared for, but it seems to me they are not getting the proper food, when seven or eight cows are supposed to supply milk for 140 people. The Department should insist on the proper amount of milk being supplied to the pupils at our Indian schools. I think that in many cases we are giving medical attention for illness, when the illness could well be avoided. I am sure Dr. Stone will agree with me that when Indian children are not properly fed they are very susceptible\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nto tuberculosis and other complaints.\n\nWith regard to the last paragraph of the Inspector's report, I think it is up to Mr. Cantlin and Mr. McLeod to provide for the education of their own children. We have nothing to do with Mr. Kramer, but Mr. McLeod is well paid, and can easily afford to contribute towards the teacher's salary out of his own salary. His position is worth from $175.00 to $200.00 a month, situated as he is.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nFebruary 24, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 404-11 of the 18th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Christiansen's report on the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. It will be possible to allow a pupilage of 140 as from April first, next; but I am today writing to the Reverend Principal, stating that this increase cannot be granted unless a suitable milk supply is provided. I know that there are several hundred children not attending school, and I believe that, next summer, you should arrange to have those that are physically fit sent to Edmonton, using Section 10 of the Indian Act if necessary. Until the pupils from Brandon leave Edmonton, there is no room for others, but it will be a good plan to have a thorough recruiting campaign in August.\n\nThe question of assistance to the private school at Hobema will receive consideration if there are more children of our own employees in attendance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M.

Grant for this number will be paid from the 1st instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nReverend P. Moulin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nErmineskin's Residential School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., April 12th, 1930\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWhile at the Hobbema Agency the other day I visited the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, and was greatly surprised to see that an addition had been made to this old ramshackle building, which, in my opinion, might be called a fire trap. The situation here is bad, and the addition has not improved matters any.\n\nI understand they have taken in additional pupils and that the number in the school is now 152 and they hope to get it up to 160. This is absurd; 140 is all they should have. I am told by Mr. Askey that they have approval of admissions up to 152, so there is somewhat of a mix-up here; if 140 is the authorized number and 152 applications have been approved there is a surplus of 12 children in the school.\n\nThe addition was made by carrying the adjoining one-storey buildings up two storeys high. The attached photograph will show you what the building looks like now.\n\nI am very nervous about this school and I do not think it is at all right to put additional children in there. What is needed badly is an up-to-date school. This reserve can maintain a school with a pupilage of 150 quite easily, and I think the time has arrived when this should be built. I hope the Department will give this matter serious consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nApril 15, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 404-11A R.C. of the 12th instant, with reference to the Ermineaskin Indian Residential School. It is true, there is a great danger from fire in this old building; but the most recent reports indicate that the fire protection is all that can be arranged. Mr. Murison's comment in this connection, of February 14th, last, indicates that fire drill is held regularly and that the Indian Agent and the school management are taking every precaution. As both the school authorities and yourself have been informed, a pupilage of 140 is now allowed. So that grant for this number can be earned, it is all right to have an enrolment of 147 or 148, provided there is adequate accommodation. You might write the Principal, telling him that on no condition should more than 148 pupils be on the roll.\n\nAt a later date, we will have to give serious consideration to the question of a new building at this point. When you write the Principal, you should emphasize the Department's wishes concerning fire drill and fire prevention. Neither Mr. Murison nor yourself state that additional fire escapes are required, so I presume that no action in this connection is necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, SASK.\nOttawa, April 16, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nPursuant to the Deputy Superintendent General's letter to you of yesterday's date, I am instructed to have you arrange for the services of a night watchman at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. The Department will allow a grant of $40 a month for this service and considers that the school should be responsible for the man's board. The watchman should be chosen with care and must be a thoroughly reliable person, who will make continuous patrol of the main building at night. Vouchers in this connection should be forwarded once every quarter and should be in favour of the Principal, who will pay the night watchman. Please make the arrangements without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK. Jan. 3, 1931\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report that during my inspection of the Hobbema Agency in December I also made an inspection of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were 145 children in residence. The work in the classroom I shall not enlarge upon, as the School Inspector had inspected this work on the 1st of December. I may say, however, that I am of the opinion that the classroom work is gradually improving, and the children spoke up much better than they did a few years ago, in fact I think they are receiving a much better education now than they did when I first visited the school.\n\nSince my last visit, new fire escapes have been erected in the building, and while I was there fire drill was held. I was informed that fire drill practise takes place every week. I also found that since my last inspection the school had been connected up with the Hydro Electric Power, which did away with the old lighting plant, and the water is now pumped with a motor\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\ninstead of an engine.\n\nEverything around the school was in good order as usual, and the buildings are kept in as good a state of repair as possible. I do not need to go into a description of the school building, as both yourself and the Department are thoroughly familiar with it. I have frequently mentioned that due to the nature of its construction, this building would be a fire trap if a fire should occur, but I consider now that every possible precaution has been taken to ensure safety. There are electric alarm bells on each floor that can be sounded by pressing one button, and the additional fire escapes which were erected give the pupils and staff every possible chance of making their escape in case of a fire.\n\nThe children were well clothed and presented an exceptionally healthy appearance. Both the boys and girls have five complete changes of clothing. They have two pairs of shoes each, besides moccasins; one pair for every-day, and a pair for Sundays. The girls are instructed in cooking, sewing, mending, darning, and in all branches of housekeeping. Although most of the washing is done by machinery, a certain amount of clothes are washed by hand each week in order to give the girls a training in this line. From April 1st until the freeze-up in the Fall, the girls do the milking, but during the winter months this is done by the boys. The farming\u2014\nfarming at this school is done in a very small way, and the boys do not receive much training in this line of work, with the exception of gardening, milking, doing chores, etc. At the present time they have 14 cows, 7 calves, two 2-year-old steers and one bull. They were milking 11 cows at the time of my visit, and getting about 20 gallons of milk per day. They have 25 pigs and 200 hens, and the Principal informed me that he was buying some more chickens so as to have an abundance of eggs for the children. They raised a splendid garden, but the potato crop was light on account of the dry weather. However, they will have sufficient for the use of the school, and also plenty of other vegetables.\n\nAt the present time the school is recruited up to full strength and above it, as there are 145 children enrolled and the Principal only receives a grant for 140. In going around the reserve I noted that there were quite a number of children of school age at home with their parents. Some of these I believe are Protestant and should go to Edmonton.\n\nDuring my stay there, Mr. Woodsworth was down to the Agency and I made arrangements with him to come down some time during January and stay a couple of days for the purpose of recruiting some children. You, of course, know the attitude of the Indians there, as soon as steps are taken to recruit for the Edmonton School they flock over to the Roman Catholic School, so as not to have their children sent away. No doubt\u2014\ndoubt there will be some children discharged from\nthe Roman Catholic School next summer, which will\nleave room for some that are not attending school\nat present.\n\nTaking it on the whole this institution,\nin my opinion, is doing very good work. The only\nthing that I believe could be improved on is the\nmatter of giving the boys more training along\nagricultural lines. The school has only about\nsixty acres under cultivation, and naturally this\ndoes not give the boys much chance to learn farming.\n\nEverything else is satisfactory, and the\nbest of harmony exists between the school and the\nAgency.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., January 7th, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, in the Hobema Agency, which was inspected by Mr. Christianson during the month of December.\n\nThe work carried on at this school seems to be satisfactory, excepting, as the Inspector points out, that the boys do not get sufficient training in farming and the care of stock. It is pleasing to note that the girls of this school do the milking during the summer. It is also satisfactory to note that the children are so well clothed, and that a fair quantity of milk is supplied daily to the school. The school has more pupils in the building than I think they should have. I am not going to comment any further on the type of building we have here as the Department are in possession of all the facts.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

Father Langleis was informed that consideration would be given to the various requests. I write now with reference to the pupilage which is authorized for your school. It is true that there is air space in the dormitories for some 140 pupils, and perhaps a few more might be safely accommodated; but there is such grave danger of fire in the main building, that the Department must insist that there be no overcrowding whatever. I note there was an average attendance of 141 for the September quarter. This was secured with an enrolment of 148. This return is satisfactory, but I have to urge that you will not take in any more pupils without there being a corresponding number of discharges. As long as you remain in the present building, the Department believes it is not wise to increase the pupilage beyond 140.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. P. P. Moulin, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nErmineskins Residential School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nErmineskin's Residential School,\nHobbema, Alberta. Jan., 8th, 1933\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the past months we had some trouble caused by some young men coming around the school, trying to have relations with our girl pupils.\n\nTwo of them were Indians and one halfbreed, Lawrence White, 20 years of age and son of the Interpreter at the Indian Agency.\n\nIn October three of our girls ran away with them.\n\nI had these young men arrested and they were given a year on suspended sentence by Judge Angus of Metaskiwin.\n\nThe case was serious.\n\nNevertheless since the trial, this Lawrence White has been coming around the school again at night. He wrote and spoke to one of the girls.\n\nJudge Angus does not find that there is matter enough for a conviction.\n\nCould you not give Colonel F. Palmer, Indian agent, order to have this young man driven from the Reserve and if being seen around the school to have him arrested for trespassing.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa, January 14, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, regarding trouble caused at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School by some young men interfering with the girl pupils. In this connection I have to say that the Department is communicating with Colonel R. Palmer, Indian Agent, requesting him to take the necessary action to prevent further trouble.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. P. F. Moulin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nErmineskin Indian Residential School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nOttawa, January 14, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose copy of a communication received from the Reverend Principal of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, regarding some trouble caused the school authorities by young men interfering with the girl pupils. It is noted, from the Principal's letter, that one of these men, Lawrence White, was arrested and given a year on suspended sentence. If he still trespasses on the school property and causes trouble, it is considered that he should be brought before the Court, with a view to his committal to serve sentence. In any event, you should warn Lawrence White definitely that he is to cease his visits and interference with the girl pupils.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you as to the action taken in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nColonel R. H. Palmer,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.112-1-1 of the 14th inst. enclosing a copy of a letter from the Rev. Principal of the Ermineskin's Indian Residential School, regarding Lawrence White and two Indians who had been causing a great deal of trouble, by interfering with the girl pupils.\n\nThere is no doubt that these young men have been causing the Rev. Father a great deal of trouble, and I have supported him in every way in his action on this case.\n\nWith reference to the second complaint against Lawrence White, there was a considerable delay in getting the magistrate to try the case, as he considered the evidence insufficient.\n\nHowever, Lawrence White, son of the Interpreter, was tried before Magistrate Angus, at Hobbema, and sentenced to two months at Fort Saskatchewan, on Monday, January 16th.\n\nAs soon as this young man has completed his sentence, may I have the authority to order him off the Reserve entirely, and have him treated as trespasser should he return here, as he is not a treaty Indian, and he is quite old enough to go out and earn his own living, and I do not wish his parents to be held responsible for any improper actions of his.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCol.

Palmer,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nOttawa, May 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your report for the month of March, last, on the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, it is noted, with respect to fire drill, escapes and protection, that, while the equipment is now in good order, no fire drill is held.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that principals give constant and intelligent thought to the danger of fire. In this connection I would refer to circular letter dated February 6, 1932, sent to the Principals of all Indian Residential Schools. The Department requests that you take up with the Principal of this School the matter of fire drill, informing him that, at the very least, two fire drills per month should be held, one of which should be after the pupils retire at night. The staff and the older pupils should receive definite instructions as to their specific duties during fire drill or in case of fire.\n\nI am enclosing copy of circular letter referred to and would request that you will advise the Department, later, if the instructions contained therein, especially with reference to fire drill, have been carried out by the Principal and staff of the Ermineskin School and if the instructions as set forth in the circular are being complied with in all respects.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Moulton Principal.\nHobbema, Alta., Oct. 5th, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI find a large number of children of school age and over, that have never been to school. These children range from 8 to 13 years of age and I am insisting that all children go to school. At a meeting of the Chiefs I explained to them the \"Indian Act\" with respect to children attending school, and with the exception of one, I was promised their co-operation and support. I also find a number of young farmers who had neglected attending school and I have asked several of them if I could get a night school started for two nights a week, if they would like to attend and all those I have asked have signified their willingness to attend. This school, if started, will be held in this office. The Chiefs are in favour of this. I spoke to Father Moulin about this and he is going to try and arrange for one of the young priests to act as teacher. It will be undenominational in character. Do you approve of this, please?\n\nA. G. B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 29, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th of October, the Department approves the arrangements you have made for conducting a night school at the Agency.\n\nI am extremely favourable towards the operation of such schools and later on would appreciate your advising the results obtained and the plan followed, as such information might assist us in arranging similar courses at other agencies.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

He expects to visit the Ermineskin School in the near future and will then take up the matter with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. P.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFormat No. I.A.403\nReg.

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whom grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. A return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 29, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Redacted]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and union at the [Redacted] Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nthis\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] Residential School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: ____________________________\n\nDated: ____________________________\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: ____________________________\n\nDated at: ____________________________\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The column of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] Residential School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Quarter:** 126\n\n**NOTE:** Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The column of the Return should be correctly added and the total placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is obtained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the grant allowed. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School] for the Quarter ended...[Date]\n\nPrincipal: ____________________________\n\nDated: ____________________________\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: ____________________________\n\nDated: ____________________________\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

$\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The column of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of Residential School] for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at [Place]: [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of Residential School] for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\n[Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nDep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30 1944.\n\nPrincipal: E. P.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The quarterly per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Brineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is obtained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of pupils' grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended 30th June 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: 19 July 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Hobema Indian Agency, JUL 20 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 465\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pacing it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarter per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of the grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the grant per capita. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended...Dec. 31st...1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31st, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 405\nReq.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered in this Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINFORMATION RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Hobbema Indian Agency, APR 1, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated June 30, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry-forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupil in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly grant. In no case, however, will any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils have been enrolled on the Roll and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI declare that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 2nd 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Hobema Indian Agency, APR 7 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I A 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINFORMATION RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated: June 30th, 1947\n\nI have carefully

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 17th, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated this 6th November, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, should any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ERMINESKIN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: April 2nd 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at this 5th March 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence at school ended off the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, so called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. In cases referring to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2 and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the columns under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant for quarter is determined by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept., 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 29, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated Oct. 29, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL |

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings therein.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter all pupils entered on the Return are included by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the number of pupils attending during quarter.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA-403\nE. 3008\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATES OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| 0814            | Jo Florine Yellowbird | 8   | 76       | Samson         | 1B                |                         | Sept.16-48                 | 92/55      |\n| 0815            | Hazel M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall claims be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended March 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: March 30, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT,\n\nINDIAN AGENCY, ROBEMA.\n\nDated at:\n\nROBEMA INDIAN AGENCY\n\nAPRIL 4, 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nR. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Report of the Brimskin Residential School at Hobson on Brimskin Reserve for Quarter ended March 31, 1946**\n\n| Register Number | Names of Pupils       | Age | Sex | Band or Reserve | Class or Study | Standing in Class | Trade or Other Industry | Date of Entrance to School | Attendance | Remarks as to Progress, etc., Reason for Absence, Date of Absence, Whether Authorized or Not |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0814            | Ida Florine Yellowbird| 7   | F   | Samson          | IB            |                   |                        | Sept. 16-46              | 3020       |                                                                                                  |\n| 0815            | Hazel M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at HUBBEMA INDIAN AGENCY OCT 7, 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3006\n### INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT OF the Erminekin Residential School at Hobema on Erminekin Reserve for Quarter ended September 30, 1949**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DAY OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0840            | Lucie Monias    | 8   | 1   | 1    | L.Bull         | 1B                 |                        | Sept.23-49                | 8 / 6       |\n| 0841            | Ida Monias      | 7   | 1   | 1    | L.Bull         | 1B                 |                        | Sept.23-49                | 8 / 6       |\n| 0842            | Rose Lucy Crier | 9   | 1   | 1    | Samson         | 1B                 |                        | Sept.23-49                | 8 / 6       |\n| 0843            | Rita Buffalo     | 7   | 1   | 1    | Samson         | 1B                 |                        | Sept.24-49                | 7 / 5       |\n\n**Non Treaty**\n\nAlma Hodgson  \nIrene Gladu  \nVelma Gladu\n\n**Total number of days in Quarter:** 92\n\n**Average number of days pupils in residence during Quarter:** 5.5\n\n**Average attendance of pupils during Quarter:** 5.2\n\n**Amount of per capita grant due for Quarter:** $8\n\n(a) this is a church-owned residential school state the number of:\n(i) non-Indian children who are boarders\n(ii) non-Indian children who are day school pupils\n\n**TOTALS:** 99 108\n\n**TOTALS:** 67 282923 20 2014 6\n\n**TOTALS:** 2243\n\n**TOTALS:** 14477 2522\n\n**TOTALS:** 157.70 x 59.75 = 9422.58\n\n**NOTE:** Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\n\n---\n\n**PUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA**\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | TOTAL NUMBER OF DAYS IN QUARTER | AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS PUPILS IN RESIDENCE DURING QUARTER | AVERAGE ATTENDANCE OF PUPILS DURING QUARTER |\n|-----------------|----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 0814            | Ide F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineaskin Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal Paul G. M. Latham\n\nDated June 30, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSUPERINTENDENT,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nHOBEMA INDIAN AGENCY,\n\nJULY 7, 1950,\n\nHOBEMA, ALBERTA.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 30th, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSUPERINTENDENT, Indian Agent\n\nDated at: Hobbema Indian Agency\n\nHOBBERMA, ALBERTA\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 409\n| REGISTER NUMBERS | NAMES OF PEOPLE | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|------------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|---------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0845             | Annie Smithson   | 8   | 1   | 0    | Ermineskin     |                         | Oct.11-59                   | 92/55      |\n| 0846             | Justine Scosby   | 8   | 1   | 0    | Samson         |                         | Feb.27-59                   | 92/41      |\n| 0847             | Lena Fournier    | 8   | 1   | 0    | Samson         |                         | Sept.4-50                   | 92/47      |\n| 0848             | Jane MacKenzie   | 7   | 1   | 0    | Ermineskin     |                         | Sept.4-50                   | 92/49      |\n| 0849             | Evelyn T.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entering the Return and is ascertained by adding the columns under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: ____________________________\n\nDated: ____________________________\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n______________________________\n\nDated at ____________________________\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n|

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, putting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

are day-school pupils.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils are in all cases enrolled on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1951.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated September 29, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nthis 2 Oct., 1951.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Wild,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alta.\n\nThe Principal of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School when completing the March Return claimed eighty-one days grant for pupil #0796 Adele Minda. He has neglected to indicate in the Remarks Column the dates when this girl left residence and later returned to residence.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would supply us with this information as soon as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pacing it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence during quarter, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated June 30, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nthis 9 July, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE ON OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0873            | Shirley Goosby  | 7   | 1   |     | Samson        | 1                 |                          | Sept. 3-51                | 4898       |\n| 0874            | Flora Northwest | 7   | 1   |     | Samson        | 1                 |                          | Sept. 3-51                | 91         |\n| 0875            | Jessie Baptiste | 6   | 1   |     | Samson        | 1                 |                          | Sept. 3-51                | 91         |\n| 0876            | Cecilia Wildcat | 9   | 1   |     | Ermineeskin   | 1                 |                          | Sept. 3-51                | 91         |\n| 0877            | Florence E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 2, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Nobbeema Indian Agency, October 8, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.-403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Ermineskin Residential School at Hobbema on Ermineskin Reserve for Quarter ended September 30, 1952.**\n\n| Resident Number | Name of Pupil | Age | Boy/Girl | Hand on Reserve | Class or Study | Standard in Grade | Trade or Other Industry | Date of Entrance to School | Attendance |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|----------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0899            | Lilian R.

|\nNovember 17, 1952\n\nMr. J.R. Wild,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alta.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 5th regarding pupils # 0763 and 0774 shown on the September Quarterly Return for the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, in view of the contents of your letter, please advise the Principal that the school was overpaid two days for each of the two pupils. This overpayment will be deducted on the December Return.\n\nThe admission of Bella Lightning to the Ermineskin School is approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of such residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ermineskin Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1953.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1, 1953\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Hobbema Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Ermineskin Residential School at Hobbema on Ermineskin Reserve for Quarter ended March 31, 1953**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0907            | Elle B.

It seems to me that when going to so much trouble to procure good schools, we should take steps to have the Indians to profit by them.\n\nWith but few exceptions, there is no real success in schools, excepting the Industrial or Boarding ones. I therefore pray you to be kind enough to give one of these latter to the Reverend Sisters there.\n\nThe Sister Superior has already shown what she is able to do at Onion Lake and I have every reason to believe that she will, if provided with the means, succeed quite as well on Ermineskin's Reserve.\n\nSuch means are, the necessary buildings, the grant per capita given by the Department to provide the children with clothing and board.\n\nRelying on your good-will in that respect, I offer you my thanks beforehand.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) X Vital J.

Reed adding thereto all the recommendations you may think fit.\n\nI am asking of the Indian Department to be good enough to build one Boarding School on Ermineskin's Reserve, next spring. We have gone to considerable expense there for the Indians to procure for them the advantage of a good education. Nuns have come from the Province of Quebec, and to give them proper accommodation nearly $2000.00 have been spent. We have besides given them the Mission House and will next summer, build a house for the Missionary in charge.\n\nIt would now be but just if the Department came to our help, erecting a satisfactory house where the children can be accommodated, for classes and necessary adjuncts, and authorizing us to admit at the start 30 to 40 children at the rate of $72.00 per head.\n\nReceive, Dear Sir, my best salutations,\n\n(Sgd) X Vital J.

I have looked over the list and find it contains the names of 30 pupils who are now attending school at the Reserve. The total number of pupils attending school at the Reserve is 40.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Superintendent has estimated the cost of building a new schoolhouse at $2500.00.

B.\u2014Cheque to be made payable to:\n\n[Signature]\n\nVoucher No.: 6389\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of Mr Inspector Wadsworth's report on the Brimskin's Boarding school; and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to note the progress made by the pupils at this school.\n\nWith regard to over-crowding in the dormitories of the present building, the Department trusts that ample accommodation will soon be provided as the sum of \u00a32500 has been provided in the Estimates for buildings. The Department would like to be furnished with a copy of the proposed plan of the new buildings.\n\nIn this connection I may mention that it is desirable that arrangements should be made for completing all building operations undertaken on the strength of funds voted for that purpose before the 30th June next. These remarks apply to all the appropriations for buildings for the different schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nSir:\n\nI am requesting for the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2500.00) which has been voted for the construction of our Boarding School. I would feel truly obliged for your kindness in having the said sum forwarded us as soon as possible. We are in a great want of it being the only resource upon which we may count to commence the work of construction.\n\nI am, etc.\n\nSgd Z. Lizes Pte O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nR.C.Mission.\nHobuema. March 8th 1897.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to send you, with the present letter, the plans for the new building for boarding school in the Hobema agency, and also the specifications and estimates, as required in your circular No. 15, dated March 8th.\n\nYou will be easily convinced that to make a proper construction for less than $5,000, is scarcely possible. Therefore, we hope the Department will be so kind as to add $2,500 to the first sum already voted, in order not to delay the complete termination of this building, of which we are so much in want.\n\nThe exterior plan herein will be performed faithfully, except the kitchen, which is to be inside, instead of behind, the new building. The dimensions for the large building are 50 x 49 ft., instead of 55 x 45, as shown on the plan; and for\nfor the kitchen, 25 x 18.\n\nPersuaded you will take our demand into consideration, I expect, with great anxiety, the sum already granted.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n## Estimate of the Boarding School building at Holburn\n\n### Transportation of wood for foundation\n- 300 ft red spruce logs for ground work $10 \\times 10$, 25 ft long, 300 ft: $30$\n- 135 pieces 2 x 6 x 24 ft long, shiplap: $324$\n- 26 pieces 2 x 10 - \" - joists, 1st story: $104$\n- 26 pieces 2 x 10 - \" - joists: $78$\n- 26 pieces 2 x 8 - \" - rafters: $832$\n- 26 pieces 2 x 8 - \" - rafters: $624$\n- 52 pieces 2 x 6 - \" - garret: $936$\n- 90 pieces 2 x 6 - \" - rafters: $1440$\n- 40 pieces 2 x 8 - \" - rafters: $1280$\n\nTotal cost of rough lumber @ $818$: $10,172$\n\n### Exterior raincoat\n- 3,300 shingles (with galeries): $2,199$\n- 200 shades, 2 x 4 & 12 ft: $160$\n- Interior raincoat & partition feet: $11,310$\n- Floors for three stories feet: $8,400$\n- 26 large windows 14 x 28: $825$\n- 15 small windows 10 x 20: $190$\n- 3 exterior doors 7 x 3: $2$ inches thick: $10$\n- 70 pieces 2 x 8 - 12 ft frames for windows & doors: $112$\n- 6 interior doors 6 x 8 x 2.8: $1/2$ inch: $15$\n- 150 ft. steps for stairs: $1/2 \\times 10$ inches: $5$\n- 6 runners for stairs: $2 \\times 14$, 18 ft long: $252$\n- Clapboard @ $26.00$ per sq.: $6,000$\n- 6 pieces 4 x 4 - 22 ft long: $108$\n- 6 pieces 4 x 4 - 12 ft: $96$\n- To finish frames & shelves: $1,500$\n- Casing for windows inside 1 x 4 inches wide, 800 ft long: $20$\n- Plinths 10 inches high, 900 ft long: $27$\n- Ceilings feet: $800$\n\n### Kitchen\n- 75 pieces 2 x 4 - 18 ft long, shiplap: $900$\n- 26 pieces 2 x 8 - \" - joists: $624$\n\nTotal: $818 = 1,524$\n\nCarpeting: $2,011$\n| Item Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 52 Pieces 2x6 - 14 ft long rafters                   |          |            | $28.97  |\n| Exterior raincoat                                     |          |            | $31.76  |\n| Total @ $65.00                                       |          |            | $39.04  |\n| Interior raincoat                                     |          |            | $70.27  |\n| 7 Windows 10x20                                       |          |            | $1.90   |\n| 2 Exterior doors 6.8 x 2.8 1/2 inch                   |          |            | $2.78   |\n| Clap board                                           |          |            | $15.00  |\n| Roof shingles                                        |          |            | $3.75   |\n| 30 Rolls Tax paper                                   |          |            | $1.60   |\n| 39 Plain                                             |          |            | $1.50   |\n| 100 lbs Nails                                        |          |            | $6      |\n| 400 n                                               |          |            | $8      |\n| 3000 bricks for two chimneys                         |          |            | $88     |\n| 30 Bucket lime                                       |          |            | $7.50   |\n| Sand                                                 |          |            | $6      |\n| Painting                                             |          |            | $18.50  |\n| Locks & hinges                                       |          |            | $20     |\n| 2 Ventilators                                        |          |            | $30     |\n| Weights cords & pulleys for windows                  |          |            | $37.50  |\n| Mortar mix                                           |          |            | $18.00  |\n| Furnace                                              |          |            | $3.00   |\n| **Total**                                            |          |            | $487.18 |\n\n$ 487.18\nIndian Agents Office Hobbema Agency\n\nApril 12th 1897.\n\nRef: Letter March 3th 1897 No 01.\n\nSir:\n\nI have received from the Rev Z Liza, Principal of Erminskin's Boarding School, the plans and specifications for the proposed new buildings which I herewith beg to transmit.\n\nYours, etc.,\nsgd W.S.

The management is being told that no more than the $2500.00 provided can be had in the way of aid from the Department, and that unless the church authorities are willing to meet any expenditure in excess of that amount, the plans must be so modified accordingly, if it is desired to secure the $2500.00 available, also that the expenditure must be incurred before the 30th June next.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nThe Deputy,\nof the Supt General,\nof Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner.\nOTTAWA 8th May 1907\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th inst.; and in reply to say that no further grant can be made for the proposed new R.C.

Principal of Ermineskin's Residential School. I have the honor to report as follows:\n\nThe kitchen range in use at present is very much out of repair, and is too small for the number in attendance. The old bake oven was torn away when the new addition was put on the school building two years ago and has never been replaced. The school has never been supplied with a bread mixer. I would consider the above three items very necessary and recommend the purchase.\n\nThe stairs leading to, and the floors of the girl dormitories are in a bad state of repair and will require immediate attention. Regarding the floor for the boys' dining room, I might say that this room is in the basement of the new part of school building, the present floor is of cement and the objection to this is, that it becomes very dusty with many feet tramping over it.\n\nThe Rev. Principal intimated to me, that if the materials were supplied for the floors etc., the Rev. Sisters would undertake to look after the labour, and also the installation of the range, oven etc.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDeputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 3, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 404-11A of the 5th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Rev. Principal of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. You are authorized to purchase a kitchen range and deliver it to the school without delay. You should also arrange for and forward to the girls' dormitories, 44 ft. x 50 ft., or similar size, to renew the staircase leading to the girls' dormitories, 8 ft. wide. The provision of a bake oven will be necessary at the other improvements requested by the school will provide all the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. McLean,\nDeputy Secretary.\nOttawa, November 5, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 7 of the 26th ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Ermineskins Indian Residential School. I am today authorizing Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham to purchase a kitchen range and flooring and stairs for the girls' dormitories. The provision of a bake oven and bread mixer will have to stand for the time being, as our funds are extremely limited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. G. Askey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir:\n\nIn July, 1925, under Department authority 112-1-5, authority was given to expend $6000.00 on a Laundry and equipment at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School; of this amount $3650.00 were expended.\n\nOn a recent visit to this school I found that the roof of the laundry building was sagging and in danger, in time, of collapsing and I requested the Agent to ascertain what would be the cost of furnishing truss rods. He informs me that the cost of material and labour for one truss rod would be $32.00, but after carefully going over the building suggests that it would be more satisfactory to rebuild the roof at a cost of about $100, and if advisable, to furnish a truss rod also, which would entail a total cost of approximately $138.00 and I beg to recommend this expenditure and shall be glad to receive authority to incur it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M.

Hobbema, Alta.\n\nWe are writing the school authorities for information as to the width of the door space necessary to admit this oven and also as to the baking capacity required. When we have this information, an order will be placed with you for the oven required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Pagst,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nMessrs. Jean J. Daoust, Ltd.,\nSt. Boniface,\nMan.\nOttawa, April 9th, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Rev. Principal of the Ermineskin's Indian Residential School requested that a bake oven be supplied. The type of oven we usually supply is that manufactured by Jean J. Dacust, Limited, St. Boniface, and this firm inform us that their No. 3 and No. 4 bake ovens have a capacity of 42 and 63 square feet baking space, respectively, and will bake from 4 to 5 pounds of bread per square foot according to the size of the pans used. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department as early as possible as to whether you require a No. 3 or No. 4 oven to meet the requirements at this school.\n\nI may say that the width of the door space necessary to admit either a No. 3 or No. 4 oven is 39 inches. You should state whether the door through which this oven would have to be taken into the building would admit the oven, and, if not, please state definitely the exact width of the door space. Should there be any difficulty as to the width of the door, the above firm state that they can make an oven to meet requirements in this respect, having the same capacity as mentioned above.\n\nWhen we have the information asked for above, an order will be placed for the supplying of an oven.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Superior,\nErmineskin's Indian Res. School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nHobbema, Alberta,\nApril 15th, 1927.\n\nJ. D. Mclean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 8th instant in connection with the Bake Oven which the Rev. Principal of Brindeskin's Residential School had requested be supplied.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to the Department for the kind consideration they have given this request, and words are inadequate to express our thanks for their sanctioning it.\n\nI must state, however, that we had anticipated getting a larger one as it is considered that the No4 oven manufactured by the J.J. Daoust would be rather small to meet our actual requirements. Besides, the number of pupils is steadily increasing, and we are, even now, looking eagerly forward to the time when the Department will put up a larger school for us.\n\nThe door through which the oven would have to be taken into is 32 inches, and there is an opening of 42' by 26' in the bakery.\n\nWe have lately visited a school where they had an oven which had a capacity of 156 square feet of baking space. Now, if this can not be supplied can we hope to obtain one having a capacity of, at least, 144 square ft. of baking space?\n\nWith renewed thanks for this and all past favors,\n\nI remain\n\nyours very truly,\n\nActing Principal.\nOttawa, April 22nd, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the size of the bake oven required for the use of the Ermineskin's Indian Residential School. I may say that the No. 4 oven manufactured by Jean J. Daoust, Limited, St. Boniface, has an average capacity of approximately 350 pounds of bread at each baking. Please state as soon as possible what quantity of bread you require at each baking for the needs of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Superior,\nErmineskin's Indian Res. School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nHobbema, Alberta\n\nApril 22nd, 1927.\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of the 22nd instant, relative to the size of the bake oven we requested. I must say that we need one having an average capacity of approximately 500 to 600 pounds of bread. This would mean that we would have to bake twice weekly for our actual needs, but oftener as the number of pupils increase. A smaller oven would necessitate baking every day, reason for which we request a larger one, and we hope it will be granted,\n\nThanking you for your kind and prompt attention in this matter, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Principal\nOttawa, May 15th, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, relative to the size of the bake oven required for the use of the Ermineskin's Indian Residential School. The Department has given this letter careful consideration, and we regret that we have not sufficient information to enable us to place the order for a suitable oven. I would point out that it would take considerable floor space in the bakery for an oven having the capacity which you require. Please state definitely the exact dimensions of the floor space in the bakery or other place where you propose to install the oven, also repeat the exact width of the doors through which this oven would have to be taken.\n\nI may say that in other schools having approximately the same enrolment and staff as at your school, we have supplied the No. 4 \"Economy\" oven, which has a capacity of from 350 to 400 pounds of bread each baking, and this oven has proved satisfactory to the schools in which it is used. Having in view the width of the door space necessary to admit a larger oven, and the floor space required for the placing of same, and also the number of pupils and staff in residence, the Department does not understand why in the case of your school an oven having a capacity of 350 to 400 pounds of bread per baking would not be of sufficient size to meet your requirements.\n\nPlease give further information as to the space available for the placing of the oven and the exact width of the doors through which it would have to be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You simply cement the sections as you place them and bolt them together.\n\nThe ovens shown in this catalogue are stock sizes. Other sizes will be built to meet local conditions, if requested. The doors will be supplied in any size to meet your particular need.\n\nAny Hubbard Oven may be purchased on a small first payment, and the balance paid in monthly instalments. Price lists and terms of sale are shown separately and reprinted as market conditions make changes necessary.\n\nThe Hubbard oven is so well known it has a high resale value and if you should wish to sell the oven or dispose of your business at any time, you can always find a ready buyer. They pass from one baker to another and command a good price, even after years of use.\n\nThe small ovens are always carried in stock.

Hobbema, Alta., I now have to inform you that, after making enquiry as to the door space, etc., available for the installation of the oven, it has been decided to accept your offer for your No. 4 special oven, at the price quoted, viz.: $417.50, f. o. b. Hobbema.\n\nThis oven is for the use of the Ermineskins Indian Residential School and we are informed by the Rev. Sister superior that the door in the building, through which the oven will have to be taken, is 32\" wide and that the opening into the bakery is 42\" x 26\". It may be necessary for you to make up a special oven of the capacity of your No. 4, to go through the space available, or it may be that you can arrange to ship the oven in sections and it could be set up at the school. I shall be pleased if you will communicate with the Rev. Sister Superior, Ermineskins Indian Residential School, and ascertain definitely from her the space available for taking this oven into the building. After receiving this information, please forward, addressed to the Rev. Sister, Hobbema, Alta., an oven of the No. 4 special size.\n\nYour account covering the cost should be forwarded to Mr. W. G. Askey, Indian Agent, Hobbema, Alta., who is being informed of the order placed with you and requested to certify the account and send it to the Department when the oven is received.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you after you have communicated with the Rev. Sister Superior in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nMessrs. Jean J.

We find that this oven will be too expensive for the purpose for which it is required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nHubbard Portable Oven Co., Ltd.,\n1100 Queen St. West,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nOttawa, June 7, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, enclosing a sketch of the bake oven which you request be supplied for the use of the Ermineskins Indian Residential School. Owing to the cost of supplying the Hubbard Oven, Model \"H\", we are not prepared to purchase same. We are placing an order with Messrs. Jean J. Daoust, Limited, St. Boniface, Man., to supply you with their \"Economy\" No. 4 special oven, having a capacity of approximately 350 to 400 pounds of bread each baking.\n\nAs we are in some doubt regarding the space available, through which this oven will be taken into the building, we have requested the above firm to communicate with you and ascertain definitely the width of the doors of the building. It may be necessary for them to make up a special sized oven. When you hear from this firm, please give them full information.\n\nI may say that this is the type of oven which we have supplied a large number of our Indian residential schools and it has proved satisfactory. There is a difference of over $750 between the price of the Hubbard and the Economy No. 4 ovens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Superior,\nErmineskins Indian Residential School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nOttawa, June 7, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that we are today placing an order with Messrs. Jean J. Daoust, Limited, St. Boniface, Man., to supply their No. 4 \"Economy\" special bake oven for the use of the Ermineskins Indian Residential School. The price quoted f. o. b. Hobbema, Alta., is $417.50. This firm have been requested to forward their account to you. Upon receipt of the oven, you should certify the account and send it to the Department for payment. We have informed the Rev. Sister Superior of the school of the order placed for this oven.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. G.

Askey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\n21. Natural Gas May be Used as Fuel.\n\nNatural gas may be used as a fuel in any Hubbard oven. The coal oven is particularly well adapted for natural gas because the enclosed system of flues carries off any bad odor through the chimney. Ovens for manufactured gas are illustrated in the back pages.\n\n22. Heating with Oil.\n\nThere are many companies offering oil burners for heating the house or building. Any of these systems may be used in the Hubbard coal oven, or we can supply the burners and equipment with the oven. It is a convenience to place the furnace at the back, if the oven is to be heated with oil.\n\n23. Capacity of Ovens.\n\nThe capacity in loaves is estimated. To say the oven had a given capacity without stating the size of the pan would be misleading. The dimensions of each baking deck is given under the illustration and you may easily determine the capacity of the oven by measuring the pan you will use or frame of pans. Therefore, any comparison of ovens should be by the square feet of baking surface\u2014never by the number of loaves.\n\n24. Built-in Convenient Sections for Assembling.\n\nThe ovens are built in sections. They are fully assembled and knocked down for shipping. No section is too large for ease in handling and will pass through a common doorway.\n\n25. Fire Proof Base.\n\nThe oven stands on legs and may be placed without danger on a wood floor. Only a mat is required in front of the furnace to receive any hot coals that might fall when removing the ashes. The legs are 3\" high and if the oven is placed on a brick or cement base, it will be supplied without legs.\n\n26. Solidity without Excessive Weight.\n\nThe ovens are heavy and solidly built, yet not too heavy to be placed in any building of very ordinary construction, weighing about 125 pounds to the square foot.\n\nSPECIAL DOOR FOR WOOD BURNING\n\nThis larger door will be supplied where wood only is used for firing the oven.\nTHE NEW HUBBARD PORTABLE OVEN\n\nHUBBARD OVEN, MODELS 'E' AND 'F'\n\nMODEL E\n50 Square Feet Baking Surface.\n2 Baking Decks, 54\" wide, 67\" deep.\nCapacity 20 bun pans, 15\" x 21\"\nabout 150 1\u00bd-lb. loaves.\nMeasurement outside,\n6' 6\" wide, 6' 4\" long, 6' 4\" high.\nShipping weight, 4,800 lbs.\n\nModels E and F are the same width. Model F is 20\" longer.\n\nThese large ovens are heated with one oblong furnace. It will burn coal or wood. The firepot for Model E is 18\" long; Model F 24\" long; the firing door 6\" x 12\", flue 9\". If only wood is used for fuel, the furnace may be fitted with a large firing door 12\"x12\".\n\nThe outer door of the furnace is provided for your comfort. It is insulated and protects you from the furnace heat.\n\nThere is a cooling damper and a fire control damper, each independent of the other, but having one common outlet. Excessive heat is carried off through the chimney. Perfect heat control, to accommodate both bread and pastry.\n\nTwo of these ovens have the same capacity as one large oven, and are more serviceable for mixed baking, saving fuel if trade is seasonable.\n\nElectric or gas oven lights can be supplied as an extra for any oven at little extra cost, when specified with the order.\n\nMODEL F\n65 Square Feet Baking Surface.\n2 Baking Decks, 54\" wide, 87\" deep.\nCapacity 26 bun pans, 15\" x 21\"\nabout 200 1\u00bd-lb. loaves.\nMeasurement outside,\n6' 6\" wide, 8' long, 6' 4\" high.\nShipping weight, 5,700 lbs.\n\nSee List for Prices and Terms\nbeen reconditioned, and are guaranteed to be in good working order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHUBBARD PORTABLE OVEN COMPANY LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRESIDENT.\n\nH.R. HEYES\n\nPRESIDENT & MANAGER\nDear Sir,\n\nWe regret to read in your letter of June 7th that we are not to receive your order for a Hubbard Oven Model H, for shipment to Hobbema, because the price is considered too high.\n\nThe Model H is a large oven, weighing 9,000 lbs. The freight is therefore a considerable item. May we bring to your notice the Model F oven which has a capacity of about 200 1\u00bd lb. loaves. It is a very popular size, and we imagine it would be quite large enough to take care of the requirements at Hobbema, because a fresh batch can be turned out every hour, and the Model F is larger than your Department uses at other points. We quote you on the Model F as follows:\n\n1 Hubbard Oven Model F with pyrometer  \nF. O. B. Hobbema $795.00  \nSales tax extra, if any\n\nIf your Department would consider a rebuilt oven, we have one on hand with two baking decks, 72\" wide, 97\" deep, and 9\" high, heated with two furnaces, which will accommodate either coal or wood. This oven has not been used long, and has been repainted, so that it is quite as good as a new oven, and it is about the same size as the Model F oven offered above. We quote this oven as follows:\n\n1 Pendrith Oven with Pyrometer  \nF. O. B. Hobbema $485.00\n\nThis oven is offered subject to prior sale, and we hope you will give it your immediate consideration.\n\nWe have also two large used electric ovens on hand, if they would be of any interest to you. Of course, they have\nOttawa, June 10, 1927.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant in further reference to our requirements for a bake oven for shipment to Hobbema, Alta., and quoting a price on your Model \"F\" and a rebuilt Pendrith oven.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the order for the supplying of an oven has been placed with another firm, and I therefore regret being unable to accept either of the ovens on which you quote.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

Page, Esq., Accountant & Purchasing Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have your letter advising us that an oven has been purchased for shipment to Hobbema.\n\nWe regret losing this business, and would like to inquire, if we may do so without seeming presumptuous, if you purchased an oven of the same capacity for less money than we offered you the Hubbard oven for. We are prompted to ask the question because the model H oven has a rated capacity of about 300 loaves. Other manufacturers offer an oven of the same capacity for less money, but the oven is actually smaller, as you would readily see if the comparison were made by the square foot of baking surface.\n\nThe capacity, of course, is determined by the size of the pan used, and we fear that we have placed ourselves at a disadvantage. You will see that it is a matter of vital importance to us to know if you have made your selection on the rated capacity of the oven, or by the number of square feet of baking surface. This has been done before, and if possible we want to find a way to avoid a recurrence, because we are losing business that goes to others, as their price seems to be lower, but the comparison is an unfair one, both to ourselves and to our customer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHUBBARD PORTABLE OVEN COMPANY LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nHRH.S.C.\n\nPRESIDENT.\nOttawa, June 20th, 1927.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th instant relative to the oven purchased for shipment to Hobbema, Alta., I beg to say that the order for the supplying of this oven was placed with Messrs. Jean J. Daoust, Ltd., St. Boniface, Man., who supplied their No. 4 special oven, having a capacity of 83 sq. ft. baking surface, and will bake from 4 to 5 pounds per sq. ft., according to the size of the pans used.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

There are such desks in another class-room (Primary) but not so old; we could replace the older ones by the latter and ask your approval for another set of desks for the Primary Grade. We have extracted page 10 from the Western School Supply Catalog which illustrates the desks no. 25 and 26. We need 12 of each number, that is 24 desks in all for four rows in a room 22x26x11.\n\nWill you also ask for a teacher's desk? She selected no. 12 Sanitary Desk with Book Rail, and a Chair no. 20. Would be needed also a Reversible Blackboard no. 3, 3\u00bd X 5 with stand.\n\nWe should be very thankful to you if you could obtain those desks for our School, we are in great need of them for the return of the pupils before the month of September.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nRev.

We know that iron is brittle and easily broken when subjected to sudden shock. We know that rolled steel cannot be broken or cut through with the use of a hammer.\n\nFor any purpose of structural purposes, steel, without question, is superior to iron in every point of comparison.

Deputy and Secretary.\nErmineskin Residential School,\nHobbema, Alta., October 16, 1928.\n\nHonorable Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Supt. Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nIn the past, a few times we have been favored with some extra grants from the Indian Department, for the improvement of the Ermineskin Residential School. For those we are indebted towards you and the officers of the Department to a very deep gratefulness.\n\nThis coming year, we would like again to be the recipient of some such favors.\n\nWe would like very much to have a Knitting Machine; we know that P.T. Legare from Quebec has some in stock for $55.00. As we have quite a number of pupils, we find it hard to make all our supply by hand work.\n\nMany of our straw-beds are worn out; we had received a good number of them from the Department a few years ago. Would it be possible to send us 4 dozen of such straw-beds, so as to enable us to replace those that are now worthless?\n\nFor the past years, we had a very poor chicken house, parts of old barns joined together but giving very poor shelter to the chickens and every day less satisfactory. Could we not have a certain grant for building a new chicken-house? It would cost approximately $700.00 or $800.00\n\nWith the hope to see our requests granted,\n\nI remain, honorable Sir,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 26, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 16th instant, concerning the needs at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. I have made a note for next year's estimates in connection with the henhouse. I regret that the Department does not supply knitting machines. With reference to the 4 dozen paillasses, you should take this matter up with Mr. Indian Agent Askey, who will let the Department have a recommendation. It will be necessary for you to tell him the size of the beds that are to be fitted up with these mattress casings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. P. F.

February 23rd, 1929\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the Ermineskin R.C. Indian Residential School, in the Hobbema Agency, which was recently visited by Mr. Inspector Christianson.\n\nYou will note that the fire protection at this school appears to be in good order, and in my opinion it is well that it is, because this is a building that requires extra precautions taken in the way of fire protection. The school has, of course, been found in its usual good order. I doubt whether there is accommodation here for 200 children or not. You will note the Principal states that there is. This school has always been favourably reported upon.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report that while making an inspection of the Hobbema Agency, I also visited the Ermineskin R.C. Boarding School, and am glad to report that this institution is doing excellent work, not only in the school, but also in the community in which it is situated. There are 120 grant earning children in the school, and at the time I was there 123 children were enrolled. The Principal explained that he always carried 2 or 3 extra as he has so many on the waiting list that he is sometimes obliged to take an odd one in without getting the grant for it.\n\nI visited all the classrooms and was well impressed with the work that is carried on there. One girl is in Grade 8 and it is the intention of the school authorities to get her into high school next year. However, I will not enlarge on the classroom work at all as this school was inspected by the Public School Inspector on November 15th last.\n\nI would just like to say that I checked up on the meals, etc., as I was so impressed with the healthy appearance of the children, and I consider that they are certainly well cared for. They are well clothed and well fed. Besides the regular three meals a day, they all get a good lunch at 4 o'clock when they come out of the classroom.\n\nAs usual\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nAs usual, the school was spotless from top to bottom. You know what the building is like. The old part is getting the worse for wear and if school is to be carried on for some years in this building, a lot of repairs will have to be made, but the Principal is in hopes of the Department building a new school in the near future, and he informed me that if he had the room he could get 200 children. However, I informed him that I knew nothing about the Department's intentions with regard to a new school being built.\n\nThere are 12 cows kept at the school. At the time of my visit they were milking 4, but some of the others were due to freshen in the near future. Very little land is farmed, but an excellent garden is grown at the school.\n\nRegarding fire protection, in my report dated February 14th, 1928, I gave a full explanation of the fire escapes and apparatus. I found this all in good order. Fire extinguishers had all been re-filled and tested during last month. A regular fire drill is carried out from time to time and in the summer time generally every week, and every little while Mr. Askey goes up to the school in the evening to conduct the fire drill himself so, as far as I could see, every precaution is being taken against fire.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to state that I am always well impressed with this institution. Father Moulin, the Principal, is a splendid example of what a Missionary on an Indian reserve should be. If there is sickness he drives night and day. The best of feeling exists between the school and the Agency, which is the way\nway it should be. This, as you are aware, is sometimes hard to bring about.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, March 1st, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your No. 404-11 of the 23rd ultimo enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Christianson on his recent inspection of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. In this connection, the Department is pleased to note that this school is doing excellent work, also, that the pupils are all in a good state of health and that the general conditions are satisfactory. I note that there is proper fire protection and that fire drill is practised regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, May 6, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Reverend Principal of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School has urged the Department to replace the old hen house, and I should be grateful if you would let me have a report and recommendation in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to department No. 112-1-5, dated the 6th instant, I have to advise you that a suitable hen house to meet requirements can be erected for use at the Ermineskin Indian residential school at a cost of about $500.00. If the Department wishes to have the work proceeded with and will advise me, I will make the necessary arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

The Department has paid the account in favour of Mr. R. S. Cresswell, of Wetaskiwin, for the erection of this building; but I am in doubt if this price was to include the painting. If Mr. Cresswell was not responsible for the painting, you might supply $15 or $20 worth of paint to the school and ask them to do the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Guy, advised us to forward to you, if possible in duplicate, our bills for the new installation of Electric Light by the Calgary Power Co. He said that he had a great hope to see these bills refunded to us by the Indian Department, which bills we are enclosing. You will note that the motor has not yet been purchased; we shall take the 5 H.P. motor marked $104.53 from the O'Neill Motor Co., it will be sufficient to pump water and to work the laundry machines.\n\nIt was a necessary improvement as our old engine and batteries were in very bad condition after many years of service.\n\nWe have been favored in the past years with such help from the Indian Department, for which we cannot adequately express our gratitude; we certainly would be very grateful if you could again come to our assistance.\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa, January 7, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing accounts in connection with the installation of electric light at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. I regret to state, in reply, that there has been unusually heavy expenditure from the Vote for Indian Education for the last few months, and there are therefore no funds for the purpose of assisting you in this improvement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. P. P. Moulin, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nErmineskin Indian Res. School,\nHebema,\nAlta.\nOttawa, April 16, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nPursuant to the Deputy Superintendent General's letter to you of yesterday's date, I am instructed to have you arrange for the services of a night watchman at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. The Department will allow a grant of $40 a month for this service and considers that the school should be responsible for the man's board. The watchman should be chosen with care and must be a thoroughly reliable person, who will make continuous patrol of the main building at night. Vouchers in this connection should be forwarded once every quarter and should be in favour of the Principal, who will pay the night watchman. Please make the arrangements without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to Department's letter No. 112-1-1, of the 16th April last, I now wish to make application for authority to purchase a night watchman's clock, and a fire alarm bell for use at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, in order to obtain the proper service from the newly appointed Night Watchman, Mr. Hector Nault, who has been engaged on your authority.\n\nI have instructed the Agent to make inquiries as to the cost of erecting two iron fire escapes. When this information is received shall again communicate with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. W. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 16, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 404-11 of the 10th instant, requesting authority to purchase a night watchman's clock and fire alarm bell for use in the Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase of a suitable fire alarm bell. The school authorities could, no doubt, arrange for any installation required without expense to the Department. If you consider that a night watchman's clock would be really necessary, you may also purchase same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nApril 15, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 404-11A R.C. of the 12th instant, with reference to the Ermineskin Indian Residential school.\n\nAt a later date, we will have to give serious consideration to the question of a new building at this point. When you write the Principal, you should emphasize the Department's wishes concerning fire drill and fire prevention. Neither Mr. Murison nor yourself state that additional fire escapes are required, so I presume that no action in this connection is necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of 12th ultimo and your reply of the 15th idem, 112-1-1, I beg to say I have secured a quotation from the Edmonton Iron Fence and Wire Works for two fire escapes of the kind erected at Edmonton Residential School and at one of the schools at Onion Lake, to be erected at Ermineskin School, one at each end of the building. They are willing to fit two new doors with casings and locks and remove one radiator and erect the two escapes with poles complete for $440.50 plus sales tax.\n\nI beg to recommend that their offer be accepted as the old building is nothing but a fire trap. At any time we decide to raze the building the fire escapes would be part of the salvage and could be erected elsewhere.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nJune 23, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 17th of May with reference to the new fire escapes required for the Ermineskin School, I beg to say that you may proceed with this work at the price quoted in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Last year we had always more pupils than the number authorized for.\n\nWith the hope that all our requests will receive a favorable answer,\n\nWe remain,\n\nDear Sir,\nYours very truly.\n\nP.

The actual School is too small to accommodate all the children of school-age, and besides it is a perpetual fire-trap that may at any time play havoc with the staff and the children. They have now a night watchman and the pupils seem to have very good spirit, but one never knows when the fire-bug will get hold of those small Indians.\n\nWe spoke together already a few times about the need of a new fire-proof school at Erminskin, but allow me once more to lay much stress on the subject.\n\nIn the mean time and to promote furthermore the good work done by the actual School, I recommend to your benevolent attention the other few items mentioned in the Principal's letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. Langlois O.M.I.\nProvincial\nOttawa, November 4, 1931.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with enclosure, concerning the needs at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. I have made a note for consideration when estimates are being prepared. Until such time as a new building can be provided, every energy should be directed towards safeguarding the staff and pupils in the event of fire. Constant watchfulness and regular organized fire drill are absolutely essential.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVery Rev. U.
