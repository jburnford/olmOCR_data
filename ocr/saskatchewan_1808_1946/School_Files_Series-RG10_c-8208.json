Something should be done to correct the unsanitary condition of the closets which are in a disgraceful condition at the present time.\nOttawa, June 28th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Mud Lake Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the condition of the closets. He states they are in an unsanitary condition.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will arrange, during the present summer holidays, to have these closets thoroughly repaired and cleaned and put in a good sanitary condition. This work should be carried out at as low a cost as possible, and the department will expect you to see that a satisfactory job is completed.\n\nWhen the work has been finished, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of any material supplied and for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nPeterborough, Ontario.\nAugust 8th, 1929.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nOn my last visit to the Reserve I went over the school at Mud Lake Reserve with Mr. Lewis and the whole building at the present time requires some brightening up and cleaning up, inside and out. A coat of paint on the floor of the Senior room and the woodwork throughout the whole interior repainted would make a much cleaner and brighter school. Many of the window panes need putty and the sash, window and door frames are in need of a coat of paint.\n\nMr. Lewis, the school teacher, at the Reserve is now of course living on the Reserve and he stated to me that he would be glad to do some of the work on the school if the Department will supply the material, provided he could start on the job right away and he stated that he would do it for $2.50 for a ten hour day.\n\nAt a small cost I think a coat of paint where needed would be well spent and preserve the building. Also the re-glazing of the windows would make the building easier to heat.\n\nIf this is acceptable to the Department for us to go ahead I could supply them with an estimate of how much paint it would take and materials. For all that would be required we could purchase it locally as needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nMud and Rice Lake Reserves.\nOttawa, August 12th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, relative to the repairs required to the Mud Lake Indian Day School building.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that you recommend that the floor of the senior room be given a coat of paint and that the woodwork throughout the interior of the building be repainted, also that many of the window panes required to be reglazed. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department as soon as possible the approximate cost of carrying out the renovations and repairs which you consider to be necessary. When we have this information, consideration will be given as to whether funds for the purpose can be provided or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nPeterborough, Ont.,\nAugust 27, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to say that in connection with repairs required to Mud Lake Day School building that my report is as follows as to the approximate cost. Mr. Lewis agrees to work for $2.50 for a ten hour day. I should judge there would be in the neighbourhood of from ten to fourteen days at this rate.\n\nIt is necessary to buy about four gallons of paint and three good brushes. I believe the paint, and putty would be approximately about twenty dollars, the labour about twenty-five, the whole thing coming as nearly as I can figure about sixty dollars. The work to be done is as follows:\n\nThe floor down stairs has never been painted. It is soft wood, it would be necessary to paint this and the wainscoting. The ceiling needs an additional coat to brighten it up. The room upstairs has a hardwood floor, but the woodwork needs painting. All outside the building is in a very bad condition. It would be necessary to paint all window sills and woodwork also need re-glazing.\n\nTrust this is the information you wish to secure, and trust you will give an early reply in order that I may secure Mr. Lewis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent,\nMud and Rice Lake Reserves.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Supt.\nOttawa\n\nCurve Lake\nMay 1929\n\nAt a regular monthly session of the Mississaugas of Mud Lake held on May 6th 1929 a resolution was passed by motion of T.D. Taylor seconded by Russel Taylor for this council to buy a new furnace for the school and repair the furnace in the church out of the funds of the Band.\n\nChief D.E. Whelan\nGeorge Coppaway\nPeterborough, Ont.,\nSeptember 4, 1929.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir,\n\nRe- your letter 25-1-5, March 2, 1929.\n\nThe matter of purchasing a stove for use at the Mud Lake Reserve Day School, and the repairing of the one in the church, I beg to say that I have had experts look over both furnaces, and it has been stated by all that they are beyond repair and out of date.\n\nThe one in the church was found to be in very bad condition. I have made inquiries at the Reserve as to their supply of body wood for heating purposes and find that this is very limited, coal being practically as cheap. I had two local firms draw up costs for installing new furnaces both in the school and church. The one most reasonable has been described as follows.\n\nFor furnishing and installing two No. 10-24 Pilot Success Pipe Furnaces at Curve Lake church and school, Five Hundred and Ninety-eight dollars. Both furnaces will have a heating capacity of forty thousand cubic feet, and will be equipped with fire grates to burn either coal or wood. This tender was supplied by Archibald and Richmond, plumbers of Peterborough.\n\nAll parties consulted informed me that present equipment would be impossible to repair for permanent satisfaction. It has been rather difficult to get local plumbers to supply a quotation during this busy season and hence the reason for delay, but as furnaces have been not urgently required I trust that September and October would be adequate time to install this equipment.\nYou authorized me to purchase the equipment but as the cost is as high as it is, I thought best to inform you.\n\nI am attaching a resolution covering the matter of repair of the furnace for the church passed at a regular session of band council.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMud and Rice Lake Reserves.\nOttawa, September 12, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, relative to the installing of a furnace in the Mud Lake Indian Day School and also in the church on the Mud Lake Reserve, and furnishing a quotation which you received for the supplying and installing of same.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to your letter of February 22nd, last, and the Department's reply thereto of March 2nd. It was understood at that time that a wood burning stove only was required for each of the above named services, to replace stoves of a similar type which were burned out. The Department did not understand from the letter referred to that it was intended to replace these stoves with furnaces.\n\nIn the resolution of the Mud Lake Band, which you forwarded, it is noted that repairs only to the furnace in the church are to be paid from Band Funds. As the installing of these furnaces would be paid from different appropriations - the one in the school from the vote for Indian Education, and any repairs or a new furnace for the church from Band Funds - it would be necessary that separate quotations be obtained. It is noted that you furnished only one quotation - that of Archibald & Richmond, Plumbers, of Peterborough. The Department would like you, if possible, to obtain quotations from other firms in Peterborough or elsewhere for the supplying and installing of a furnace in the school and also for the making of any repairs or the installing of a new furnace, if you consider same necessary in the church. The cost of installing the furnace in the school and church should be stated separately. When we have further particulars as to the need of the furnaces instead of stoves, and the cost involved for each service separately, consideration will be given to authorizing having the work carried out. You should give this matter your prompt attention, in order that, if it is decided to install new furnaces, the work can be completed before the extreme cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In the school there are three registers taken off to heat the various rooms. The only thing that could be done would be to install furnaces.\n\nThe supply of good body wood is practically exhausted at the Reserve and the caretaker and teacher inform me that it is impossible to sustain the heat necessary for the comfort of the pupils from the small firewood secured at the Reserve or nearby. A combination wood-burning and coal-burning furnace would be the most economical installation in the end.\n\nAs to the present equipment, it is so obsolete and out of date and in such poor repair, that anything done in the nature of repairing would be only temporary.

Indeed the success of the Hecla Pipeless Furnace is due to the combination of the superiority of the pipeless system of heating in Canada. It contains the same excellent features as the \"Hecla\" Pipe Furnace, including the patented automatic control valve, which is fitted with closed impervious and embodies the practical results of many years study and experiment. In thousands of Canadian homes the \"Hecla\" Pipeless is giving the same satisfaction that has built the reputation for the \"Hecla\" Pipe Furnace.\n\n\"SAVES ONE TON IN SEVEN\"\n\nSOLD BY\n\nW. R. TURNER\n206 Simcoe St.\nPETERBORO, ONTARIO\nThe \"HECLA\"\n\nCanada's Premier Furnace\n\nFully Guaranteed\n\nThis furnace when installed according to our instructions must give the satisfaction we have promised or if not approved, the purchase price refunded.\n\nNo other Furnace offers you so much in Comfort, Ease of Operation or Fuel Saving!\n\nTHE HECLA cannot be compared with any other Furnace because it has features that no other furnace possesses. First, it has Fused Joints ensuring that the circulation of air is pure and clean\u2014absolutely free from gas or dust. Second, the Circular Water Air Pan is constructed of Cast Iron\u2014the most essential to health and comfort. Third, Steel Ribbed Firepot cuts down fuel consumption from 13 to 15%, and make six tons do the work of seven. From Base to Dome, every part that comes into direct contact with live coal is constructed of Cast Iron. It is built to give a lifetime of useful service and heating comfort.\n\nClean, Pure Air\u2014Always\n\nIt is impossible freedom from gas and smoke, that is secured by Patented Fused Joints. The joints are made of ARMCO IRON, a special cast resisting material, are fused to the Cast Iron in an unusual manner. The joint is not only absolutely tight and that will stay tight. This cannot be said for any other furnace. The joints are welded which is opened up by the difference in the rate of expansion between Cast Iron and Steel.\n\nHealthful Humidity\n\nThe HECLA furnaces properly humidifies air to every part of the house. A large circular waterpan in the base is so located that each return air pipe gets its share of moisture. Thus the heating humidity is distributed evenly throughout the house. When properly humidified, actually seems warmer and pleasanter than dry air at 70 degrees. It also means a saving on fuel.\n\nImproved Type Combustion Chamber\n\nThe HECLA furnaces have heavy cast iron and steel construction result even if the fire be built up beyond the firebox line. The chamber walls also instead of being vertical are slightly tapered toward the bottom. This prevents the hot gases from escaping and the combustion chamber to expand as it becomes heated, to prevent the escape of heat. This gives a more efficient utilization of heat than in the case of the ordinary straight walled combustion chambers.\n\nDoes its Duty with a Minimum of Attention\n\nOther convenient features which make the daily care of a furnace include: (1) a good wide firing door big enough to take a large shovelful of coal or chunk of wood; (2) Strong, well-made grate bars that grip the fuel firmly and prevent it from sliding out; (3) Independent grate bars that keep the ashes in any part of the fire without using a poker; (4) A large, well fitting ashpan which catches all the ashes and minimizes dust in the cellar; (5) An efficient regulator equipment so that damper can be easily adjusted from outside; (6) Special patented chimney draft control.\n\nThe \"Hecla\" burns any kind of fuel\u2014hard coal, soft coal, coke, wood or natural gas. A special wood grate can be supplied with the furnace and easily shipped in for use, or a gas ring can be substituted for the lower part of the firepot for use with natural gas.\n\nManufactured by CLARE BROS. & COMPANY, LIMITED ... Preston, Ont.\n\nBranches at WINNIPEG, CALGARY, EDMONTON, SASKATOON, VANCOUVER\nThe \"HECLA\" Warm Air FURNACE\n\nWith the Special, Patented, Two-piece STEEL-RIBBED FIREPOT\n\nAn Exclusive Feature\n\nNo part of a Warm Air Furnace is so important as the Firepot, first, because it has to withstand the fiercest heat of the fire and second, because it constitutes the most effective radiating surface of the whole furnace. The ideal Furnace Firepot design is one which will stand up to the strain out under the severe strains placed upon it by Hard Coal and particularly Soft Coal and Coke and at the same time has the largest amount of effective radiating surface.\n\nThe two piece Steel Ribbed Firepot (an exclusive Clare Bros. invention) most nearly meets these ideal conditions. It is guaranteed for twenty years and has three times as much surface as any other Firepot on the market.\n\nThe scarcity of Hard Coal and its high price has brought into general use, to an increasing extent, the more free burning fuels, such as Soft Coal, Semi-Anthracite and particularly Coke. These fuels reach a high temperature much more quickly than does Hard Coal and in consequence increase the danger of burning out and cracking the ordinary type of Firepot, whether it is made in one or two pieces and with or without Cast Iron Flanges.\n\nThe Steel Ribbed Firepot introduced and developed by Clare Bros. is the only one that will successfully withstand the severe strains of the prevailing fuels. It is heavy and by reason of having three times as much radiating surface, never becomes white hot, will not burn out and is practically indestructible.\n\nActually SAVES ONE Ton in SEVEN!\n\nGreater Radiating Surface\n\nIncreased radiating surface for firepots has always been sought by Furnace Manufacturers in place of the ordinary Cast Iron Firepot by Cast Iron Flanges\u2014the latter being now in general use. The practice of moulding however, limits the number of Cast Iron Flanges that can be used because of the one inch above one inch in width of the primary surface of the firepot.\n\nIt was only when Clare Bros. invented and patented the use of Steel Ribs in Firepots that the number of ribs could be increased. On a 19 inch firepot there may be nine in each section, using only half as much of the primary surface of the pot as do 17 Cast Iron ribs.\n\nInstead of 1,000 square inches of radiating surface on a cast ribbed firepot, the Steel Ribbed firepot of corresponding size has 3,000 square inches\u2014three times as much surface to radiate heat into the house and stop it from going up the chimney.\n\nSteel Ribbed Firepots therefore mean not only durability but economy, long life and less fuel. Careful tests have shown this saving in fuel to be from 13 to 15%. Six tons and a Steel Ribbed firepot will do the work of seven tons with the ordinary firepot.\n\nThe Firepot with a 20 year guarantee\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nReference your letter #25-1-S.\n\nI beg to submit the following tenders in connection with this work at the Mud Lake Reserve.\n\nI requested five tenders and received three replies.

I examined the building which was originally built for a Community Hall and is not altogether suitable for a school. These Indians are clamouring for a new Council Hall, but if any building is anticipated, it should be a new two class School, and the present structure turned over to be used as a Council Hall. Before leaving on my inspectional trip, I was instructed to examine the school furnace. I found it entirely useless, and dangerous to the building. It has been in use for twenty-five or thirty years. A new furnace is being installed at the present time. The Agent informs me that both teachers are giving very good service and that the pupils are making steady progress. Attendance is irregular especially in the fall and winter months owing to families moving around.\n\nThos.

(RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nA Long Fire Travel\u2014Another Sense for the Pease \"Economy\"\n\nWhen this picture was taken the camera was looking down on the top of an uncased Pease \"Economy\" Furnace and it explains the fire travel very clearly. You will notice that the hot gases strike the top of the combustion chamber and then pass through the flue pipe (two of them \"double hoods\"), making the top of the furnace very hot with the seat radiator around both sides of the Pease Heat Radiator. The fire travels until it reaches the smoke collar at the rear. By this time there is very little heat left to pass up the chimney. The cold air supply is connected to the bottom of the galvanized iron casing that encloses the Pease furnace, and the cold air heated by passing over the hot sides of the casing, enters the combustion chamber and radiator. It leaves the furnace through the opening just taken from the top of the casing and passes to the upstairs rooms. One item we must keep in mind is that practically all heat waste is eliminated with a Pease \"Economy\" Furnace. It is so constructed that you get every bit of heat that it is possible to extract from the fire.\n\nFrom CONTINUATION SCHOOL, Tamworth, Ontario:\n\n\"Regarding the efficiency of the two Pease Economy Furnaces installed in the Continuation School at Tamworth, I might state from the reports of the pupils and janitor as well as from my own knowledge of three years teaching in this school, that this is the first winter that the school has been warm. This year, with the old system, all overcoats last year, with the old heating system, we wore overcoats in the class room part of the time.\"\n\nPease\nThe Firepot and Shaking Arrangement of a Pease \"Economy\" Furnace\n\nYou will notice that the Pease Firepot is practically vertical on the inside. The purpose of this method of construction is that the firepot will be self-cleaning. In other words, ashes do not adhere to the sides as with a tapering firepot and this heating surface is therefore 100% efficient at all times. In addition the Pease Firepot is made in two sections, joined together by gas-tight cup joints. Expansion and contraction in this way are provided for.\n\nThis illustration will also explain to you the shaking arrangement of the grates.\n\nFrom JOHN ELSON, 108 Edgewood Ave., Toronto, Ont.:\n\n\"I am glad to say that my Pease Furnace is satisfactory in every way and that we are getting very good results from it with no trouble whatever. It burns anything and gives good heat; there is a great difference in the warmth of the house this winter; in fact, we are quite comfortable, which is saying a great deal.\"\nSOMEBODY has aptly said, \"True salesmanship consists in selling goods that don't come back to people who do,\" and in these fourteen words is expressed the real reason why Pease Furnaces are in such great demand.\n\nAbout fifty years ago the originators of Pease Foundry Company Limited, set out to produce a furnace that would earn a reputation for itself, and today there is no section of Canada in which the Pease \"Economy\" Furnace is not known.\n\nAs a heating appliance that will produce ample heat from a small supply of fuel, the Pease \"Economy\" stands in a class by itself. Large numbers of testimonials on file from satisfied users prove this statement conclusively.\n\nIn addition to this the very fact that Pease \"Economy\" Furnaces are being used in China, Japan, England and Scotland would indicate that they must have exceptional merit.\n\nIf you have the opportunity to carefully examine a Pease Furnace you will find that every part is extra heavy and well made. At the present time many of our \"originals\" are in use, and although they have rendered good service for forty years or more the users do not feel that it is necessary to replace them for some time to come.\n\nIf you want a furnace that will last for many years, and one that will be economical on fuel, specify a Pease \"Economy.\" You will never regret your decision and your lowered fuel bills will more than offset the slight extra cost of the \"Economy\" over so-called \"cheap\" furnaces.\nNotice that Pease Heat Radiator around the dome. Also the convenient cleanout doors, as well as the dust pipe that draws the fine dust up over the fire instead of allowing it to come through the ashpit door when not tightly closed. In every respect the \"Economy\" is a furnace that will appeal to the man or woman looking for a quality product.\n\nFrom Mrs. McEWEN, Catherine St., Fort William, Ont.:\n\n\"We have had splendid results from the Pease Economy Furnace. Our house was never cold all through the severe test of last winter. It is also easily managed and is a fuel saver. We are surely satisfied with the investment.\"\n\nPease\nPease Combination Coils\n\nThe Pease Combination Heating System is simple and comprehensive. By an effective arrangement of coils and air-heating surface, the apparatus is able to warm and distribute air, and WITH THE SAME FIRE, to promote a circulation of hot water.\n\nThe Pease Combination Coils illustrated on this page are placed in the combustion chamber directly over the fire, thereby MAKING DOUBLY USEFUL a large portion of heat energy which would otherwise be used only in heating air. When Pease Combination Heating Systems are in service, the cold air is warmed by passing over the heating surfaces of the furnace in the usual way, is moistened by evaporation from the water pan, and is distributed to the rooms above through warm air pipes and registers. These registers are placed in the rooms nearest the furnace, while the exposed and more distant rooms are heated by hot water radiators. Thus a method of ventilation is assured.\n\nPease Combination Coils are made in sixteen sizes, rated to carry from 80 to 570 square feet of direct hot water radiation in addition to that of the mains. These sixteen sizes are interchangeable so that the castings may be assembled in any particular form that may be necessary, the total number of variations being very large.\nAnother Dollar Saver\u2014\nThe Pease Air Blast\n\nAt the back of and just above the firepot is an ingenious device whereby a strong current of hot air enters the combustion chamber and mixes with the gases generated by the fire, insuring complete combustion. This is the Pease Air Blast. It has a sloping hood over the outlets to prevent its becoming clogged with ashes or coal-dust and is connected to an opening in the outer casing.\n\nExplained in a simple manner this means that you burn a certain amount of air which costs you nothing. Another strong argument in its favor is that the Pease Air Blast enables you to burn soft coal as fuel.\n\nAt the present time there are innumerable appliances called \"gas blasts,\" \"Carburetors,\" etc., being offered for use with furnaces, but the Pease stands alone as being the introducer of this fuel saver in Canada. It has formed part of our regular equipment for many years and is one of the main reasons why the Pease \"Economy\" is looked upon as a most efficient heating outfit.\n\nA Great Convenience\u2014\nThe Pease Domestic Water Heater\n\nImagine the convenience and comfort of having a steady supply of hot water at the faucet as long as the fire in the furnace is kept burning. By referring to the illustrations you will notice that the Pease \"Economy\" Furnace has two openings on the left hand side of the head door through which pipes pass to connect to the Pease Domestic Water Heater. These heaters are illustrated above and may be installed at any time without taking down the furnace or drilling any holes. The tank may be in the basement or upstairs, whichever is most convenient to the user.\n\nPease\nThis One-Piece Ashpit Eliminates the Dust Nuisance\n\nHow often have you heard people complain about the dust that comes from a poorly constructed furnace? And maybe in your own mind you have condemned all furnaces for this reason, little thinking that in the Pease \"Economy\" a simple idea has been perfected that overcomes this trouble.\n\nIn most furnaces the ashpit is moulded in several sections and bolted together. This is a cheaper way of manufacturing, but it leaves joints through which ashes and dust can escape into the air chamber and then to the rooms above. The Pease \"Economy\" Ashpit, however, is different as it is cast in one solid piece and no dust can possibly escape through it. It is absolutely dust-tight.\n\nIn addition, this ashpit is extra large, holding a liberal deposit of ashes. Think what this convenience will mean.\n\nFrom L. E. McLEAN, 7 Alexander St., Belleville, Ont.:\n\"The Pease Economy Furnace we have found entirely satisfactory. It means a saving of about 20% in the fuel bill.\"\n\nPease\nYou will appreciate the Pease Vertical Shaker\n\n\"No more stooping or back-breaking work.\" That's our slogan when we speak of the shaking arrangement in the Pease \"Economy\" Furnace.\n\nThis idea is most effective yet very simple in construction. The grate bars are extra heavy, cannot be forced out of position and will actually break any clinker that may become lodged between them. There is nothing to get out of order or to warp.\n\nThe vertical shaker is, perhaps, the most distinguishing feature of a Pease \"Economy\" Furnace as it appeals to every user. The fact that it enables a woman or small child to shake the fire quite easily makes it particularly desirable.\n\nWhen the fire requires to be dumped the shaker is pulled out as far as it will come. The grates are then in a vertical position, leaving wide openings through which they clean themselves.\n\nGRATES FOR BURNING WOOD\n\nWhere a supply of wood is available, a special wood burning grate should be used. This is simply a circular piece of perforated cast-iron cut across, and can be placed in position by anyone in a few moments. This grate rests on the regular coal grates and may be removed at any time.\n\nFrom Mrs. T. J. TOLTON, 1405 Isabella St., Fort William, Ont.:\n\n\"I am burning hard coal and coke in my Pease Furnace with splendid results. Last year I used a \u2014\u2014 and the year previous a \u2014\u2014 furnace, but did not get anything like the results I am getting from this Pease Furnace. I can thoroughly recommend same.\"\n\nPease\nSectional View of a Pease \"Economy\" Furnace\n\n900 Series\n\nHere is the 900 Series Pease Economy Furnace for the man who wants particularly to burn soft coal. Notice that special cast iron section between the combustion chamber and the top of the firepot. This enables one to carry a bed of fuel deeper than ordinary, and naturally means a longer firing period.\n\nFrom Mr. FRANK TOUTT, Kincardine, Ontario:\n\nI have been using the Pease \"Economy\" Furnace for two years and I am very well pleased with it. I think there is no other furnace which will give as much heat from as little fuel as the \"Economy.\" I am heating an entire country house and it is quite economical at the time. We just used two tons of coal for three months. I think it is a fuel saver and a heat producer.\n\nPease\nThe Pease \"Economy\" Combination Furnace\n\nThis sectional view explains very clearly the principle of the Pease \"Economy\" Combination Furnace. Specially constructed water coils are fitted into the combustion chamber of the furnace and they supply heated water to the radiators, while warm air is carried to the registers in the usual manner.\n\nPease\n### Capacities, Dimensions, etc., of Pease Economy Furnaces\n\n| No.   | Capacity (Cu.

Eastwood Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nChief Dan Whetung visited the Department today and was discussing the educational needs for the reserve. At the present time, the Department is using the Council hall for two classrooms. We should vacate this property as soon as funds can be provided for the erection of a suitable school building. The old school on the far side of the church has good lumber in it and it might be possible to effect a saving by using the materials there. The Chief thinks that the old school building site is a good one and it is somewhat removed from the highway. The teacher's residence is not required, as the Department is renting a mission house from the Band, paying $100 a year rental.\n\nThe Department should not favourably consider a request for rental for the council hall which we are using at present, as we have put in a new furnace, have painted it and are keeping it in good repair as long as it is used for school purposes.

The janitor has refused to do this work, as it has been done by different people from time to time as needed. It has been proposed that the closets be cleaned at least six times a year at a cost of $8.00. In the past it has cost $5.00 and for the two a total of $10.00 and they have not been kept in first class order.\n\nThe intention of the Council was to make one man responsible for the completion of this work when necessary. I am enclosing a voucher covering the cost of this work on May 19th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nMud and Rice Lake Reserves.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | Authority Dept.

I would recommend that two new closets be built as soon as funds are available, this fall if possible.\n\nThos.

He recommends that two new closets be erected this Fall if possible.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will make early arrangements to have two new closets erected. They should be of a size and type considered by you to be satisfactory. They should be erected on the site of the present closets, or if you think it would be advisable to have them erected on a new site, you may do so. The old closets should be taken down and the ground properly filled and levelled. All expense in the erection of the new closets should be kept as low as possible. The Department will rely on you to see that a satisfactory job is completed in the erection of these closets. It may be that some of the material in the old closets could be utilized in the erection of the new closets and you may arrange for the purchase of any other lumber and materials required, also for the labour in putting up the closets. It might be advisable to have screened approaches erected to each, but the Department will leave this matter in your hands. If you consider that these approaches are required, you may have the work carried out. The entire work should be completed before the extreme cold weather sets in.\n\nAfter the closets have been erected and all work completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the materials and for the labour employed.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nA.

Two classrooms are required. One should be considerably larger than the other, so that it could be used for school concerts and other functions. A room for the children's lunch hour is not required. A central site on the public part of the reserve can be secured immediately to the west of the church, where there is at present an old frame building on a stone foundation. I suggested that they arrange to have this old building demolished without cost to anyone. This site is central for the reserve and is about 75 yards west of the main corner. Behind it and the church property is the agricultural ground. I informed Mr. Eastwood and Chief Whetung that the Department hoped to get the funds for the new building at the coming session of Parliament.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Quite a number of the other panes need putty. The total cost of material would be about $2.00. The caretaker has agreed to supply the labour.

W. M. Eastwood\nIndian agent for\nRice & Mud Lake Reserves.\n\nCurve Lake\nOntario\nDecember 17, 1934\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt a regular monthly council meeting of the Mississaugas of Mud Lake Band held at the Council Hall on Friday, December 7, 1934, the following resolution was moved by Councillor James McCue. Seconded by Councillor Albert Whiting and carried:\n\nAs the present school class rooms are held in our Council Hall, which is unsuitable in every way for this purpose and there is not sufficient accommodation for the number of pupils attending schools, we request the department at Ottawa to grant us a proper school for this reserve and return to us our Council Hall for the purpose it was originally intended.\n\nChief D.E. Whiting\n\nGeorge Coppaway, Secy.\nPeterborough, Jan. 17, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose a resolution passed at a regular meeting of the Mud Lake Band Council held at the Council Hall on the Reserve on the 17th of December last.\n\nThe building referred to in the resolution is a two-story, three-roomed brick building originally built as a Town Hall or Council Hall. It has been used for some years for a school. At the present time there are 63 pupils attending school on the reserve. Mr. Rome conducts the senior classroom on the ground floor, with an attendance of 26 pupils. Miss Long has a junior class with 37 pupils on the second floor. The building not being designed in the first place for a school, has a great many disadvantages. The classroom downstairs has no room for additional desks. At the present time it is crowded with every foot of space used. The lighting is very poor and in the winter months it is difficult for the children to see the blackboards after two o'clock.\n\nThe junior class on the second floor has just sufficient room. The lighting is from three sides and, although much better than the senior classroom in this regard, there are cross lights which are difficult to overcome. About four years ago a new heating furnace was put in this building. This has been working out very satisfactorily. The whole building needs considerable repairs. Several large cracks have appeared in the walls within the last year and, although not endangering the building, will have to be looked after when the weather permits in the spring. The whole building requires painting inside and out.\n\nThe building is not suitable for the purpose it is now used for, and for some time now the old church has been used for a Council Hall and Community Hall. This has been dilapidated for years and not worth the expense of repairs. It is near to the point of not being able to be used for any purpose. This possibly is one of the reasons for the resolution requesting the return of the hall as a Council Hall.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nAbout four years ago there was an estimate in the annual appropriation to cover the cost of a new school at this reserve. This was cut along with other things during the past difficult years. I went into the matter very thoroughly with Mr. Ferrier at that time and this may be on record.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nMud & Rice Lakes Agency.\n\nVME: HMC\nEncl.\nPeterborough, Jan. 17, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nRe Mud Lake Day School.\n\nI have instructed Mr. Rose to carry out fire drills as a precautionary measure at the school. Of necessity the junior classroom is on the second floor which leaves the sill of the windows about 25 feet from the ground. There is only one stairway down from the second floor and this stairway is in a well, with the cellar stair going down underneath, and the ceiling going up to the small bell tower. The upstairs classrooms and the downstairs rooms open into this hallway or well.\n\nWith the small children on the second floor, I would suggest that some other means of getting down should be considered. I think a ladder to reach the second floor windows should be kept near the building or an iron fire escape should be considered. I would suggest that a medium sized fire extinguisher be placed at the main entrance and this be put in charge of the caretaker.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\nMud & Rice Lakes Agency.\nOttawa, January 22, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing a resolution passed at the regular meeting of the Mud Lake Band in Council, on the 17th ultimo, requesting that the use of the council hall for school purposes be discontinued and that a new school building be erected.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will have no funds during the coming fiscal year, 1935-36, to provide the cost of erecting a two-roomed school for the Indian children on the Mud Lake reserve, and it will therefore be necessary to continue the use of the council hall. The need for a new school building will not be lost sight of, but its erection will depend upon Parliament providing funds for the purpose. The Department regrets any inconvenience caused the Council in having to use the old church as a council and community hall.\n\nWith reference to the matter of fire hazard in the exit by the stairway from the junior classroom on the second floor, used for school purposes, there would, no doubt, be certain danger if fire occurred, as the stairway might act as a flue in drawing the smoke and flames. I would request that you state if you would recommend the building of an outside covered stairway, with a door installed, leading into the classroom, and closing up or removing the present stairway. If so, please submit an estimate of the cost of erecting an inexpensive stairway, supported by stout cement piers. If the expenditure would not involve a large amount, favourable consideration might be given to the erection of the outside stairway and discontinuing the use of the inside stairs. The cost of the erection of a properly constructed iron fire escape would not be much less than the building of the outside stairway. In winter, if the escape was covered with snow and ice, it would be dangerous for younger pupils. As this building will be required for school purposes for a considerable period, it will be necessary to take precautions for the safety of the children, in case of fire. You should see that the janitor is careful in keeping the furnace room clean and that no rubbish is allowed near the furnace.\n\nUpon the occasion of your next visit, you should make a thorough inspection of the furnace room at this school. When the Department has your views regarding the building of the outside stairway and the cost involved, consideration will be given to the question of whether the work can be authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nV. M. Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I mentioned the additional exit in my letter as an emergency exit. An open outside stairway would be impractical in the winter on account of snow and ice.\n\nThe school is kept in very good order and particularly the basement. No rubbish is permitted around the building and the furnace is in good condition.\n\nMr. Rome, the principal, has been holding fire drill at intervals and the children now leave the building in good time and order.\n\nI would recommend that a chemical fire extinguisher be purchased and placed at the foot of the stair and a twenty-five foot ladder be built and kept\non hooks on the side of the building for emergency use. I think this\nwould be long enough to reach the eves of the band school and\nalso reach the windows of the second floor of school building.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAgent\nMud and Rice Lakes Agency\nApril 29th 35.\n\nThe Pyrene Mfg.

In this connection it is noted you do not consider either a covered or an open stairway would be satisfactory. It is noted that the Principal is taking every precaution and that no rubbish is permitted around the building or furnace and also that fire drills are held at intervals.\n\nThe Department is placing an order with the Pyrene Manufacturing Company of Canada, Limited, Toronto, to forward, addressed to you, a 1\u00bd gallon Thermene extinguisher, anti-freezing, to be placed at the foot of the present stairway. The account covering the cost will be sent you, and, upon receipt of the extinguisher, in good condition, you should attach the account to a proper voucher form, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nYou may arrange to have a 25-foot ladder built and kept on hooks on the side of the building, for emergency use.

This Council is willing that the Department use these rooms until such time they are in a position to build a new day school which we hope they will be able to do so in the near future.\n\nWe also recommend that the outside brick wall and door steps leading into the School be repaired with brick for walls and stone and concrete for steps.\n\nSigned,\n\nChief D.E. Whaling\n\nAlbert Whiting  \nGeorge Taylor  \nJames McCue\n\nM. Eastwood  \nAgent\nThe SECRETARY  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Ontario\n\nSir:-\n\nRe: Mud Lake Day School\n\nI inclose a resolution of the Mud Lake Band Council suggesting certain changes in the above school.\n\nIn my letter of January 17th, 1935 I explained the inadequate accommodations of the present building in use as a school.\n\nMr. Reme expects an addition in attendance for the fall term and additional desks will be required, and no room available for their placing.\n\nAt the last council meeting I explained this to the Council and asked them their views on allowing the present council room to be included in the senior class room which is on the main floor, and where the situation is more acute.\n\nThis resolution gives the consent of the Council.\n\nI attach a rough sketch of the ground floor plan of the School. The partition is not a supporting wall. The joints are three by sixteen and run as shown in the sketch. The partition is only lath and plaster. I would recommend this.\n\nFor a Council Hall, the Council propose to use the old building to the south of the church which has been used for community purposes.\n\nIn the last paragraph of the resolution there is a recommendation that the brick walls be repaired. This should be done this year. There are several large cracks and the cellar window openings require attention. The arches above these openings have been knocked out by being passed into the cellar.\n\nNew roofing is required. The shingles have been on since the building was erected some thirty-five years ago. The whole building requires painting.\n\nThis seems a large order but I think the whole thing can be done reasonably. I suggest that estimates be secured from contractors, to include the concrete steps. The estimates should be separate for the different work required and if it should be too large amount to do the whole at one time, the more urgent work could be done this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMud and Rice Lakes Agency\nOttawa, May 21, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing a resolution of the Mud Lake Band in Council, approving of the use of the council house for classroom purposes and recommending that certain alterations and repairs be carried out in order to enlarge the senior classroom and put the building in good condition.\n\nI have to request that you will forward an estimate, showing the cost, separately, for each of the following items:\n\n- Removing the partition,\n- Repairing exterior wall and cellar windows,\n- Re-shingling the roof,\n- Painting the building,\n- Installing concrete steps.\n\nIt is thought that Chief Whetung, or some other Indian with experience in building operations, would be able to give you a fairly close estimate of the cost of material and labour required in connection with the above mentioned work. It is understood that all the work could be performed by Indian labour.\n\nI may add that the Department will undertake the cost of removing the partition to increase the classroom accommodation, but it is thought that the Band would agree to providing the cost of shingling the roof and painting the building, from their funds. You should take this matter up with the Band, and, if they are willing to incur the expenditure in painting and repairing the outside of the building, you should forward their resolution when submitting your estimate of the cost of the work. If the Council do not agree to authorizing the cost from their funds, the Department would have no funds this year to paint the building or reshingle the roof.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

It is noted that it will be necessary to have some repairs made to the brick work and to the window arches of the furnace room and, also, that there is a large crack in the north east corner of the building, which requires attention.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have only the absolutely necessary work carried out, before the school re-opens after the present summer holidays. It is noted that you estimate the cost will not exceed $40. You may purchase any materials required and utilize Indian labour, if satisfactory.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, you should forward an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials, and vouchers, in triplicate, for the labour. Please state definitely the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands and will expect you to have the repairs carried out in a satisfactory manner and at the lowest possible cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As there are no persons on the Reserve with experience to build arches etc. and the job could only be done by one man no Indians were employed with the exception of the drawing of materials. Most of the Band members are now busy with their summer work.\n\nMy estimate of $40.00 was Mr. Taggey's figure on the job as I took him with me one evening I had to make a run out to the Reserve.

H. Hunter be dated. The purchases were made May 27th and vouchers have been dated accordingly.\n\nIt has been the practice in the past to purchase cleaning and lighting supplies for the Church, school and public buildings as required. There was no authorizing letter in connection with the purchase of these brooms for this reason. In future purchases of this nature, authorizing letter will first be asked.\n\nIt would appear that 14 brooms in eighteen months for Mud Lake Day School is a considerable number of brooms for cleaning out two class rooms but I know that the whole building is cleaned out, which is practically all used for a school, three rooms, two hallways and the stairway and the basement. The rough pine floors are unpainted and there are a considerable number of knots in the floor and the brooms use up very quickly on this type of floor. I hope to cut down the number of brooms used by asking the caretaker to hang the brooms up or stand them with the broom part up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n385 Water St., Peterborough, Ont.,\nAugust 12th, 1938\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe furnace at the Mud Lake Indian Day School, Mud Lake Reserve, requires a complete set of grates.

There are several handy men but they would have to be expert supervisors.  \n\nBUILDING REQUIREMENTS: ROOMS AND ACCOMMODATION; NUMBER OF PUPILS; TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION.  \nTwo classrooms about 33 x 24 in size, with southern exposure, to supply accommodation for present future requirements\u2014possibly 50 to 100 pupils during life of building. Normal attendance is 60 pupils with two teachers. Building could be one story with basement for heating equipment, fuel, and toilets. Foundation cement and building of brick. Teacher's residence is not required.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF SITE AND CONDITIONS; SUBMIT PLAN; NORTH POINT; NATURE OF SOIL, DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS AND ANY OTHER PARTICULARS.  \nThe site suggested and shown in plan is 150' from lake shore with a gradual slope to water edge, providing good drainage. The soil appears to be loam on gravel and there would be no excavation difficulties as the limestone rock already does not occur here. The elevation is about 20' above lake. The plot of ground owned by the Band and the dimensions are as shown on plan. Any ground space is provided by the balance of the survey.  \n\nWATER SUPPLY: SYSTEM REQUIRED; SOURCE OF WATER, ETC.  \nBy force pump to reservoir from lake for toilets & washrooms. Drinking water from well which could be located anywhere near site.  \n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-5, part 3)  \nPUBLIC ARCHIVES  \nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES  \nCANADA\nTOILET FACILITIES: SEWAGE DISPOSAL; SYSTEM REQUIRED; LOCATION.\n\nWater toilets could be supplied from reservoir in building with water pumped from lake by gasoline when power available by electric pump. Septic tank for sewage disposal. Site proposed for this 150 feet back from lake with a lift of about 20'.\n\nHEATING SYSTEM: TYPE OF FURNACE OR BOILER; FUEL.\n\nHot air heating system with air conditioning equipment. Water would be difficult to use unless intake from lake was buried below first floor. Gas would be available if proposed building additional cost. Costliness is about $750.00.\n\nLIGHTING SYSTEM: SOURCE OF POWER; SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS.\n\nAt the present time, the nearest source of power is the Ontario Hydro line to Buckhorn, about 3\u00bd miles distant.\n\nPower will eventually be available. Building should be wired.\n\nBUILT-IN EQUIPMENT REQUIRED: BLACKBOARD AREA; CUPBOARDS, ETC.\n\nEach class room to have space end with half partition for cloak rooms. Class rooms were 38' x 24' which would accommodate about 40 to 50 pupils each, the two wall surfaces with blackboards at eye level, approximately about 4' high.\n\nSHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS FOR MATERIALS: NEAREST SHIPPING POINT.\n\nLOCAL TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES TO SITE, ETC.\n\nBy Canadian National Railway to Lakefield, Ontario. Then by truck 13 miles to Mud Lake Reserve.\n\nREMARKS:\n\nReservoir tank or well or built into roof could be utilized for additional fire protection. There is no fire protection by the system. Suggested site is away from the road. Recent building used as school is in a noisy location close to traffic through the Village.\n\nINFORMATION SUBMITTED BY: V.M. Eastwood - Indian Agent.\n\nDATE: December 20th, 1938\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDecember 21st, 1938\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs directed in your letter 25-1-5 of December 16th I have completed the building data form to the best of my ability. I also enclose tracing showing the proposed site. The property outlined in the plan is the property of the Band. The plot of ground is rather irregular in shape and if there was not adequate space, additional property could be secured at reasonable cost from Band members. The suggested site is as near to the centre of population on the Reserve as will permit the use of water for toilets, etc. The shoreline is very attractive and gradually shoals out to the channel on Buckhorn lake which passes the Reserve opposite this location.\n\nAt the present time there are about sixty pupils of school age. The present outlook is that there should be a steady increase in the numbers. In 1898 there were 163 members in this Band according to the pay-list; in 1928 - 284; in 1938 - 326. There has been a steady increase in the last few years. Considering the next twenty years requirements, accommodation for one hundred pupils should be provided.\nAccommodation for the teachers in charge of the Mud Lake School is reasonably well provided for at the present time. Chief D. E. Whetung boards them at reasonable rates at his place, a short distance from the school. Should the senior teacher require a separate dwelling the \"Mission House\" could be made available. I have discussed the matter with the two teachers and they seem to be satisfied with present arrangements.\n\nThe labour available at the Reserve is unskilled. I think it essential that the building be carried out by contract, with Indians employed where possible. There are three or four members of the Band who would work well as carpenters, two or three as painters. Excavations and rough forms could be completed by Indian labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\nOttawa,\nDecember 28, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant enclosing building data form with reference to the proposed new two roomed school on the Mud Lake Reserve.\n\nI have reviewed the plan that you forwarded with your letter and I approve of the site that you have chosen. Please obtain a resolution from the Mud Lake Band transferring this site to the use of the Department of Mines and Resources for Indian day school purposes only.\n\nThe information that you have supplied is being forwarded to the Surveys & Engineering Branch and it is our intention to erect a modern two roomed school with full basement which will be used for vocational training purposes. This building should be completed by September 1, 1939.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nV. M.

When providing the money in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40 it was understood that a teachers' residence was required and consequently the amount of $9,000.00 was included. Recent information indicates that a teachers' residence will not be required at this school and, therefore, the amount mentioned above should be more than sufficient to build the proposed new school. If any further information is required please let me know.\n\nFor the past few years the Mud Lake school has been conducted in the Council hall belonging to the Mud Lake Band. It is very unsatisfactory and in making arrangements for the erection of the new school it is desired that the building be ready for occupation by September 1, 1939.\n\nI attach sketch of site of new school.

The site chosen is about twenty feet above the level of Buckhorn Lake and I think it would be possible to get water by digging a well at approximately this level but I am of the opinion that a driven well with say a four or five inch pipe would supply purer water. I believe a well can be driven for $3.00 a foot.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\nOttawa,\nJuly 29, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th instant in which you state that a well is required at the new Mud Lake school.\n\nMr. McKnight of the Surveys & Engineering Branch expects to visit the Mud Lake school next week in connection with the construction of the new building and at that time you should bring to his attention the necessity for a well.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nV.

A dug well, tiled, would cost $7.00 a foot. As a dug well within 100 yards of the location where I would like to have the well located, is about 40 feet deep and on account of the uncertainty of securing water with a driven well, Mr. McKnight informs me that he has insufficient in his contingency fund to take care of a well and to insure water beyond a very moderate depth. In addition to the above costs, I believe there would be 10% for the contractor.\n\nMr. McKnight has therefore asked me to state the facts and ask for advice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nVME:P\nOttawa,\nSeptember 27, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to the proposed well at the Mud Lake Indian day school.\n\nI am not certain from your letter whether you consider a drilled or a dug well would be the more suitable. What type of a well is usually found in the vicinity of the Mud Lake school?\n\nIn the case of drilled wells how deep is it necessary to go? You should also let me know the name and address of well drillers whose services might be obtained.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nV. M. Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n385 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 25-1-5 of Sept. 12th, with reference to the proposed well at the Mud Lake Indian Day School, I consider that a drilled well would be the more suitable as it would be completely closed in and be free from outside contamination and does not require the attention that a dug well would require from time to time, usually as a school well would not likely be used during the summer months and if a well is not used, it is more liable to accumulate silt and other foreign matter.\n\nThe usual type of well in this vicinity has been a dug well but most wells latterly have been driven. Arthur Whetung secured a loan last winter to have a well drilled on his property and it was necessary to go 60 feet to get an adequate supply. Comparing this with a dug well of 40 feet and the cost of each would be $210.00 for a driven well and $280.00 for a dug well. This driven well was in a more rocky formation than exists in the vicinity of the school and it would appear to me that it might be possible to secure water at a shallower depth. The school site is approximately 20 feet above the lake level but I am told this has not a great deal to do with the securing of water.\nThe Secretary,\n\nIn talking to the different well drillers I learn that water cannot be guaranteed at any depth but that 60 feet is a fairly deep well for this vicinity. I know of one well, which was drilled this summer which went down 55 feet, and this was at a 100 yards distance from the lake and about 20 feet above the lake.\n\nIn addition to the above costs there would be the cost of capping and the cost of a pump.\n\nThe only well driller I know of in the County is Melville Crowe of Warsaw Post Office, Peterborough County. His services would be available and his price is $3.50 per foot for a driven well. He uses 5\" pipe and has dug a considerable number of successful wells in the County and elsewhere.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nV.M.Eastwood/P\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the proposed well at the Mud Lake Indian day school.\n\nThe probable cost of this well would involve considerable expenditure which our funds will not permit at the present time. Might I suggest that you purchase two water coolers -- one for each classroom. These can be secured at a very reasonable cost. Water could be carried by the boys each morning to fill these coolers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. V. M. Eastwood,\nIndian Agent,\n385 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRE: New School at Mud Lake Reserve\n\nMr. McKnight, the Engineer in charge of the construction of the new school, and Mr. Wilford, the contractor, advised me that the school should be ready for occupation on or about the first week of November. Would you kindly advise me as to the matter of equipment to be used in the new school. The present seats in the old school, with the exception of six or seven purchased about five years ago, are very old and would not make desirable furnishings for the new school. The teachers' desks are make-shifts. The junior teacher's desk is a small table and the chairs are the ordinary kitchen type.\n\nShould the purchase of new equipment be considered, storage of same can be made at the new school.\n\nThe fuel for the school will be going forward next week. There is sufficient coal in the old school to carry on school at that location until the end of November.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nVME:P\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 27, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, regarding the Mud Lake school, the Department usually supplies single school desks and they can be secured as follows:-\n\nSize #1 - for children aged 16 - 20\n#2 - \" \" \" 12 - 16\n#3 - \" \" \" 10 - 12\n#4 - \" \" \" 8 - 10\n#5 - \" \" \" 5 - 8\n\nPlease let me know the number of each size required.

The contractor hopes to have it completed the first week in November. It will possibly take several weeks to complete the installation of equipment after the contractor is through before it can be occupied. The coal supply was delivered in the bins at the school and the heating plant is now under operation. Considerable work will have to be done on the grounds but this will have to wait for settlement of the filling around the foundations. All who have seen it are very pleased with the school and all members of the Band are quite proud of it.\n\nV.M. Eastwood, Indian Agt.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nAs requested in your letter 25-1-5 and in regard to school desks, for the new school at Mud Lake Reserve, I enclose statement showing the desk requirements as submitted by Mr. Mackey, principal. If it is the intention to provide seats up to the seating capacity of the school, Mr. Mackey estimates that another fifteen seats would be required.\n\nI would suggest that possibly half of these would take care of the requirements for the next three or four years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\nDesk requirements at Mod Lake Indian Day School.\n\n| Size | On Hand | New Required | Total |\n|------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 5    | 2 + 4 end desks | 8 | 10 |\n| 4    | 5 + 1 end desk | 15 | 20 |\n| 3    | 7 + 1 double desk | 12 | 19 |\n|      | 1 end desk |   |     |\n|      | 1 double end desk |   |     |\n| 2    | 2       | 12          | 14 |\n| 1    | 8 + 4 end seats |   | 8 |\n\nTotals: 24\n\nNotes: (a) these are actual present requirements.

The grounds around the building have been levelled off but the ground remains soft and will be muddy in mild weather. May I suggest that about four or five loads of crushed or screened gravel be spread around the approaches.\n\nA mat will be required for the vestibule, which is the main entrance to the school as well as the basement, there being only one entrance to the building. The vestibule or porch has a floor area of 4'3\" by 7'10\". A cocoa mat suitable for the school may be obtained through Pratten Hardware, Peterborough, in two grades, Grade BE $21.00, Grade BG $24.00. This matting is made by the Cobourg Carpet and Matting Co., Cobourg, Ontario and the size of the mat quoted and recommended is 4'3\" by 7'16\". This allows clearance on the edges. Two mats could be purchased, one for each entrance, but I am afraid it would be difficult to keep them placed and there might be the danger of the children tripping on them. I also had in mind two boot scrapers but find these are not made but could be made up for $1.50 by a blacksmith.\n\nThe class room windows face south. The windows are 6'7\" high and 3'15\" wide inside the mouldings. These require window blinds about 3'9 or 10\" wide and there are five such windows in each class room. They make a very bright class room but will require blinds to control the amount of sunlight.\nThe Secretary,\n\nI request your permission to purchase cleaning tools for the care taker. I would suggest a push broom 16\" wide for cleaning daily. These can be purchased for $2.50. The Board of Education at Peterborough purchases a better quality broom for $6.50. It might be that the cheaper broom would do on account of the lesser amount of work. Two mops will be required and two washing pails as well as cleaning materials.\n\nMay I have your authority to purchase locally the minimum supplies required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nVME:P\nOttawa,\nDecember 20, 1939.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant you may purchase for use at the Mud Lake school 1 mat at a cost not exceeding $21.00, 5 window blinds, 1 push broom at a cost not exceeding $2.50, 2 mops and 2 pails.

The caretaker says it is particularly strong when he opens up the school in the mornings after it has been closed all night and the teachers claim it is quite noticeable in the class rooms during the day.\n\nI inspected the building and lavatories and I found there was a strong odor coming from these chemical closets. Instructions for their use have been followed closely by the caretaker and every means of keeping down the odor have been taken with no appreciable results. I called W. R. Turner of Peterborough, who made the installations and he said he would write the factory who made them and give me a reply but he was very doubtful whether any improvement could be made on this type of installation. The school has been in actual use for about a week so it is not a case of having them cleaned out.\n\nI thought I would advise you in order that the matter could be taken up with the contractor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nRE: Mud Lake Indian Day School\n\nI regret to advise that the Black boards at the new school have become loose from the wall to which they were fastened.

They are hung from the top and cemented to the sheathing. Some difficulty was experienced by the contractor with cement breaking loose from the board and more cement was obtained and used.\n\n\"With reference to the chemical toilets these were of type as specified in the specifications and installed according to manufacture's directions. There are two 3\" vent pipes to each tank going up in the partition wall and joining in a larger pipe over the class room ceiling. These toilets were used but very little during construction and no odour was noticeable.\n\n\"In both cases the contractor followed the manufacturer's instructions and carried out the work in a satisfactory manner.\"\n\nYou will note that the installation of the work in question was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's directions.

R. Turner & Sons, Peterborough, sub-contractor, in connection with the chemical toilets and from my conversation with Mr. Ford Turner of this firm I conclude that the present chemical equipment will never prove satisfactory.

On receipt of your memorandum we wrote to the Indian Agent and in a letter dated February 15 he advises as follows:\n\n\"With reference to your letter 25-1-5 of Jan. 25th Mr. Wilfred, the contractor for the Mud Lake Indian Day School, called me by telephone to get in touch with W.R. Turner & Sons, Peterborough, subcontractor, in connection with the chemical toilets and from my conversation with Mr. Ford Turner of this firm I conclude that the present chemical equipment will never prove satisfactory. However, he is writing the manufacturer and will advise me when he receives word from them as to what can be done to improve the present unsatisfactory condition.\n\n\"It is doubtful whether any extensive work can be carried on under the present conditions as the ground is frozen to a depth of about 3 ft. and the road to this Reserve is being kept open with considerable difficulty.\n\n\"The odour throughout the school has become so overpowering that I have instructed the teachers to close the toilets and have had the two outhouses from the old school fitted with boxes and moved to a satisfactory location near the school as a temporary accommodation.

In the meantime we are instructing the Agent to forward to us for payment a voucher for the expenditure of five or six dollars which he has incurred.\n\nDirector.\nFebruary 27, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe - Indian Day School, Mud Lake Reserve, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to the toilet system installed at the above, the operation of which has been unsatisfactory, I may say that a new type, known as a Water Septic System, equal to that manufactured by the Canadian Sanitation Company, was specified in accordance with the recommendation in the building data form submitted by the Indian Affairs Branch for this project.\n\nWhen the plans of this building were being prepared the use of this system was discussed between officers of the Indian Affairs Branch and this Service and an inspection was made of a similar system being installed in a new Separate School at Vankleek Hill, Ontario. In this discussion it was pointed out by our officer that there was no evidence that a system of this type would operate satisfactorily. However, in view of the use of this system in other schools and the desire to obtain an inexpensive indoor system for use in larger Indian Day Schools where a piped water supply is not available, it was decided by the Indian Affairs officers to try the system at the Mud Lake School as a test case.\n\nEnquiries are being made by this Service to determine whether the failure of the Mud Lake system is due to the design of the equipment or to the manner in which it was installed; and also regarding the operation of the system at Vankleek Hill.\n\nA further report on this matter will be submitted as soon as we have received replies to our enquiries.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nMarch 2nd, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nI have your memorandum of February 19th regarding the unsatisfactory performance of the chemical toilets installed in the Mud Lake Indian School, and have discussed this matter with our officers. The attached copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills will explain why this type of chemical toilet was installed.\n\nIt is my opinion that no type of chemical toilet now manufactured, is satisfactory for installation in any residences. Even the best type could only be used in a school when located at some remote point in the building. From the description of the toilets installed for observation in the Mud Lake Reserve School, it would not seem that any result much better than that noted, could be expected.\n\nI am asking Mr. Mills to take up with the manufacturers the unsatisfactory performance of this equipment, and see if they can supply any satisfactory explanation.\n\nDirector.\nMarch 26th 1940\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMcKnight School\nPeterboro.\nMr. Knight Building Inspector,\n\nGentlemen,-\n\nOur Mr. Dean advises that he was consulted when in Peterboro recently regarding a Septic Toilet System installed in the above new school during the past year, and which is not working satisfactorily. Our Mr. Walter Dean was able to advise the man who had installed this equipment regarding the trouble, and we are pleased to be of service in this matter.\n\nIn this connection we might say, that we understood the specifications in this instance read Canadian Sanitation Company equipment or equal. We were not asked to quote on this job so do not know anything about it beyond what was stated above. But we beg leave to point out that our equipment is manufactured throughout of armco Rust Resisting Ingot Iron, 12 gauge in the tanks. We are confident that the equipment installed here in no wise approximates ours in quality, nor are the manufacturers competent in any wise to render that service calculated to continue carefree operation for years and years to come.\n\nThe writer has had seventeen years experience in dealing with Sanitation principally for Schools, and our equipment has been especially developed to stand the rough and tumble usage of the School House. Our experience with Reservations is broad enough so that we know exactly what to expect too, and we try to provide an equipment that can take it, because it surely has to in most of those places.\n\nPlease believe us when we say that we are not writing this complainingly, but merely for your information, and to again assure you that whatever experience we have gleaned in the past seventeen years in this connection is available at any time to your Department in a consultative way without any charge or obligation whatsoever.\n\nVery truly Yours,\nCanadian Sanitation Company\n[Signature]\nSupt.

I believe it could be placed on supports on the ground near the door, with the bell rope high enough so persons unauthorized could not ring the bell. In order to do this the rope could be passed through the top of the bell through a hole in the wall to the class room. The cost would be possibly $10.00 or $15.00.\n\nIn most homes there are no clocks and they depend upon the bell for their time and also for sending their children to school. There is also the matter of warning in case of fire. Ringing the bell for various causes has been a long established custom on this Reserve and the members miss the bell considerably.\n\nWould it not be possible to have the bell taken from the present Council Hall which is closed up generally during the week and erected on the school as proposed. The Council is willing to give the bell for this purpose and it is also necessary to take the bell down from its present location as the timbers are no longer safe.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nIndian Affairs.

Eastwood,\nIndian Agent,\n385 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nRE: Mud Lake Indian Day School\n\nYour letter 25-1-5 of June 3rd requested me to advise when the manufacturer's representative had visited the Mud Lake school in regard to the chemical closets. The arrangements were not carried out as stated in my letter but Mr. Wilford, the contractor, commenced alterations on Monday unknown to me. I do not know whether the manufacturer's representative came through Peterborough or not nor have I seen Mr. Wilford, so I called Mr. Turner, the plumber, who sub-contracted. I was at the Reserve yesterday and saw the work being completed.\n\nApparently the work entailed digging of a 12 x 12 x 3 ft. disposal bed six feet below the surface in front of the school. Eight foot by thirty inch tanks under each set of toilets were plugged and the level was raised to cover and seal the copper tube from each toilet, 10\" in diameter. The present tanks will be maintained at the present level sealing the area of each, which is approximately 24 sq. feet and reducing the area exposed, the 10\" diameter copper tubes under each toilet. The overflow will go to the disposal bed. In addition to this, whereas one overhead ventilator was connected to both toilets, there will be a separate one for each. This, if it will work, should rectify the trouble.\nThe Secretary,\n\nI am somewhat skeptical of the efficiency of the disposal bed to handle the overflow. This disposal bed is seven feet below the grade and it is questionable whether the type of soil which forms the walls of this disposal bed will absorb the overflow. It would appear to me, from what I can recall of the original excavation, of the school, where the rainfall lay in the bottom for some days that this disposal bed would just fill up and remain that way and not take the overflow. If this should happen the pumping out of the tanks would have to be resorted to.\n\nHowever, I hope and trust this arrangement will work satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nVME:P\nOttawa,\nJune 18, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the chemical closets at the Mud Lake School.\n\nIt is hoped that as a result of the work that has been done recently there will be no further complaint regarding these toilets.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. V.

(RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have recently received a letter from the teacher who was appointed to Chemong, which leads me to enquire if something cannot be done to put the house at Chemong Lake in fit condition for a family to live in. The information contained in Mr. Cork's letter is substantially as follows:\n\nThat the house was built over forty years ago by the New England Company, and connected with it was over one hundred acres of land, but when the Company withdrew, eight or nine years ago, the Indians bought the whole property for $2500 (Twenty-Five Hundred Dollars) and it now belongs to the Band.\n\nThe teacher who served under the New England Company occupied the house for several years. After he left it was occupied by an Indian and his family, and this continued for some seven years. A part of the time this Indian paid $2 (Two Dollars) per month rent.\n\nThe Indians now want Mr. Cork to take the house at a rental of $50 (Fifty Dollars) per annum. The house at one time was a good one, but is too large for an ordinary family, and is in a bad state of disrepair. There are a lot of sheds and stables but they also are in a terribly dilapidated condition. It is thought that no paint has been put upon the house since the time it was built, and some of the floors are in very\nvery bad condition. The wall paper is hanging in tatters in most of the rooms, and in some places the plastering is off. The whole place is in an exceedingly dirty condition. Mr. Cork thinks it would take from $250 to $300 (Two Hundred and Fifty to Three Hundred Dollars) to put part of the house in a state fit for decent people to live in. The surroundings outside the house are all right and quite attractive. Mr. Cork has not said anything to the Council, deeming it better, I suppose, that anything of that kind would have more weight if coming from the Department.\n\nYou will readily see what all this leads to. We are very desirous of effecting an improvement in the Day School, and this, I think, Mr. Cork is capable of accomplishing; but if he is to remain it is essential that he have a reasonably comfortable place to live in and this necessitates somewhat extensive repairs. As we have no claim upon the property in any shape or form it is of course out of the question for us to undertake the necessary work. I sincerely hope and trust that the Department may be able to make such representations to the Indian Council as will result in having the dwelling and the necessary out-buildings put in thorough repair.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, December 2nd, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to repairs to the parsonage at Chemong Lake for the use of the teacher, Mr. Cork.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that an officer of the Department visited this reserve a few days ago and upon his return the necessary action will be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nThe Methodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa\nJanuary 10th 1910\n\nMud Lake\n\nMr. Cork, although a married man, is living alone in a small rented house near the school. He told me his family, who live in Toronto, were not disposed to spend the winter on the Island. There is a brick house, formerly used as a Church of England parsonage, which is now in the possession of Band, on the Lake shore, which should be repaired as it is going to crack and ruin for want of a tenant. An Indian was in possession of it for sometime and it suffered in consequence. It would take about $300.00 to make it habitable and remove some of the tumble-down outbuildings which surround it, but, if put in order, it would make a very comfortable residence for the teacher and his family. I have also a view of this house.\n\nSgd Martin Benson\nBrick house, about 12 or 15 rooms, good horse stable, good well water, cistern, orchard, lawn, and about one acre of garden ground, in all, about two acres. Beautiful trees and shrubs also surround the lawn. There is also a good wood shed. The building is beautifully situated near Mud Lake shore, about 50 yards distance, and a half mile from Buckhorn Lake shore. Rose Lake, Long Lake, and other smaller fish abound in these lakes. This dwelling is situated in Cheltenham Village, about 11 miles from the city of Peterborough, and a few miles from surrounding villages; post office a quarter of a mile; handy getting to Peterborough by stage or steam boat every day.\n\n[over]\nOttawa, March 11th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of yesterday's date, in which you were informed that Mr. Agent McFarlane would be instructed to have the parsonage put in repair so that it would be fit for occupation by yourself and family, I beg to say that the Department considers that it will be better to wait until you have seen the house before undertaking any repairs, as it would like to have a detailed list of the necessary repairs and an estimate of the probable cost.\n\nI may state that the Department is not disposed to incur any very large expenditure for the purpose, but is quite willing to make the house habitable. In the meantime, if you wish, you may move yourself and family into the house, which is quite large enough to afford ample accommodation even while undergoing repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn H. Prosser, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nVirginia, Ont.\nOttawa, March 11th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has arranged for a transfer between the teacher of the Georgina Island School and the one at Chemong. As it will be necessary to provide a residence for the new teacher and his family it is considered that the parsonage on the Mud Lake Reserve might be fitted up for his accommodation, and Mr. Prosser has been requested to send in a list of the repairs needed and an estimate of the cost before any expenditure is incurred.\n\nShould you visit the Reserve soon the Department would be glad to have a report from you on the condition of the house and how much you consider it would cost to make it suitable for the teacher's residence. The Department does not wish to incur any great expense and only the outlay necessary should be made.\n\nThe Department considers that if it puts the house in repair it should have the use of it, free, for as many years as it would take at a rental of say $50.00 a year to cover the amount expended. If the Indians are willing that the repairs should be made out of their funds the Department will pay the rent at that rate to the Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nWm.

The Band wishes, as the resolution states, to have it repaired and rented to the School teacher who was married this summer and who is desirous of taking up a dwelling on the Reserve. He would be willing to pay $100.00 per year for rent of the Mission house. A small outlay of money to cover the repairing of same would be needed, about Three Hundred or Four Hundred Dollars ought to fix everything up in livable condition. The plaster has to be fixed, a couple of new doors and some new window put in, some flooring is needed and the roof repaired. The building is well worth spending some money on as it is a brick building and one of the best on the Reserve. In all other ways the building is quite sound.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 6, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant, recommending that the mission house on the Mud Lake Reserve be repaired so that it can be rented to the school-teacher, I beg to say that this is considered favourably by the Department. You should arrange at once to have the repairs made, but should first figure what repairs are absolutely necessary and what the probable cost will be and report to the Department. You mention a cost of $300.00 or $400.00, but should be more certain before undertaking the work. As the season is getting late no time should be lost in getting repairs under way.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher is willing to pay $100.00 per year rent for this house and it is desired to know if he is favourable to having $25.00 per quarter retained here from his salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

INSPECTOR DOWNEY,\ndated October 5th, 1928, on his inspection of the MUD LAKE Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Lewis is now a married man and he is very much inconvenienced by his inability to secure a suitable house on the reserve. He is living five miles from his school. The unoccupied Mission House on the reserve could readily be put in shape for him. It is my thought that this should be done.\n\nI am quite well pleased with the work being done by both of these teachers.\nPeterborough, Ontario.\nNovember 1st, 1928.\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir: Reference letter #25-1-8, Oct. 6th, 1928.\n\nI looked carefully over the mission house recently at Mud Lake Reserve and find that the original amount of Three Hundred Dollars to Four Hundred Dollars suggested for repairs to same to be considerably out in my estimation.\n\nThe house is a twelve room brick structure and it is to be regretted that it has gotten into such a condition as it now stands. The biggest item that I can see in the repairing would be the whole roof re-shingled for which I am getting a quote. The walls are considerably blackened and the whole place needs re-decorating inside. The brick on the north exposure needs re-pointing. The foundation looks very good indeed with the exception of one window having fallen off taking part of the foundation with it. Otherwise the house is in excellent condition and it would be a pity to let it go. I rather think it would be considerably larger than the teacher's requirements. He went through it with me and he suggested walling up part of it so that he could use about half, but I rather think this would be costly unless temporary partitions were put in.\n\nI have approached several contractors to give me a figure on this work but as it is twenty-two miles from Peterborough and a long way to draw material I have been unable to get a definite quote.\nAlong with the other things I have mentioned flooring would have to be laid as the soft wood used has been scored badly. Different families of Indians have lived in it from time to time and have not kept the property in good condition.\n\nI hope to have more definite information on the cost of this work, in the course of a few days, which I will supply you with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nMud and Rice Lake Reserves.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Council of the Indian Reserve here are very anxious that the teacher's residence should be fixed up for me and I have been informed that the Dept. is willing but at present things are at a standstill as far as accomplishing anything in concerned with the Indian Agent about on a deer hunt for two weeks and cold weather setting in the outlook to say the least is discouraging. It is cooling me quite a bit to have\nto drive eleven miles each day to and from school.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is too busy to attend to this matter why not give me the responsibility to put things in shape. You will recall no doubt that you depended on me to make the changes in our school two years ago and I guaranteed a satisfactory job in this case. I realize you would not sanction useless expenditure and there is no one can get you the job you want done on that house any cheaper than I could.\nA general idea of what is wanted is as follows.\n\n1. Roof shingled\n2. Veranda shingled and floored.\n3. 9 panes of glass put in.\n4. Three downstairs rooms\n   sanded and painted also\n5. Chimney rebuilt\n6. Window sashes and frames\n   painted\n7. Outside door put in room\n   to be used as kitchen\n8. A ping (wash) put\n   in kitchen.\n9. Cellar cleaned.\n10. Some of brick on east wall\n    pointed.\n\nIs the Dept. fellows\nthat any of the above are unnecessary after investigation why it will be quite all right.\n\nAt present the greater part of the roof is all right but the south side leaks very badly in several places.\n\nI trust that you will see that some action is taken in this regard as soon as possible.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nMorgan Lewis\nTeacher.\nOttawa, November 21, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nYour letter of the 14th instant has been received with the information that the mission house which was to be fitted up for you as a residence is still without the work being done on it. It was the expectation of the Department that the work would have been done before this and will accept your offer to look after the necessary repairs to the house. At this late season of the year only some repairs can be carried out and the following are approved of:\n\nJust repair the roof on the side where the leaks occur instead of shingling the whole roof.\n\nWith reference to the verandah, it is considered that this might be left until next spring.\n\nThe glass required may be put in.\n\nThe matter of decorating rooms - the Department will approve of one coat of paint on the three downstairs rooms and the hall and also the papering of these rooms. The Department relies on you to buy a moderate price paper say around twenty-five cents a roll.\n\nThe defective part of the chimney should be torn away and rebuilt.\n\nMr. Morgan Lewis,\nSchoolteacher,\nCurve Lake, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The inside of these will in the three rooms and hall be painted in accordance with above authority.\n\nAn outside door may be put in the room to be used as a kitchen and you may also have a sink basin placed there.\n\nIt is considered that the cellar could be cleaned by yourself without the Department going to that expense and the pointing of the bricks on the east wall will have to be left until next season.\n\nYou will obtain competitive prices for material you have to buy and make purchase at the lowest price. Accounts should be submitted to the Department in duplicate and when doing so you should report the prices obtained by you.\n\nIn the matter of labour, if it is essential to have some money to pay the men, the Department will advance a small amount upon request, but please state the smallest amount which will serve your purpose.\n\nSome work in connection with the school was undertaken by you for the Department which proved satisfactory, hence the confidence placed in you in asking you to have these repairs made and I trust that you will keep the expenses at the very lowest possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIt was expected that you would see that the mission house on the Mud Lake Reserve would be repaired for the use of the teacher but nothing has been done by you in the way of definite action. Mr. Lewis, the teacher, is very anxious to get in the house as he is inconvenienced without it and the Department has asked him to carry out certain repairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir: Reference your letter 25-1-8 of Nov. 21/28, and previous correspondence.\n\nAbout six weeks ago I looked over the property on the Mud Lake Reserve, known as the mission house. I find it is a very large house having about fourteen rooms not including sheds and it is in a very poor state of repair. Different Indian families have lived in it from time to time and left it in a very dirty condition that, combined with the age of the house and the use it has been put to has made it a very costly item in my estimation to do anything with. The house was built in about 1865 and apparently has had nothing done to it since. This is the actual condition I found the house in. It needs shingling throughout and plastering throughout. The whole brick work needs re-pointing. The whole building needs re-flooring. It needs re-decorating as the walls are all smoked and the chimney is in a very bad state of repair. The north side of the foundation has fallen in to the extent of about 10 feet, the arch of a cellar window having collapsed. The windows throughout need re-glazing and the house needs re-painting throughout.\n\nNow in the matter of seeing what I could do to put this house in livable condition or part of it, I went to one contractor and he estimated One Thousand Dollars. Because of the inaccessibility of the place and the necessity of hauling materials such a long distance it is difficult to get a\ncontractor to take over the work. However, I located a man in Lakefield who would take over the work and I am enclosing a letter and agreement stating what he would do and what he would expect in payment thereof and you will notice in his agreement that he has not covered all the necessary work.\n\nIn connection with your letter to Mr. Lewis, I would be very glad to co-operate with him in getting the work done. I certainly would be very doubtful of the amount of money he can have it done for. I realize that it is better to get some revenue out of this, but there again I do not think the Department is getting sufficient rental if they invest anything near this amount although I think it would be an excellent thing to have the school teacher living on the Reserve. Mr. Lewis and his wife have been boarding at D. E. Whetungs as Mr. Lewis has been doing since he came to the Reserve and although I appreciate him wanting to be in a house of his own, he certainly has not been inconvenienced as stated in your letter.\n\nI would suggest a representative from the Department, if in this vicinity on any other mission, should call and look over this property before anything is done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nMud and Rice Lake Reserves.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant enclosing a tender from Mr. Dewar for repairs to the mission house on Mud Lake Reserve. As Mr. Lewis, the teacher, was authorized by official letter of the 21st instant to have some necessary repairs made so that he can live in the house, the Department is favourable to him carrying out these repairs. The full repairs to the house can be considered next spring and any work done now at the house will save that much work next summer. You will please cooperate with Mr. Lewis to have the place fixed up in accordance with the letter to him, copy of which was sent to you under cover of letter of the 21st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nV. M. Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nSir:\n\nYour letter of the 21st instant has been received accepting my offer to look after the fixing up of the mission house for the teacher's residence.\n\nThe work is now under way and I am doing my best to retain your confidence in me by giving the Department the special deal, securing prices from every available source. Of course the time of year makes the job much more difficult and expensive.\nFor example, it is necessary to buy some wood to keep two stoves going in order to keep the room at a proper temperature for the workmen.\n\nNow shall I report the labour to you as a lump sum or with names and details?\n\nIn anticipating my financial requirements for labour, it is hard as yet to just be definite but I think around $60 would carry things along until the work is completed.\n\nShall I submit the bill in duplicate as they came in to you?\nwait until the work is completed and send them all in at the same time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMorgan Lewis\nSchool Teacher\n\n[Signature]\n\nYe 20\nadvance Morgan Lewis\n$60.00 to pay for labor\ntake connection with\nrepresent Mission Home\nWood Lake Rv\nLetter 6971\nand Dec 6/18\nOttawa, December 5, 1938.\n\nWith Cheque.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo requesting an advance to pay for labour done on the mission house at Mud Lake Reserve, you will find cheque No. 6971 enclosed for the amount of $60.00. You should have the return of labour made out on the forms enclosed showing the time of each workman each day and the total for the week. Each workman should sign the pay-list and I would ask you to have each week's pay-list made in duplicate and forward to the Department.\n\nThe accounts for material purchased should be submitted in duplicate and a number of voucher forms are being sent to you for the purpose. The original and duplicate accounts from the merchants should be attached to the voucher forms and as requested in my letter of the 21st ultimo report the names and prices quoted by those firms whom you asked for tenders.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The woodwork was very dirty and required some hard work to put in shape.\n\nMr. O. Copway recognized as the best worker in the Reserve was hired at $200 per day. He assisted the carpenters put in practically all the window frames, thus making it possible for the skilled workmen to go ahead with the harder work.

The weather was unsatisfactory so I let the men go. But it could be repaired quite cheaply with cement or lime.\n\nOf the $60 received $50.70 has been paid out for labour leaving a balance of $9.30 unexpended.\n\nTo complete first time a bill ending Dec. 1.

The season was against us and I trust your confidence in me will be strengthened when a complete\nFinancial return has been made. The labour as was to be expected in the big item on the contract.\n\nThe situation of the village has made it difficult to get the materials delivered and tend to increase the expenditure but there are no bills for transportation as I did the hauling with my own car except the shingles which were delivered free. I made 4 trips to Lakefield and two to Peterboro for...\nmaterial and quotation covering a distance of 120 miles all told and I am just sure you will not expect me to be at a loss for this expenditure and effort. In addition I was on the job here before and after school as time keeper assisting the carpenter and directing the work and if you could only see the completed job and compare it with the expenditure I am sure your confidence in me will be sustained.\n\nJ.M.

Cheques are being issued by the Department and sent direct to the persons who supplied the material.\n\nEnclosed find cheque No. 7485 in your favour for $115.60 to enable you to pay for labour in connection with the work on the house.\n\nIn official letter of the 5th instant, you were asked to submit vouchers in duplicate but have submitted only single copies and the accounts of the merchants in duplicate. Duplicate vouchers have been made at the Department. Enclosed please find a voucher made out in the way the Department requires them. A voucher similar to this should be made in duplicate, attach an account of the merchant to each and then submit to the Department. This is only for future guidance and it is not necessary for you to again submit vouchers on behalf of the three persons for whom already vouchers have been sent and payment made. Be careful in submitting labour returns to have each return signed and in duplicate.\n\nThe Department is very pleased with the way the work has progressed and I trust that these repairs will materially aid in making the house comfortable for your occupation. When the work is completed the Department will take into consideration compensating you for the use of your car, which you explain, was used by you a great deal and thus lowered the cost of repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMr. Morgan Lewis,\nTeacher,\nCurve Lake P.O., Ont.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, December 23, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nIn the voucher which you submitted from Mr. Shearer for shingles supplied, you have placed a note to the effect that 2000 shingles have not been used and it is desired to know what you have done with these shingles. If these shingles will be required next summer for the mission house you should see that they are properly stored away so that the snow will not lie on them or that they can be stolen. If they are not required could you not return them to Mr. Shearer or sell them for what they cost you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Lewis\nTeacher.\nQuotations on Dec. 6th without paper as this was obtained direct from the company and I didn't have the cash to settle it. Mr. Leonard paid for it and the price on the bill and voucher is the amount he paid for the paper.\n\n1. Kingston Hardware $4.05\n2. Campbell & Best $4.35\n3. W. Leonard $3.60\n\nDec. 10th Order:\n1. Coleman Bros. $11.60\n2. Kingston Hardware $10.90\n3. W. Leonard $10.70\n\nLeonard's Hardware is also 18 miles nearer to the city than the other. M. Lewis.\nRemarks on various items on this bill.\n\n1. D.C.O.D. Order for paper.\n\nIn doing the three rooms and hall, 189 rolls of paper were used at an average price of $4.75 per roll, which is nearly 1/4 less than your limit of $5.25 per roll.\n\n2. Paint materials. For the woodwork (except hall) we found we could save money by mixing our own paint so we bought lead oil etc., returning any materials unused.\n\n3. Padlocks were obtained to lock two doors which hitherto had been open to the public.\n\n4. Plaster. When not...\n(1) Removed the plaster in hall & bedroom stoves found that the water leaking in had spoiled great pieces of plaster falling off so we obtained some prepared plaster and fixed them place before repainting.\n\n(2) Glass. Ordered 12 panes of glass for the windows and 12 lbs of putty.\n\n6. Glue had to be applied to ceiling before paper could be put on.\n\n7. The pipe was bought to tie down and was on a borrowed trailer. I had to bring it to Curve Lake. A truck driver had asked $4.00 to deliver it to Curve Lake.\n8. You ordered the painting was carried out. One coat being given to floor and woodwork.\n\n9. New kitchen doors required 12 panes of glass (12 x 11\").\n\n10. The sink which we purchased was installed in the kitchen by myself thereby saving the Dept. at least $5.00 as these plumbers charge for their time to coming and going.\n\nThis practically is the completion of the bills except for wood used to heat building for decorator and painters.\n\nMorgan Lewis\nQuotation on similar door and frame by the Pittsburgh Lumber Co.\n\nDoor 13 and 9 for the frame with sill = $2.2\n\n2. MacDonald Lumber Co. quoted a similar door $14.57 for frame and sill $2.21. $16.57 complete.\n\nMr. Moore specializes in this line of work. It was necessary to have lighter pans or doors as they are the only source for the kitchen.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMorgan Lewis\n| DATE   | DESCRIPTION                                      | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | TOTAL    |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|----------|\n| Nov.29 | To 10# 1\u00bd\" nails 60                             |               |              |          |\n| Dec.1  | 3 gal. 8.00 4.50, 50# white lead 8.00            | 12.50         |              |          |\n|        | 1 qt. mahogany 1.65, Turps 35, Drier 40           | 2.40          |              |          |\n|        | 5# yellow ochre 40, 30# 1\u00bd\" nails 1.80            | 2.20          |              |          |\n|        | 200# prep. plaster 2.50, front door lock set 2.50 | 5.10          |              |          |\n|        | 1 pr. butts & screws 20, 2 rim knobs 60           | 9.00          |              |          |\n|        | 2 padlocks 1.00, 2 safety hasps 40                | 1.40          |              |          |\n|        | 20 glass 16 x 17, 9 glass 12 x 14, 10do.12 x 12  | 4.90          |              |          |\n|        | 10# putty & brads 80                             | 8.00          |              |          |\n|        | 6 4\u00bd glue 60, 2\u00bd putty 20, 12 glass 11\u00bd x 12 1.20 | 2.20          |              |          |\n|        | 1 bag plaster 65, turps 35, 1\u00be-\u00bd\" rope 40         | 1.40          |              |          |\n|        | cash paid for C.O.D. order of paper               | 26.98         |              |          |\n|        | 10 4\u00bd gal.

(RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nAs you know the work on the Mission House at Cypress Lake was not completed last fall and I await your directions as to its completion this spring up fitting it up as the teacher's residence.\n\nPart of the foundation on the north wall is caved in endangering a collapse of the brickwork on that side. About three feet of the chimney need to be rebuilt before it can be used. Some of the brickwork needs pointing. We have only handspoke shingles for the verandah.\n\nApril 15, 1929.\nThe verandah floor is in bad shape. The outside woodwork needs paint badly. These reforms have mentioned would greatly increase the value of the place as well as its appearance. The one coat of paint on the inside floors does not show up very well at present although we have tried to save it by means of fuggets. I would also like screen doors for the front and side doors.\n\nI wanted you I would do the painting after flooring and shingling of the verandah if you supplied the material but\nit would be necessary to get a mason for the other work. The cost would not be great.\n\nSome of the fence surrounding this lot is not in very good shape. If it was properly enclosed I could do much in demonstrating the economic value of a good garden to these people whose education along this line seems in most cases a non sequitur. There could also be an ideal place here for a school garden if a portion of it was properly set apart and enclosed.\n\nThanking you for the great interest you have shown.\nin the advancement of education on this Reserve and your interest in my regard.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nMorgan Lewis\n\nTeacher Med Lake\nIndian Day School\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, asking that further repairs be made to the Mission house in which you are living. As the work done last year by you was satisfactory, the Department is prepared to authorize further repairs as follows:\n\nRepairing the foundation, chimney and pointing the brick work, for which work it will be necessary for you to engage a mason, but the Department relies on you to see that full time is put on the work and a satisfactory job is done.\n\nWith reference to shingling the verandah, you have the shingles stored from last year, but it may be necessary for you to purchase shingle nails and such expenditure is approved. The work on the verandah and painting of the floors it is understood will be done by you the Department supplying the necessary material. The repairing of the verandah floor and painting of the floors in the house is approved. You ask for authority to enclose a portion of the school grounds in order that you may have a school garden, I would say that if this can be done at a small expense the Department approves of it being done. You may purchase the necessary seeds for the school children and submit vouchers to the Department.\n\nMr. Morgan Lewis,\nTeacher,\nCurve Lake, Ont.\nThe Department also approves of the purchase of two screen doors for the house. The painting of the exterior wood work of the house will be left for the present until we see how much the cost will be for the repairs now authorized.\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter pointing out that the fence around the Mission lot should be repaired, I have to ask what is required and what would be the probable cost before authorizing this.\n\nIf you desire an advance the Department will forward it upon application.\n\nA supply of voucher forms and labour returns is being sent to you under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

Your letter was replied to by official letter of October 6th and asked if Mr. Lewis would be favourable to having $25.00 per quarter retained from his salary to pay the rent and no reply has ever been received from you. Please ascertain from Mr. Lewis how he prefers paying the rental for this house and have the information back to the Department before the close of school this month, so that if deduction is to be made from his salary, the Department may be advised in ample time. What length of time should Mr. Lewis be charged rental for the mission house?\n\nThe repairs of the house have been carried out under the direction of Mr. Lewis and it is understood from Chief Whetung that a good job has been made of the house and the cost is considerably less than if a contractor had been given the job. The Department will be pleased to receive a report from you on the repairs made to the house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nV. H. Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nJ. D.

As you will observe, the Department will arrange to transfer from its appropriation for Indian Education the sum of $100 per annum to the credit of the band funds, and Mr. Lewis will, therefore, have the use of the house without any charge being made against him for rental.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nV. M. Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterboro, Ont.\nOttawa, July 2nd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to your re-engagement as senior teacher of the Mud Lake Indian Day School for the next school year, and requesting to be informed as to the salary that will be allowed and the rental charged for the mission house which was recently repaired to be used by you as a residence.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to approve of your re-engagement as senior teacher of the Mud Lake School for the next school year. The salary allowed you will be at the rate of $95 per teaching month, the same as was previously paid. Besides, the Department will allow you the use of the house as a residence without any charge against your salary for rental, and it is considered that this should be taken into account in lieu of any increase in your salary as teacher for the next school year. We are arranging to reimburse the band who own the residence to the amount of $100 per annum. In view of the fact that you will be given free use of this residence, it is considered that no charge should be made by you for overseeing the work in the repairs that were recently made to same.\n\nRegarding the water supply, the Department is not prepared at the present time to authorize the drilling of a well, and it is thought that you can continue the same arrangement to obtain a supply of water as you are at present doing.\n\nMr. Agent Eastwood is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMorgan Lewis, Esq.,\nTeacher, Mud Lake Indian Day School,\nCurve Lake, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nACCOUNTANT.\n\nRelative to the rental of the Mission House, on the Mud Lake Reserve, to the teacher, Mr. Morgan Lewis, as a residence, I have to say that the sum of $100 per annum to pay the rental of this building will be transferred from the appropriation for Indian Education to the credit of the Mud Lake Band (Account No. 20.) This will be independent of the salary allowed Mr. Lewis for his services as teacher, and will date from the beginning of the next school year, viz., September 1st, 1929.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nPeterborough, Ontario.\nJuly 4th, 1929.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir: Reference your letter #25-1-8.\n\nWith reference to the rental of the mission property to Mr. Lewis, school teacher at Mud Lake Reserve, I beg to say that in looking over my files I believe I did inform you that Mr. Lewis would be willing to have $25.00 retained per quarter from his salary - this would make a total of $100.00 per annum. Mr. Lewis occupied the mission house on the 25th of December 1928. It should be charged from that date and he desires that it be withheld from his quarterly salary.\n\nIn connection with this matter Mr. Lewis feels that in as much as he has devoted considerable time to the repairing of the house, that the Department would see their way clear to grant him some compensation for his work. I beg to report that in regard to the house the following work was done: The south slope of the roof was shingled, also verandah and the verandah floor was re-painted. The foundation was repaired on the north side (this had fallen in around a window enclosure); all the brick was pointed up where found necessary and the chimney repaired; the three east rooms and the hall were re-decorated and the woodwork and floors painted; a sink was installed; screen doors were put on where necessary and all windows were re-glazed. In a report to me on the matter Mr. Lewis claims that there are no facilities for hard water and drinking water on the mission property. He evidently would like to have a well dug or some way of taking care of his requirements.\n\nI believe that a very good job has been done to the property not only to make it tenantable but also to conserve it, as it was badly in need of repairs.\n\nTrusting this is the information you require.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are ten rooms in the house but five would be all we would need. In this case when we would be only in half of the house the rent to them seems high. Their salary is so small that they can't afford to pay much more.\nUnless they were there I couldn't possibly rent my one room and live there alone.\n\nIf you could consider letting it for sixty dollars per year we could get along together quite nicely.\n\nI had counted on renting one room and boarding myself and will feel disappointed unless you can consider accepting lower rent.\n\nI hope this meets with your approval, I remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Miss) Phelma A.

In order to do so, Mr. and Mrs. Irwin, United Church Missionaries to Lakehurst and Curve Lake, are going to take the house and let Miss Garveth have two rooms. You might say that they would be caretakers of the house for Miss Garveth.\n\nIn looking over the building, it would be necessary to take in two more rooms than those occupied by Mr. Lewis. The cost of papering and painting the two rooms and the hallway, I would estimate at $75.00 and I would request authority to have this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nMud and Rice Lake Reserves.\nOttawa, September 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, informing the Department that Miss Garveth, teacher of the Mud Lake Indian Day School, will occupy two rooms of the mission house and requesting that certain repairs be carried out.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of your having the papering and painting required to the two rooms and hallway carried out. We note you estimate the cost to be $75. It is considered, however, that this work could be carried out at less cost. You should arrange to have the papering and painting required done at an early date, and the Department will expect you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The total accounts came to $61.60 and we were well under the authorized expenditure of $75.00.\n\nThe work was urgently needed to make the house habitable in as much as the previous work done on the property was confined to about four rooms. Mr. Lewis did this work. With the two families residing in the same place it was necessary to bring in some extra rooms.\n\nThe work is very satisfactory and I saw no necessity of going passed Miss Garveth's father to have the work done.

This year one teacher is living with the missionary and the other one is boarding at Chief Whetung's. Care should be taken before expending any public money on a teacher's residence.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nThe enclosed return of labour for the week ending June 28th, 1930, had been overlooked by the Council at the Mud Lake Reserve and it was recently forwarded to me. It covers the labour of erecting a wire fence on the Mission property on the Mud Lake Reserve and was authorized by Department letter of April 15th, 1930, file #25-1-8.\n\nI take the opportunity now of presenting this for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nMud and Rice Lake Reserves.\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like a little information regarding the so-called Mission House on the Curve Lake Reserve.\n\nHas the pastor in charge of the mission any claim on the mission house; or, are the teachers entitled to all the rooms they want, free of rent?\n\nThanking you for an early reply.\n\nI remain\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMrs. A. H. Irvine.\nOttawa, March 5, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter dated January 20th, last, which reached the Department on the 3rd instant, requesting information with reference to the Mission House on the Mud Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I have to say that this house is the property of the Indian Band. In the Fall of 1926, after it had been unoccupied for some time, and as the teacher was unable to secure a suitable house on the Reserve, a considerable amount was expended in repairing and fitting up same. When Miss Garveth, the present senior teacher, was appointed in September, last, the Agent informed the Department that the United Church missionary and his wife, who were recently appointed, were going to take the house and let Miss Garveth have two rooms, and that it would be necessary to fit up two rooms other than those occupied by the senior teacher. He was informed that if Miss Garveth lived with the missionary she could make whatever arrangement she wished regarding board, and that, as the house was to be occupied by the missionary, no rental should be charged by the Band for its use. We have no knowledge of the arrangements made between the teacher and missionary for her board and rooms she should use. For any further information regarding this matter, I would refer you to Mr. W. M. Eastwood, Indian Agent, Peterboro, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. A. D. Irwin,\nCurve Lake,\nOnt.\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCure Lake, Ont. March 13th 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nA member of the Band here informs me that a rental of $50.00 a year will be asked for the Mission House after July. We are content to pay that amount if required, but we understood when we came that the Missionary would have the house rent free.\n\nI would ask that proper documents be given to assure us permanency of tenancy. A home cannot be left on short notice without entailing considerable hardship and some loss.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.D. Irwin\n(United Church Missionary)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6148, File 414-8, part 1)\nOttawa, March 23rd, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed find copy of letter received from Reverend A. D. Irwin, missionary at Curve Lake, Ontario, on which it is desired to have your report.\n\nYou will know that there is a building at Mud Lake Reserve owned by the Band as a residence for the missionary. There being no missionary at the Reserve and the house lying idle it went into disrepair and in 1926 the Department had the building repaired as a residence for the school-teacher Mr. Lewis. The cost of repairs was paid from Band funds and this Department allowed the Band $100.00 a year rental for the house while occupied by the teacher.\n\nNow that the missionary is resident on the Reserve it is only logical that he reside in the Mission House, but apparently Miss Carveth, one of the teachers who lives with the missionary, cannot agree with him and there is a dispute as to whether the missionary or the teacher has the right to the house. You should endeavour to have Mr. Irwin and Miss Carveth come to some arrangement satisfactory to both and submit the plan to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nV. M. Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir: Reference your letter 25-1-8, March 23/31.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the above date enclosing a copy of letter from Rev. A. D. Irwin, missionary at Curve Lake, I beg to report that I visited the reserve yesterday and met Miss Garveth and Mr. Irwin at Chief Whetung's.\n\nThe mission house is occupied by both parties as laid out in the accompanying sketch. You will notice that Miss Garveth has the south-east bedroom on the ground floor and this communicates, by means of sliding doors, with the sleeping room occupied by the Irwins. These doors are not absolutely sound-proof, in fact, the main contention is that any sound or noise which is made in Miss Garveth's room is distinctly audible through these doors.\n\nI recommended to Miss Garveth that she take the three upstairs bedrooms as shown in sketch number two and hand over to Mr. Irwin the room she now occupies on the ground floor. She declined to do this and summing up the whole dispute, this is the main contention. There has been a misunderstanding as to who is responsible for the whole house. Mrs. Irwin claims that she has papers to show that she has claim to the whole house and Miss Garveth says the same thing. However, I think I succeeded in explaining the matter to them. Miss Garveth has Miss Long, the Junior teacher, living with her and possibly needs extra room for this reason.\nI would recommend that Mr. Irwin be given the rooms number one, two and three on the ground floor which are the only rooms improved and that Miss Garveth have the choice of any rooms, three of which are improved, on the second floor. This would satisfactorily separate the two parties as the hallway does not interfere in any way with this arrangement. I also divided equally the garden space which was in dispute.\n\nThis disposition of the rooms will not be satisfactory to Miss Garveth, but I see no reason why this should not be done, as it is the only way in which Mrs. Irwin will be satisfied. In all there are seven bedrooms upstairs and plenty of room to choose from for both parties and I think one should be upstairs and one down and Miss Garveth, being by herself, can willingly afford to give in to this extent.\n\nIn the matter of the substance of Mr. Irwin's letter there has been absolutely no foundation of a statement such as a band member was supposed to have made in connection with rental. I think Mr. Irwin would be well advised to request this information from myself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\nMud and Rice Lake Reserves.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, reporting on the disagreement between the Reverend Irwin and Miss Garveth with reference to the occupancy of the Mission House on the Mud Lake Reserve. This house was provided by the Band for the use of the resident missionary and it is the logical thing that he should occupy it and have control of it during the time he is a missionary there. When no missionary was on the Reserve and the teacher, Mr. Lewis, could not get accommodation the house was repaired at the expense of the Band and the teacher was allowed to occupy it, this Department paying the Band a rental of $100.00 per year.\n\nWhen Miss Garveth was engaged as teacher to the Reserve it was understood that she would have two rooms in the Mission House and this did not give her control of the whole house, it being understood although probably not expressed in writing, that if the missionary occupied the house he would have the control of it as was done in past years when occupied by the minister.

Rome, principal of the Mud Lake Day School, writes me that he intends to be married this month and inquires about accommodation at the Mud Lake Reserve. Until recently, the Mission House has been allowed the teachers as residence and was repaired in 1929 for this purpose. Mr. Lewis, a former teacher was granted the privilege of living there when he married. As there is practically no accommodation for a married teacher on the Reserve with exception of this I suggest that Mr. Rome be granted the use of Mission House.\n\nIt is now occupied by James McCue as caretaker. He pays the band $3.00 a month. As his term is now expired and he is living on as there has been new demand for same, he could be moved on short notice.\n\nI also suggest at this time that Mr. Rome be advanced to the same salary as Mr. Lewis received. He would be difficult to replace as a teacher and his influence, aside from teaching has been of great value to the whole band.\nHe has organized seasonable games on the Reserve both amongst the school children and the older members. This has promoted better feeling and is of interest to all. The hockey team played a number of games with the villages near the Reserve and did quite well. There are a number of boys just past school age with nothing to do in the winter months and Mr. Rome has endeavoured to get them interested in something. Under ordinary conditions most of these boys would be out working but jobs are difficult to find at present.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAgent\nMud and Rice Lakes Agency\nOttawa, August 11, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, recommending that permission to live in the mission house on the reserve be granted Mr. W. Rome, senior teacher of the Mud Lake Indian Day School, after his coming marriage.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that this building is the property of the Band, and, when same was occupied by the former teacher, Mr. Morgan Lewis, it is understood he paid rental at the rate of $100 per annum. If the building is used by Mr. Rome, will the Band require that he pay rental for same, and, if so, what amount? Further, would they be in favour of allowing Mr. Rome to occupy the house? Please state, also, if you have been obtaining the rental from James McCue at the rate of $3.00 per month. Should the Band agree to the occupancy of the house by Mr. Rome, it would be necessary to give Mr. McCue notice.\n\nI may add that the Department will approve of Mr. Rome living in the mission house, provided there is no objection on the part of the Band and an arrangement is made as to any rental that may be charged him.\n\nWith reference to your suggestion, that Mr. Rome be granted an increase in salary, equal to that paid the former teacher, Mr. Lewis, I have to say that, under the regulations of the Treasury Board, no increases in salary can be made during the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nV. M. Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterboro, Ont.\nPeterborough, Ontario\nAugust 23rd, 1933\n\nThe SECRETARY\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter #25-I-8 of August 11th, 1933 re the application of Mr. W. Rome for the renting of the Mission House on the Mud Lake Reserve, I beg to advise that Mr. Rome is now here with his wife and he would like to make his plans for taking up residence at the Reserve for the coming term. I took the matter up with the Chief and he states that it would hardly be possible to assemble a council at the present time and the earliest would be September as most that are able to get the work are away guiding. The Chief tells me that he thinks $50.00 a year should be reasonable rental and he is satisfied that this would be agreeable to the Council.\n\nJames McCue who now occupies the Mission House would not require more than a weeks notice. He owes for April, May June, July and August. This would be $15.00. He paid $12.00 on May 3rd for Dec., Jan., Feb., and March I issued General Receipt #07441 for this and returned it to the Department in my\nMay Revenue returns.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAgent\nMud and Rice Lakes Agency\nOttawa, August 28, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the rental of the mission house on the reserve to Mr. W. Rome, senior teacher of the Mud Lake Indian Day School. In this connection it is noted the Chief of the Band considers that a rental of $50.00 a year would be reasonable. The Department will therefore approve of Mr. Rome having the use of the mission house as a residence during the coming academic year for the rental above stated. The Department would prefer that, when Mr. Rome receives his salary cheque at the end of each quarter, you collect the rental from him and forward same to the Department for credit of the Band. This arrangement would be more satisfactory than retaining the amount from his salary, as it would simplify our bookkeeping here.\n\nPlease endeavour to collect the balance of the rental due by James McCue and give him the necessary notice to vacate the premises. It is noted that he owes rental from April first, last. If he is unable to pay the amount, it could be deducted from his interest distribution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nV. M. Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPeterboro, Ont.\nCurve Lake, Ont.\nMarch 3, 1934.\n\nV.E. Eastwood Esq.,\nAgent for Indian Affairs,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nDear sir:\n\nThe floor of the \"Mission House,\" in which we live, is badly in need of paint, while the walls of the downstairs part have not been papered for many years. Will you, please, secure\nfor us enough paint to cover two rooms, floors one 19'6\" by 15', the other 15' by 14'. The walls of the same rooms are 7' high from baseboard to drop ceiling, and there is a large archway between.\n\nI think 14 double rolls would be plenty for the walls, and a gallon of dark brown paint would do for the floors.\n\nYours truly,\nWm. J. Rowe.\nPeterborough Ontario\nApril 23rd, 1934\n\nThe SECRETARY\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe:- Mission House on Mud Lake Reserve\n\nI inclose a letter from Mr. Wm. G. Rome, teacher at the Mud Lake Day School, requesting some decoration of the interior of the Mission House. Mr. Rome is now paying $50.00 annually for the rental of this place. The interior is very much in need of cleaning up and if the materials are supplied, Mr. Rome will supply his own labour. I would recommend that the necessary materials be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nAgent\nMud and Rice Lakes Agency\nApril 30, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Conley,\n\nPlease see letter of April 23rd, from Agent Eastwood. The house now occupied by Mr. Rome, teacher of the Mud Lake Indian Day School, is the property of the Band, and, if any repairs are made, I suppose they will have to be made from Band Funds. Mr. Rome is supposed to pay $50 a year rent for this house. No doubt, this amount is shown on the agency monthly revenue returns.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Case, an Indian, for a number of years. There was only one child in attendance and there had only been one for some days with an average of two for a month past. Inquiry revealed the fact that there only five children of school age in the section. I would suggest, therefore, that this school be closed and Mr. Case informed that his services will no longer be required. These children can be enrolled at the Institute.\n\nThe school building was erected in 1857 by Chief Waubuno with funds collected in England. The Department put on a new roof a few years ago and quite extensive repairs would be necessary if the school was to be kept in operation. If the suggestion to close the school is approved I presume that no action will be taken.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Department politely refused to accede to our request.\n\nAccording to the Treaties, Frederick Haldimand A.D.1795, treaty was made with various tribes of Indians. We are one of the tribes. We used to get blankets, guns, kettles and many other things until about A.D. 1848. Ministers came on the Reserve telling us to turn this into a school fund and finally the Indians consented. Ever since then we were entitled to the school. As the Hon. Indian Department refused to grant our request, we claim we are treated unjustly.\n\nWe do not see why we are used as such, though we have shown our loyalty to the Empire in sending our brave warriors to the Battle Line in France. Therefore we submit under the circumstances we ought to have our rights.\n\nWe pray your Royal Highness to instruct the Indian Department at Ottawa, Canada, to reopen the said School at once, on condition we must be heard in the choice of a teacher, that is to say the Chief and Council.\nand the Trustees, same as any school in the Country. We justly demand that the said clause be given to us as a right.\n\nTrusting Your Royal Highness will give this petition your favourable consideration. We have been duly appointed by the Munsee Indian Council to act as this case in behalf of the Band.\n\nGod Save our King.\n\nAnswer be given to Chief Saml. John of Munsee Indians,\nP. O.

A few go to Bear Creek school part of the time, but owing to a very bad, and untravelled road lying in between the two schools, it is almost impossible for them to go except in the summer months.\n\n(b) The two bands do not work in as complete harmony as might be desired, and consequently the children do not get to school as often as they might.\n\n(c) The distance is too great for several of the Munsees to go to Bear Creek school.\n\n(d) I took the matter up with Mr. Inspector Johnson, who was very much in favour of the re-opening of the school.\n\nWith 15 children of school age, and 22 smaller ones to come along, it seems a shame that they should not be afforded some chance of receiving an education. Of course the question of where a teacher would board will be of some difficulty here; but one might board in Middlemiss, about 2 1/2 miles distant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6149, File 415-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nOttawa, August 13, 1918.\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the reopening of the school on the reserve of the Munceys of the Thames; apparently conditions have changed since this school was closed seven years ago, when there were only five children of school age in the section. The Department would be prepared to consider reopening this school if the Indians would evidence enough interest in the education of their children to have them attend regularly.\n\nI note that you state there is no boarding place nearer than Middlemiss; this would preclude the possibility of obtaining the services of a white teacher, as one could hardly be expected to walk $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles from a boarding-house to the school; there is also the further question of repairs to the school building; when an officer of the Department last visited the school in July, 1911, he reported that some extensive repairs would be necessary if\n\nJ. R. Littleproud, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nthe school is to be kept in operation.\n\nWill you be good enough in the meantime to report fully on the condition of the building and also to make further inquiries as to a possible boarding-house.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMiddlemiss,\nAugust 22, 1918\n\nMr. J. R. Littleproud,\nIndian Agent for the\nCaradoc Indian Reserve,\nMuncy,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving been informed that a vacancy exists in the Lower Muncy Indian School, on the Caradoc Indian Reserve, I beg leave to offer myself as a candidate for the position at a salary of four hundred and seventy-five dollars ($475.00) per year.\n\nI took the Fifth Class work after passing my Entrance and have\nattended the Glencoe High School at Glencoe, Ontario for two years. I am eighteen years old and can supply references from our pastor, Rev. H.D. McTavish, 2 Murray, Ont., and Mr. J.B. Hamilton, Principal of the Glencoe High School, at Glencoe, Ont.\n\nShould you see fit to choose me, I assure you that I will endeavour to discharge the duties of the position to the best of my ability, and hope to your entire satisfaction yours with respect,\n\nMary McArthur,\nMiddlemiss, Ont.\nSir,\n\nRe re-opening of the Munsee school.\n\nIn reply to the above mentioned letter, I beg to report as follows:\n\nThe chief, Mr. Samuel John, assures me that the band will be delighted to avail themselves of the privilege of school again; and that he will make it his business to \"get after\" those parents who are dilatory in sending their children to school.\n\nAs for a teacher's boarding place, I beg to enclose an application from Miss Mary McArthur of Middlemiss, who says that she would go home to Middlemiss in the summer months, and would possibly board with some Indian family in the winter. Mrs. Caroline Logan who lives very close to the school would possibly keep her, and her home is clean and tidy. I believe the Department is also in receipt of an application from Miss Helm of Appin, for the Oneida No. 3 school, which application might possibly be used in this case if Miss Helm has not yet obtained another school. Miss Helm's academic qualifications are very much better than Miss McArthur's, but Miss McArthur is a much more presentable girl, a qualification of no mean importance in choosing a teacher for small children.\n\nWith regard to repairs I would report as follows:\n\nThere are enough desks at present; they would merely need to fastened to the floor. The teacher's desk might be made to do for the present, although it is not very suitable. New blackboards are needed; a cupboard for books and supplies; and a new set of\nSir,\n\nstovepipes; some repairs to the plaster; and the whole school scrubbed up. Together with this would be a whole set of the regular school equipment.\n\nOutside, the closets need repairs and shields; and a small hole in the stone foundation needs repairs.\n\nI believe that much of this work could be done by the Munsee people themselves. Many of them would help at a \"bee\", if a competent workman were put in charge to direct the work. I believe this would be a good plan, and no doubt would help to make the Indians more self-dependent, as well as reducing the actual cost of the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 4, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that, in compliance with the request made by the Minoceys of the Thames, the Department has decided to re-open the school on their reserve, which has been closed since 1911, and Mr. J. R. Littleproud, who was agent previous to your appointment, wrote the Department stating that he had an application from Miss Mary McArthur of Middlemiss for the position of teacher of this school. If you consider that Miss McArthur is possessed of sufficient qualifications for the position you may appoint her at a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum. Kindly advise the Department as to what action you take in this matter.\n\nAn application was also received from Miss Helm of Appin for the position of teacher of the Oneida No. 3 School, but there was no vacancy there.\n\nMr. Littleproud states that there are sufficient desks in the building, but they would need to be fastened also to the floor; new blackboards are needed; a new cupboard for storing books and supplies and a new set of stove pipes.\n\nSome repairs are also required to the plaster and the school-room needs a thorough cleaning. These should be attended to at once.\n\nL. A. VanSkiver, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMinocey, Ont.\nThe outside closets need repairs and shields and a small hole in the stone foundation needs repairs. Mr. Littleproud states that he is of the opinion that this work could be done by the Munsee people themselves. He states that many of them would help at a \"bee\", if a competent workman were put in charge to direct the work.\n\nI should be glad if you would give these matters your immediate attention and furnish the Department with the dimensions of the blackboards needed. You should obtain prices for the cupboard and stove pipes and forward them to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\nAsst.

Therefore the raise in salary given last year for attending the Bracebridge Summer Model School has not been added. This was paid in advance last year. This only makes a salary of five hundred and fifty dollars ($550.00) + the bonus of sixty dollars ($60.00). Therefore making the total amount for the year six hundred and ten dollars ($610.00).\n\nI feel that this amount is altogether too small for this school as it has so many disadvantages that the other schools on this reserve are not bothered with. Namely: The roads which are almost\nimpossible at certain seasons of the year.\n\n(2) There is no boarding house. The nearest being at Middlemiss, a distance of two and one-half miles. This makes it necessary that a horse and buggy has to be provided for, which is very expensive, besides a drive of this length twice a day is not very pleasant in the winter.\n\n(3) There is no place where I can leave a horse and feed for it each day. Therefore someone has to be provided to drive me to the school and return with the horse before nine o'clock and come after me at four o'clock. I feel that taking into consideration all these disadvantages, my salary is very inadequate and should be increased two hundred dollars ($200.00). This would make a salary of seven hundred and fifty dollars ($750.00) + the bonus of sixty dollars ($60.00).\n\nI hope you will take this into consideration and reply at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMary McArthur\nTeacher, Lower Munsey Indian School\nMiddlemiss, Ont.\nOttawa, November 15, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the communication addressed to you by Miss Mary McArthur, Teacher of the Lower Muncey Indian Day School. I have noted her queries regarding salary and bonus and written to her direct. She was under the impression that her total salary, counting bonus, was $610. I have explained to her the oversight in the matter of her last cheque and that her salary is being paid at the rate of $600 per annum and $150 bonus.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Merrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nThomas McGookin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nOttawa, November 15, 1921.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, to Mr. Agent McGookin, of Muncey, Ont. He has referred the inquiries you make concerning your salary and bonus to us. In reply I beg to state that in error your cheque for the September quarter read $137.50. The amount should have been $150.00 as you were being paid at the rate of $600.00 per annum. A cheque for the difference of $12.50 is being sent under separate cover.\n\nConcerning your bonus, the flat rate of $150.00 per annum is now being paid to all teachers of Indian day schools. This is not payable quarterly, as formerly, but at the rate of $15.00 per month. There is but one teaching month in the quarter ended September; the result is that your bonus cheque for the September quarter was for $15.00. For the three succeeding quarters your bogus cheque will amount to $45.00, $15.00 for each teaching month.\n\nYou will understand, therefore, that you are being paid at the rate of $600.00 per annum, plus a bonus of $150, a total of $750.00.\n\nI trust that this explanation will be satisfactory to you and I wish to assure you that an application for an increase in salary at the end of this academic year would be in order if your efforts as teacher at the Lower Muncey Indian Day School continue to be as successful as in the past.\n\nI have noted the difficulty in connection with transportation to and from your school and would be glad to hear from you if this explanation eases your mind concerning financial matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Mary McArthur,\nTeacher, Lower Muncey Indian Day School,\nMiddlemiss, Ont.\nMiddlemiss, Ont.\nMarch 14th, 1922.\n\nMr. Thos. Mc Gookin,\nIndian Agent,\nMuskogee,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease find enclosed a letter received by me from the Superintendent of Education, Ottawa, re. my salary.\n\nMy salary is now six hundred dollars ($600.00) plus a bonus of one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) making a total of seven hundred and fifty dollars ($750.00). I feel that this is insufficient, when we consider the difficulties in connection with this school. First, There is no suitable boarding house closer than Middlemiss, a distance of two-and-one-half miles. Second, The roads are almost impassable at certain seasons of the year. Third, In order to reach the school a horse and outfit is necessary. This is rather expensive. The upkeep alone amounts to one hundred and twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per year. Fourth, There is no place...\nto leave the horse and feed for it near the school during the day. This makes it necessary that someone has to drive me to school in the morning and come after me at four o'clock. This makes an additional expense.\n\nTaking into consideration these incumbrances, I feel that my salary is quite inadequate, and should be increased one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00). This would make a salary of seven hundred and fifty dollars ($750.00) plus the bonus of one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00), making a total of nine hundred dollars ($900.00).\n\nI hope you will give this matter your immediate attention, and reply at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMary McArthur,\nTeacher of the Lower Mungo,\nMiddlemiss,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from Miss Mary McArthur, which will speak for itself.\n\nIn connection with this teacher's application for an advance of salary, I may say that her work has been very satisfactory, excellent progress having been made by her pupils. The situation of this school is such that it would be a difficult matter to replace Miss McArthur, there being no boarding accommodation closer than the village of Middlemiss, 2\u00bd miles, and in winter the roads are very bad in this section; it is necessary to have the use of a driving outfit morning and evening, which means a considerable expenditure.\n\nApplication is recommended for your approval.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 20, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 16th instant, referring to the application for an increase of salary for Miss McArthur, Teacher of the Muncey Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that before granting this request, which would give Miss McArthur a salary considerably in advance of those received by the other teachers of Indian day schools in your agency, it is thought advisable to look into the matter rather carefully.\n\nIn this connection, I have to inform you that it is my intention to pay a visit to the Mt. Elgin Institute and to any day schools requiring attention at this time, during the first two weeks in April. You should advise Miss McArthur to bring this matter up at the time of my visit. If you expect to be absent from Muncey during the first few days of April, I would be grateful for an immediate communication to that effect, as I would prefer to visit the Mt. Elgin Institute when you are at home.\n\nI enclose the Department's earlier communication to Miss McArthur.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

This is a more or less dangerous precedent, and it should be understood that this increase is to care, in part, for the expense Miss McArthur has to meet in connection with travelling to and from her boarding place to the school. Commencing in September of this year, Miss McArthur's salary will be at the rate of $650 plus whatever bonus is allowed by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

(RG 10, Volume 6149, File 415-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe unsatisfactory conditions and results of the day schools in the Cariboo agency necessitated an inspection and remedial measures. 162 children were enrolled during the past fiscal year and the average attendance, but 85 - a percentage of 46. The average salary we have been paying is $607. These facts are indicative of two reasons for the lack of progress, (1) bad attendance, (2) unqualified teachers.\n\nIn October I spent three days visiting the schools and the public school inspectors. The only really qualified teacher is Miss McDonald, at Oneida No. 3. Miss McArthur, at Muncey, is very successful and worthy of another trial. The other four teachers - Miss Brown at River Settlement, Miss Graham at Bear Creek, Mr. Doxtator at Oneida No. 2 and Mr. Fischer at Back Settlement - are unqualified and should be released at the first opportunity.\n\nI returned to the reserve after a week-end at Moravian town and Malpole Island and met the Indian parents, the chiefs, and councillors, missionaries and others, at a general meeting in the Chippewa Council Hall. I explained that conditions were unsatisfactory and asked for the reasons. The parents and other Indians took quite an interest and were practically unanimous that there were but two reasons: (1) poor attendance, (2) unqualified teachers. The Chief, councillors and parents promised to do everything in their power to better the attendance and I assured them that the Department would install qualified teachers at the first opportunity. When pressed for my meaning in this connection, I explained that the teachers at the River Settlement and Bear Creek Schools could be changed practically at once, (end of the calendar year) as teachers could secure boarding accommodation in the vicinity, and that the Back Settlement and Oneida No. 2 tenors could be changed as soon as residences for qualified teachers could be provided.\n\nI am including in the Estimates for 1925-26, as Important Day School Needs, a residence for the Back Settlement school, a residence (2 teachers) for Oneida No. 2 and No. 3. I also assure them that the only classroom building which was really unsatisfactory (that at Oneida No. 2) would be replaced at the first opportunity. A new building is now in the course of erection on a day labour basis.\n\nI am arranging for better equipment in these schools and, in an effort to make them attractive, am providing some libraries and some articles for group games. At a later date it may be necessary to offer prizes for best attendance and to also organize the reserve into school districts so that a real interest will be aroused.\nExtract from Report of Inspector Sexton on the Lower Muncey Indian Day School - dated June 10th, 1926.\n\nMiss Mary McArthur\n\nThis teacher should have better academic qualifications. She should concentrate her attention on the class she is teaching - She knows Indian character fairly well.

There has been some criticism by members of the Muncey band regarding the appointment of qualified teachers in the other day schools while the services of Miss McArthur were retained.

Said resignation to take effect, September 1st, 1926.\n\nAllow me to extend to you, and to all other government officials on education, my sincere thanks for the many kindnesses you have shown to me during the seven years and nine months I have been in your employ.\n\nI am, yours sincerely,\n\nMary McArthur.\nSir,\n\nReferring to letter No.7-4-I of the 23rd ultimo, I beg to enclose the resignation of Mary McArthur as teacher at the Lower Muncey Day School and also applications received for the vacancy.\n\nThe application of Margaret Baird, who has had seven years teaching experience, seems to be the most satisfactory, & a teacher with some experience would be preferable for this school. Miss Baird mentions a salary of $1000.00 per year but I think she would accept $900.00 with an allowance of $50.00 for transportation to and from the school, the nearest boarding accommodation obtainable is between two and three miles from the school and, in winter, the roads are very bad; it will be necessary to make an allowance for transportation to any teacher engaged for this school. In the event of Miss Baird being already engaged the second choice is Miss Leila Bilyea who has got an interim first class certificate at the recent normal examinations, but has no teaching experience; she asks a salary of $850.00 per year with transportation allowance of $50.00. Either one of these teachers would give satisfaction I believe.\n\nI would be pleased to have your decision at an early date, so that the teacher decided upon may be so advised.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 13th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing the resignation of Miss Mary McArthur as teacher of the Lower Muncey Indian Day School, and applications from several teachers for the position. In reply I beg to say that the resignation of Miss McArthur is accepted.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Margaret Baird, who has a permanent second class certificate with seven years' experience, to begin duties on September 1st, next. The salary allowed Miss Baird will be at the rate of $95 per teaching month, which includes the cost of an allowance for transportation expenses.\n\nShould Miss Baird not accept, the Department would accept the services of Miss Leila Bilyea, who has an interim first class certificate, but no teaching experience. The salary we would allow Miss Bilyea would be at the rate of $90 per teaching month, which also includes the cost of any allowance for transportation.\n\nPlease communicate with Miss Baird at once and ascertain from her definitely as to whether she will accept the position or not. If she does not accept, you should endeavour to secure the services of Miss Bilyea. Please inform the Department as to which of these applicants accepts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.-F.

As stated in our letter of the 15th instant, the salary allowed will be at the rate of $95 per teaching month. Please inform Miss Baird of her appointment and arrange with her to take up duties on the date mentioned.

McGookin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nR.R.H.4, Denfield, Ont.,\nAug. 27, 1926.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn August 9, I made a personal application to your agent, Mr. McGeochin, Wabigoon, for a school on the Wabigoon Reserve. He gave me to understand that, since I held a First Class Certificate and my qualifications had been the highest of any other applicant, I was to teach in the school for the coming year. Then I sent in a written application as he directed, to be sent to the head office to be verified and recorded.\n\nConsequently, understanding I had a school, made no further applications for other vacancies. Made every preparation to\nbegin work next Wednesday,\nSept. 1. Also, I had advertised\nfor and obtained a conveyance\nas to distance between school\nand nearest boarding house is\nthree miles.\n\nSince that time, I have obtained\ninformation from a reliable source that another\nteacher has been engaged there.\nUp to date I have received\nno word from Mr. McGookin,\nsaying that my acceptance\nhas been cancelled. The other\nlady was hired on August 19.\nI had signed no contract as,\nafter making enquiries, I was\ntold it was not necessary.\n\nAs I cannot see that I got a\nsquare deal, and have made\nno further applications to\nobtain a school on account of\nthinking I had the position,\nI decided to report it to you\nfor your decision.\n\nLooking to hear from you\nshortly,\n\nLeila Bilyea\nOttawa, August 30, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, with reference to the application made by you to Mr. Agent McGeochin for the position as teacher of the Lower Muncey Indian Day School for the next academic year. In reply I beg to inform you that Mr. McGeochin forwarded your application of the 9th instant to the Department with other applications which he received. We instructed him to offer this position to Miss Margaret Baird, as we required a teacher having had previous experience. Miss Baird has therefore been appointed. We regret that there was a misunderstanding in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Leila Billyea,\nR. R. No. 4,\nDenfield, Ont.\nOttawa, August 31, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Miss Leila Bilyea, R.R. #4, Danfield, Ont., relative to the application which she made for the position as teacher of the Lower Muncey Indian Day School. She states that you gave her to understand she was to teach this school for the coming year, and, consequently, she made no further application for a school. I have written to her briefly stating that the position has been given to another applicant, and that the Department regrets there was a misunderstanding.\n\nI should be grateful for your report in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. McGookin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No.7-4-I of the 31st ultimo with regard to the application of Miss Lelia Bilyea for the position as teacher of the Lower Muncey Day School.\n\nI beg to say that this young lady's cousin, Mr. Fred Dodson, Missionary teacher at the Mount Elgin Institute, spoke to me some time ago with a view to having Miss Bilyea appointed; he was informed that she should make application in the usual way, however she came personally to see me and in the course of the interview stated that she thought she was entitled to the position having the highest qualification, a first class certificate, she was informed to send in her application which would be forwarded to the Department, together with the other applications received, for decision. Miss Bilyea was treated in exactly the same manner as the others who made personal application, she was taken to see the school and was informed that in the event of her application being accepted, suitable arrangements could be made for board and transportation. There was no statement made that would give her to understand that she had been appointed, she was told that the applications had to be submitted to the Department and that, in the event of her application being accepted she would be notified immediately.\n\nI might say that my reason for recommending the application of Miss Baird, who has been appointed, was that it was considered that her seven years teaching experience would be of much greater value than Miss Bilyea's first class certificate without any experience.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mrs. Phillips is receiving $95.00 per teaching month at the present time. She boards with the Anglican clergyman and his wife in the village of Muncey, which is three miles distant from her school. She has purchased a car to take her to and from school, but will not be able to use it during the Fall and Spring months. It will be necessary for her to engage someone to drive her in a buggy. Mrs. Phillips is a very satisfactory teacher and her pupils are making good progress; one of her pupils got her entrance last summer with high marks.

McGookin Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McGookin:\n\nAfter the progress that has been made in the last three or four years in the development of the Caradoc Indian schools, I would be very disappointed if anything should happen to make them less efficient than they have grown to be.\n\nThe manifest interest you have taken in the schools which I have had the honour to inspect, has been no small factor contributing to their present state of efficiency. I think then, that it is only necessary to point out to you some of the ways in which the present situation may be improved, to secure your active cooperation in bringing about the necessary improvements.\n\nThe Lower Muncey school presents difficulties not present in the other schools on the Reserve: the isolated situation in the centre of the Reserve, the unsuitable character of the school building, the lack of necessary accommodation for the teacher, are all contributing causes making it a not attractive situation. Only someone possessed of the idea of being able to do something towards the uplift of the Indian people will persist in carrying on the duties of a teacher in this school, and this we have in the present teacher \u2014 she possesses the combination of good teaching ability, energy, and a desire to better the condition of the children in her charge. But it is not to be expected that these qualities, without encouragement, will continue to hold a teacher in a too-difficult position. The expense of getting to and from the school, besides the hardships entailed, is so great that she finds it next to impossible to continue the work.\n\nI would then recommend that you use your best endeavour to get the Department to so increase her salary as to place her on the same basis as the other teachers on the Reserve.\n\nI am satisfied you cannot do better than retain the services of Mrs. Phillips, if an increase of salary would do it. If you get an unsuitable person to take this position, one whose sole interest is money, you might better close the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He states that the teacher, Mrs. Elna Phillips, has recently resigned.\n\nThe Department has not yet received any intimation from you that there would be a vacancy at this school.

McGookin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSirs:\n\nRe Lower Muncy Indian Day School, Caradoc Reserve, Ont.\n\nFor the past year and a half, I was employed as teacher in the above school. In June of 1927 and June 1928, I took, with the Agent's permission, the Entrance pupils to my home and boarded them during the time of writing the Entrance Examination. The Agent, Mr. McCookin, assured me it was the usual thing to pay the teacher for any expense incurred in connection with board etc. I have written him but he ignores the matter.\n\nI hope you will not merely write and say that I must take this matter up with the Agent because it is no use doing so. I think it is a serious matter when the Agent who represents your Department can make statements and promises that are misleading to the teachers and there is apparently no way of straightening matters.\n\nI might say that I took the pupils to my own home so that I might aid them in every way possible that they might succeed in the examination. The pupils have passed, a rare thing as your records will show, outside the Institution.\n\nI tried very hard to help the children in every way and I feel that this is an injustice to have to demand the payment promised by your Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMrs. J. A. Phillips\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No.7-4-I of the 25th ultimo with reference to the resignation of Mrs. Edna Phillips, teacher at the Lower Muncey Day School.\n\nI beg to say that Mrs. Phillips has not sent in her resignation up to the present. I talked with her some few days before school closed; at that time she was undecided as to whether or not she would continue teaching at this school, since then I have written her asking if she intended resuming her duties after the summer holidays, but have not yet received a reply.\n\nMrs. Phillips is an excellent teacher and if her services can be retained I would be very pleased. She has given very satisfactory service but is of a rather peculiar disposition and has found it difficult to get a boarding place for any length of time; this rather discouraged her and the result will probably be that she will look for another school closer to her home at Strathroy. As soon as I can get in touch with her and get her decision, I will advise you at once. Should she decide to resign no difficulty will be found in getting another teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher with wider experience with Indian children is becoming more efficient in their management. Miss Comfort is energetic and fertile in expedients to interest her classes.\"\n\nMiss Comfort receives salary at the rate of $85 per teaching month, less 10%. She was appointed teacher of this school on September first, 1928, but was absent from December 21st, having taken ill with appendicitis, and was unable to resume duties until September first, 1929. She has been employed continuously since that date.\n\nAt all Indian schools conducted under\nProtestant auspices in Ontario, we require teachers having at least second class provincial certificates. In the Roman Catholic schools, while a number of the teachers have Ontario certificates, there are a number of others who have Quebec qualifications.\n\nThere are 19 pupils enrolled at the Nunsay Bay School, with an average attendance of 17.\n\nSgd A.S. Williams\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMR. WILLIAMS,\nAsst. D.S.G.\n\nMinister's Office\n\nJuly 20, 1933\n\nI have your memorandum of the 17th instant, your file 74-1, regarding the Teacher of the Minosey Indian Day School. I note she has an interim 2nd class certificate for the Province of Ontario, and that it will be necessary for her to return to the Normal School for one year before she can receive a permanent certificate.\n\nIs she entitled to continue on her temporary certificate, or is it the intention of the department to place in charge of this School a Teacher with a permanent certificate?\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nJuly 26, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nReplying to your memorandum of the 20th instant, I have to say that this Department has not during the past requested that teachers holding Interim Second Class Certificates for the province of Ontario give up duties upon the expiry of their certificates. Interim certificates, only, are granted teachers when they graduate from normal schools. These certificates are good for a period of four years, after which the Provincial Department of Education requires that teachers return to normal school for one year's study before their certificate is made permanent.\n\nMiss Comfort, teacher of the Muncey School, obtained her Interim Certificate in the summer of 1928 and, therefore, under the Ontario regulations, the same has expired and she has no regular teaching certificate. In cases of this kind in Ontario Provincial schools, where teachers continue, they do so under authority of a permit from the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nThe last report received from the Provincial School Inspector stated that Miss Comfort was performing satisfactory service, and we have therefore taken no action to dispense with her services, although, under the requirements of the Ontario Department of Education, she would not now be eligible as teacher in a white school. We have never requested a teacher whose interim certificate has expired to return to normal school in order to obtain a permanent certificate.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nAugust 18, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nWith reference to the enquiry from your office, regarding the number of teachers in Indian schools in Ontario who have interim certificates only, for consideration in connection with the case of Beulah Comfort, teacher of the Muncey Indian Day School, there are approximately 20 teachers in our Indian day schools with interim certificates. From the information which we have on our files, it is difficult to decide the number of these teachers whose certificates have expired. In the Coradoc Indian agency, in which the Muncey School is located, there are six Indian day schools, all the teachers of which have interim certificates only. At three of these schools, the teachers have first class interim certificates and three hold second class interim certificates.\n\nAs stated in memoranda dated July 17th and 24th, last, the Department has never requested that teachers whose interim certificates have expired should give up duties.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMR. WILLIAMS,\n\nThe Minister is informed that a vacancy is about to take place on the teaching staff of the Muncey Reserve.\n\nShould this vacancy materialize, the Minister's instructions are that Mr. Aubrey C. Lyons, of R. R. No. 2, Kerrwood, Ontario, is to be engaged, subject, of course, to his having the necessary qualifications.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nEX'D.\n\nAugust 10, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the first instant, regarding a vacancy on the teaching staff at an Indian day school on the Muncey Reserve, I have to say that Mr. A. D. Moore, the Indian Agent, visited the Department yesterday. He states that, up to the present, he has received no intimation from any of the teachers of their intention to give up duties and that, as far as he is aware, they intend to continue their services when the schools re-open after the present summer holidays, on September third, next.\n\nHowever, should a vacancy occur, the Minister's instructions, that Mr. Aubrey C. Lyons be engaged, provided he has the necessary qualifications, will be carried out.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nDecember 20, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 17th instant the action which you have taken regarding the closing of the Lower Muncey Indian Day School until after the Christmas holidays is approved.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would extend to Miss Comfort my very sincere sympathy in the severe loss which she has sustained.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 9, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFrom reports received it is evident that the Department is not justified in continuing the Muncey Indian Day School in view of the very small enrolment and the still smaller average attendance. I also understand that it has not yet been found possible to re-open the Back Settlement School in the basement of the church.\n\nHowever, the question of Miss Howe's appointment in your office has not been definitely decided, although application has been made for a further extension of her services which will, no doubt, be granted. In the meantime I am advised that a competition has been advertised for the position. She will no doubt apply.\n\nIf Miss Howe is successful in the competition and is permanently appointed to your office, it is our intention to close the Muncey School and re-open the Back Settlement School with Miss Comfort as teacher. If, however, Miss Howe does not secure the position in your office, it is our intention to have her take charge of the Back Settlement School.\n\nMy purpose in writing you this letter is simply to outline our intentions in the matter and consequently no attempt should be made to re-open the Back Settlement School or to close the Muncey School at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. G.W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nOctober 13, 1942.\n\nAttention\u2014E.A. Hoxey, Esq.\n\nYour File 7-7-8 & 7-4-1\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere is also the question of the Back Settlement and Lower Muncey Schools. You will have learned by this time that Miss Helen Howe has definitely decided against applying for the position of Clerk at this Office and will be available for the Back Settlement School when ready. The new desks for this school arrived a few days ago but no other equipment so far. However it is noted in the last paragraph of your letter, that at present the Back Settlement School is not to be opened and the Lower Muncey is not to be closed. I presume you will advise as to future intentions. In the meantime I must take advantage of the Church's offer, if only for the storage for desks and other equipment that, I presume, will be arriving shortly.\n\nI might also say, I agree with your decision to close one school. There is no justification for continuing the Lower Muncey School, but whatever you have in mind, thought should be given to centralization. If that is done, I think the situation could be overcome with a minimum of trouble and to the satisfaction of all concerned. It would certainly blend in with other outlined propositions.\n\nYou will please advise whether or not I am interpreting the last paragraph of your letter correctly in delaying any action in opening school for the Back Settlement in the basement of the Church until further orders.\n\nYour obedient servant\nG.W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 27, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, I presume that you have had an opportunity of discussing with Mr. Hoey the school situation, and consequently a decision regarding the re-opening of the Back Settlement and the closing of the Muncey Day School will be delayed until he returns to the office next week.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G. W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nMemorandum for file:\n\nWhen Mr. Hoey visited the Caradoc Reserve recently the following arrangements were made with reference to the Back Settlement and Muncey Schools:\n\n1. Arrangements have been made to conduct the Back Settlement School in the basement of the Anglican Church and the Agent was instructed to have the necessary supplies placed there as soon as possible. If Miss Howe does not wish to continue in the Indian office at Muncey, she will re-open the school immediately after the Christmas holidays. In that event, the Back Settlement School will continue in operation until June 30, 1943, at which time the situation should be reviewed with a view to determining if the number of children available justifies the continuance of the school for the academic year 1943-44.\n\n2. However, if Miss Howe wishes to remain in the Indian office at Muncey, the Agent was instructed to close the Muncey Indian Day School before the Christmas holidays and place the present teacher of that school, Miss Comfort, in charge of the Back Settlement School after the holidays.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nNovember 24, 1942.\n\nAttention Mr. Hoey,\n\nYour File 7-4-1\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of October 9, wherein you outlined a policy in reference to the Back Settlement and Lower Muncey Schools. It is noted you had in mind, that at the reopening of the Back Settlement School, either Miss Comfort or Miss Howe would assume charge and that there would be a possibility of closing the Lower Muncey School. This question was again discussed during your recent visit, and I think it was understood that under existing conditions Miss Howe preferred to return to regular occupation. In this connection I have to advise that preparations are going ahead to have the basement of the Anglican Church made ready for the opening of school after the Christmas holidays, with Miss Howe as teacher.\n\nThis leaves the question of Lower Muncey and Miss Comfort. It was my impression that this school would close and the children would be given the option of attending Back Settlement, River Settlement, Bear Creek or be admitted to the Mt. Elgin Institute. Should this still be your policy, you will please confirm. It would also be appreciated if in the event of closing Lower Muncey, you have any suggestions in reference to Miss Comfort's services.\n\nT. P. L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. T. Down,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 27, 1942.\n\nMr. G.W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont.\n\nRe: Operation of Muncey and Back Settlement Schools\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 24th instant, in which you seek information in respect to the operation of the above-noted schools.\n\nYou may remember that it was my intention that Miss Comfort should take charge of the Back Settlement School immediately following the Christmas holidays and that the Muncey School should be closed. This decision was based on the assumption that Miss Howe would remain at your office as clerk. As Miss Howe, however, has decided to go back to her position as teacher at the Back Settlement School, I am not at all sure that the Muncey School should be closed. I am disposed to think that it might be in the interests of all parties concerned to permit it to remain open until the close of the present academic year. I have not in mind any school to which Miss Comfort could be appointed at that date. If you have not yet succeeded in securing a clerk would she be suitable for work at your office? You are more familiar with the pros and cons of the case and with local conditions than I am. You are authorized, therefore, to work out the best arrangements possible under the circumstances and send forward to us your final decision.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November 9, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL\n\nCARADOC:\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThere are six Indian day schools and one residential school - the Mount Elgin Institute - on this Reserve. Five of the schools were in operation at the time of my visit. A fully qualified, experienced teacher is in charge at each school, and I was favourable impressed by the courses of study provided for the pupils. The schools and school grounds were in no sense comparable to the schools of the Six Nations reserve. I noticed at the Muncey School, in charge of Miss B. Comfort, a tablet stating that this school was established in 1840, with funds collected in England by the Chief of the Band. This school was in a deplorable condition and had to be abandoned about two years ago. The pupils are now taught in the council chamber, which means that the members of the council have, for the time being at least, no place in which to meet. This has caused a certain amount of dissatisfaction. The old school should be dismantled and the lumber distributed to Indian for the repair of their homes, and a new school should be built.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nDecember 3rd, 1942.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq., Supt. Welfare & Training, Ottawa.\n\nIn acknowledging your letter of November 27th, it is noted that the two schools, namely, Back Settlement and Lower Muncey, are to remain open immediately following the Christmas holidays.\n\nI was rather interested in the later suggestion of your letter and have been giving it some thought. Miss Comfort would perhaps solve our problem, but before approaching her, I would like some definite proposal as to what the Civil Service Commission, the Department of Indian Affairs or the Ministers Office have in mind. Personally, I think she might fill the position with credit, but it would be hardly fair to ask her to accept such a position without giving her some assurance that her services would receive consideration in the recently advertised competition.\n\nTodate, I have not been advised officially whether or not a suitable appointee applied and I do not appreciate the days ahead. Miss Howe has expressed a wish to terminate her engagement at this office on the 19th day of December. That however, is another matter, but I think the interpretation of your letter would suggest, providing other arrangements have not been made and providing Miss Comfort, would be willing to accept the office position that the Lower Muncey School be closed immediately following the Christmas Holidays.\n\nI realize of course that the office appointment is a Civil Service appointment and perhaps not within your jurisdiction, but owing to the fact that the closing of a school is involved, you might discuss the matter with the officials directly concerned.\n\nI shall await your reply with interest.\n\nC.W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 9, 1942.\n\nG. W. Down, Esq., Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont.\n\nYour letter of December 3, 1942, addressed to Mr. R. A. Hoey, has been referred to me for attention.\n\nSo far as the competition held some weeks ago for the filling of the position of Clerk, Grade 2, at the Caradoc Agency is concerned, I have to advise you that no eligible list was established, and the matter of whether or not another competition widening the field of advertisement will be proceeded with is now under consideration by the Civil Service Commission.\n\nI think, therefore, if Miss Comfort is willing to accept employment as Clerk at the Caradoc Agency, the Department will be very glad to accept her services and will recommend to the Civil Service Commission that she be appointed temporarily, effective January 2, 1943, as Clerk, Grade 2, at a salary of $1,060 per annum. If Miss Comfort accepts the offer of this employment, I would ask you to have her complete the enclosed application form, in duplicate, and forward both copies to this office as soon as possible in order that the matter may be taken up with the Civil Service Commission.\n\nShould the Commission decide at a later date to advertise the position, Miss Comfort will have an opportunity to enter the competition. Please let me hear from you as soon as possible in order that action may be taken in the matter, both as to the Clerk and the suggested closing of the school.\n\nSgd. Harold W.

This difficulty was solved by bringing in two of our old teachers and although I have not found it convenient to visit the several schools as often as I should have liked, I have to report, at this time, a very satisfactory teaching staff.\n\nMr. Doucet visited the Agency during the year and with him I visited the various schools. It was on a Sunday and I hope he enjoyed his communion. With the exception of Oneida No. 1 which is a new school, all, more or less, need repairs. Back Settlement, with its entire equipment was burned to the ground. This was quite a loss and disappointment to both teacher and pupils as some were studying for Entrance examinations. Arrangements have been made and the school has been reopened in the basement of the Anglican Church. Lower Muncey, with its small numerical enrollment has been closed and Miss Comfort who has taught the Muncey children for many years is taking over the position of clerk at the Indian Office.\n\nGeo.

W. Down, Ind. agt, will make inquiries to the Ind Department if old Mission School is owned By som Mission or its a Band Property.\n\nIn reference to Resolution No. 1. At a meeting held immediately following the regular monthly Council of the Munceys of the Thames, May 8th, a request was made, by resolution, to dispose of an old building situated on the school site of the Muncey Reserve. The building in question is in a very dilapidated condition, and my recommendation would be that the building be wrecked and usable material salvaged for other building purposes or sold by tender. However, before any action as to disposal be taken it is necessary to determine ownership. I therefore advised that the question be submitted to Ottawa to determine whether or not they had legal right to dispose of same. The following inscription is cut on a marble plaque hanging in the building\n\n\"This Mission School was erected A.D. 1857 by Hereditary Chief John B. Waubauno who collected the funds in England.\"\n\nIf you have any information as to ownership a report would be appreciated. In any case, if the building is to be retained it must be considered for extensive repairs, otherwise it will be a total loss. The older members of\n\n.................\nthe Band are of the opinion that it belongs to the Band, whereas the younger members and Council prefer their right of disposal. Personally, I would say it is Band property and would recommend that they be given permission to dispose of it to the best advantage.\n\nGec. W.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAttention of Mr. C.W. Jackson\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson,\n\nI am coming today with a request for a little personal assistance from the Minister. Here are the facts.\n\nWe are experiencing very great difficulty in getting teachers for the Indian Schools. You know that where you have fifty or sixty boys it is impossible to have decent discipline unless at least you have one teacher who is a man. We have an offer of a teacher who is willing to go to Muncey. His name is Sam Dodds. He holds a first class teacher's certificate for Ontario. He was called up some time ago for military service and given the status of conscientious objector by the Tribunal. The Alternative Service sent him out to Banff to work but that, of course, has been closed out. He is now engaged in ordinary manual labour in the city. I think you will agree with me that it is a waste of good material to have a teacher employed as this man is just now in manual labour\u2014not that there is anything wrong with manual labour but we need teachers. Under the circumstances, that he is a conscientious objector and that this status must be disclosed where any School Board would employ him because they would have to enter into a contract with Alternative Service, it is practically impossible for him to get a school.\n\nWe are willing to employ him at Muncey\u2014indeed, we are anxious to have him. I am convinced that he will not, in any way, hurt the Indian children. He is a young man of fine appearance and excellent character. We have on a number of occasions been in touch with Selective Service in connection with the employment of conscientious objectors, and have received nothing but the most courteous consideration from them. However, I have reason to believe that Mr. Westman or Mr. McKinnon of the Department of Labour, who are the men in charge of this branch, would like to have a request from someone higher up to permit Mr. Dodds to be employed as a teacher at Muncey. If Mr. Crerar would be good enough, as he did on a previous occasion, to phone Mr. McNamara, asking that Mr. Dodds be made available for Muncey, I think the matter would be arranged in a minute. I hope Mr. Crerar will not be too busy to take two or three minutes of his time to do that for me. The School is to reopen on the first of September and action should be taken right away. It will be greatly appreciated if you will be good enough to do this for us.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6149, File 415-1, part 2)\nAttention of Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI beg to enclose copy of letter which I wrote to Mr. Jackson about getting the services of Sam Dodds for Munsey.\n\nYou will remember that I spoke to you about the Revolving Fund which had been set up. I would like to have quotations of Mr. Meighen's remarks in the Senate which you have in one of your drawers and also statement about the Revolving Fund or at least where I can get it in the Department's report.\n\nYou also said that there had been made in Ontario a survey of the mental possibilities of the Indians. I think you said it was a pretty extensive thing but if you could send me some of it I should be obliged. I am going to talk to a group of ministers at the end of the month about Indians.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAugust 14th,\n1944.\nOttawa, January 18, 1946.\n\nMr. George W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nThe Muncey School was closed at the end of December, 1942, partly due to the fact that there was such a small number of children available. There was a phone call from the Minister's office this afternoon with reference to this school, and I am anxious to know if the situation has changed. Do you think this school should be re-opened? Of course, I realize that even if there are children available it will be difficult to secure teachers. However, I would like to have up to date information with regard to the situation at this point.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nReference is made to your letter of January 18th with regard to the Lower Neebing School.\n\nFirst, you will recall that this section was closed due to the fact that there were only four or five pupils on the roll and no immediate prospect of increase.\n\nSecond, because the Council complained that the building, their council hall, was loaned for school purposes and that the people wanted it back for their meetings and social gatherings.\n\nHowever, a check at this time reveals that the condition, as far as children old enough for school enrollment remains the same as 1942 with no immediate prospect of increase. The children who would ordinarily be attending this school, if it were open, are attending Red Creek school, which is approximately one mile from the Neebing School site and approximately one and one half miles from their homes. I do not think I would be justified in recommending that the school be reopened to accommodate four or five pupils. You must also keep in mind that the building is not a school. However, if for this it is necessary to reopen it, I will endeavour to make satisfactory arrangements with the Neebing Council, also try to secure a teacher, which in itself is a difficult proposition.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 24, 1946.\n\nMr. G.W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the Muncey School. In view of the information that you have supplied I can see no particular reason why we should re-open this school at the present time. The contents of your letter is exactly what we need on file for future reference.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, February 22, 1946.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nc/o Mr. G. W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont.\n\nIn a letter dated February 19, Indian Agent Down writes as follows:\n\n\"In this connection the teacher feels that he would rather board and lodge than be encumbered with the responsibilities of housekeeping. I explained to him that he could arrange his own accommodation and whatever he did to make himself comfortable would be satisfactory to the Department. He therefore arranged to live and board with an Indian family which I had arranged for, as a temporary measure until the residence was ready. Under the circumstances it will not, at this time, be necessary to purchase new furniture; neither will it be necessary to remove the furniture from the Nurse's apartment, unless Dr. Moore or Dr. McGlenahan wishes it removed. You might take the matter up with Dr. Moore and advise what his wishes are.\"\n\nI would appreciate it if you would have a talk with the new teacher and let me know what you think of him. I suppose if he wishes to live with an Indian family, there is not very much that we can do about it, but personally I think he will be more comfortable in the teacher's residence.\n\nYou will note, from the latter part of the letter, that this matter of furniture again arises. I am not familiar with the situation regarding the nurse and the doctor at the moment, but unless the furniture is actually required and no other provision can be made, I think the furniture should be placed in the residence.

Ferrier, Esq.,\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose a letter received from Miss Buelah Comfort, who was appointed teacher at the Muncey Day School and took up her duties on the 4th of September, she taught until the 21st December when she was taken ill with appendicitis and has been unable to resume her duties since. It is hoped that she will be able to do so after the Easter holidays.\n\nDuring the time Miss Comfort taught school, her services were entirely satisfactory. She took a real interest in her work and although only teaching for about fifteen weeks, the pupils made very good progress under her tuition.\n\nMiss Comfort feels that she is entitled to some sick leave and I recommend, for your consideration and approval, that she be given one month's salary, this amount would greatly assist her in paying for operation and hospital account, and it would also add to her interest in her work. I will be glad if you can see your way clear to do this for her.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI.A.\nR.R.I., Mt.

This matter should receive your early consideration, as, if it is decided to authorize any work being carried out, it might be done during the coming Easter holidays.\n\nThe Inspector also states that a well is needed for this school, as the drinking water is at present supplied from a neighboring well. You should state whether, in your opinion, you would recommend that a well be drilled or dug, or whether it would not be possible to continue the present arrangement for the obtaining of the water required. We do not desire at the present time to undertake the expenditure involved in drilling a well unless it is absolutely required.

Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, in favour of Mr. McArthur, should be made out by yourself after the work is completed, if you are satisfied that a good job has been done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If so, please state the approximate cost of the labour and material, and how you would recommend that the work be done.\n\nWith reference to the pupils who require attention for eye trouble, you may arrange to have them examined by an optician and the glasses required supplied.

Ferrier, Esq.,\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 7-4-5 of the 22nd instant with reference to Inspector Sexton's remarks as to providing a water supply for the Lower Muncy Day School and also the heating of this school.\n\nRegarding the water supply, there is a good well situated on the side of the road about 100 yards from the school; sometime ago, a new pump was installed in this well and a concrete cover; the water is excellent for use and there should be no difficulty whatever in getting the school supply from this well. I am informed by some of the residents that several attempts have been made at different times to get water on the school grounds, but have not been successful. Unless the Department is prepared to go to the expense of drilling a well, which would cost $5.00 per foot for water and failing to get water, $1.50 per foot, the present supply, which has served for many years, will meet the needs of the school.\n\nRegarding the heating in the cold weather, I might say that I do not think coal would be preferable to the wood; it has always been difficult to get janitors to get the fire going early enough in the morning, as it takes the coal fire longer to get going; the class room would not be properly heated by the time school opened. Owing to the scarcity of dry wood, it was necessary to use green wood last winter, but a supply of dry hard wood has been contracted for this winter; if found necessary another small stove can be used, together with the one already in use, but I do think this will be required. I will give it my personal attention and see that the class room is comfortable and properly heated.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the suggestion made by the Public School Inspector that a better water supply be provided for the use of the Lower Muncey Indian Day School.\n\nIt is considered, in view of your report that there is a good well about 100 yards from this school from which the supply of water required can be obtained, that it will not be necessary to incur the expenditure required in drilling a well nearer the school.\n\nRegarding the heating of this building in the winter, it is noted that you are of the opinion that coal would be preferable to wood. If found necessary later, another small stove could be used. It is noted that you will give the matter of the heating of this school your personal attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

AGENT MCGOOKIN,\nDATED SEPTEMBER 30, 1927.\n\nAnother item of $500.00 is included in the Estimates for painting exterior and interior of the Lower Muncey Day School and for alterations to classroom, providing living accommodation for the teacher, as suggested in letter from Inspector Sexton to the Department, file No. 7-4-8, July 25th.\n\nThe cost of alterations would be approximately $300.00 and for painting the school and closets, $200.00. The teacher, Mrs. Phillips, is very anxious that living accommodation be provided, as the roads leading to the school are at times during the winter months almost impassable. The classroom is altogether too large for classroom work, and apart from providing living accommodation for the teacher, it would be greatly improved by being made smaller and more compact. It is 42 x 26 with a 15 foot ceiling. It is not uptodate and is very hard to heat. Without providing living accommodation for the teacher the classroom could be made uptodate for teaching for about $100.00.\n\nThe Lower Muncey School should be painted, whether the Department decides to make the suggested alterations to the interior or not, the foundations require pointing and repairs to the window frames will be required.\nMuncey, Ontario,\n30th December, 1927.\n\nAttention of Russell T.

Ferrier, Esq.,\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 7-4-5 of January the 28th regarding Inspector Sexton's report on the Lower Muncey Day School.\n\nI beg to say that the Inspector's recommendation that a room be fitted up in the school building for the teacher's living quarters, is not considered favourably; this is one of the least desirable sections on the reserve for a teacher's residence, especially one living alone, and I am very doubtful if a lady teacher would care to make her living quarters in the school building. I do not think that the expenditure necessary to fit up the place for this purpose, would be wise. The present teacher\u2014Mrs. Edna Phillips\u2014has made arrangements to board in the village of Middlemiss, about two and a half miles distant from the school, and she is also arranging for the hire of a horse conveyance to take her to school when the roads are impassable for a car. I think it would be wise to try this arrangement out before going to the expense of fitting up rooms in the school building. Mrs. Phillips is not in favour of the suggested living quarters in the building.\n\nThis school requires painting both inside and out, the foundations require repairs and the window frames and sills also need attention, the roof, which is a metal one, leaks in places and will need to be repaired before painting the interior.

It could be made into\ncomfortable quarters for a schoolroom but, as it\nis, it cannot be heated, etc., etc.\n\nThe old council chamber is in a very\ndilapidated condition and is getting worse all\nthe time.\n\nThere is no water on the premises.\nChildren cannot get along without a constant\nsupply of good water.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No.7-4-5 of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the painting of the Lower Muncey Day School.\n\nI beg to say that owing to the extra amount of work involved in connection with the recent Royal Commission investigation, the work of painting this school has not commenced, as the investigation is now over the work will be started within the next few days, day labour, under a competent foreman, will be employed.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir.\nYour obedient servant.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs\nMuncy Station Ont.\nAttention Mr. McGeigan\nEstimate for painting of\nLower Muncy School\nAll Outside Works to be\nshellaced, followed by\n2 coats of paint. Work to\nbe done in workmanship\nlike manner. Material to\nbe supplied by Department\nThis figure does not include\nany but Buildings\nfor the sum of $70.00\nSeventy Dollars.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMitchell McArthur\nMuncey, Ontario.\n13th August, 1928.\n\nAttention of Russell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter No. 7-4-5 of the 25th ultimo in connection with the painting of the Lower Muncey Day School.\n\nI beg to say that a portion of the plaster at the back of the class room has fallen; this will require to be repaired before any painting can be done and I find it impossible to get the services of a plasterer. I have tried London and St. Thomas but none are available; under the circumstances it will be necessary to lay the work of painting the inside of this school over until next year. In the meantime the work of painting the outside will be carried on under Mr. Mitchell McArthur who is a competent painter and will be completed before school opens on the 3rd September.\n\nMr. McArthur's estimate for painting this school (2 coats) is $70.00, all material to be supplied by the Department; this estimate is considered very reasonable and the work will cost less and a better job done than by employing day labour as I first recommended. Mr. McArthur's estimate is recommended for your approval.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir.\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.A.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nOttawa, August 22nd, 1928.\n\nThos.

I.A.\nOttawa, August 22, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letters of the 13th and 14th instant, in connection with the painting of the Bear Settlement, Bear Creek and Lower Muncey Indian Day School buildings. I note that you were unable to have this done by day labour; that you are prepared to purchase the materials, after securing competitive prices, and to engage Mr. Mitchell McArthur, a competent painter, for the activity.\n\nIn reply I beg to confirm my telegram of today's date, as follows:\u2014\n\n\"You may engage Mitchell McArthur to paint three day schools.\"\n\nIt is understood that Mr. McArthur will give three coats of paint to the outside, one coat of murose to the inside and two coats of paint to the ceiling and woodwork of the Bear Settlement Indian Day School for $140; that he will give two coats of paint to the Bear Creek School for the sum of $45; and that he will give two coats of paint to the Lower Muncey School for the sum of $70. All outside knots are to be shellacked.\n\nWhen the work has been satisfactorily completed, you may forward a properly certified account, in duplicate, in favour of Mr. McArthur.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I believe that sheeting would be better than plaster, the roof is a metal one and leaks in spots where the nails have rusted away, and it is almost impossible to locate these spots, as a result the plaster suffers and keeps falling off. During the recent heavy rain storms the plaster has cracked and fallen, giving the class room a very unsightly appearance. The outside of the building is in good condition and well painted.\n\nI will be glad to be advised if the minor repairs, above mentioned, may be carried out in the meantime.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI.A.\nOttawa, April 13th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, relative to the repairs required to the Muncey Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have the fence wire tightened and approximately 15 new posts installed. You may also arrange for the purchase and installation of a new wire gate to replace the present one which you state is past repair. You may also arrange to have about 15 loads of gravel placed around the front walk and toilets, and you may have fasteners placed on both toilet doors, if required. The above work should be carried out as soon as weather conditions permit, and as cheaply as possible. Please forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRelative to the renovation required to the interior of the school building, I have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the cost of sheeting the ceiling with metal sheeting, and also, if required, the cost of plastering the walls. It is also considered that the roof of the building should be repaired in order to prevent leakage. If any painting of the interior is required after the ceiling and plastering is completed, you should state what work of this nature is required and the cost of same. When we have full information as to the cost, and the exact nature of the work to be performed, consideration will be given to authorizing having it carried out during the coming summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

INSPECTOR SEXTON,\nDATED MAY 17th, 1929, ON HIS INSPECTION OF\nTHE MUNGEY INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 7-4-6.\n\nOn the school premises, there is a frame building not originally intended for a school but a Mission. It is impossible with the present system of heating to properly heat this building, largely, on account of the high ceilings. The interior should be remodelled, if continued to be used as a classroom. The plaster is off the ceiling and the walls need redecoration badly.\n\nThere is a wood shed in good repair. Two closets situated in the very worst part of the yard, in a place often covered with water. They should be rebuilt in another part of the yard.\n\nThere is no water on the school premises and a supply of good pure water is necessary for the health and comfort of the pupils. There should be a good earthen ware tank in the school for holding the water, and individual drinking cups.\n\nThe school property could be made very much more attractive if rows of evergreen trees were planted along the north and west side of the school yard.\nJune 24, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nI have been discussing Mr. Public School Inspector Sexton's recent report on the Muncey Indian Day School with Inspector McGeckin. He believes that it would be advisable for you to look at this building when you are next on the reserve. There has been some talk of setting apart a portion of this building for a teacher's residence, but I am not sure that this is really required. Apparently, something should be done to make the building more easily heated and to repair the ceiling. I have turned out some of the correspondence.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6149, File 415-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter 7-4-5 of April 13th last relative to the renovation of the interior of Muncey Day School, I would recommend that the following work be done this Summer,\n\nThat owing to this class room ceiling being at least 18 feet high, that a false ceiling be put in at either 10 or 12 feet and to do this it would need 60, 2x4's, 14 feet long and 60 braces 1 x 4, 8 feet long, metalic ceiling could be put on the rafter, of which it would take 10 square at $5.00 a square. The plaster of the south wall to be removed and the whole replaced with gyproc. Two coats of muresco to be put on the whole interior, all walls and the ceiling.\n\nMr. Lucas of Glencoe, has estimated the cost of labour and material at $279.00 and I would recommend that he be given the contract at that price, with the understanding that he engage as much Indian labour as possible.\n\nThe roof of the school needs attention and this can be done by day labour and a good grade of elastic gum be put on around the chimney and ridge board, where it is now leaking. At a future date this steel roof should be painted to prevent rust. A gate is needed 10 feet long for the school fence a new floor put in the boys closet and locks on the closet doors and this should not exceed an additional $25.00 in cost and can be done by the Indians.\n\nConsideration should also be given to arrange the building of a teacher residence in this school or to the building of a residence at a place which would be used both by the teacher of Muncey School and also Back Settlement School, both teachers I understand find it hard to secure a proper or suitable boarding house as it is now arranged.\n\nsecretary.\nDept of Ind. Affs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 9, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Muncey Indian Day School.\n\nYou may engage Mr. Stanley Hawes, of Mt. Brydges, to put in a metallic false ceiling at 13 ft. Mr. Hawes should also repair the roof where it is leaking, put in a gate for the school fence, a new floor in the boys' closet and locks on the closet doors.\n\nYou may engage Mr. Charles Lucas, of Glencoe, to remove the plaster from the south wall of this school and replace it with tentest, then put two coats of muresco on the whole interior, including the ceiling.\n\nThe Department relies on you to see that these repairs and improvements are carried out at a reasonable price.

Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. A. D. MOORE, INDIAN AGENT, MUNCHY, ONT., DATED DECEMBER 6TH, 1929.\n\nMiss Baird, Miss Comfort and Miss Howe, teachers on the Chippewa section of Caradoc Reserve, have requested that I take up with Dept. the building of car garages at each of their schools. In all three cases, their homes or boarding houses are miles from their school and it is necessary for them to use cars to get there and all day in all kinds of weather their cars must remain outside as there is no building to put them in. I understand a portable garage can be put up for around $100.00 and would ask your consideration of the erection of such a garage at each of the schools of the above-mentioned teachers.\nOttawa, December 14, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your monthly report of inspection of the Bear Creek, Muncey and Rock Settlement Indian Day Schools in which you recommend that garages for the teachers' use be erected at each of these schools, I have to say that the Department will approve of the providing of garage accommodation at the Rock Settlement and Muncey Day Schools. If weather conditions permit, you may arrange for the erection of a garage of the portable type at each of these schools. You should see that the site selected in each case does not interfere with the playground accommodation or the general appearance of the school building. We note you estimate the cost of the erection of a portable garage to be approximately $100, but, if possible, to do so, they should be furnished at each school at less cost. The Department will rely on you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred in the providing of suitable garage facilities for the teachers at both these schools. After the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred for each school separately.\n\nRelative to the erection of a garage at the Bear Creek School, the Department does not consider that this is necessary at the present time. We understand that the teacher resides in the village of Middlesex, which is only a mile distant from the school, and that a car is not necessary to get to and from her school in any condition of weather.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear from you as soon as the two garages authorized above have been completed, with full particulars as to the type, cost, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nActing Asst.-Deputy & Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI would wish to advise that I have practically completed the installation of single school desks in the Back Settlement, Bear Creek and Lower Muncey Indian Day Schools and find that it will be necessary to have a few more seats to complete the installation, which will mean that all schools on Caradoc Reserve will be fully equipped with single school desks.\n\nThe following seats are required, for Bear Creek School,\n\n- 1, No 2, Single School rear.\n- 1, No 5, Single School Desk.\n\nThe following is needed for Lower Muncey School,\n\n- 3, No 2, single school rears.\n- 2, No 3, single school desks.\n- 3, No 4, single school desks.\n\nNot being familiar with these seats it was not possible for me to give you the exact number required at the original order and it was not until I was completing the equipment of the last school I was able to ascertain what was still needed. Kindly have these desks sent as soon as possible and I shall have them installed at some weekend and the Canada Foundries and Forging Ltd. of Brockville Ont. should be informed that they did not send sufficient screws for the desks they supplied and I had to purchase 6 boxes to replace what they were shy.\n\nSecretary,\ndept of Ind.

I have, therefore, to request that you will arrange to ship, as soon as possible, addressed to A. D.

Muncey, Ont., sales tax included, to Mr. Moore, who is being informed of the order placed with you, and requested, upon receipt of the desks, to certify the account and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nThis equipment should be shipped knocked down, all parts complete, and ink wells should be supplied with each desk.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nCanada Foundries & Forgings Ltd.,\nBrookville,\nOnt.\nOttawa, January 9, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, requesting that a few extra single school desks and rear seats be supplied in order to complete the seating equipment at the Bear Creek and Lower Muncey Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that an order is today being placed with the Canada Foundries & Forgings Ltd., Brockville, to ship, addressed to you, Muncey, Ont., the following:\n\n2 No. 2 Single School Desks,\n3 No. 2 Rears,\n3 No. 4 Desks,\n1 No. 5\n\nThe above firm have been requested to make early shipment and to forward their account covering the cost, in duplicate, to you.

Please state where you would propose the indoor closets be located, the type of same and the cost of carrying out the work of having them properly installed. When we have your report, consideration will be given as to whether the Department can provide the funds required or not.

Ltd. at Dundas, Ont., is the firm that is installing closets in most of the white schools in Middlesex County and they submit a price of $250.00 for a complete toilet system which includes two bowls, seats and covers with the necessary tanks, vent pipe, etc. As this school has only 18 pupils at present and this number not likely to be greatly increased in future, a single bowl for girls and a single bowl for boys would be sufficient and the whole cost of instalment including the erection of the partition would not be more than $315.00 at the most.\n\nThe Kaustine firm also supplies the service truck for the emptying of these tanks yearly at an additional cost of $14.00 which includes a year's supply of chemical for refilling after the tank has been pumped out. I enclose illustration of these Kaustine toilets.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D.

In this connection I have to say that our funds for the present fiscal year are extremely limited and it has been found necessary to curtail all expenditure as far as possible. It is regretted that the Department will be unable to provide the funds for the installation of toilet facilities in the school building this year. This work will have to stand over.\n\nIt is hoped that the present outdoor toilets will be satisfactory for another year. You should arrange during the present holidays to have these toilets thoroughly cleaned and placed in a good sanitary condition. Please see that a good strong lock is placed on the doors, in order that they will not be used by outside parties. You should keep the expense in the cleaning, the installing of locks and any repairs required as low as possible. When the work has been completed, please forward a certified account, in duplicate, in the usual manner, covering any expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

With reference to the fence repairs, I would advise that after making a guard fence on the entrance to a bridge on the Chippewa Reserve, I had about 12 rods of Page wire fence left and this wire could be used in the repair of the Lower Muncey school yard and only the cost of the work and a few staples would be necessary and I would wish to have your authority to do this work.\n\nThere is needed about six loads of gravel around the school building to fill the water holes that have been gouged out from rain from the roof; two loads of this gravel should be placed at the entrance to the outer houses of the school and the total of these repairs should not exceed $10.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 27, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to the repairs required to the fence around the school yard and to the roof at the Lower Muncey Indian Day School, also regarding the gravel required around the school building.\n\nRelative to the fencing, it is noted that you have sufficient wire on hand to make the repairs required. The Department will approve of you arranging to have the work done and also purchasing the staples required. You may arrange to have 6 loads of gravel spread around the school building and at the entrance to the out houses. You may also have the broken pane of glass replaced. After the above work has been carried out, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the repairs and materials.\n\nRegarding the painting of the roof, I should be pleased to have a further report from you as to the work you would recommend be carried out and the approximate cost of same. I may say that our funds this year are extremely limited and only the painting required to prevent leakage or damage to the roof should be given consideration this summer. When we have your report as to the work to be done and the cost involved, further consideration will be given the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nOttawa, July 8, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to the painting of the roof of the Lower Muncey Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your arranging to have the roof of this school given two coats of a good grade of paint. The cost of the work should not exceed your estimate of approximately $50. You should arrange to purchase the paint, etc., required, and for the labour. In purchasing the paint, you should be guided by instructions regarding purchases in your Agency. It is considered that, if a good quality of a suitable paint is put on this roof, it would be satisfactory. This work should be carried out during the summer holidays, and, when completed, you should obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, which you should certify and forward to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nA. D.

Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, February 18, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your l-3-3 of the 11th instant regarding the Muncey Indian Day School, I beg to say that you may purchase sugar to the value of $1.00 for the noon lunches.\n\nYou may, also, purchase the bolts and nuts necessary for the garage door, at a cost of fifty cents (50\u00a2).\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nOttawa, May 31, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. J. H. Sexton, Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Muncey Indian Day School, states that the toilets are not in very good condition and that the yard might be improved. He states, also, that there is no proper container for water in the classroom and that the water should not be kept in an open pail, but in a covered container, with tap for drawing off the water from the bottom.\n\nI would request that you inform the Department what work or repairs are required in placing the toilets in a good condition and also in connection with improving the school yard.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of a suitable water container, of the type mentioned by the Inspector. Please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nWith reference to the supplying of a flag, please state if there is a flagpole and if it is in good condition. If so, a flag could be sent from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nI would beg to enclose Agents' Report Forms covering my visit to the six Indian Day Schools of Caradoc Agency for the month of May.\n\nFollowing the procedure of other years I will after my visit in June submit to you recommendations of repairs that will be needed at these schools and which work can be done during the coming Summer holidays. At that time I will report as to the suggestions made by Mr. Inspector Sexton re Lower Mancey School, your letter 7-4-5 May 31st, 1935.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-4-5 of May 31st, dealing with the report of Mr. Sexton, Public School Inspector on Lower Muncey Indian Day School and would advise that I visited this school on June 10th and would report as follows,\n\nThere is at this school a three gallon crock water container and the tap of the container needs a little repair which can be done locally. There is no flagpole at the school and the teacher informs me that she has many times requisitioned for a flag with her school supplies and has never received one. A Union Jack flag 4' X 6' should be supplied to be hung up in the class-room.\n\nTwo flower beds and 18 shade trees have been planted since Mr. Sexton was at the school and were arranged for before his visit. Some small repairs are needed to the belfry at the school; 2 window locks to be installed; a new small wood gate to be built and the toilets are so old and have been repaired so often that I would recommend the building of two new ones and to use what material you can out of the old ones and that they be moved to a different location. The total expenditure at this school will be in the vicinity of $30.00 and the work should be done during the coming Summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, June 18, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, regarding the repairs required to the Lower Muncey Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may have a flagpole erected. This should be of an inexpensive type. You should see that it is securely placed and the necessary pulley and rope supplied.\n\nYou may also arrange for the following:\n\n1. Carrying out the repairs required to the belfry,\n2. Installing of two window locks,\n3. Building a new small wood gate,\n4. Erecting two new toilets, on a different location from the present old ones, using any material from the old toilets that would be serviceable.\n\nIt is noted that the total expenditure for the above work, including the flagpole, will be approximately $40, and, if possible, all costs should be kept within this amount. The work should be carried out during the coming summer holidays. When completed to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts, stating in detail the cost of materials and labour.\n\nA flag will be supplied, upon request, when the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6149, File 415-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMuncy, Ontario,\nOctober 31st, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-4-5 of October 21st regarding water supply at four of the Indian Day Schools at Caradoc Agency.\n\nIn this connection I have made an inspection of the schools and the school grounds around each and would beg to report as follows:\n\nOneida No. 2 School\n\nAt the present time and during the past several years water for use at this school has been obtained directly across the road from an Indian named Abram Williams. The Department has been paying ten dollars for the privilege of obtaining water for the school for the school term of September to June of each year. Mr. Williams can continue to supply this water if reimbursed for it at the above price. Water is very scarce in the locality of this school and therefore, if a well is dug on the grounds there would be little chance of striking good water. A filtered well would be necessary. A well about 20 ft. deep and nine ft. in diameter could be dug. The water from the roof of the school would be carried into the earth troughing by means of a down pipe to the ground where it would enter a trench containing gravel to filter it. This trench would be connected with the well on the school grounds.\n\nBear Creek School\n\nThe water used at this school is obtained from a good spring which is situated in lands near the school. I understand that water has been obtained from this source for many years. At the present time there is a 12 ft. well located on the school grounds. In accordance with instructions contained in official letter of July 7th last, this well was cleaned out during the summer months and we were in hopes that water would come into the well which would be fit for drinking purposes. Apparently this well which was dug many years ago contains only surface water and was never used as the water was impure. The well does not contain any pump due to the fact that the well in it was never used. Since the well was thoroughly cleaned out in August, no water has yet come into it and therefore nothing further was done in connection with this well. In the first place it is too shallow and brickling in it is loose. Many bricks would have to be replaced and the well deepened and as good wells are very scarce in this neighbourhood it is very doubtful if water would be procured in this old well.\n\nIn view of the condition of this...........\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nBear Creek School - cont'd\n\nIn view of the condition of this old well it would involve considerable expense in repairing and deepening it and a new well could be dug here and the present one filled in. A filtered well the same as that described in this letter in connection with Oneida No. 2 School could be dug and if this were done no doubt a satisfactory water supply would be secured.\n\nRiver Settlement School\n\nAt this school the water has been obtained from an excellent spring located near the school. Many Indians in the district surrounding this school obtain water from this spring. If the Department decide that a well is necessary on the school grounds I would suggest that a filtered well the same as described in this letter in connection with Oneida No. 2 School should be dug. Good wells are scarce in the locality of this school and it would be very unlikely that we would hit a good supply of water. Therefore a filtered well would be required.\n\nLower Muncey School\n\nThe water used at this school is obtained from a well located about three hundred yards from the school on the side of a public road. Many other Indians obtain their drinking water from this well in which there is no pump. In view of the fact that this well is located on a road some distance from the school lot I would not recommend placing a pump in it as it would be broken before long with numerous Indians using it. Therefore a well would have to be dug on the school grounds and in all probability we would not strike sufficient water in this area so that a filtered well would have to be installed the same as at the above described schools.\n\nIn accordance with the above it would, in my opinion, be necessary to install four new filtered wells if a supply of water for each school is to be obtained on the school lots. This would certainly entail a considerable expenditure as three of the schools have never been equipped with eavetroughing and this would first of all have to be put on. The only school which has eavetroughing on at the present time is the Bear Creek school. The estimated cost of completely installing four wells with pumps at these schools would be as follows:\n\nEavetroughing at 3 schools, approximately 250 ft. completely installed with down pipe $77.75\n\nDigging four trenches, filling with gravel @ $2.00 per trench 8.00\n\nDigging four wells each approximately 20 ft. deep and five ft. diameter (Indian labour at $2.50 per ft.) top on well included in this price $200.00\n\nOne cord of gravel delivered in small lots to each of the four schools 10.00\n\nThree barrels of cement for top of well @ $2.50 8.40\n\n(Cont'd)\nBricks for the four wells - 6400 @ $14.00 M $89.60\n\nFour pumps (Beatty) 4\" cylinder with 1\u00bd\" pipe @ $15.00 each 60.00\n\n230 ft. of facer board to attach eavetroughing 1\" x 5\" at $40.00 per M 9.20\n\nIn putting down four filtered wells at these schools the total estimated cost is $463.05 which includes all labour and materials.\n\nIt is my opinion that none of these schools are inconvenienced to any great extent because of lack of wells and this is particularly true at the River Settlement, Bear Creek and Lower Muncey Schools. There is an excellent spring very close to the River Settlement and Bear Creek Schools and there is a well on the side of the road near the Lower Muncey School. The pupils can easily carry one or two pails of water a day for use in the schools and I think it would be a good thing to have them carry the water to teach them to be useful. I understand that these schools have been procuring water in this manner for several years in the past and they could continue to do so in future.\n\nThe situation as far as water is concerned at the Oneida No. 2 School is more pressing as we have to pay ten dollars yearly for the water which the school obtains from Abram Williams and it might be a measure of economy to place a filtered well at this school and thus save this annual expense.\n\nOf course, if funds are available, it would be much more convenient and proper to have filtered wells installed at each school but in my opinion neither the teachers nor the pupils at any of the four schools are suffering from lack of water.\n\nI might add that if the wells are to be dug it could be done by an experienced Indian well-digger of this Agency and his price of $2.50 per foot is less expensive than it would be if we were to have it done by white men.\n\nI trust that the information contained in this letter will be sufficient to enable the Department to arrive at a decision as to whether to install wells at these schools or not and I shall await your further instructions in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. W. McCracken, In Charge Caradoc Agency.\nOttawa,\nNovember 6, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your very complete report regarding the water supply at four of the Indian day schools in the Caradoc Agency.\n\nThe Department is unable to provide, at the present time, the funds that will be necessary to have a well at each of the schools but, in view of the special conditions existing at the Oneida No. 2 School, you may arrange for a filtered well. I presume that the cost of this will be slightly over $100.00.\n\nAt the other schools the teachers should be encouraged to have the children carry the water to the school daily. This will not require any very heavy effort on their part and may be considered as a patriotic duty to relieve the Department of expenditure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Down,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nNOTICE\n\nRECENT ACTS OF WINDOW BREAKING AT THE ONEIDA NO. 3 SCHOOL CAN ONLY BE TERMED \"WILFUL DESTRUCTION\". SOME OF THE GUILTY PERSONS ARE KNOWN AND I WANT THIS TO BE A WARNING TO THEM AND TO ALL WHO CONTEMPLATE SUCH ACTS OF VANDALISM AND ANY FURTHER DAMAGE TO SCHOOL PROPERTY WILL BE SEVERELY DEALT WITH.\n\nOWING TO THE SHORT SUPPLY OF GLASS THIS SCHOOL MUST, OF NECESSITY, REMAIN CLOSED UNTIL REPAIRS CAN BE MADE. I WOULD ASK PARENTS AND ALL CONCERNED TO PLEASE CO-OPERATE AND IMPRESS UPON THE CHILDREN AND THOSE OF ADOLESCENT AGE THAT SUCH ACTS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED AND WILL ONLY MEET WITH PUNISHMENT.\n\nGEO. W. DOWN,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nActs of vandalism are always more or less present where juveniles congregate, but recent happenings at the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School have demonstrated a determined act of wilful damage.\n\nI have recently had some difficulty in locating and purchasing replacement glass for this school and, fortunately, before I could locate a man to put it in, some person or persons, adults or adolescents wilfully smashed every window in the school. The matter has been reported to the police and every effort has been, and is being made to determine the guilty party or parties, but to date we have been unsuccessful. Notices have been placed and residents in the immediate vicinity are angered by such acts and have promised to report any loitering on school property. Were it not for the fact that glass is in very short supply repairs could be made, but I have to close the school pending supplies.\n\nI find it very difficult to keep pace with routine and the ever increasing Agency duties and such matters are extremely annoying. However, every effort will be made to secure glass and have the school reopened as soon as possible.\nOttawa, 26 October 1946.\n\nMr. G. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nVandalism at Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School\n\nReference your 130-3 of Oct. 23.\n\nWe concur in your action concerning the vandalism which has taken place at the above school.\n\nIn view of the situation which exists, the Department authorizes the installation of heavy wire mesh screens on the windows at this school and if you can have this done, you can submit accounts accordingly.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMarch 1, 1949.\n\nMr. F.L. Hall,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nRepair to Schools - Caradoc Agency\n\nThis will confirm our recent conversation with regard to the repairs required at the schools in your superintendency next summer. Both interior and exterior paint will be required, and I would suggest that you requisition for this early in April. We normally provide Sherwin Williams paints directly from the factory, and I would suggest to you that in requisitioning you indicate clearly the colours and types of paints which you wish to use. As I mentioned, we prefer a white ceiling, pale green walls with a darker green under the blackboard. I mentioned to Mr. Joblin that it would be preferable to provide masonite under the blackboards in some of the day schools rather than to paint the plaster or plaster board there.\n\nThe other major item of repair is of course the provision of new roofs, and here again, I would recommend that you submit your requisition for the number of squares of asphalt roofing required. We normally provide three in one strip asphalt shingles, slate surfaced 250 # per square feet.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher with wider experience with Indian children, is becoming more efficient in their management.\n\nThe Department might, with profit, furnish some equipment, i.e., saws, hammers, and work bench for the boys and suitable material for the girls, as most Indian children show great aptitude in making things.\n\nThere are plenty of places for intelligent girls trained to do housework (when they are through school) and for boys. Hence, their school courses should in some measure be framed to furnish the means to these children to prepare them for these positions when they leave school.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nLower Muncey..................

The writing of both third and fourth classes was good. Of four fourth form pupils examined in spelling fifteen words, two were good, one fair, and one poor. Fourth form grammar needs more attention. The teacher is right in stressing the work of the junior pupils. There are three pupils in the room of low mentality.\n\n[OVER]\n\nSIGNATURE OF INSPECTOR........... J. H.

There is no water on the school premises. The schoolyard has wonderful possibilities for beautification if something were done every year to improve it, in the way of planting shrubs in neglected corners, and evergreen trees along the north and east boundaries it might stimulate the impulse in some homes to improve their surroundings.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nUnder this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.\n\nMiss Comfort is faithful and energetic.

There is plenty of room in the building, and the pupils would be better qualified on leaving the school to make a living. To-day, some of the older pupils were doing some work to show at the school fair. The quality of the girls' sewing, and the contrivances of the boys was an evidence of what might be accomplished, if more of this practical training were a part of the school work.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Attention here is given to the cultivation in the pupils of habits of industry, courtesy, good manners, and conduct, of cleanliness, etc., not always directly but incidentally in songs, games, etc.\n\nMost Indian children are skilful and interested in all kinds of handiwork. They can weave, sew, draw, and write better than the average white child, and conditions here are quite suitable, on account of the small attendance for the introduction of that kind of work. There is plenty of room for the installation of such simple equipment as workbench and tools for boys, and some Domestic Science equipment for girls.\n\nNow that Miss Comfort has been teaching for some time, I think it advisable that she should take a refresher Summer Course of training to perhaps complete her present non-professional standing.\nOttawa, May 30, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the report of Mr. Sexton, Public School Inspector, on his recent inspection of the Muncey Indian Day School.

Primary\n\nHealth:\nFairly good -- out one week illness\n\nSuccess:\nWith Juniors good -- Fair success with Senior pupils.\n\nSuggestions:\n(1) To urge upon the authorities the necessity of improving the school premises. The yard has never been properly cleaned since an old building was removed. Weeds and long grass make the yard unsightly. Evergreen shrubs planted along the north and west boundaries would greatly improve the yard. (2) To insist that more mental work in Arithmetic be done and that more problems of a practical character be used more suited to life situations.\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE PUPILS\n\nThe primer class of beginners is making good progress. The teacher took a Kindergarten course last summer, which helped her very much in this work. Two 4th Form pupils were examined in Arithmetic. One was good, and one poor. The spelling and writing of the pupils generally was better than fair. The Art work was deficient in both quality and quantity, speaking generally. The quality of the work with the Junior pupils was better than that with the Seniors.\n\n[over]\n\nSIGNATURE OF INSPECTOR: J.H.

That the teacher's methods are effective is shown by the fluency of the reading of the 1st class pupils. Of two pupils examined in 4th Class Junior, both spell well and write neatly, but for reasons of non-attendance and lack of rational intelligence do not think clearly or express themselves fluently.

Miss Comfort understands the children pretty well, but she makes the mistake that is common among teachers of handing out information to be memorized. Learning to read, write and spell may be essential, but learning to do things with their hands is quite as important, if not more important for Indian children. A proper balance should be established between the purely academic and the practical.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nLower Muncey Indian School Date of visit October 22nd 1937\n\nPost Office address of school Muncie, Ontario\n\nGrades I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX\n\nEnrolled 13\n\nPresent 8\n\nTeacher Beulah Arra Comfort (Name in full)\n\nLicence (or certificate) None\n\nValid to -- 19 --\n\nTaught last term in Lower Muncey\n\nTotal teaching experience 2 years\n\nService in Indian school 9 years\n\nConventions attended West Middlesex Convention Oct. 5th 1937\n\nIndian School Convention 2 days Oct. 14th 16th\n\nLOW HIGH\n\nAppearance X\n\nHealth X\n\nPersonality X\n\nInitiative X\n\nDiscipline X\n\nRelations X\n\nManagement X\n\nTeaching skill X\n\nPreparations X\n\nLanguage X\n\nCommunity service X\n\nPupils' progress X\n\nGeneral comment:\n\nI believe those responsible for the change were ill-advised, in moving these children from their regular classroom to other quarters, in my opinion less suitable.

Sexton, Inspector of Public Schools, in which he refers to conditions at the Lower Muncey School. Mr. Sexton's report reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Today the schoolroom was cold, dreary and uncomfortable (52 degrees Fah. at 1 o'clock). The teacher informs me that conditions have not been better during the winter, perhaps accounting for the prevailing illness in the section. There were only five pupils present today - Grades 1, 2, 6 and 7. These were not above the average in attainment, due to irregular attendance.\"\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that this report is wholly unsatisfactory. We have not at our disposal in the Training Division funds sufficient to pay for the operation of schools with an average attendance of approximately five. I am anxious, therefore, that you should make a thorough investigation of conditions at the Lower Muncey School. You should report to this Branch on the advisability of:\n\n1. Closing the school and having the pupils transported to an adjoining school;\n\n2. The removal of the pupils from the present building to the adjoining building which, I understand, was at one time used as a classroom;\n\n3. The desirability and cost of making certain repairs to the present building, that will enable the pupils to undertake their studies in a classroom suitable for the purpose.\n\nYour attention to this matter and a report to the Department at an early date will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey.\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 25th, File 7-4-6, dealing with the report of Mr. J. H. Sexton, Inspector of Public Schools, and concerning conditions at Lower Muncey School and would report as follows:\n\n1. According to the teacher, the date of visit of the Inspector was one of the coldest days of the winter and a small attendance was the result. There is at this school 15 on the roll and on my day of visit, April 11th (being off duty during February and March) fourteen pupils were present and it is considered that this attendance is sufficient to keep this school open, although the enrolment does fluctuate due to the Indians moving around. This school also is the only one located on the Muncey Reserve of this agency.\n\n2. The present classroom was considered best by the teacher, Medical Supt., Muncey Council, parents of children and myself because it was considerably smaller than the old classroom. The present building was the lesser of two evils and it would have taken much more to repair the old building than the present classroom which was a consideration in removing to the present building as well as size and continuation of use of the present building is considered most satisfactory in the long run.\n\n3. Considerable repairs were made to the grounds and interior of the present classroom during the holiday period last Summer and in view of lack of funds then, repairs were kept to a minimum. Further repairs are necessary to the exterior of the building being the installation of some new window frames and sashes and also the purchase of storm windows and some additional siding to stop all draughts and when this is done it should make the building a quite comfortable and satisfactory classroom. As in past years, a recommendation will be made in June for repairs that can be done during the present Summer holidays.\n\nThe teacher also reports to me that the caretaker was very inexperienced during the past winter in her methods of firing a coal furnacette and that she improved considerable toward the latter part of the winter and this improved the heating.\nconditions in the classroom. I would also inform you that both buildings, the old and the present classrooms, are very old and it will cost considerable in repairs in keeping them in shape and should an official of the Department visit at this stage or at an early date, I would deem it a favour that an inspection be made of the Lower Muncey River Settlement and Bear Creek Schools, all of which buildings are reported over 50 years of age and are going to cost the Department considerable for their repairs and upkeep in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Pupils answer freely, do neat work, participate in school activities joyously. They are proud of their achievements and enjoyed showing the good work in Art, Sewing, Knitting, and work books. They read well, practice good health habits, and take good care of the property. They have planted trees and flowers.\n\nMiss Comfort apparently makes use of every opportunity to bring her methods up-to-date and has given an excellent year's service in this school.\n\nThis school requires a set of weights and measures for instruction in Arithmetic.\n\nGordon Young Inspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Greer, M.A.,\nChief Inspector,\nPublic and Separate Schools,\nParliament Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Greer:\n\nEnclosed are my reports on the Indian Schools for this spring. A duplicate of this letter is also enclosed. It may be forwarded with the reports, if you deem it advisable.\n\nThe teachers on the reserve meet regularly to discuss methods and management. I regret that I have been able to attend only one of these meetings during the year. Ideas are exchanged, so the quality of the work is fairly uniform. Difficulties are solved and devices introduced. Next year they propose to meet with one of our township groups. It will be mutually beneficial. The one teacher who has not a certificate has given outstanding service this year. These meetings and a summer course last year have been very helpful to her.\n\nAs indicated on my reports, the traditional subjects of Reading, Writing, Arithmetic and Simple English Composition are learned well. The libraries of the schools need revision to enable the best work to be done in Social Studies. Generally, Art is excellent, Science and Health very good. This year a limited amount of Woodwork and Sewing has been introduced. This is very valuable, but I think that we should not look upon this phase of the work as vocational training. It does give pupils a very satisfying opportunity to demonstrate manual ability and makes school more attractive.\n\nThe teachers are gradually attempting the activity or project plan of learning. Possibly we should say that they are enlarging the application of this device for it has always been employed to some extent by good teachers.\n\nI have been pleased to note that oral work has improved. Possibly the fact that I was a stranger last fall made the children very diffident about speaking.\n\nAll the ungraded schools have been provided with paper towels. Two of the buildings were painted and repaired last year and I understand that the other two will receive attention this year.\nMr. Greer - 2\n\nMr. Moore, the Indian agent, takes a keen interest in the schools and will look after this. I was pleased to note how the children are taking some interest in the care of the property. In one school each pupil has a little health kit\u2014comb, tooth-brush, etc.\u2014and uses it daily at the school.\n\nThe report on the Mount Elgin Institute is so complete that no reference to the building and accommodations is necessary here.\n\nTrusting that these reports may be satisfactory,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGY:AS Inspector of Public Schools\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nLower Munsey Indian School Date of visit Oct. 19 1939\n\nPost Office address of school Mount Brydges R.R.#1\n\nGrades I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX\nEnrolled 3 3 1 2 0 0 1 1 3 - 14\nPresent 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 1 3 - 10\n\nTeacher Miss Beulah Comfort (Name in full)\n\nLicence (or certificate) Attended Normal School\nValid to No Certificate 19\nTaught last term in This School\nTotal teaching experience 11.4 years\nService in Indian school 11.4 years\nConventions attended (1) Indian Teachers' Convention at Oneida #2 September 22nd\n(2) London Regional Conference October 13th\n\nLOW HIGH\nAppearance 1\nHealth 1\nPersonality 1\nInitiative 1\nDiscipline 1\nRelations 1\nManagement 1\nTeaching skill 1\nPreparations 1\nLanguage 1\nCommunity service 1\nPupils' progress 1\n\nGeneral comment: The care of school supplies, the neat arrangement of books, apparatus and other supplies and other evidence of good housekeeping in this school always gives me pleasure. While Miss Comfort has more facilities for these good features, I believe that her own management must receive credit as well.\n\nClasses in Arithmetic, English, Social Studies, were observed and some of the note-books examined. These lead me to conclude that the work in this school is of the high order previously reported.\n\nThe three girls in Grade IX are taking Correspondence Courses from the Ontario Department of Education. While Miss Comfort was exercising some supervision over this work, I suggested that she make a definite effort to supplement the assigned exercises with lessons related to the exercises. In English this will give opportunity for oral practice of the principles of the exercises. I also suggested that Grade IX girls be guided to give good leadership to pupils' activities in the school.\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Some wood work and sewing has been done. Written work is all neat. It is a pleasure to find that the pupils of this school continue to keep up the good standards of oral work - reading, answers to questions, explanation of school work etc.\n\nTwo of Grade IX girls taking Correspondence Courses still attend. They may complete the course in the year but that is doubtful. Even so, I believe that it is a most satisfactory arrangement. The girls have been at home; they have had a good opportunity to show whether they are capable and sufficiently interested to undertake further studies.

They read well and are exceptionally good in writing. English composition is good. They are slow in arithmetic. Their work in social studies, science, and health has been limited partly because they are slow in apprehending the material and partly due to attendance. They appear to be receiving a good training in household duties. Their sewing is very satisfactory and they have made the room very attractive with art and paper articles. Good health habits are stressed in a practical way. They sing very well. Some of the pupils are fairly old for their grades but they are not below the level at which they can do the work successfully.

SEITON, ON MUNCEY INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\nReport dated May 11, 1927.\n\nThe necessity of provision of some kind for a teacher's residence became very apparent during the past winter. At times, during the spring and fall, the roads leading to and from the school were almost impassable and, as there is no place in this part of the reserve where a teacher can find a suitable boarding place, it seems to me it would be wisdom to provide a residence.\n\nI would suggest that one of the rooms in the school building proper be fitted for use of the present teacher, who is willing to occupy it during bad weather.\nOttawa, July 25th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the Lower Muncey Indian Day School, recommends that provision be made for living accommodation for the teacher. He states as follows:\n\n\"The necessity of provision of some kind for a teacher's residence became very apparent during the past winter.

The cost of any work which you would recommend be undertaken in providing living accommodation for the teacher should be stated. I shall be pleased to have this matter receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. McGookin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No.7-4-8 of the 25th instant reference to Inspector Sexton's recommendation that living accommodation for the teacher be provided at the Lower Muncey Day School.\n\nI beg to say that in the winter months the roads leading to this school are very bad and it often difficult for the teacher to get through although the former teacher living at Middlemiss 3 miles distant used a horse and rig in the bad weather and attended the school regularly.\n\nThe suggestion that the class room be divided and fitted up as a residence has been discussed with Mr. Sexton, this suggestion has some merit but I am not prepared to make a definite recommendation that it be adopted. I think it would be advisable to have Mr. Orr look over the situation the first time he is in this vicinity.\n\nThe class room is 42 X 26 feet with a 15 foot ceiling, there is a teacher's room at the back 12 X 12 feet, the class room would be improved by having it made smaller and more compact and there would be sufficient room for living accommodation for the teacher, but whether the advantages in doing this would justify the expenditure or not is doubtful. Mrs. Phillips, the present teacher, would be willing to live at the school, but should another teacher be appointed in the future, it is very unlikely that she would care to live here alone as the school is situated some distance from a dwelling.\nI would be glad to meet Mr. Orr at London and take him back, should you decide to have him look the situation over. I think this course would be advisable.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir.\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\nI.A.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the recommendation of the Public School Inspector that living accommodation be provided for the teacher in the school building at the Lower Muncey Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that no action will be taken at the present time to fit up rooms for a teacher in this building. It is thought that the teacher can make arrangements for suitable boarding accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. McGookin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. AGENT MCGOOKIN,\nDATED SEPTEMBER 30, 1927.\n\nAnother item of $500.00 is included in the Estimates for painting exterior and interior of the Lower Muncey Day School and for alterations to classroom, providing living accommodation for the teacher, as suggested in letter from Inspector Sexton to the Department, file No. 7-4-8, July 25th.\n\nThe cost of alterations would be approximately $300.00 and for painting the school and closets, $200.00. The teacher, Mrs. Phillips, is very anxious that living accommodation be provided, as the roads leading to the school are at times during the winter months almost impassable. The classroom is altogether too large for classroom work, and apart from providing living accommodation for the teacher, it would be greatly improved by being made smaller and more compact. It is 42 x 26 with a 15 foot ceiling. It is not up-to-date and is very hard to heat. Without providing living accommodation for the teacher the classroom could be made up-to-date for teaching for about $100.00.\n\nThe Lower Muncey School should be painted, whether the Department decides to make the suggested alterations to the interior or not, the foundations require pointing and repairs to the window frames will be required.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR SEXTON,\nDated November 3rd, 1927, on his inspection of the Muncey Indian Day School.\n\nThere is a main school building, not Government owned, which is not, as it stands, suitable. In cold weather it cannot be kept warm and the children are not always comfortable. The building should be remodelled and a room furnished in it for a teacher's residence as there is no suitable place in the immediate neighborhood where the teacher can board.\n\nIf something of this kind is not done, it will be difficult to find a teacher to say in this school and there are a fine lot of pupils here to be taken care of.\nOttawa, January 28, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the Lower Muncey Indian Day School in November, last, has drawn attention to the main school building. He states that this building should be remodelled as it is not suitable for school purposes and is difficult to keep warm. He recommends that a room be fitted up in the school building for the teacher's living quarters, as there is no suitable place in the immediate neighbourhood where the teacher can board.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to your letter of September 30th, 1927, forwarding the estimates for your agency. I have to request that you will again draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next Spring, giving full particulars as to the alterations you would recommend be carried out in this building in order to provide better classroom facilities and also a room for the teacher's living quarters. It is noted that certain painting is required to the building, and in furnishing your report as asked for, you should also state definitely what painting should be carried out. The cost involved in any recommendation made by you in the alterations and in any other work should be stated. If, after your report is received in the Spring, it is decided to have the work done, it could be carried out during the summer holidays in July, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

The old building which is used as a classroom was once a council hall and, although it is too large for classroom purposes, to put in residence facilities there would cost a lot of money and the building is hardly worth it. I believe the Department should consider an appropriation for a teacher's residence, and I have made a note for estimates.

I also consulted with the Minney Band at their last monthly meeting and arranged with them that if the Department of Indian Affairs would consent to allow the sum of $42.00 to be taken from the funds of the band to buy the poles and sections and nails that the band would build the fence. I think it will take fully $42.00 to buy the material. The old lumber would do very well to nail on again, it being a tight board fence on three sides of the yard and another panel fence on the fourth side. I therefore forward a resolution of the bands council asking the consent of the Department to make a grant of $42.00 to buy the material for the fence.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Affairs Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teachers have been provided with vocational training materials as well as supplies to enable them to prepare hot noon day lunches for the pupils during the winter months. A filtered well was recently dug on the grounds at the Oneida No. 2 School. The water in this new well is proving satisfactory both in quantity and purity.\n\nM.W.

Last year the sum of one hundred and ten dollars was made available for this purpose, and this money was divided amongst the schools in proportion to the number of pupils attending each. I would recommend that an accountable cheque for the sum of one hundred and five dollars be forwarded to this office which would be used to purchase the materials required from an approved local source. The distribution would be made as follows:\n\n| School                  | Amount |\n|-------------------------|--------|\n| Oneida No. 1 School     | $18.00 |\n| Oneida No. 2 School     | $18.00 |\n| Oneida No. 3 School     | $18.00 |\n| Back Settlement         | $15.50 |\n| Bear Creek              | $13.50 |\n| River Settlement        | $12.00 |\n| Lower Muncey            | $10.00 |\n\nAgency cheques for each of the above amounts would be issued in favour of the teacher concerned, who would spend this money for materials which the teacher considers could be most advantageously used.\n\nAt the end of the school term in June a report of the manual training activities carried on in each school during the 1941-1942 term would be forwarded to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Enquiry has been again made as to the decision arrived at in this\nmatter & I am unable to make a recommendation but say therefore want to V. report.\n\nJan\nIndian Affairs Office\n\nHagersville\n\n5th Nov. 1888\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to file No. 18630, respecting Miss Mary Murray's application for an increase of salary as teacher of the school upon this Reserve, I beg leave to report as follows:\n\nThat the delay in attending to this subject was caused by my inability to obtain a Council meeting between the 2nd April and 19th Sept. last.\n\nI have forwarded to you the minutes of Council of 19th Sept., and the following is a copy of them upon this matter.\n\nThe Agent read Departmental letter of 16th July respecting an increase in the salary of the Teacher Miss M. Murray.\n\nChief Councillor Wood thought that the salary Miss Murray was receiving was a good one and $50 more than she had received at the Hagersville School.\n\nIt was moved by Councillor Sterling seconded by Councillor Ymer and Resolved.\n\nL. Van Koughnet Esq.,\nDep. Chief, Ind. Aff.\nOttawa\nResolved that the teachers salary be increased to $300 per annum provided the usual grant from the educational fund can be procured. Carried.\n\nIn favor of an increase of salary to Miss Murray. I find that her character is very good; that she taught for three years in one of the divisions of the Haginsville School; that she is very highly spoken of by the Haginsville School Board as a teacher and trainer of children; that since she has taught upon the Reserve, she has obtained the confidence of the parents and the almost loving respect of all the children; that since January 1888 the average attendance has increased from 12 daily to over 23, a remarkable increase; and that she is receiving $75 less than former.\n\nI have reviewed the Report of Indian Affairs and find the following salaries have been paid to teachers the past two years.\n\n| Year | Teachers in all paid by Band | Salary |\n|------|-----------------------------|--------|\n| 1878 | Three teachers               | $400   |\n| 1879 | \"                             | $362.50|\n| 1880 | Alex Scott                   | $350   |\n| 1881 | Alex & J.H. Scott together   | $350   |\n| 1882 | J.H. Scott Paid by Band      | $237.50|\n\nBy School Fund $112.50\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6150, File 416-1, part 1)\n1883 J.H.

Nor have I any docu-\nmentary reason to show why in 1885\nit was discontinued, and the full\namount of $350 charged the Band.\n\nAgainst an increase in salary\nis the fact that Miss Murray has only\na three years permit granted to teach;\nthat the salary of female teachers is\ngenerally lower than males; that she\ntaught in Wagersville for $250; and\nthat the Council object to give her\nmore than $275 per annum from\nthe funds of the Band.\n\nPoor Copy\nFrom the foregoing Report I beg leave to recommend an appropriation from the \"Indian School Fund of the Department\" the sum of Fifty Dollars per annum to this Teacher Miss Mary Murray.\n\nI do so, because $275. is good wages for an Indian Band to pay for a female teacher out of their own funds. Because the male teachers who served in 1882-3 and 4 were unlicensed but received $300 from the Band and $650 from this Fund. Because by the peculiar tact and adaptation of Miss Murray these Indians are receiving about double the amount of education which statistics show heretofore existed, and because numerous teachers (mostly females) of Indians, are receiving from the Indian School Fund from $50 to $600 per annum.\n\nI am\n\nYours Obed. Servt.\n\nP. E. Jones\nInd. Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have to ack the receipt of your letter of the 6th inst relative to the application made on behalf of Miss Murray, teacher of the Mississauga Indian School for an increase in salary, and in reply I beg to refer you to the 6th letter of the 6th inst.

I have seen each trustee separately, and they assure me that Miss Nelson agreed to board near to the school, and carry out the provisions of the school by law in respect to the duties of a teacher.\n\nThey say she has violated her agreement by persisting to board at home with the exception of two or three weeks. That she was consistently many times late in getting to school. That even if she arrived at school in fine weather with good roads at 9 A.M., she was not in a proper condition to immediately commence teaching, and that in stormy weather muddy roads she could not teach for half an hour or more, or until she got her skirts and extremities dry.\n\nThey also complain that the children have not properly progressed in their studies, some have been prepared for the high school, and they consider the attendance is so large that a properly qualified male teacher should be employed. They acknowledge that they were well at\nat her applying for an increase of $160 to her salary and still more so when she attempted to get a petition signed to that effect. The trustees insist upon their wishes in this case being carried out.\n\nThe teacher says she was only late once, that she was accustomed to long walks and that it benefited her health. That she had been very attentive diligent in the school, that the children and parents were pleased with her, that the pupils were progressing in their studies, that as the attendance had grown so large she should have an increase in salary and that she was hired for a year and should teach to the end of the year.\n\nFor my part I think that the wishes and authority of the trustees should be maintained. They are elected by the people and know the wishes of their constituents. If it should be possible for the Dept. to rule against this decision I fear it will lead to the resignation of the trustees, and it will be difficult to obtain substitutes.\n\nJ.\nI have spoken to a number of the heads of families upon this matter and they all agree with the trustees that a change of teacher is necessary.\n\nI have the report of the Minister of Education, and Dr. Kelty's remarks respecting this school, and to which Miss Mclean refers you, I consider it is not favorable to the teacher.\n\nI find by this report that the school upon this reserve is by far the largest of any Indian day school in Ontario.\n\nMiss Mclean's certificate as a teacher has expired. She of course could not compel the trustees to employ her for longer than they desire.\n\nAll the trustees assure me that they have had no conversation with Mr. Dixon or anyone in respect to his employment as teacher. Mr. Dixon says he has said nothing to them upon the subject. In May last Miss Mclean told me the report she had heard. I asked my son and the trustees then and they assured me there was no truth in the report and I so informed Miss...\nMiss Mulhern, and after doing so I think it was very ungracious of Miss Mulhern to send you that unfounded report. The fact of Mr. Dixon being any citizen however, should not be any bar to his employment as teacher if the trustees desire him.\n\nOf the 15 names upon Miss M. Mulhern's petition six of them have no children of school age. The other nine represent 17 children.\n\nMy opinion is that the trustees should advertise in the Toronto papers for a competent male teacher to take charge of the school on 1st Oct. 1893.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. E. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\nThis is to certify that Miss Maggie Mehan who holds a second class non-professional and a third class professional certificate of qualification as a public school teacher, and is at present teaching the New Credit School on the Pus cau Reserve, is legally entitled to teach any Public School in the Province of Ontario.\n\nSigned M.J.

I beg to report that in a letter dated the 24th inst., Miss Meehan enclosed Notices which she had received from the trustees informing her that her services would not be required after the summer holidays, it being their intention to engage another teacher. She also stated in that letter that she had been lawfully engaged by them for a year to end next Christmas holidays and with an agreement to resign within any part of the year which she could not cause her financial loss. She states further that she cannot assign any reason for this action on the part of the trustees unless it be that they are annoyed at her because she some time ago asked the Dept. to increase her salary from $300.00\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo: Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 189...\n\n$300.00 to $400.00 per annum.

Jones, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent\nHagersville, Ont\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th inst., having further reference to the proposed dismissal of Miss Meehan from the position of school teacher on the Mississauga Indian Reserve, I beg to inform you that the Department does not consider that this step can be taken without doing an injustice to Miss Meehan. It appears that she was engaged to conduct the school for one year from last Christmas, and though there was no written contract yet the verbal agreement should be held as binding on the trustees. Moreover, Miss Meehan does not appear to have done anything in violation of the terms of the agreement, except it be that she lived at Hagersville instead of upon the Reserve, Hagersville being a considerable distance from the latter, and therefore it is alleged occasioned Miss Meehan at times to be more or less incapable to commence teaching after reaching the school owing to fatigue, and in wet weather her clothes being damp &c. It is alleged by you in your letter that Miss Meehan was also consequently many times late in getting to school. Miss Meehan, however, denies this and states that she was only once late in reaching the school house.\n\nThe attendance at the school since Miss Meehan took charge has more than doubled, which of itself speaks favorably.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6150, File 416-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nfavorably for her, apart from the report of the School Inspector, Dr Kelly, which has recently been received at the Department, it being dated the 9th ultimo. From it it would appear that there are 56 children on the roll, that 44 were present when he made his inspection, that the average attendance for the month of May was 38; and the condition in which he found the school premises generally is favorable reported on, both as regards the outside and the inside of the premises. He reports in respect to the 3rd class that the writing, spelling literature, grammar and geography were good, and that the arithmetic was fair; that the children knew the counties and county towns of Ontario very well, can analyze simple sentences, parse fairly well, and do problems in arithmetic up to and including reduction. Of the second class he reports favorably, excepting as regards arithmetic, in which he says they were the weakest. As regards the senior portion of the 1st class he reports that they are doing very fair work, and in regard to the lower 1st class that they do as well as can be expected.\n\nAs respects the trustees being vexed because Miss Meehan applied for an increase of salary, and still more so when she attempted to get a petition signed to support her application, I fail to see how this could be a cause of offence to the trustees. It could surely be regarded at the most as a very venial one, and from Dr Kelly's report of inspection it certainly would appear that she has been very attentive and diligent in the discharge of her duties, and that the pupils were making progress in their studies as borne out by that report.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6150, File 416-1, part 1)\nAs to the wishes and authority of the trustees being maintained, this is all right in legitimate matters, but when it comes to their arbitrary dismissing a good teacher from the school, it is incumbent on the Department to step in and prevent them, especially when a contract entered into by the trustees and the teacher is being violated. Moreover it would never do to allow a teacher to be either appointed or dismissed in accordance with the wishes of the Indian population on the Reserve, whom you style constituents of the trustees; and in fact the slight grounds on which the trustees wish Miss Meehan's services to be dispensed with demonstrate that they themselves unfit for the positions they hold.\n\nMiss Meehan, according to Dr Kelly's certificate filed when she was appointed to the position\n\nHolds a Second Class Non-Professional Certificate and a Third Class Professional Certificate of Qualification as a School teacher. It is therefore not correct to say, that her certificate has expired as stated in your letter.\n\nI approve of the recommendation made in the concluding part of your letter that when Miss Meehan's term of engagement shall expire it would be well to advertise for a competent teacher to take charge of the school, though I doubt very much whether the services of a certificated male teacher could be secured for the small salary paid, viz: $600 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant\nIndian Office\nWagoville.\n17th Aug. 1893.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st ult., in respect to the school teacher upon this Reserve.\n\nIn reply I would say that I have read the letter to the trustees. They were inclined to resign their positions, but I persuaded them not to do so.\n\nI have little to add to my letter of 15th July last excepting that you have attributed the opinions of the trustees to me, which is not right. I gave you their statement, the teachers statement, and then my own remarks upon these statements.\n\nYou say Miss Mahan only violated her agreement by living in Wagoville.

General of Indian Affairs, after having given as much consideration to the case of Miss Meehan as his time would permit, he is of opinion that the wishes of the trustees should not be disregarded.\" This I suppose will mean that according to the notice the trustees have given you, your services will cease as teacher at the end of this month.\n\nI am, &c.,\n(sgd) P.E. Jones, Ind. Agt.\nTo Mr. Gordon, Department\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\u2014Tonight since five o'clock I received the shock of my dismissal from my school by the Gordon Department.\n\nI was hired by the year by the Trustees of the Credit School, without any agreement of dismissal or a month's notice. I did not agree to board close by the school. Mr. Cheecho proposed that if I were late I should forfeit the school, to which I would not agree; however, I was late only once occurring about half an hour, it being a very rainy morning.\n\nI worked hard for the improvement of the school, surely an increase of attendance nearly three-fold, besides the approval of the Inspector and a proportionate advancement in learning by the pupils prove the truth of what I say.\n\nHow can the Trustees judge of the proficiency of the school who know next to nothing of the subject taught and who never enter the school-room hardly more than once in a year.\n\nI sent you all the notices I received from the Trustees. The notice I received, and so will you is not a lawful one. Those who send notices should employ a competent person to write them, or declare correctly themselves. I believe the notice to be unlawful and so paid no attention to it.\n\nAgain, I asked Mr. P. E. Jones, Indian Agent, to inform you this way I was being treated he replied he did not wish to hinder the powers of the Trustees.\n\nI appealed to you and received orders to continue in any school to the end of the year. Now comes dismissal with scarcely a moment's warning. I know scarcely anything of the charges laid against me.\nIf what charge I must defend & clear myself.\n\nwere I to employ the nearest Sordian and treat him as I have been treated I would be liable to the extent of the law.\n\nOh! I depended on the word of the Department as one justice whose just laws errinate at the Bar of British Freedom.\n\nYou have sacrificed any right to a few Indians who know neither justice or mercy. Mr. Echeloth is a man thought to possess not even the ordinary intelligence of an Indian.\n\nAbout the time I received the Indians notice I had been boarding at the Rev. J. Howard's close by the school so it can't surely be because I walk to school from home.\n\nRev. Mr. Howard has left the Reserve and Rev. Mr. String fellow's wife is too poorly on health to keep boarders.\n\nI am now to late to attend the Kamalak School this term.\n\nYou will see this letter if Dr. Jones was not sent to me in time for me to write you and receive your reply before Monday. Does it look fair?\n\nHoping to hear from you soon.\n\nI remain your respectfully,\n\nMaggie Nathan.\n\nW.B.- I have done nothing to forfeit any school\n\nW.W.\nMiss Maggie Sheehan,\nHagersville, Ont.\n\nMadam,\n\nI beg to ask the receipt of your letter of the 28th inst., enclosing a letter received by you from the Indian Agent at Hagersville, notifying you of the decision of the Dept.

From your said letter I have presumed that that was the only attempt the trustees have made to justify their action. If they have put forth any other ground or reason for same, would you please inform me, what it is, that I may be able to put in evidence in rebuttal. As to the alleged stipulation that she was to live near the school-house, we can give no more than the emphatic denial of Miss Maclean, together with the fact that the trustees did not request her to do this before they gave her notice to quit, after having taught the school for more than two years, and also that there was no place near the school where any one could reasonably be expected to board.

It is to be regretted that the trustees took such extreme measures and I would ask that you take this matter into consideration and you will agree with me that if Miss Maclean's story is true she is legally entitled to the balance of her salary and bring all the disadvantages of not being able to have the trustees cross-examined upon their affidavits, it is hard that she should be deprived of her salary. But as a learned judge has said \"Witnesses are to be weighed, not counted,\" I believe it would be much to Miss Maclean's advantage, if you had a report from Mr. Kelly or some other reliable man as to the nature of the witness testimony.

I received your letter of the 26th Sept. I immediately posted the enclosed letter to Miss Durham.\n\nNotwithstanding this letter she went to the school house upon the day for opening. The trustees had the keys, but she tried open one of the windows and put a child in who opened the back door, and when the trustees arrived they found her in possession, but persuaded her to leave.\n\nThe written agreement with Mr. Good was that he should teach to the end of the yr. for $80, and afterwards if satisfactory at the rate of $350 a year. Mr. Good was to give a months notice if he wished to resign, and he was to board upon the reserve convenient to the...\nthe school, which he has done.\n\nHe had given good satisfaction but unfortunately for the school, he has made up his mind to attend the Normal School this year and notified the trustees that he could not teach after the 1st June.\n\nYou will notice in his report the remarks he makes. Mr. Maclean it appears during her last quarter elevated a great part of the pupils into a higher class, when they had not gone through the book, they were in. Mr. Good had therefore the unpleasant duty of putting them back to their proper places.

A few of these pupils stand well in their classes, and if they had been more regular could easily have won prizes. Parents and others interested can obtain all information in the power of the teacher to impart regarding the position of any pupil in any subject, by referring to the writer.\n\nThat care has been exercised to attain fairness in determining the relative standing of the pupils. The compiler of the return sincerely hopes that all who have any influence will support his decisions and endeavor to allay the jealousy and suspicion unavoidable so long as such a system of prizes remain in use. If the time-honored, meaningless, unprofitable charge of favoritism be circulated as heretofore in the case of former teachers, let it be remembered that if I were inclined to arrange matters so as to distribute the prizes according to my own interests, I would give them not to my supporters, but to the grumblers and malcontents whose support I wanted to obtain.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6150, File 416-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nThe relative standing of the pupils is founded almost wholly upon the average number of marks taken by each at the Quarterly Examinations, held March 30th, June 28th, September 29th, and October 4th and 5th.\n\nIt has unfortunately happened that the attendance has been rather small on all these dates, and some pupils of excellent class standing have been present at none. In cases such as these, when the highest marks obtained by the pupils present at the Examination was less than 60%, I have granted a Third prize upon general Class Standing.\n\nOnly three pupils in the Fourth Book attended over 100 days, so I have been obliged to count the marks obtained by this class in with those obtained by the Third Class.\n\nThis was the only course possible but even it is somewhat objectionable. For example, Jeffry McRoyall obtained 60% of the marks given for Fourth Book Geography, and if there had been another member in the class he would probably have obtained 1st or 2nd Prize. But several pupils in the Third Book obtained over 60% of the marks given for Third Book Geography, so Mr. Royall is thrown back into a comparatively poor position. However, as the Bye-laws require four members in each class to which prizes are given (\u00a7 23) choice had to be made between this plan, which results in cutting down the prizes won by Fourth Book Students; and\u2014of this course were not followed\u2014the remaining alternative of letting them go without any prizes at all.\n\nI would be pleased to explain my systems of marking etc., to anyone interested in the matter.\n\nThe case of Francis McRoyall is one to which I desire to draw special attention. This pupil, though of Indian blood, is through no fault of his own\u2014not a recognized member of this Band. The money of his mother, brother, and sisters, however, helps to main-\ntain the school, and her friends claim that she should on this ground be entitled to all the privileges of the school. As far as personal merit is concerned, the child deserves commendation and it certainly seems fit rather hardly visiting the sins of the father upon the children if she is to be denied recognition. If she be ruled eligible for prizes the chart marked \"A\" for combined Third and Fourth Classes is the one to be acted upon; if she be not considered eligible, chart B is to be used.\n\nEffie Wood is a member of the Band who is in attendance upon the Haygreenville P.S. The number of days in the school year for the Haygreenville school differs from that in the New Credit School, but as she was absent only three days during the year when her school was in session, I have counted her attendance as equivalent to three days less than the school year recognized in the New Credit School.\n\nWhen a \"tie\" has occurred in the number of marks obtained by prize winners, the prizes in question and the one next lower are to be added together and divided equally between the two. In the case of the prizes for spelling in the Part Second of the First Reader, the three prize winners all obtained equal marks so the total value of the prizes for this subject (viz., $1.00 + $0.25 = $1.25) is to be divided among them equally. This, I understand, is not the plan hitherto followed in such cases, but it is the only course founded upon justice and common sense.\n\nOnly one pupil who attended the full hundred days failed to win any prize. This is Johnstone.\n\nIt is of pressing importance that the prize money be paid promptly, as most of this money is expended on school clothes for the children.\nand the writer is now close at hand. You will please represent these circumstances to the Department of Indian Affairs in the most forcible language and form possible, so that greater promptness may be avoided.\n\nThe Return re Relation Standing herewith presented, together with the foregoing explanations and comments is all respectfully submitted by\n\nThe Ruthlessmost obedient Servant,\n\nNorman Ferguson Black,\nTeacher R.C.

A word of explanation relative to the amount named as \"Govt. Grant toward Teacher's Salary,\" viz., $83.75 may not be amiss.\n\nBefore me lies the agreement between myself and the school Board, for this present year, subscribed to by all the trustees and myself, Jan. 26th, 1895. In this document my salary is placed at \"Three hundred and thirty Dollars per annum, payable in four equal Quarterly Payments.\" Such payment would, of course, amount to $82.50. Through some mistake, however, my return under the caption of Govt. Grant was altered after leaving my hands, and I received for my services during the Jan.-Mar. Quarter only $61.25. This leaves a balance of $12.50 owing me from last Quarter, so the amount now due me according to the terms of the contract is $83.75.\n\nIt may be advisable to include this with the Requisition for my salary.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is very unfortunate that these parents deprive their children of the benefit of education when it is offered to them at their door, for the nominal fee of 25 cents a month. The trustees however are quite right in not allowing the teachers time to be taken up with children, the parents of whom pay nothing towards the support of this rather expensive school.\n\nIn respect to the teachers salary, I enclose a letter addressed to me by Mr. Black. I have seen the trustees since, and they say they had intended to submit their recommendation for a raise in the salary by $5.00 to the Council for approval. This was not done, nor was I informed of the proposed change. The trustees...\ntrustees desire me not to ask for the increase until after the matter has passed the Council.

Your Return for March quarter has been received and you have been paid on account of that quarter at the rate $25 per annum or $25:75 for the quarter, leaving a balance of $3:75, or a total amount of $3:75 due you up to the 31st March last a cheque for which is enclosed herewith.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to say that any inconvenience you may have been put to is not due to any fault of the Department but to the delay in the receipt of the original agreement under which you were engaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMr Norman F.

Allow me respectfully to submit that this statement is incorrect and is not sustained by the agreement signed by myself and the trustees and authorized by the Chiefs.\n\nIn my letter of the 4th inst., I explained in detail the circumstances which resulted in the Trustees agreeing to pay me (as per the agreement in your hands) at the rate of $350 per annum till midsummer, and thereafter at the same rate as last year, viz. $350. This would make the year salary amount to $340 in total.\n\nI state positively\u2014and the trustees candidly admit\u2014that my services were retained here last year under a distinct promise from the trustees that my salary for '96 was to be $350. When the time came for signing the agreement, in view of the depleted state of the Band's finances, I ultimately agreed to submit to an arrangement reducing my prospective salary for this current year by $10, making it $340.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This was not done, nor was I informed of the proposed change. The trustees desire me not to ask for the increase until after the matter has passed the Council\", and in reply the Agent was informed that if the agreement of the 26th January '95 to which you referred showed that you were entitled to an increase the same would be paid, and you have acknowledged the receipt of a communication from the Agent to this effect, but the agreement above referred to has never yet reached the Department, although you were so advised on the 20th March and 8th May last.\n\nOn\n\nMr Norman F.

This agreement, although dated after the Department had been advised of your resignation stipulated for the payment of your salary for the year 1895 at the rate of $330 per annum and for the year 1896 at $340.\n\nBy the memorandum attached the quarterly payments which you were to receive are shown but you will see that the arrangement to pay you $67.50 for March Quarter was not signed until the 2nd day of May, or more than two months after the end of that quarter. The Department was not a consenting party to the memorandum which provided for two payments of $337.50 and two of $32.50 or a total yearly salary of $410 and it does not consider itself bound to carry out an arrangement to pay for services already rendered at a higher rate per quarter than mentioned in the original agreement.\n\nI may add that the school year terminates on the 30th of June and any agreement for an annual increase of salary should be dated to begin from the 1st of July.\n\nHowever, in order to close the correspondence on this subject, which I regret to say has evoked many unjust and uncalled for remarks on your part, the Department will, as a matter of grace, consent to pay you $250, a cheque for which is enclosed herewith.

Her certificate should be forwarded to the Department to be noted, after which it will be returned to her.\n\nYou might inform young McDougall that it is hoped he will not be discouraged, but that, having made a good start, he will continue, so that in time, when a vacancy occurs in some school, the Department may be glad to give him an appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHugh Stewart, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville,\nOntario.\n\nS.D.

King seconded by Joseph Lefebvre.\n\nResolved that all children living upon this Reserve be allowed to attend our school free.\n\nA standing vote was taken when all members present with two or three exceptions stood up in favour of this resolution. John Chisholm was the only member of the Band who voted contrary.\n\nI was instructed to submit this resolution to the Department for their consideration and approval.\n\nThe question was discussed at length and the following are some of the reasons advanced why the resolution should be adopted:\n\n1. There is plenty of room in the school for all children on this Reserve. It costs no more for fuel, caretaker or teacher, outside buying their own books. The teacher says she would rather have them attend, as 30 or 40 scholars together make more progress than one.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOur third chief number would be a number of our children attending a residential school adjoining this Reserve at the Mohawk Institute at Brantford free of charge.\n\nThe majority of those members attending belong to the Brant family who have been closely identified with this Band by reason of having always lived among them and still occupy land upon this Reserve; they are also closely related by marriage.\n\nOf the most important reason is that according to the terms of settlement between the Mississaugas and the Nations in 1800, the land was to be occupied in common and that members of either Band may purchase or from the other the right of occupancy, so there will be more or less intermarriage of the two Bands, so that it appears to be only fair to attend each other's school in common.\n\nI am well aware that the Rules and Regulations of the Band say these Members shall pay fifty cents per month.\n\nThe members present were of the opinion that these Rules & Regulations should be revised and amended. If you have not had a supply printed from the copy I sent you on Feb. 10th we would respectfully ask permission to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.C. Van Loan\nIndian Agent\nOTTAWA, 30th March, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant reporting that the Mississauga Band in Council had decided to allow all children living upon their reserve to attend their school free; and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of this resolution.\n\nThe Rules and Regulations to which you refer have been printed and it is impossible to make any change therein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary\n\nW.G. Van Loon, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nHaquerville\n24st March 1904\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the regular meeting of our Council in January a resolution was passed regarding the trustees of our school to run the school according to the by-laws regulating same and acting in accordance with the resolution. I asked the senior trustee to notify the teacher to notify our members that they would be required to pay $5 a month on account as provided in by-laws and then non-members took their children away.\n\nAfter sometime considerate of that the senior trustee, Mr. McDougall, and allowed the non-member children to attend school free of charge. I am one of the trustees and was not notified in case of any business trustee should have done nothing. Otherwise I think the matter would not be legal. On the 2nd next a public meeting of the Band was held and at this meeting a resolution was passed for the effect that all non-member children be allowed to attend our school free. This I think is wrong as I do not think said meeting had the power legally make such a rule. As I claim the trustees have full power.\nTo run the school in accordance with by-laws, as the Mississaugas built the school and furnish equipment and teachers; I think it an injustice for outsiders to be allowed free use of it and would ask the Dept. to protect in same. Would also ask the Dept. to send one copy of by-laws also to confirm Agent as to the powers of Trustees. Although I have asked the Senior Inspector Dault, Notice to call a meeting of the Board he has not done so. Would be pleased to get instructions from the Dept. as to how the trustees should act.\n\nYours ever,\n\nJohn Sheehan\n\nA member of the Mississaugas of the Credit\nOTTAWA, 29th April, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that before the receipt of your communication the Department had decided to allow all Indian children living on the Mississauga reserve to attend the Indian school free of charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Mitchell, the School Teacher on this Reserve has been working for an increase of pay. She has been receiving $300.00 while I understand the teachers on the Six Nations Reserve receive from $350.00 up. The School Committee met at this office on the 12th and after discussing the matter for some time, it was unanimously decided to recommend a raise of $25.00 a year.\n\nI can find nothing in the Rules and Regulations, or Indian Act to show who has the authority to deal with this matter. The council meets on March 18th. If necessary I can bring the matter before them. Miss Mitchell is a good teacher and should receive what the trustees have recommended, but I believe it is left to the council they will object to paying her more than $300.00.\n\nKindly advise me on this matter, and I shall be obliged.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nW.C.

Mitchell, from $300 to $335 per annum.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of this resolution and the increase may go into effect from the first of the current quarter, and you should make out the requisition for the teacher's salary for this quarter accordingly.

She holds no certificate, but has taken up the high school work for the last three years, so that I think she would be quite capable of teaching this school as the children do not attend very regularly.

The Department considers that a mistake was made by the Indian trustees in refusing Miss Mitchell this increase as it is a very difficult matter at the present time to secure the services of a qualified teacher.\n\nThe Department should also have been consulted before any advertisement was placed in the paper for a new teacher.\n\nIt is most desirable that a qualified teacher should be obtained for this school, if possible, and this cannot be done unless a more liberal salary is paid. You did not state the salary that you offered, if any, in your advertisement in the Globe.\n\nThe Department cannot approve of bringing a young\n\nW. G. Van Leon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nlady with no qualifications all the way from Gamebridge to teach this school at a salary of $360.00 per annum.

There have been but one of her pupils in this school to pass the high school entrance examination. The reason she gives for this is that the children do not attend regularly. The principal complaint against her is that she boards in Hagerstown, about four miles from the school, when the roads are bad she is obliged to walk during the summer she has a wheel. If another teacher can be got a change might be made for the school. If Miss Mitchell is engaged she should board near the school at least during the winter and when the roads are bad, as I do not think a teacher could go further to a school and walk four miles night and morning.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.C.

Only one member voting to make non-members pay a fee of 25\u00a2 per month.\n\nIn my letter of 23rd March 1904, I mentioned a public meeting held on the 22nd.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Ind Affairs\n\nOttawa\n17th 1908 to consider the revision of the Bylaws, this school question was again brought up. After a number of the leading members had given their opinions on the matter a vote was again taken, and by a large majority they decided to allow children residing on the Reserve to attend non-members to supply their books and other supplies, and the bylaw was accordingly. I might say that when the resolution was passed a short time ago to charge a fee of 25\u00a2 both Chief Councillor McDougall and Councillor Joseph stated that they had previously supported resolutions to allow all children to attend the school, but had changed their minds. If while living on the government land residing on the reserve are compelled to pay this fee I believe we will lose many of the best of them, as this is something unknown in other municipalities in Ontario. Besides it is not costing the Board anything, so they are obliged to hire a teacher and keep the school house in repair.\n\nI do not know what the Council is doing in the matter. I heard yesterday they had written to the Superintendent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.C. Van Loon\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa, April 25, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department trusts that there will be no further trouble with reference to the attendance of non-members at the Indian school on the Hagersville reserve.\n\nYour remarks in regard to the good attendance are noted and in this connection I have to ask you to be good enough to state whether you have anybody in view to take charge of the school after the summer holidays, or whether you think Miss Davidson might be prevailed upon to undertake the work for a time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. G. VanLoon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nIndian Office\nHagersville\nApril 28th, 1870\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant No. 152830-1 regarding the school in this reserve, and beg to say in reply that Miss Davidson, the present teacher, will be able to teach after the summer holidays as she is engaged to take a course at the Normal School.\n\nMiss Edna Lang who taught for a time before Easter, would like the school to the end of the year provided she passes the examination she is taking for June. I have no other person in view.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nW.O. Van Sover\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Ind. Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, May 2, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo in reference to the position of teacher of the New Credit Indian School, which will be vacant after the summer holidays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would like, if possible, to secure the services of a permanent qualified teacher and you should continue your inquiries with this object in view. Be good enough to state whether you have communicated with the Public School Inspector or not. Should it not be possible to obtain such a teacher Miss Lang's services may be utilized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. C. VanLoon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nHagersville May 11th\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 18th, No. 152830, and also copy of By-Laws for which please accept my thanks.\n\nWe have decided to leave our resignation in abeyance until we have heard from the Department in regard to approving of the resolution passed by the council in which it was decided to tax non-residents of the band. Will you kindly send me four copies of the Indian Act, as we are unable to get them from our Indian Agent.\n\nI regret that the Agent does not co-operate with the council to a greater extent, as on different occasions we have not been made acquainted with important correspondence until it has become public property and are not consulted on important matters, such as advertising for tenders, construction of small cemetery buildings without the consent or approval of the council. He also refused to show us correspondence in connection with the school and claimed he was not compelled to do so.\n\nThese are the reasons why we submitted our resignation, and the causes of complaint.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We wish to hear from your Honorable Department before the eighteenth (the night of our council) I remain Yours Very Truly Joseph Henry\nOttawa, May 16, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, in which you state that you and Mr. McDougall have decided to allow your resignations as trustees of the New Credit school to remain in abeyance until you have heard from the Department in regard to the approval of the resolution passed by the Council of the New Credit Band, in which it was decided to tax non-residents of the Band. By non-residents it is presumed that you mean non-members.\n\nThe Department is of opinion that the children of Indians who are, by the consent of the Band, resident upon the reserve and those of white tenants have a right to school privileges without the payment of a fee, as the exemption action of such fee would be contrary to the approved rules and regulations of the Band.\n\nIt is most desirable that the Indians, the Agent and all concerned should work harmoniously together, having in view the raising of the standard of this school, and the Department is willing to do anything in its power to promote your interests in this respect. It is hoped that an efficient teacher will be secured to take charge after the summer holidays and that school matters will soon regain their normal condition on the reserve.\n\nMr. Joseph Henry,\nHagersville, Ont.\nIn compliance with your request copies of the Indian Act were sent you on the 10th instant. After you have carefully studied this Act I have to ask you to be good enough to point out the section by authority of which a tax can be levied upon the residents of the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nIt seems to be impossible to get along with the present Council, at least three of them, Chief McDougall Councillors Sault and Henry. They appeared to be angry before the meeting commenced yesterday. The school question appears to be the greatest trouble. They are angry because they could not impose a fee of twenty five cents per month on nonmembers attending the school. They will not appoint other trustees to act in the places of those resigned.\n\nAnd they are very much put out because Walter Sault has not been appointed constable, school trustee &c.\n\nW.C. VanLoon.\nIndian Agent.\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd instant No.152830/1 respecting a teacher for the New Credit Indian School, I beg to say that Miss Davidson, the present teacher will have to give up the school at the end of June, she intends taking a course at the normal school, and I understand her parents will not allow her to teach any longer, at the present, she is rather young for this school.\n\nI visited the school last week there was 25 pupils present, some of them were as old as the teacher, and she is unable to manage them. Miss Lang who taught for a time would take it but there is no certainty that she will qualify, if she fails in her examinations she will want to go on with her studies. I have written to the school Inspector of the county, up to the present I have received no reply, I have been making enquiries from school trustees and others, and find that teachers are very scarce, and I do not think there is any possibility of getting a qualified teacher locally, this school requires an experienced qualified teacher, Miss Mitchell, a former teacher had no difficulty in managing the school but her boarding so far from the school was unsatisfactory she liked the position and would take it again for $450.00 and board on the reserve, if this is not satisfactory It would be well to advertise for one immediately.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 15, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 28th ultimo in regard to the appointment of a teacher for the New Credit school I beg to say that the Department will consent to the appointment of Miss Mitchell, a former teacher, at a salary of $450.00 per annum on condition that she boards on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. G. VanLoon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th of June last No I52830/I respecting a teacher for the New Credit School, I beg to say that Miss L. Mitchell referred to has decided to go west and yesterday morning started for Vancouver where she intends to stay at least for one year.\n\nHowever there is a young lady here from Hamilton by the name of Waterbury who has applied for the school at a salary of $450.00 she says she has a Normal School Certificate.\n\nMiss Edna Lang who taught for a time in the early part of the year has also applied, she states that she is qualified to teach a district school, and would want $425.00 she gave good satisfaction before.\n\nWhile the first named young lady has the best qualifications, she is young and looks rather delicate for this position, Miss Lang, in my opinion, could manage the school much better, and I have no doubt would give good satisfaction to all concerned.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 23, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the New Credit School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if there is a prospect that Miss Lang will remain in charge of this school for any length of time the Department approves of her appointment at a salary of $425.00 and you may make the necessary arrangements to have her re-open the school after the summer holidays, but, if this would only be a temporary engagement, it might be preferable to engage Miss Mizumaki Waterbury. This matter should receive immediate attention so that you can inform the latter teacher if her services should be required. In order that there may be no delay the necessary authority to engage either of these ladies is given to you and you will be good enough to advise the Department immediately when you have completed your arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. G. VanLeon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nI hereby offer and agree to teach the new Credit School for the year, from the 15th of August 1910, for the sum of \u00a342.50.\n\nEdna Lang\n\n387981\nSir,\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant No. 152830/I, I beg to say that I called on Miss Edna Lang one of the applicants for teaching the New Credit school, and explained the matter to her; after consulting with her father she decided to take the school for one year and signed the enclosed offer; she also agreed to board on the reserve during the week but will want to spend Saturday and Sunday at home here. This is the best offer that I have received and I trust it will be satisfactory to the Dept.\n\nI enclose herewith her written offer.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 3, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo I beg to say that your action in engaging Miss Lang as teacher of the New Credit school is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Van Loon,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 12, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nIn a recent requisition for supplies for the Hagersville school you state that there are 13 whites in attendance. The Department would like some information with regard to these children, whether their parents reside upon the reserve or whether they are lessees of Indian lands. In any event stationery is not supplied for them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. O. VanLoon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant No. 152830/1 respecting white children attending the New Credit School, and beg to state in reply that the parents of these children are lessees of Indian Lands residing on the reserve, and that I have always advised the teachers that they are not to supply books to neither white or Six Nations children, and have told by the teachers that they do not furnish books to any but members of the band.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract from minutes of a special meeting of council, Mississaugas of the Credit, 12th Oct. 1910.\n\nEX'D.\n\nThe Chief Councillor said that trustees would be appointed for the school, at the next regular meeting.\n\nCertified correct,\n\nW.C.

I do not want to give up my school but I believe it is best. My teachers think I ought to go back and finish my own school work. I have become very much interested in my pupils and would like very much to stay with them, at least until the summer holidays, but I am afraid it is impossible. Wishing you success in procuring another teacher, I am\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nEdna V. Bang.\nSir:\n\nMiss Edna V. Lang was engaged to teach the New Credit School for one year from August 15th 1910, for $425.00 this agreement was approved of by the Department in your letter of August 3rd 1910 No 152 \u00a730/I.\n\nShe notified me last night that she would have to give up the School at Christmas, giving as her reason that she must finish her own school work.\n\nTo day I met Clarence A. Veigel who is anxious to get a school after Christmas holidays, he has passed the Normal Entrance and is better qualified than Miss Lang, and will finish the year on the same terms as Miss Lang. I understand from the Principal of the High School here that he is a clever young man (will be 16 in Sept. Next) and will likely be able to manage the school better than Miss Lang, there is now about forty scholars on the register, and some days thirty or more attend; some of them are nearly grown up, and the teacher has had difficulty in managing some of them.\n\nI would therefore recommend that Miss Lang be relieved and that Clarence A. Veigel be engaged to take her place. I will enclose Miss Lang's letter.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 19, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant enclosing the resignation of Miss Lang as teacher of the New Credit school and recommending the appointment of Clarence A. Veigel who has passed the Normal Entrance Examination to finish the school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Miss Lang's resignation is accepted and you may appoint Mr. Veigel to finish the school year, his salary to be at the same rate as paid Miss Lang, viz.- $425.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Of the 39 children of school age belonging to the Band, two are at the Mohawk Institute and fourteen are away from the Reserve and attend other schools.\n\nSub-Section I6 of Section 7 of the school By-law says that each child member of the Band between seven and fifteen years of age must attend for the full term during which the school is open; this should be changed, the intention was that each child must attend for the full term of 100 days during which the school is open each year.\n\nIf this was changed I would see that it was carried out.

These regulations, as other similar regulations, call for children between the ages of 7 and 15 years to attend school during the full term, unless they are excused as provided for in Section 17. It is not considered advisable to limit the term to 100 days in each year when there are 216 teaching days. There may be reasons for which a child should be excused from attending the school over and above those enumerated in clause 17 of the regulations and in that case it will be for you to exercise your discretion. In the meantime it is thought that some steps should be taken to put these regulations in force.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. O.

It would almost appear that it was done in order that Mr. Veigel might remain in the school for an additional month, thus making a vacancy at a time when the majority of teachers will be engaged. If necessary the Department will advertise for a teacher, but before doing so would like you to make further inquiries and communicate with the County Inspector. You should advise the Department of the result of your inquiries at the earliest possible date and at the same time state whether living accommodation can be had within a reasonable distance of the school and at what rates for board and lodging.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

It might be well to engage this young man unless the Department has another in view, I do not know of any qualified teacher that we could get.\n\nMr. Jennings was to receive $500.00 for the year, he has been paid $297.50, leaving a balance due of $202.50\n\nKindly forward a cheque for the same and greatly oblige.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe SECRETARY,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have notified Claus several times since that the boy must attend school, he always made good promises but I understand the boy would go for one day and then away for a week, he is working most of the time at the livery stable here, I have been told he gets $2.00 per week and his board.\n\nI am satisfied that the boy does not want to go to school and that his parents will not send him, and would recommend that he be sent to some Industrial school if there is room for him. It is reported that he has been keeping company with some young Italians and that they are getting quit longfingered. This case should be attended to at once.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

Mr. Fuller, Principal of the Shingwauk Home, will be coming to Hamilton about the 9th proximo and he is being requested to call at Hagersville and take young Claus back with him to his school. You should have this boy committed to the Shingwauk Home under section 9 of the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children and proceedings should be taken without any delay, so that the necessary time may be allowed for giving the required notice and the committal of the child. After he is committed he should be held until called for by Mr. Fuller about the 10th proximo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nW. G.

Mr. Fuller, Principal of the Chingwauk Home was here last night and we called on the father of the boy; we learned that he had been attending school regularly since I notified them that he was to be sent to this Home, and as they have a very comfortable home and promised to send him to school regularly in the future we decided to leave him home for the present. But there is a Six Nation family residing in this village who have two or three daughters who should be placed in this home at once. Mr. Fuller says he has room for them, the parents are very poor and the children are in such a condition that the authorities will not allow them to attend the public school; there is also another Six Nation family residing about two miles from this village, five children, the eldest is twelve, three of them could be taken in this home, the mother deserted them last winter and is said to be living with another Indian near Hamilton. Rev. Mr. Whitelaw who represents the children's aid society in this vicinity was with us last evening he said he would do what he could to get them ready. If you will kindly send me a good supply of application forms I will fill them in and endeavour to get the parents to sign them. Could we send young Claus to this school without the consent of the parents. Mr. Claus said if he did not attend school regular he would give his consent and sign the application for admission.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

If the father did not carry out his promises in the past, there is no guarantee that he will do so in future.\n\nThe Department considers that you should have carried out the instructions sent you in official letter of the 29th ultimo and have had this boy committed under the Regulations to the Shingwauk Home in time to be sent to that institution in charge of the principal, who was requested to visit New Credit for the purpose of accompanying this boy to his school.\n\nIf he does not attend the day school regularly, and the father will give his consent and sign an application for his admission, he should be sent to the Shingwauk\n\nW.

He has attended normal school in Hamilton for the last year, and was successful in all but two subjects which he will take up and pass at another sitting. He failed by but a few marks but has the year's training and will have no difficulty in passing these two subjects in the spring. He obtained what is termed a limited third so that I have every reason to believe he will make a good teacher.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nJ. E. Foster\nMethodist minister\nJarvis\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nIn February, last, Mr. Agent VanLoon stated that he considered that it would be in the best interests of the New Credit School if the services of a qualified teacher could be secured after the summer holidays, as they had not had one for the past five years. It was his opinion that one could be secured for about what we were then paying. On the strength of this letter Mr. VanLoon was requested to inform the teacher, Mr. Cragg, that his engagement would expire on the 30th of June, last, and if a qualified teacher could be secured the Department would not re-engage him. The Agent was also instructed to communicate with the Public School Inspector with a view to securing a qualified teacher for this school. In a letter dated June 12th the Agent stated that he wrote to the County Inspector, but got no answer, and that in his opinion the only way to get a teacher is to advertise in the Toronto papers.\n\nAn\nAn advertisement was inserted in The Mail and Empire for a teacher with Normal training for this school. The salary offered was $500.00 per annum. The only application received is from Mr. C. M. Ross of Jarvis, Ont., who claims to be the holder of a Third class normal trained certificate with one year's experience in the Model School affiliated with the Normal School at Hamilton. He asks for a salary of $550.00 a year. Mr. Vanloon forwards testimonials from J. G. Foote, Methodist Minister at Jarvis and Dr. Howell of the same place as to his character. He has apparently never had charge of a school and his qualifications would hardly entitle him to more than an initial salary of $500.00. Mr. Vanloon states that Mr. Ross would like to know as soon as possible whether his services are accepted, as he intends to apply for another school.\n\nBefore accepting the services of Mr. Ross, I wish to mention to you that Miss Gertrude Lawrence, who taught most successfully in the Assiniboine Day School for the past six years, when tendering her resignation, stated that if a vacancy should occur in any of the Indian day schools in Ontario she would like to be considered as an applicant. A letter has been received from her dated the\nthe 20th instant, in which she renews her application for re-engagement in Ontario. Miss Lawrence is an experienced teacher and was most highly recommended when she applied for the Assiniboine School. I think the Department would be fortunate if it could again secure her services. Her present address is 12 Delaware Ave., Toronto, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, as I do not know just what gardening. However, as I do not know just what duties would be expected in that connection, and also as I understand that the people on the reserve seem partial to securing the services\nOf a male teacher. I told Mr. Arney today that I thought it would be wiser for me to accept your offer, and let them try to get a man for Moravian town. Therefore, if the position at the New Credit School is still open, I will accept it and be ready to commence duties on either the 1st or 5th of September.\n\nI shall be glad if you will kindly send me the address of the Indian Agent who is in charge of the reserve, that I may be able to secure from him definite information regarding a suitable place to board.\n\nPam, Sir,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nGertrude Lawrence.\nOttawa, August 11, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant stating that you will accept the position of teacher of the New Credit Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is glad to learn that you have decided to accept this position and you should open the school on the 5th proximo.

I placed an application with you some four weeks ago for your school at New Credit, and a week later sent you two statements of character from both my minister and doctor. All this was done through your agent Mr. Vaillant, Hagemeister. It is getting close the close of the holidays and most schools near my home have been doing without other offers waiting for a reply from you. My qualifications are Normal trained, 2nd-class limited certificate. During the past year I was a teacher-in-training at the Hamilton Normal School and was obtained a year experience in their model schools. I seek for a second-class certificate but failed by a few marks in groups I and II and so intend to rewrite them at the next Easter exams and so from Easter to end of year my qualifications might be a\nsecond class certificate. I am a protestant and would like a salary of $550 per annum. I would be pleased if you would let me have a reply by mail either through your agent Mr. Valdora or direct to me or phone 58 in Jarrow.

The last teacher, I understand, was a son of the missionary on the reserve and lived at home but they are not so situated that they could consider taking a boarder.\n\nI am writing Mr. Danison also regarding the matter and trust that if it is impossible for me to undertake the work, that you may be able to secure the services of another who can.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGertrude Lawrence.\nReferring to your letter of the 11th instant re a teacher for the New Credit school, I beg to state that this morning I received a letter from Miss Gertrude Lawrence of Toronto that she had been told that she would be unable to get board near the school. I replied that I had spoken to Mrs. John Flower who lives within one mile of the school that she would take her in and I think Mrs. R.D.

In it I mentioned that I had received information that it would be impossible for me to obtain board there. The party who gave me that information was on the reserve a few days ago and was speaking to Mr. Van Loon, the agent. However, he must have misunderstood him in some way, for I once wrote to Mr. Van Loon and he has already replied, telling me of two good boarding places within a mile of the school.\n\nI am sorry that I did not wait until I received word direct from Mr. Van Loon himself before writing the Department, and regret any annoyance I may have caused you regarding the matter.

I have not spoken to Mrs. Grant about it myself, but Mrs. Cragg and Mrs. Flowers both tell me that she has said that she could not take me in and of course would not attempt to force myself upon her.\n\nIt will, I suppose, be necessary to give the Department a month's notice of my intention to leave, but if it is possible,\nTo get another to take my place, I can be ready to go at any time, and in fact, would sooner do so.\n\nI regret the extra trouble I am causing you in regard to it, but under the circumstances it seems to be unavoidable.\n\nYours very truly,\nGertrude Lawrence.\nINDIAN OFFICE,\nHagersville September 21st 1916.\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter which I received from Miss Gertrude Lawrence, teacher of the New Credit School, on the evening of the 19th instant, I did not send it on to the Department yesterday as the council met in the afternoon and I wanted to discuss the matter with them and see if we could not get a suitable boarding house for her nearer the school, they were unable to do anything in the matter and I suppose we will have to look for another teacher. After making enquiries I find that she was a splendid teacher and well liked by the pupils and I regret that we have to part with her. Soon after I received her letter she received a telegram from home saying that her mother was seriously ill and to come at once, she left the same evening, doubtless she will write and explain everything to the Department.\n\nKenneth Cragg is the only available teacher that I know of and of course he could board at home.\n\nKindly advise me as to what should be done.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Asst.

I did not hear from him until yesterday morning when he called on me and agreed to take the school, and requested me to ask the Department if the salary would be the same as Miss Lawrence was to receive. I told him that I thought the salary would be the same as he received before ($500.00) but that as soon as he qualified the salary would likely be increased. Today his father called on me and requested me to notify the Department that he wanted $60.00 per month or he would give up the school on Friday next.\n\nI at once called up Mr. Ross who applied for the school to see if he was at liberty to take it and was told by his mother that he had a school, now I do not know where we can find a teacher unless the Dept. accepts Mr. Cragg's offer.\n\nI would like to see a qualified teacher in this school.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

If he is not prepared to accept this offer steps will have to be taken to secure another teacher.

Wilson employed your department as teacher of New Credit school on Mississaugas. The Trustees and Agent Mr. W. C. Van Loon, Hagersville, are anxious to keep him as teacher as they know they would have great difficulty to get another that would give the same satisfaction as he has and probably not be able to get one at all. As a girl with the same education and as well qualified for teaching as he is, could get better positions in the city where there is so much demand for girls at present. And as soon as I could find out it was the employer that should ask for exemption of conflores. So about two weeks ago I told my son he had better see if Mr. Van Loon would write to you about it, and he said Mr. Van Loon had just gone away for two weeks but now I found out he will not be back until the end of this week so then he would not have time to get word from you. That is why I take the privilege of writing to you. The reason I wish him to be exempted is because he can help me with the work on the farm as he always does. I have a large stock and try to farm when the weather and roads are good he boards at home and can help with the chores in the stable night and morning and it is often seeing him at Easter holidays and in the summer holidays he helps all through with the haying and harvest which is as important as military service. But I do not know if the Tribunals will exempt him on those grounds or not, so he will be placed as a school teacher.\n\nIndian Affairs.

K. Williams as teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School I beg to inform you that a telegram has been received from Mr. Williams stating that it is impossible to obtain a suitable place to board at New Credit. He states that the lowest cost for board and transportation from the nearest white settlement is at the rate of eighteen dollars a week and that, therefore, he cannot accept the position of teacher.\n\nIf, since the date of his telegram, he has been unable to make any arrangements for his board and will not remain there, does not seem to be any other option than to close the school until arrangements can be made for the proper accommodation of a teacher. It might be possible to secure the services of an Indian teacher who could board with one of the Indian families.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst., Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. O. VanLoon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, regarding a teacher for the New Credit school, I beg to state that I saw a Young Six Nation Indian, Enos Monture, the person referred to in my letter of yesterday, he stated he would take the school and start in at any time, $50.00 per month would satisfy him. I am of the opinion that he would give good satisfaction, and probably by the Christmas holidays we could find a qualified teacher who would take the school.\n\nI would recommend that this young man be engaged for the present.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nAfter receiving your letter of the 26th ultimo I was on the lookout for the arrival of the teacher for the New Credit school, she came yesterday morning and by some means she passed through the crowd that was leaving the train and instead of her looking me up she hired a horse and drove out to New Credit to look for a boarding house, and as I did not see her I decided that she would not be here until evening and drove out to see if I could find a place for her and was surprised when Mrs. R.D. Brant told me that two young ladies had just left there and one of them had stated she had been engaged by the Department to teach this school. Mrs. Brant said she not board them but that her married daughter might. I went back to Hagersville and met Miss Williams and her sister, they said they had called at the Mission House and endeavoured to get board with the Missionary and his wife, but they refused to take her in. I at once took them with me and drove out to see Mrs. Brant's married daughter who happened to be away from home with her husband and was told by a neighbour that they left word with him that that they would return in the evening. I took them back to Hagersville and said I would take them out after tea, when I was ready to take them the teacher stated she had decided that she would not board at an Indian house and unless we could give her $60.00 per month and pay her board and transportation from Hagersville she would not take the school, this would have costed $15.00 per which I thought altogether too much, she then accepted an offer from the school board for one of the schools in the adjoining Township.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nO T T A W A.\nTOWNSHIP of Walpole and started teaching this morning.\n\nI was informed by the County school Inspector that they had 3 or 4 schools without teachers last night.\n\nNow I do not think it possible to find a suitable boarding house on this reserve for a teacher, the Missionary has a large dwelling convenient to the school, and he should have taken her in, there is not another white family any ways near the school. Brant's would have been a good place but Mrs. Brant says she will be alone now as her only single daughter goes to New York tomorrow to become a nurse. I might be able to get the young man, Enos Menture, mentioned in my letter of Aug. 9th, until we could find a qualified teacher willing to reside on the reserve and board with an Indian family.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 5, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, in which you inform the Department that Miss L. K. Williams, who was appointed teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School, will not accept the position, as she was unable to obtain a suitable place to board.\n\nRegarding the appointment of a teacher for this school I beg to refer to your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you state that you can secure the services of Enos Monture, a Six Nations Indian, to teach the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may engage the services of Mr. Monture temporarily and the Department will pay him a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum. You should arrange with him to begin duties as soon as possible, in order that the school may not remain closed. It is hoped that he will meet with a fair measure of success and you should inform him that his retention in this position will depend entirely upon the success with which he meets. You will be good enough to see that he forwards his returns of attendance, etc., promptly at the end of each quarter.\n\nKindly advise the Department of the date upon which Mr. Monture begins his duties.\n\nThis is the best arrangement that can be made at the present time, as, owing to the scarcity of teachers and the difficulty in obtaining suitable accommodation, it is improbable that the services of a qualified teacher can be secured at the present time.\n\nIf any school supplies are required you should instruct\n\nS. VanLoon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nInstruct Mr. Monture to prepare a requisition and you should forward it to the Department, when the supplies considered necessary will be sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir:-\n\nAfter receiving your letter of the 5th instant yesterday, I went out to see Enos Menture the young Six Nation Indian referred to by me in my letter of the 2nd instant; he stated that he would teach the New Credit school for $50.00 per month until we could get a qualified teacher, and that he would not care to give up his studies at the high school for less than the amount stated above.\n\nIf he is hired by the month it would only amount to about $500.00 per annum.\n\nHe will begin teaching on Monday morning Sept. 15th if this is satisfactory to the Department.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, September 11, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in further reference to the temporary appointment of Enos Monture as teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you were informed by official letter of the 5th instant, the Department will pay him a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum, which will be paid him quarterly upon the receipt of his quarterly returns of attendance. He will also be entitled to the bonus to be allowed to teachers for the present fiscal year.\n\nIt is noticed that Mr. Monture will take up his duties on the 15th instant, and it is hoped that he will meet with success in the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The agent however, at Nagersville, told me that suitable rooms etc. would be obtainable at Christmas in time to start the new year. Please inquire if this is the case and tell me if I may have board at the missionary's home.\n\nThanking you in\nadvance for your kindly consideration, and trusting to hear from you as soon as possible.\n\nremain\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Williams, who was appointed teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School, to begin duties after the last summer holidays, and who did not accept, as she was unable to secure a suitable place to board. She states that she is willing to take up duties as teacher at the beginning of the New Year, provided she can obtain suitable accommodation. She states that she has been informed by you that accommodation could be obtained after Christmas.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Department fully regarding this matter and state whether it would not be possible for her to obtain a room and board in the missionary's home on the reserve. The Department will expect you to give full information as soon as possible regarding the board and accommodation she will be able to secure and the price she will have to pay per month for the same.\n\nMr. Monture, who is teaching at present, is aware that his employment is temporary, pending the appointment of a qualified teacher.\n\nThe Department is anxious to obtain Miss Williams' services and hopes that you will be able to make suitable arrangements as to her accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

I may say that the bonus is being allowed to teachers in Indian day schools for the present fiscal year at the rate of $150.00. All teachers' salaries and bonus are payable quarterly, upon receipt of quarterly returns of attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss L. K. Williams,\nJervis,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th ultimo, with regard to the offer of Miss L.K. Williams to take charge of the New Credit school after the Christmas holidays, provided she could find suitable accommodation, I beg to state that I saw the two senior trustees and requested them to call on the Missionary and see if it was possible for them to board her and if not let her have a room in the house so that she could board herself. They saw Rev. Jno. Nelson the Missionary and he refused to either board her or let her have a room, although there is but the missionary and his wife they have a very large house, I should say 8 or 10 rooms and I do not think they occupy one half of it, at least during the winter, and as there is no white family near the school I think it would be well to keep the present teacher on as he appears to be bringing the pupils along nicely and is well liked both by pupils and parents. I think after the summer holidays they will likely have another missionary on this field, if not the Indians say they might as well close the mission.\n\nI think if a change is made we can arrange to have a room in the house for a teacher. I did not see Rev. Nelson myself as I did not think I could influence him any as I understand he intended to ask for an investigation of my conduct with regard to some of the losses made last fall. I intended to see Miss Williams but on account of the bad state of the roads was unable to go so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA\nOttawa, December 26, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, in which you state that you have been unable to secure suitable accommodation for Miss L. K. Williams, who offered to take charge of the New Credit Indian Day School after the Christmas holidays, and recommend that the services of the present teacher, Mrs Monture, be continued.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as it has been found impossible by you to arrange with the missionary to accommodate Miss Williams, Mr. Monture's services will be continued. You may inform him accordingly and also Miss Williams, who address is Jarvis, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. O.

Montour.\nSir:\n\nEnclosed find my school report for the month of May. The teacher failed to send me a statement of the attendance and number in each standard, this morning I called at the school and got his report also his resignation, which I enclose herewith. It will now be necessary to advertise for a teacher. I drove out to the school in Walpole where Miss L.K. Williams was engaged last September and found that she had quit at Christmas. I was also informed that she did not get along very well with the school, was not satisfied with any boarding house she could get, and left. A Miss Hewitt is teaching the school now she stated that she might put in an application for the New Credit school. I will call and see her again, I thought the Missionary at New Credit might leave at the end of June, and his successor might board a teacher, but he is to be there for another year, and I do not know of any white family near the school who will take a teacher to board.\n\nHowever I will see Mrs. R.D. Brant, a member of the Band and it would be a good place, last year she could not help and for that reason would not take the teacher.\n\nI hope we can secure a qualified teacher for this school this year.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If, however, you are unable to obtain a teacher by the middle of July the question of advertising will be considered. Should you receive any applications for the position, they should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department will full particulars as to the name, age and qualifications of the applicant. It would seem that the difficulty in obtaining a suitable teacher is in the providing of board and it is hoped that you can arrange for accommodation and board for the coming school year. You should give this matter your prompt attention and do the best you can to obtain the services of a teacher and suitable accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. C.

Montour, teacher of the New Credit school. I will also enclose requisition for the balance due the teacher. As he has resigned he did not put in a requisition for supplies.\n\nI expect to hear from Mrs. Brant tomorrow and know if she will be able to board a teacher for the coming year; the Brants are about the only people in the school section who are in a condition to board a teacher.\n\nAs there was no change made the Missionary, Rev. John Nelson will stay for another year and while they have plenty of room they will not board a teacher.\n\nI saw one qualified teacher who will let me know next week, at least I requested her to, if she will take the school, teachers are still very scarce in this vicinity.\n\nKindly forward a cheque for the teacher and oblige.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 14th ultimo, with regard to a teacher for the New Credit school, I beg to state I drove out to seek Mrs. Brant to find out if it was possible for her husband to board a teacher and she cannot, her husband works about 200 acres of land, has two boys and her only single daughter who started last year to New York to qualify for a nurse was turned back as she was then too young, but she intends going very soon to Cleveland to be with her sister who is a qualified nurse and she expects to get in a hospital at once, for these reasons Mrs. Brant cannot take a teacher. Her daughter Mrs. John Merkimer will board one for the sake of the school but she lives one and a quarter miles from the school house.\n\nI expect to know definitely on Saturday night next if the county school Inspector can find he does not know of any at present and several schools in this county are without teachers.\n\nIf he succeeds I will telegraph the Department on Saturday night, if not and add should be put in the Toronto papers. I am very sorry that we cannot get a suitable boarding house near the school as it is a good comfortable school building and the surroundings are much better than many of the rural schools in this vicinity.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

King against the teacher of the New Credit school.\n\nI visit the school occasionally and have always found everything satisfactory. I don't know of any school property that has been destroyed or damaged since she came. She has a larger attendance than we ever had since my appointment. I saw the teacher today; she states that she has no trouble with the pupils. I also, a trustee, R.D. Brant, he said everything was satisfactory so far as he knew. With regard to the gravel walks mentioned, I might state that at the regular council meeting in May 1919 a resolution was passed recommending a walk to be built from the school house to the well, about 200 feet. Mr. King was a member of the council also a trustee at the time. The councillors were all farmers and had teams and promised to haul the gravel. I spoke to them several times about and they always promised but never made the walk, however if the Department approves of it I will have gravel walks made to the out buildings and well as soon as the weather will permit in the spring.\n\nI think the teacher, although a young girl is doing very well and the boys attending the school are all small and I do not think the girls would give her any trouble. I notice she puts the name of a pupil on the black board for misconduct, and for the second offence draws a line through the name and for the 3rd, she uses the strap and it appears to have a very good effect on all the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should again draw this matter to the attention of the Council and endeavour to have the work performed early in the spring. The Indians should take enough interest in the school to deliver the gravel required and do the work of completing the walks.\n\nWith reference to the resolution of the band in council of the 16th instant I beg to say that the appointment of Chas.

If you are able to engage a teacher who would be congenial and helpful to Mr. and Mrs. Drew, the problem of the New Credit school might be solved for some years.\n\nMy suggestion is that you ask Mr. Drew to nominate a teacher, in the hope that an appointment through him would solve our difficulties.

The building was in very good condition. No residence is provided.\n\nIt is extremely desirable to have a teacher who will be congenial company for the resident missionary and his wife, because the personage is practically the only desirable boarding place in the vicinity. I have made overtures on file to both the Agent and the Missionary, in connection with the appointment of a teacher for the next school year.\n\nOttawa, May 4, 1922.\nOttawa, June 21, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nThe attention of the Department has been drawn to the case of several of the pupils of the New Credit Indian Day School who are very irregular in their attendance. The names of these children are Ruben Herkimer, James Sault and Frances Laforme.\n\nIn the case of the first named, Ruben Herkimer, this boy remains away from school whenever he chooses. He is stated to be 12 years of age and is absent about two-thirds of the time. James Sault is a son of the truant officer, and is reported to be an inveterate truant, despite the actions on the part of his father to have him attend. The mother of Frances Laforme keeps this girl away from school without any reasonable excuse. The home surroundings are stated to be deplorable.\n\nIt is considered that it would be advisable to take the necessary action to have these children placed in a residential school. If the parents refuse to sign applications for their admission, steps will be taken under Section 10 of the Indian Act to have them committed to a residential school. If these children are Protestant, they could be placed in either the Mohawk Institute or the Mt. Elgin Industrial School.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you regarding this matter and your opinion as to whether you would recommend that the action mentioned above be taken. As an example to the other Indian parents, and in the interests of the children themselves, it is thought that this would be the best course to adopt.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

I advised the officer to see the parents of those children who did not attend regularly and inform them that unless the children attended regularly they would certainly be sent to an industrial school.\n\nNothing can be done now until after the holidays we will attend to this matter.\n\nThe teacher said she would give me her resignation along with her quarterly report next week.\n\nThe Missionary told me that there was a teacher up at Georgina Island who desired to make a change and would like to come to New Credit. Miss Grace Martin is her name. I believe she is a member of the Six Nations.\n\nHe thinks she would be a very satisfactory teacher for this school.\n\nTeachers are still very scarce in this district.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The salary she said would be $750.00, with free house and fuel.\n\nAnd then she said if she taught her for another year she would not take less than $1000.00, that she was not satisfied with her boarding place and would have to find another, and would much prefer boarding herself if she could find a suitable place.\n\nThe Mission house here is large enough for two families and should have been divided so that two rooms could be occupied by the school teacher if they desired it, and I intend asking the delegates to the Conference in June to advise the next Missionary coming here that two rooms are to be reserved for the school teacher. I understand Rev. Mr. Drew expects to leave here this year, if so I think we could keep Miss Martin. She says she will give me a decided answer as soon as the conference is over.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should then immediately inform the Department as to her decision. As you were informed in official letter of the 23rd of March last, we would be prepared, if it is necessary, to make a small increase in her salary.\n\nIt is hoped that satisfactory arrangements can be made by the church authorities to provide a suitable boarding place for Miss Martin, and that she will consent to remain.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. C. Van Leen, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nHagersville, Ont.\nJune 4/23\n\nDear Mr. Vanloon,\n\nAs you requested I am sending you particulars in regard to my qualifications to teach.\n\nI have completed my high school training, holding the Lower School Normal Entrance & Junior Matriculation Certificates also I spent one year in the fourth form.\n\nThis is about all that will be of interest to you I think. And I believe I could manage the school very nicely, as it isn't too large.\n\nYours Very Truly,\nBruce A. Hallett\nEnclosed find my school report for the month of May.\n\nI was out one day to visit the school and find out just what the teacher intended to do. I had learned that the missionary was to remain on this circuit for another year.\n\nMiss Martin informed me that she would remain for another year if her salary was raised to $1000.00, which seems to me rather high for so small a school; there was but ten pupils present yesterday. I think however reason for the small attendance was both measles and whooping cough have broken out on this and the Six Nations reserve and some of the families have been quarantined.\n\nI received an application from a young man who resides about two miles from the school, which I will enclose; he belongs to a good family and might make a satisfactory teacher; he wants $900.00 a year.\n\nIf Miss Martin would remain for $900.00 I would recommend that she be engaged and if neither offer is satisfactory to the Department we had better advertise for a teacher.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 9, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the services of a teacher for the New Credit Indian Day School for the next school year and enclosing an application from Bruce A. Haller for the position.\n\nIn reply I beg to say we hope that Miss Martin, the present teacher, will consent to remain. If she does so, we will be prepared to grant her an increase of $100 per annum in her salary. This will allow her salary at the rate of $800 per annum which, together with the bonus at the rate of $150 per annum, will make a combined salary and bonus of $950. I would point out that Miss Martin, while making a success of the work, has no professional qualifications, and the above increase is the total amount we could pay her. You will be good enough to ascertain definitely from her whether she will consent to remain another year at the salary and bonus now offered her.\n\nWe could not approve of the appointment of Bruce A. Haller, should Miss Martin decide not to remain, as we would prefer to obtain the services of a teacher having professional qualifications. We hope that, if Miss Martin remains, she will be able to make satisfactory arrangements for boarding accommodation either in the mission house or elsewhere.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

We hope that she will find conditions at this school more satisfactory during the next year, and that she will meet with every success in her work.\n\nYou should inform Miss Martin that her appointment as teacher at New Credit is approved for the school year 1923-24.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

However, I remained there till summer holidays keeping the difficulties from the public for the sake of the church.\n\nFurnished rooms in the parsonage may be recommended, may be a means of avoiding trouble, insuring peace and comfort for the teacher, and keeping good will among teacher, preacher and people, but under the existing circumstances it would not mean this to me so kindly release me at the close of the present quarter.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGrace Martin\nSir,\n\nEnclosed you will find my school report for the month of October. I will also enclose a letter from teacher as well as her resignation, which should be accepted.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Barner, Superintendent of Indian Missions met Rev. Drew and Miss Martin at this office on Saturday and from what I heard from them I think the best thing to be done is get another teacher. I was in Brantford today and was informed by the clerk at the Indian Office that they advertised for a teacher and received twenty-six applications, some with first class certificates offering to teach for $1000.00 and offered to teach for $900.00. Our school house is situated on the S.W. of lot 6 and Miss Martin has been boarding since the holidays on the S.E. of Lot 9 so that the distance was not very great.\n\nRev.

Pereira to come to Hagersville on the morning of Jan. 2nd and I would take her out to the school and boarding house, on the 31st I received a card from her saying she had accepted another school and would not be here.\n\nI then telephoned Miss Gibbings at Clinton who had applied, and gave me her telephone number; she replied that she had just accepted a school near Collingwood but would rather come here and if they would let her off she would come and wanted me to wait for a final answer until 4 P.M., and if they would let her off she would call me, she did not call and I then telephoned Port Dover to a Mrs. I.J. Field who was a qualified teacher and had sent an application for the school, she said she would give a decided answer at 5 P.M., she called me up then and said she would be here on Monday the 7th to open the school, on January 3rd I received a letter from her saying she could not come. I then telephoned Miss Laura Garrett at Blyth who had applied through Miss Gibbings, she said she would be here on Saturday the 5th but came on the 4th, she is a young woman who just received her certificate, I was out yesterday to visit the school and see how she was getting along.\n\nI am satisfied that we have a good teacher and she is well pleased with the school and said everything was quite satisfactory.\n\nI learned that teachers wanting schools answer several advertisements and accept the one with the highest salary.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJanuary 9th 1924\nOttawa, January 11, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, informing the Department that Miss F. Pereira, who was engaged as teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School, did not accept the position, and that you had secured the services of Miss Laura Garrett, who has begun duties.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the action taken by you in obtaining a teacher for this school, and the appointment of Miss Garrett is approved. The salary allowed her will be at the same rate as was promised in the case of Miss Pereira, viz: $800 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law, to be based on ten teaching months in the year.

After examining the school by law we find that the School is under the direct management of said Council. We therefore ask that her application dated 16th of June 1924 inst. be accepted and that the Department notify our agent Mr. W. C.

As you are aware, Miss Garrett has only a third class certificate and has been teaching this school since January, last. If you are satisfied that her services would be satisfactory, the Department would have no objection to her appointment for the next school year, beginning after the summer holidays, on or about September 2nd, next.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your recommendation as to whether you would advise that Miss Garrett be re-appointed or not, and also if you are satisfied that her services are satisfactory. Your early reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. C.

Garrett for the position of teacher for the coming year.\n\nI received the Departmental letter dated June 24th, 1924 File No. I6-I-I, stating that the Department had received a communication from the Chief Councilor requesting that Miss Garrett be engaged for the coming school year.\n\nI believe Miss Garrett is pretty fair teacher, but I could not recommend that she be reengaged unless her father is willing for her to return to this reserve, the Missionary and senior trustee, Ex-Chief F.L. King, both complain about attending all the dances going on in the neighbourhood and sometimes cut all night.\n\nOn Friday night June 27th the congregations of the three Mission churches which the Missionary looks after, met at his home New Credit, and presented him with an easy chair and a purse, about 100 people were present, and I am told the teacher was away at a dance that night.\n\nAs for the Chief I do not think he has visited the school since Miss Garrett has been teaching, his children attend Hagersville School.\n\nI expect a letter from the trustees in a day or so, also a copy of the Inspector's report when I will report more fully.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Garrett for re-engagement as teacher for the next school year does not appear to have been forwarded. It is noted that Miss Garrett's services for the period she taught this school have been fairly satisfactory, but that there have been complaints about her attending dances, etc. Before deciding whether her re-engagement can be approved, the Department will await a further report from you. After you have received the letter from the trustees and a copy of the Inspector's report, you should state your views as to whether you would recommend that she be re-engaged or not. This matter should receive your early attention in order that if it is decided to dispense with her services steps can be taken to obtain another teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

McKenzie of the Orillia Model School.\n\nThe salary I ask is ($750) nine hundred and fifty dollars per annum.\n\nShould you do me the honour of re-engaging me, I will bend every energy to make the school a success.\n\nMy home address is London, Ont.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nLaura Garrett.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 24th of June, with regard to the New Credit school, I will enclose a letter which I received from two of the trustees on Monday.\n\nI will also enclose Miss Garrett's application for the position of teacher for the coming school year, which I failed to enclose with her quarterly school report.\n\nI suppose the Department has received the school Inspector's report dated June 9th, 1924.\n\nI quite agree with the trustees that a male teacher would do better work on this reserve, and then the Missionary left the reserve yesterday and I understand the Missionary who takes his place is a Cree Indian and they, his family, might refuse to board the teacher and there is no other suitable place within two miles, and a young could easily walk that far.\n\nThere is plenty of teachers to be had at the present time, I understand they advertised for a teacher at a small rural school about eight miles from here at Easter and received nearly one hundred applications.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nC T T A W A.\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Garrett for the position as teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School for the next school year, and also a communication from the trustees in which they request that a male teacher be engaged.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if you consider it would be in the best interest of the school work you may inform Miss Garrett that her services will not be required, and you could then take the necessary steps to secure a male teacher having at least a second class professional certificate. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you recommend be engaged should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. The salary allowed would be at the rate of $800 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law, which during the present fiscal year ending March 31st, next, will be at the rate of $15 per month. Payment of salary and bonus is based on ten teaching months in the year. The Department will leave the obtaining of a teacher for this school in your hands. If you consider that Miss Garrett's services would be satisfactory and meet with the approval of the Indians, you may re-engage her. If not, you should obtain the services of a male teacher, as stated above.\n\nKindly inform the Department of the action taken by you in arranging for a teacher for the New Credit School for the next school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

My father has no objection to me taking the school.\n\nL.E.G.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 7th instant with regard to a teacher for the New Credit school, I beg to state that I wrote Miss Garrett that I had consulted the new Missionary and did not think he would board a teacher and whoever we engaged would have to board with an Indian family or walk about three miles to board with a suitable white family, and as she was a young girl did not think it advisable for her to come back as there was a great many advertisements for teachers and she should have no difficulty in getting a school, but if her father would give his consent in writing for her to return she might come on the same terms as last year.\n\nIt seems a large majority of the band wanted her back and the only objections I received was from two of the trustees.\n\nI think she is well qualified to teach this school as all of the pupils are young, the objections I had was based on complaints about her attending so many dances and being out late at night.\n\nI will enclose the reply I received from her this morning.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nO T T A W A.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 23, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing a communication which you received from Miss Laura E. Garrett, stating that she definitely accepts re-engagement as teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School for the next academic year and that she will begin duties on September 2nd, next. In reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of her re-appointment. The salary allowed will be at the same rate as was previously paid her, viz.: $800 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Payment of both salary and bonus is based on ten teaching months in the year.\n\nWe note that Miss Garrett states she does not anticipate having any difficulty in obtaining a suitable boarding place. You will be good enough to inform her of the Department's approval of her re-appointment and I shall be pleased if you will give her every assistance you can in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Garrett who has recently been re-engaged as teacher for the New Credit Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the situation is somewhat difficult, but I believe you will be well advised to have Miss Garrett come to your office before she reports for duty. You should explain that her conduct after school hours last academic year was not entirely satisfactory to the Department, and that you have reason to believe she was keeping company with one of the Indian band. Miss Garrett should be given to understand that her influence in the school and on the Reserve will suffer if she continues with these practices, and that her continued employment in our service will depend upon the manner in which she conducts herself. This conversation you will have with Miss Garrett will no doubt throw some light on the question, and you will be in a position to recommend her definite re-engagement or her dismissal.\n\nI am returning the enclosure which accompanied your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In order, however, not to interfere with the progress of the pupils, it is considered that it might be advisable to leave her in charge of the school until the end of the present school year, namely, June 30th, next, but, if for any special reasons you consider her services should be dispensed with sooner, the Department should be advised.\n\nPlease let me have your views on the matter at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You should inform her not later than the end of May that her services will not be required after the end of the present school year.\n\nIt is noted from the report which you forwarded for the month of February that 7 of the pupils on the roll are whites who reside on the Reserve. Please state if these are children of white tenants of Indian lands. I would point out that this Department is not responsible for the providing of educational facilities for white children, and you should report fully regarding the white children who attend. In cases where white children attend Indian schools a tuition fee is charged, and the Department cannot consent to white children continuing in attendance at the New Credit Indian Day School unless a tuition fee at the rate of $12 per annum is paid by the parents for each child. The Department will await a full report from you regarding the white children in attendance. Please state whether they are too far away from a white school to attend, also whether they are interfering with the regular classroom instruction of the Indian children, and whether you would recommend that they be allowed to continue in attendance provided the parents pay the regular tuition fee charged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

I. Tuscarora, died last April, left a widow and five children; four are of school age, the family are destitute, I collected clothing in this village for them so they could attend school, and then it is in accordance with Sub. Sec. 4 of Section 5 of By-Law 12.\n\nI might add that we have about 11 members of the band who attend Hagersville public and High school without paying any fees, and other are attending No. 9 school on the Six Nations reserve, without paying any fee.\n\nOur school would seat about 40 pupils and the average attendance is less than twenty, and I think that when we have twenty or more pupils attending they will attend more regular and take more interest in their work and like the school better.\n\nFor these reasons all children of school age on this reserve should be allowed to attend our school free the same as is done in other municipalities.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, March 10, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, and in reply note that you will inform Mrs. Arthur Tobicce, the present teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School, that her services will not be required after the end of the present school year.\n\nThe question of obtaining the services of another teacher should be brought to the attention of the Department early in July, next. If you have anyone in view at that time whom you desire to recommend for the position, you should furnish full particulars regarding name, qualifications and experience.\n\nRegarding the white children who attend, I wish to thank you for drawing the attention of the Department to the By-Law of the Mississaugas of the Credit in this connection. We note that they are to be admitted to the school on the same conditions as the Indian children, provided they furnish their own books and appliances.

In this connection it is considered that it will not be necessary to obtain the services of another teacher for the balance of the year and the school may therefore remain closed.

Reuben Herkimer lives in the second house east of the school, less than 100 rods from the school, has a son nine years of age, who has been very irregular; he has been warned by the truant officer, after a warning he will only attend for a day or two and then quit, when I spoke to his father his only excuse was that he had no shoes, although the father has a good 100 acre farm and older boy about 15 or 20.\n\nWm. H. Laform lives on the S. 1/2 of Lot 5 Con. I. Tuscarora. His son only attends occasionally although he has been warned by the Truant officer and myself, his mother simply says the boy is sick, but they do not get a doctor's certificate, and the boy is able run around the neighbourhood.\n\nThe Mounted Police ride past both places occasionally. I want them to notify the parents that unless they get a doctor's certificate, the boys must go to school and if they fail when they call again they will be taken and placed in an industrial school where they will attend. This would have a good effect on all parents and pupils on this reserve.\n\nI do not know if the Police would take orders from me or not, they say they have nothing to do with this reserve. If not I will ask Col. Morgan give them the order.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

H. Laform, who have been repeatedly warned by the truant officer to send their children to school, and who have neglected to do so, you may request the officer of the mounted police in charge of the detachment at Ohsweken to notify the two parties named that their children of school age, who are in good health, are to attend school regularly each day it is open. If the parents refuse to send their children after they have been duly notified by the police, steps should be taken to have the children placed in an Indian residential school, but before doing so, you should report the facts to the Department and receive instructions as to the school to which they should be sent.\n\nYou may show this letter to the mounted police as your authority for asking their services in investigating and notifying parents of delinquent children. If the police will not act on this notice from you, you may request Colonel Morgan, Indian Superintendent, Brantford, to request them to investigate and give the parents notice that their children must attend school regularly.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear later as to the result of any action taken by the police.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Now I am quite willing to give her a chance and also the same for the Inspector but we must have your permission as she only hold a third class certificate, but as I have said before she has had experience in the school and the Inspector thinks she will be satisfactory, I would therefore recommend that you give her a trial until Christmas and then get a report from the Inspector.

Just as soon as we get one we think to be satisfactory I will notify you.\n\nAs for the Miss Garret whom was recommended by Mrs Tobicce I know nothing of her except that she is Mrs Tobicce's sister, and anyway the inspector and myself decided that a man teacher would be much preferable to a lady if one could be got, however if we cannot procure a man we will decide on someone in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir-\n\nReplying to your letter re teacher I have engaged one, all but getting your consent, he is a first class certificate and a graduate from Toronto university and practically his B.A. I consider, and so does the inspector here consider, that we are exceedingly fortunate in securing a teacher of the qualification of the above, I am also glad to say that it is a man which is much more satisfactory.\n\nAs for considering the recommendation in your letter, that lady is a sister to Mrs Tobicoe, and as I could not handle her very well I would not want to consider the application at all. Mrs Tobicoe would not listen to The Inspector or myself she claimed as she was principal of the school she was the boss, so I am afraid that she would be the same if we had her sister here.\n\nThe above applicant whose name is Mr. Culvert has had no previous experience but is a very clever looking chap his recommendations are of the very best and his qualifications are the same he requires a salary of $50.00 per year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, August 21st, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, nominating the services of Mr. Culvert for the position as teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School for the coming school year, and stating the qualifications which he possesses.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Culvert, to begin duties on September 3rd next.

There were twenty pupils present of a roll of twenty-two. The attendance has been very good since the 1st of September. The teacher is a young man with four years' University work and is very capable. The school building is in good condition, classroom clean and well ventilated. The pupils generally are a bright, healthy looking lot of children. The teacher asked to have a globe supplied for instruction in Geography. This is being sent to him from the Schools Branch.\n\nThos. Mc Gookin.\nInspector.\nSir,\n\nMy teacher at New Credit sent in his resignation to take effect after Xmas Holidays. In this it being such short notice I referred him to the Inspector of the schools here and on consulting him myself we decided that he being a young man and with such high qualifications as a fourth year graduate in The University did not wish to hold him down, we therefor notified him that if he could secure a qualified teacher with some experience, to take his place we would give him his release which he did. The new man has had four years experience and comes highly recommended and being a son of a United Minister, and is 26 years of age.\n\nI hope this meets with the approval of the Department.

He has had seven years experience altogether, is twenty-eight years of age, and is the son of a united minister.\n\nJudging from the first appearance of the man, I believe he will be very good.\n\nI had already stated the salary, and he suggested that he should have more, but I advised him that $950.00 per year was the limit.\n\nThe qualifications of Mr. Hinton are good having the seven years experience and a second class permanent certificate.\n\nI wish the department to understand that I did not engage this man altogether myself; I done it with the recommendation of the Inspector here, who I believed in a position to know.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have already taken the matter up with the Inspector Mitchener, and he informs me that it will not be any trouble obtaining a new teacher as there are plenty of them. However, as soon as we get someone in view, will forward particulars to the Department at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the last instant, enclosing the resignation of Mr. M.

I would recommend this for your approval for a supply teacher until summer at least when we will have plenty of time to engage some one else.\n\nShe has agreed to act as supply at the same salary as the former teachers $95.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 12, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, nominating the services of Mrs. Nelson Parker (nee Hazel Timson) for the position as teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School to succeed Mr. Hinton who has resigned from the end of the present month.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, while the Department would prefer the services of an unmarried teacher, yet, in view of the difficulty of obtaining a teacher at this time of the year and also in view of the fact that the public school inspector has recommended Mrs. Parker's services, her temporary appointment for the balance of the present school year is approved. The salary allowed her will be at the same rate as was paid the former teacher, viz., $95 per teaching month. You should inform her of the approval granted for her temporary appointment and arrange with her to commence duties on or about April 1st, next.\n\nYou might inform the Department whether or not Mrs. Parker will obtain boarding accommodation on the Reserve and whether her husband will accompany her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

MUNCHENER\nDATED MAY 7th, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nNEW CREDIT INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 16-1-6.\n\nAs previously reported, frequent changes of teachers hinders the progress of the pupils. I think that the salary should be at least $1,000.\nOttawa, June 14, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to official letter dated March 12th, last, regarding the appointment of Mrs. Nelson Parker, as temporary teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School to the end of the present school year, I have to request that you will inform the Department in due time whether a change in teacher will be necessary at this school for the next school year. The Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection, states that frequent changes of teachers at this school have hindered the progress of the pupils. The Department is anxious to obtain the services of a fully qualified teacher for this school, and I shall be pleased to have a recommendation from you stating the action you would advise be taken regarding the teaching services at this school for the next school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The present teacher does not wish to continue as she is a married woman and cannot be away she was only acting as a supply, and has been very successful is a real good teacher the only regret is that she will not continue after the holidays.\n\nRegarding next year I believe the Inspector should be notified to advertise for a teacher for this school, or else I should advertise in plenty of time so as to have a personal interview with the applicant before making an agreement.\n\nWith the assistance of the Inspector Mitchener I am confident we can engage a teacher who will be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMaurice Bonner\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 2, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, relative to the teaching services at the New Credit Indian Day School for the next school year. It is noted that the present teacher, Mrs. Parker, will not continue her services and that it will be necessary to obtain a successor.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department may be able to obtain a teacher from the applications on file, and this matter will receive consideration in due course. It will not be necessary for you to advertise or take any other steps to obtain a teacher unless in the event of the Department being unable to make an appointment, when you will receive instructions as to any action you should take in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMaurice Winger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nMEMO.\n\n16-1-I\n\nSir-\n\nReferring to your letter of July 2 regarding teacher for the New Credit day school. I have interviewed the school Inspector here, and he advises me that the old teacher Mrs Parker would return for another year providing she could get One Thousand dollars.\n\nNow in this connection I have to say that if the Department can see their way clear to pay that I believe it would worth while,\n\nThis lady is a real teacher she picked up the school just three months ago when it was in a very bad condition and passed both her entrance pupils and one of them with honors, this I consider wonderful, owing that she had them such a short time. She is also very well liked by the parents which is quite a lot. I understand that a petition is in circulation at the present time, for the department to have her returned.\n\nKindly advise me as to this at your earliest convenience.\n\nYou see the main objection for teaching on the reserve is the board.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir-\n\nWith reference to teacher for the New Credit day school I wish to say that, the teacher we had last has reconsidered her decision and decided to take the school for another year at the same salary as before that is $950.00 providing you have not engaged a teacher, and that you are willing to accept her.\n\nI would recommend very strongly that you engage her for another year, as she is a first class teacher, she is well regarded by the parents of the pupils, and as she has had 3 months with the school now make it much better.\n\nHoping to hear from you at as early a date as possible, as I do not wish to keep Mrs Parker from getting another school.\n\nI had an interview with Inspector Mitchener this afternoon and he advised me to write the Department giving the above recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, July 26, 1930.\n\nMaurice Winger,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\n\nReference vacancy New Credit Indian Day School Department had arranged with qualified teacher to accept position provided she could board with Reverend Mr. Burgess the missionary -STOP- Ascertain if he would board young lady teacher who is highly regarded by department officers -STOP- I doubt advisability of continuing services of married woman at this post -STOP- Reply by letter immediately.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nChg. Dept. I. A.\nSir-\n\nReplying to your letter of Saturday July 25, regarding a teacher for the New Credit day school, I wish to say, That I considered every angle before recommending the teacher we had last year on account of her being married, but could not figure anything to my knowledge.\n\nAs for a teacher boarding with the Missionary Mr. Burgess it is absolutely out of the question, however I drove to his place and made the necessary inquiries this morning, and they are not in a position. They have a family of four themselves, and two of these will be attending High School, and the other two are very small, the mother is a frail little woman and cannot stand the work.\n\nThe nearest boarding place to the school, that is one at which I would ask a lady to stay, is 1\u00bd miles, is rather inconvenient during the Winter and muddy weather, however if she thinks she can walk that far I will do all I can to assist her in any way.\n\nKindly advise me as soon as possible, if she is willing to take the chance or if you still want Mrs Parker. I myself am not much in favour of hiring a married woman, but in this particular case the Inspector and myself decided that it would be the best.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMaurice Wilkie\n\nThe Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs.

INSPECTOR MITCHENER,\nDATED SEPTEMBER 22, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF\nTHE NEW CREDIT INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nName:- Mrs. N. Parker    Age:- 24\n\nSalary:- $950.\n\nQualifications: II Perm. 4 years experience.\n\nSuccess:- The pupils have made a fine beginning of\nthe fall term's work. Department - excellent.\nProficiency - good average.\n\nOther experienced teachers duly qualified\nare receiving $1000 salary. I think that the salary\nof Mrs. Parker should be raised to $1000.\nFebruary 26, 1931.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMrs. Parker is paid $95 per teaching month. She has to keep a car to get to and from school. She has made an application through Agent Winger for an increase of $5.00 per month, which would make her equal with the Six Nations' teachers. From what I saw of her work in the short visit to the school and from reports of some of the Indian parents, I would recommend this for your consideration.\n\n(Sgd.) Thos. McGookin,\nInspector.\nOttawa, March 2, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department will approve of an increase of $5 per teaching month in the salary of Mrs. Nelson Parker, teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School, from April 1st, next, the beginning of the new fiscal year. This would make the total salary allowed Mrs. Parker from that date at the rate of $100 per teaching month. This increase is made in view of the reports that have been received regarding the splendid services Mrs. Parker is performing at the school. I have to request that you will inform her of the increase in salary that will be allowed her from the date mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMaurice Winger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville,\nOnt.\nSir-\n\nFind enclosed monthly report also the Quarterly report of the teacher of the New Credit Bay school. I may say that the school has made the best progress under the management of Mrs Parker of any teacher since my term of office and am very sorry to notify you that she has given notice that she does not intend to come back after holidays.\n\nThe school inspector Mr. Mitchener and myself have been on the lookout for a teacher to fill her position and have had several applications. The one application is a young man living locally who has just got through his examinations whom I believe will be very good and who has been spoken of by the Inspector; however I will give you a further report on this later as to his qualifications etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 4, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, informing the Department that Mrs. Nelson Parker, teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School, tendered her resignation to take effect when the school closed for the summer holidays.\n\nIt is noted that you have taken up the matter of the appointment of a successor with the public school inspector and that you hope to make a nomination in due course. You should give full particulars as to the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom the inspector and yourself recommend be appointed to succeed Mrs. Parker.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nMaurice Winger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of July 14th with regard to teacher for New Credit Bay school. We have had several applications and our selection has been a young fellow from our own neighbourhood by the name of Winfred Bacher. He spent two years studying for a minister and found out he could not afford to go on so he completed his course at Normal for a teacher. He has a second class interim certificate with all the other training for physical training and cadet training. He is 22 years of age and a real gentleman, he has had no experience, but I believe he is worth a trial. I know his people and know they are very respectable family and need the work.\n\nTrusting you will give this your favourable consideration and advise me as soon as possible so he can arrange matters accordingly.\n\nThe Inspector as well as myself decided on this applicant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6150, File 416-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 1, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, nominating the services of Winfred Bacher for the position as teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School for the next academic year and stating the qualifications which he possesses.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Bacher, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays, on or about September first, next. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month. Please inform him of his appointment and arrange with him to take up duties on the date mentioned. It is hoped that he will meet with every success and I would request that you give him any assistance you can in his work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMaurice Winger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am a teacher on the Mississaugas Reserve and desire to teach Agriculture to the children. Of all children, the Indians ought to have Agriculture taught them as their farms are very widely cultivated.\n\nThere is a special grant given for teaching Agriculture in Public Schools. However, the Inspector did not know for certain about Dominion Schools. Would you then kindly inform me what grant will be given for teaching Agriculture?\n\nAs yet I have no special certificate in Agriculture but intend to take some courses.\n\nTrusting that you will inform me at your convenience.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWinfred Backer\nOTTAWA, September 23, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the teaching of agriculture to the pupils of the New Credit Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the Department does not allow any extra remuneration for teaching this subject. It is considered, where such instruction is given, it should form part of the regular classroom work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nMr. Winfred Bacher,\nR.R. #1,\nHagersville, Ont.\nOctober 4, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Senn:\n\nI wish to refer to recent conversation in regard to salary paid Winifred Bachar, teacher of the Mississaugas of the Credit Indian Day School; also salaries paid teachers of the Indian day schools on the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nMr. Bachar was appointed teacher as from September first, 1931, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month. This salary has been subject to the 10% cut since April first, last. In compliance with the Salary Deduction Act, 1932, and regulations of the Treasury Board, it is not possible to make any increase in salaries during the present fiscal year. No exception can be made to either grant an increase or to exempt any salary from the 10% cut. It is considered that the salary paid Mr. Bachar compares favourably with that paid teachers in the surrounding rural white schools having similar qualifications to his and as large an enrolment of pupils as at the New Credit School.\n\nRegarding salaries of teachers on the Six Nations Reserve, previous to April first, 1929, all these salaries were paid from the funds of the Band. Since that date, however, the salaries of the Six Nations teachers have, the same as in the case of all teachers in the other Indian schools in Canada, been paid from Parliamentary Appropriation. The\n\nM. G. Senn, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\nsalary of the Six Nations teachers was set by the School Board at the time payment was made from their funds, and the same scale has been continued. A teacher having at least second class professional qualifications receives a minimum salary of $1,000, which, after a year's service, is increased $50 per annum until the maximum, viz.: $1,200, is reached. During the present fiscal year, however, all salaries of teachers on the Six Nations Reserve are subject to the 10% cut, and no increase was granted. Indians are engaged as teachers as far as possible. When the services of an Indian teacher, who has not the minimum qualifications, are engaged, the salary allowed in such cases is at the rate of $900 per annum. I may add that the Six Nations are the only Band in Canada which have their own School Board. While all salaries and appointments made by the Board are subject to the approval of the Department, yet, owing to circumstances on this reserve, we rarely take exception to the appointment of a teacher made by the Board or in salary which, as stated, was set when salaries were entirely paid from the funds of the Band.\n\nIn schools other than the Six Nations, teachers are engaged at a remuneration based on qualifications - the salary paid depending more or less on the supply of teachers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSir -\n\nAm enclosing quarterly school report, monthly school report also requisition for school supplies for term beginning Sept. first thought it advisable to get them away early.\n\nMy teacher here at New Credit has resigned, he is getting a larger school at Caledonia Ont., am very sorry to lose him as he was a very good teacher and the children were getting well advanced under his care.\n\nI have application from a dozen different teachers without advertising and think it will not be any trouble getting a teacher to fill his vacancy.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 6, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, informing the Department that Mr. Winfred Bacher, teacher of the New Credit Indian Day School, has resigned, having obtained a position in a white school.\n\nWith reference to the appointment of a successor to Mr. Bacher for the coming school year, I have to inform you that the Department has in view a fully qualified teacher for this school. You will be advised later regarding name, salary, etc. In the meantime, you should take no action to obtain a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMaurice Winger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nSir -\n\nWith further reference to supplying of teacher for our school, I wish to say that I have about twenty applications without asking for any and most of these are from our own county; three of them are from young men and all three seem to be well qualified. I have one in particular which seems very attractive. He has his first class certificate, is qualified to teach physical culture and agriculture, as well as a music teacher on the piano having taught piano lessons for a year; this last alone is worth considerable, he states he is willing to take $700.00 a year salary with the usual 10% cut, thus costing us $630.00 per year which is not unreasonable for a school the size of ours.\n\nIf convenient I much prefer a man teacher on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nCaledonia Oct 16-1-1\nJuly 6, 1933\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have placed my application with Mr. Winger, the Indian agent at Hagersville for the position of teacher in the school at New Credit on the Six Nations reserve. This with other applications I suppose will be forwarded to your department. Since then I have had an interview with the Senior Trustee of the school who with the other trustees is willing to accept my application accordingly these men have agreed to sign their names to the letter I am writing.\n\nI live near the reserve, am twenty-two years of age and have an interim first-class certificate.

It is presumed the applicants have given full particulars concerning qualifications and experience. When these applications are received, consideration will be given and you will be advised as to the teacher appointed, salary, etc.\n\nI may add that the Department has received a communication from Leslie Knight, Caledonia, which is endorsed by Walter M.

George Henry lives opposite the old school, and J.A. Wood will have 1/2 miles further to send his children.\n\nAt the Council 25th May last the following Minutes have been reported by me:\n\n\"The Council decided to be a Committee of the whole to examine Plans for a New School House and to meet at the Indian Office, Hagenville upon 27th May for that purpose.\"\n\nI prepared Plans and the Committee met and approved them. I enclose without any discussion.

This is done to give two members of the Band, who are painters by trade, an opportunity to compete which they might not have if this job was left to the contractor. It is desirable that as much of the cost of building as possible should be earned by the Band, and I will endeavour to persuade the contractor to employ as much skilled Indian labor as possible.\n\nIf my plans and specifications are acceptable to the Department, a practical man might be selected from the Band, to constantly oversee the work, and thus avoid the large expense of an architect who would have to come from Hamilton or Brantford. I would suggest that when the specifications are\nare approved, they should be typewritten at Ottawa and 3 or 4 copies sent to me.\n\nIn respect to the Plans,\nAlthough the builders are complacent over, and say they can do the work from them and the Specifications to the satisfaction of the Council, still I think it would be well for Mr. Austin and Bay, to make a proper tracing from my Plans and the Specifications.\n\nI have not made a sectional plan, for the Specifications merely require it, but it ought to be made however.\n\nI would like to ask for tenders by the 10th Sept., to be opened by the 19th Sept., and I think the building can then be completed by the 1st of Dec., and all internal arrangements provided so that the building may be used after the Christmas holidays.\n\nIn December I would advise that the old School House be offered for sale by tender or auction and I think it would bring between...\nbetween one and two hundred dollars, or quite enough to furnish\nthe New School House.

And I have not been treated right in the matter as I was to have the amount in full at completion, and it is nearly six weeks since I finished my contract, and everything on my part has been very satisfactory, and the council & whole band are well satisfied with the work, but I am considerably put out by not getting the money as my husband and some other matelot cost me more by getting it on a longer time than 30 days, more I hope you will do me the favor of sending it at once and save any further trouble, they want to begin school there on the 4th you see.\n\nW.C.

The time now is too short to call for tenders before the Easter holidays.\n\nYou will be good enough, therefore, to see that the tenders are called for the work to be done during the summer holidays. When calling for tenders the necessary specifications should be made to insure good work. All tenders with a copy of the specifications should be forwarded to the Department for its consideration sometime between now and June 30th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

I intended to bring this matter up yesterday along with John Herkimer's application for a loan of twenty five dollars to build line fence, and when I would bring up any question they would simply say they wanted to know more about the school question or Walter Sault's appointment; and now I would like to know if I am to prepare specifications and ask for tenders for painting of the school house or let the matter drop.\n\nW.C.

G. VanLoon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nSir:\n\nIn compliance with the request contained in your letter of the 30th ultimo No.152 830/5 I beg to enclose three tenders which I received for painting the New Credit School House upon this reserve, also specifications for the same.
