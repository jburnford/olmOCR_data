Guerney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nWe duly note contents of your letter of July 30th, relative to the proposal to deduct cost of certain alterations from the balance due us and also paragraph in your letter of July 26th relative to water tanks.\n\nWe unhesitatingly affirm that these tanks are properly designed pneumatic tanks and that the connections are not an unreasonable distance from the bottom.\n\nTo support the above statement, we enclose blue prints showing how the tanks were made. It is true that the outlets are not at the actual bottom. This was done by the Vulcan Iron Works who made them, to allow for settlement of sediment as it has been found that nearly all water storage systems collect sediments. It was only during the past winter that we had experience in moving a similar tank which had collected in only two years use, over six inches of solid matter in the bottom. This was a tank manufactured by the Vulcan Iron Works.\n\nWhere the outlet is put in the bottom of the tank, the gauge glass is placed to allow for the water line to be about the center of the tank as shown by yellow pencil on blue print submitted. In order to offset loss of storage by placing the outlet at the bottom, you will notice the couplings for water gauge are set near the top to allow for a much higher water line, and by this method owing to the water contents being increased at the center of the tank, the amount of storage is greater than if the water line kept to the center and the outlet at the bottom.\nIf such a simple matter as changing the outlet would make the system work, it would not be necessary to substitute low down tanks for flushometers and we contend this feature was the controlling factor and not the position of the outlets. Another disadvantage under which the system is, or was working, is that there were no means of keeping up the air contents, and unless this is done, the amount of aeration will ultimately use up the air cushion. It is quite possible that owing to a low down tank being used, less water is wasted and the using up of the small reserve at the bottom, with this feature added, will lessen the number of times pump has to be in operation; and excepting for this difference, the system is working no better now than when we left it, though it should still have and we always maintained this was necessary, some means to increase the amount of air in the tanks.\n\nWe do not think it is fair to us, for the Department to make an arbitrary assumption that we are to blame and to deduct money from us without first giving us an opportunity of stating our case. It appears to us somewhat as a \"try it on the dog\" policy, which would hardly be expected from the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nWe trust however, from explanations offered herein, that you will agree with us that our design for the tanks is on the whole, reasonably correct, and not the cause of the trouble, and therefore, that no deduction will be made from the balance due, but that same will duly be forwarded to us intact.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident.\nCANADIAN PACIFIC R'Y.

T. Ferrier informed me that there was an appropriation of some $11,000.00 in the estimates for this school to be applied on plant, the money to be used in erecting farm buildings. I may say that we are badly in need of accommodation for our hogs. So far we have done our best to put up pens out of odd pieces of lumber and any old buildings which could be converted to this purpose. At present with the winter coming on it is necessary to do something. We have about 125 hogs with more coming on. As the Department will realize hogs form a very profitable industry on a farm such as this where we are trying to be self-supporting. I would be glad of some information in regard to the plans of the Department in this respect. It will be necessary to do something for our hogs if we are to continue in this branch of farm work with profit. We would be glad to submit to the Department a sketch of the buildings we require.\n\nYours Truly;\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 27, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the advisability of erecting a hogpen at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.

I should be pleased if you would make a recommendation in this connection and, if you are in favour of such a building, indicate how the work can best be undertaken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing you a pencil sketch of what will be suitable for a hog pen at Edmonton. The dimensions are 56' x 22'. In addition to this they need about a half dozen outside brooding pens which will cost about $125.00 each. The management will undertake to construct these buildings under the supervision of the principal by day labor, the department furnishing the material and probably one experienced carpenter.\n\nWe are very anxious to have this building under way at the earliest possible date. I trust the department will be able to consider this proposition favorably.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. T. Ferrier\nSuperintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and Hospitals in Canada\nOttawa, September 2, 1924.\n\nSIR:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the request for a hogpen at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.

I have to inform you that the Rev. Principal made a request in this connection, under cover of the 18th ultimo, and Mr. Commissioner Graham was asked to make a recommendation and indicate how the work could best be undertaken if he was in favour of such a building.\n\nI am directing to him a copy of your letter and the sketch you enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Whenever it rains heavily the water comes through in a regular little stream, particularly at the steeple. This is of course because of faulty construction and no doubt is due to carelessness on the part of the builders. In order that this be remedied and thus save floors and ceilings from damage I would recommend that this be seen to. It is chiefly at the steeple, but other places also leak.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. F.

This is a very small furnace and quite unsuited for heating the house. We did the best we could under the circumstances to save getting a new furnace at the time but it has proved inadequate. I can buy a new furnace for $103.00 which would be entirely satisfactory. I think it would also be possible to sell the old furnace to a neighbor for $30.00 or so. If possible I would like permission to install a new furnace in this house.\n\nYours Truly;\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, Nov. 19, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th instant, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and installation in the farmer's residence at the Edmonton Residential School of the furnace which you state you can obtain at a cost of $103. We note that this furnace will be satisfactory and that you can obtain the same at the above mentioned cost, which amount should not be exceeded. You may arrange for the installation of the new furnace, the labour for which should be performed without cost to the Department.\n\nWhen forwarding accounts for the new furnace, which should be in duplicate and properly certified, you should show thereon the deduction of the amount received from the sale of the old furnace.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We are awaiting a small charge from Mr. Woodsworth for some lumber he supplied to our men and as soon as we receive this, we will forward the account, and trust it may receive your approval and be duly paid.\n\nMay we now ask that the long delayed final payment of $1000.00 be forwarded to us.

This is the boiler that is used to operate the laundry. He has taken this matter up with the chief boiler inspector but this officer does not feel free to act as he is a provincial inspector and this is a Dominion Government institution.\n\nAs this inspection involves some expense I would be glad for authority to have our boiler inspected.

In reply I have to say that you may arrange with the provincial inspector to make periodical inspections of both boilers at the school. These boilers should be inspected once each year. You should forward properly certified accounts covering the fees charged by the provincial inspector in this connection, together with a copy of the inspector's report on the condition of the boilers. Please arrange for an early inspection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F.

The system seems to be working fairly well.\n\nThe only item in connection with the septic tank which may require some attention in the near future is the condition of the gravel in the large chamber, just before the sewage leaves the tank. The water does not appear to filtering through as it should and is now largely running over the manhole at the top. This is a matter with which we can do little until the summer time when gravel should be changed. The trouble seems to be that the gravel and sand put into the septic tank was too fine and has become clogged. Next summer when the water running through is small in quantity, a carload of new gravel might remedy this difficulty. However at present the situation is not particularly serious.\n\nYours Truly;\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, Jan. 9, 1926.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo advising me of the present condition of the sewage disposal system of the Indian Residential School at Edmonton, Alta.\n\nAs suggested in your communication you may arrange when convenient for the charging of the gravel filter bed in the tank, which you state is not of the dimensions required to insure the proper operation of this system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This is a measure of prevention against accident to anyone close to the boiler in the event of the glass breaking under pressure.\n\nThe way in which the boilers perform under steam shows that the water from the present well is not very satisfactory, and if it were possible to have a reservoir constructed to collect rain water from the roof of the building this would be a considerable advantage. Water from wells in that district has in several instances been found quite unsuitable for boilers, and has been the cause of \"pitting\" taking place, and the risk of that would be obviated by the use of rain water.\n\nI am enclosing account in triplicate for the sum of $22.50, this being the amount of inspection fees payable to the Department of Public Works.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am returning two of their itemized accounts, which total $20.61 and are apparently for window glass. The Department expects Indian residential schools to make replacements of this kind, except in the case of hail or catastrophe, and meet the expense from per capita earnings. A cheque for $141.25, in favour of the Revillon Wholesale, Limited, will be directed to you under separate cover. I have also noted that an account for postage was paid by the Department a few weeks ago. Please do not forward any more vouchers in this connection, as the Department has discontinued the practice of paying vouchers for stamps used at Indian residential schools.\n\nNow that the Edmonton Indian Residential School is in operation, I have to request that you will conform to the practice at other Indian residential schools in the matter of drugs used in the dispensary for Indian children. Every quarter, you may requisition to the Department for the medicines and drugs that will be required. The requisitions should be in triplicate and should be certified by the medical officer of the school. The Department will arrange for competitive prices and will award the business. If you have to make small purchases of drugs from time to time, the accounts should be met from per capita earnings. If a large quantity of drugs is required, in the case of an epidemic or other emergency, the Department's authority for immediate local purchase should be secured.\n\nThe Department will favourably consider accounts, which should be submitted quarterly, in connection with the maintenance of the plant at the institution. Emergency purchases of lumber and hardware, which are necessary to the upkeep of the Department's property, should be made to good advantage from Revillon Wholesale,\n\nRev. J. F. Woodworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\n- Marshall Wells -\nMarshall Wells, or any other firms that will give satisfaction. The business should be distributed - each firm getting the business for a quarter or for six months in turn. The account, in duplicate, should be recapitulated by the firm given the business, but should be in sufficient detail so that it will show the type of goods that have been purchased. It should be properly certified by yourself and submitted, under cover of a supporting letter, to the Department for payment. A cheque will then be issued and directed to the firm in question. The foregoing refers to small emergency purchases in connection with plant. When you have requested and received authority to make purchases of a larger nature, competitive prices should be secured, and when you are submitting the certified account in duplicate, in favour of the firm awarded the business in each case, you should support it with a statement showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nWhen submitting accounts which are to be paid by the Department, please be guided also by Circular Letter of the 12th instant. Your compliance with these requirements is requested by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Edmonton School, in which he informs me that he has been granted authority by the Department to erect a barn at the Edmonton School.\n\nI am also in receipt of a plan from Mr. Woodsworth showing the class of building he desires, and I quite agree to the plan.\n\nWe have the most elaborate barn in Western Canada at the Edmonton School now, and the Department had very little to say in its erection. I do not propose spending any more money at this point than is absolutely necessary. We will give them a good barn to accommodate the number of cattle that should be kept at the school, but there will be nothing fancy. We have built good barns for St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve, and it was along the lines of these barns that I had proposed building the one at Edmonton.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

He was also informed that arrangements will be made to have the necessary funds for the labour available in the spring.\n\nI note that you agree with the sketch submitted by the Rev.

What I wish to say is that I do not quite agree with the plan submitted. It is altogether too large, in my opinion. I am seeing Mr. Woodsworth at Calgary on Monday, and I will discuss this matter with him and arrange to have the necessary material paid for out of this year's appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

F. Woodsworth\nAgent\n\n[Signature]\nFebruary 28, 1925.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Woodsworth:\n\nWe billed the Department with the cost of making alterations to the louvres of the tower to keep out snow and rain, which owing to the peculiar situation near to an inclined roof, caused wind to blow snow and rain upwards into the louvres. The Department have written us, in order to establish the fact that the work was done, they would like to have our accounts forwarded to them through you.\n\nWe are therefore, sending you our account in duplicate and would be glad if you will kindly check them up so far as you are able, with a special reference to the fact that material was delivered, that mechanics were employed and that the work was done as we have outlined, and forward them to Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd inst., I do not think that any trouble you have heating the building is due to radiation. The amount of radiation to each room was specified by Mr. Orr and if the Stansfield Plumbing and Heating Co. put it in as shown on his plan, I think there will be no question of the capacity of the plant for the work. You are no doubt aware that our building is on a very exposed location and has no protection whatever, from the very cold winds. In addition to this, more than the usual number of windows are hung to give ventilation in the summer, that with the slight unavoidable shrinkage due to winter heat, more cold air passes through the windows under wind pressure than the radiators can readily overcome.\nIf the windows were fitted tight enough to overcome this, it would be impossible to operate them in the summer time as the air being moister than causes a certain amount of swelling. It is our opinion that windows in a building so exposed should have metal weatherstripping which we believe will more than pay its cost in fuel and I think the Department has this under consideration.\n\nRegarding the moisture on the walls, I am sure that the trouble you have mentioned is due to conditions outlined in our previous letter.\n\nThe gutter of the School we are now building at Kamloops has been re-designed, to avoid this troublesome feature. You may not be troubled the same way each year, but so long as climatic conditions are such that the gutters fill and freeze, they will have to be repaired each spring.\n\nIf there are any other matters we can advise you on, we will be very glad to do so on hearing from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\nEnc. EC/A.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\nFebruary 26th 1925.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nhereewith please find enclosed voucher in favor of Claydon Company Limited for $77.78. This account is for repairing the leaks in the tower. I enclose the covering letter from Claydon Company. I may say that the work on this particular item was done and as far as I can see at present there is now no leak. As to the responsibility for this defect I presume this is a matter for the Department to decide. I may say however that at the time of construction I pointed out to the contractors the open nature of this tower.\n\nIn regard to the loose windows and the difficulty in heating the building I may take this up later with the Department.\n\nYours Truly;\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\n\nMarch 2nd 1925\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI very much regret having to report that the roof of this building is leaking badly. In one of the girls dormitories two of the beds were soaked through with pools of water on the quilts. In one of the staff bedrooms the drip filled a pail of water in a short time besides soaking other furnishings in the room. It seems a great pity that these conditions should exist after all the money the Department has spent on this building. It is purely and simply bad construction.\n\nIn regard to the windows spoken of in the letter of Claydon Company which I sent you a few days ago:- All winter the wind came in making some of the rooms almost unfit for occupation, and this in spite of heavy fires going all the time, and also in spite of storm windows. To me it seems like nonsense to talk of the number of windows and exposed position etc. such as is spoken of in the Claydon Company letter. There is no excuse for rattling windows and cold rooms in a modern building such as this is supposed to be. If there is any remedy for these conditions I would be glad. It makes me feel rather badly to have to report them.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 16,\n1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter received from the Rev. Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, and I would ask you to give your kind attention to the matters referred to in Mr. Woodsworth's letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Assistant Deputy Secretary,\n\nE. Claydon, Esq.,\nImperial Bank Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, March 16,\n1925.\n\nSir,-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of\na letter received from the Rev. Principal of the\nEdmonton Indian Residential School, and I would\nask you to give your kind attention to the matters\nreferred to in Mr. Woodsworth's letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Assistant Secretary.\n\nE. Claydon, Esq.,\nImperial Bank Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe Indian Residential School, Edmonton\n\nYour letter of March 16th enclosing copy of letter from the Principal of the School, received.\n\nWe do not believe there is any trouble at this building which could be regarded as a liability under our contract. We set out to Mr. Woodsworth what we believe is the cause of the trouble, and still believe this to be correct.\n\nWith reference to his complaint about draught from the windows, it is impossible to avoid this in a room where there are five sets of sash hung. They cannot be made airtight if they are loose enough to operate. Likewise the storm sash are fastened with hardware designed to facilitate easy handling. They are rather large, and it was desired that they be so arranged to enable caretaker, or whoever handles them, to put them on without using a ladder. This cannot be done if the sash are made tight enough to resist wind pressure finding its way past them.\n\nWe cannot at this time add anything to our suggestion to Mr. Woodsworth. We believe all these items have been covered in our correspondence with Mr. Orr.\n\nIn order to more fully cover, if possible, and in an endeavour to assist the Department, we have written to a reliable mechanic, who was employed by us on the building, and set forth to him everything we can think of for him to investigate and go over so that we can make another report to you.\n\nAs soon as we hear from him we shall at once communicate with you, as we are most anxious to co-operate with the Department in dealing with the situation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nApril 2nd, 1925.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth\nEdmonton Indian Residential School\nCity.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn thinking over the hot water supply at your School Building, we believe that another tank with a capacity of 295 gallons, size 30 inches by 8 ft. long, would fill your requirements. This new tank with that already installed would require a tank heater with a capacity of 600 gallons and we are pleased to quote you as follows:\n\nOne only galvanized tank 30\" diameter, 8 ft. long, fitted with galvanized iron steam coil and man hole in head of tank, Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00).\n\nOne only tank heater with a capacity of 600 gallons One Hundred and Forty Five Dollars ($145.00).\n\nYours truly\n\nThe Standard Heating & Plumbing Co., Ltd.\nPer [Signature]\nSecty-Treas.\nThe cost of this tank installed will be about $150.\n\nI would appreciate very much if the Department would authorize the principal to purchase this boiler at once.\n\nSince writing the above Mr. Woodsworth has thrown me the enclosed letter which I think the best should see.\n\nT.V.\nApril 14th\n\nThe Secretary Department\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to bring the attention of the department to the need of some change in heating water throughout the Edmonton Institute. The method adopted at present is to heat it from the steam plant which heats the building. This consumption of fuel is not objectionable when a fire is required for heating the building. Now what? The building will not need heat by the furnace. It is very desirable that the boiler be installed with a capacity to heat 600 gal of water. We are not sure that the hot water tank has sufficient volume. This heating would take care of more of the expenses.\n\nJ. Van Wyck\nManager\nOttawa, April 28, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, who has lately visited the Edmonton Indian Residential School, has drawn to my attention the need for equipment for the heating of water in that institution. You are authorized to purchase and have installed in the basement a hot water jacket heater, \"Mogul T-32\" or equal, capacity 600 gallons. You are also authorized to purchase and connect with the kitchen range an 80 gallon hot water tank and water front. Please be guided by the regulations governing purchases.\n\nThis action should receive your early attention, as there is no method of heating water when the furnaces for heating the building are no longer in use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, April 28, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the need for supplementary water heating at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.

He recommended the installation of a two unit three and six K.W. Lister equipment at a cost of $4,000 installed. The Reverend Mr. Ferrier, who was recently in the office, mentioned that he understood that Edmonton was extending their electric lines to within two miles of the school. I, therefore, wired Mr. Graham on receipt of his telegram to make inquiries regarding this extension and wire me. I received a telegram from him stating that the matter of extension had been dropped. I then wired Mr. Graham advising him that the cost of the 8 K.W. Lister outfit that was lost in the fire was $3,669, completely installed, and suggested that the plant should be smaller if possible in order to keep the cost to a minimum. I have now received a telegram as follows:\n\n\"Proposed lighting plant vastly superior to original one being a two unit which means greater economy in operation which is essential; capacity cannot be cut down. Lister has practically given us one thousand dollars below regular price.

The laundry was last visited by a member of the staff at 10:45, who reports that she found everything in good order, and that there was no fire in the store nor had been for six hours previous.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a snapshot that was taken of the wreck, and would point out that the insides of the walls will have to be taken down almost entirely, as well as the cross walls. The outside wall which you see will have to be taken down in some places two or three feet. Under the cornicing there is considerable damage done and this will take considerable to put in good repair.\n\nI am leaving for Hobbema in a few minutes and perhaps will go from there to Onion Lake before returning to Regina. I will report to you further how the work is progressing when I return.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nI arrived here on Wednesday morning and went out to the School at once. I found that the Laundry and Engine Room were completely gone, nothing but the walls standing, and most of these will have to be taken down as they are badly burnt. I made a thorough examination of the Laundry equipment and Engines and am thoroughly convinced that nearly everything will have to be replaced. Fortunately, I met C.A. Lister, President of the Lister Lighting Company here - in fact he waited here over a day to meet me. He had with him an expert on machinery and they convinced me beyond doubt that the plant was a complete loss, and that it would take more to rebuild it and put it in shape than it would buy a new one at the cost at which he was prepared to supply the Department with one. I wired you submitting the price which was $4,000. This is, therefore, $1,000 less than it would cost the Department had they been buying through the regular channels. Of course this means installed so that the Department would be put to no additional cost for this work. The proposed machine is to be a two unit one, three and six K.W.\n\nAs for the laundry machinery: It is just possible that the Flatwork Ironer can be rebuilt, but this remains to be seen. I am having an expert look over this machine and anything else that might be worth while fixing. Of one thing I am sure, and that is that the Washers are completely gone and I have taken it upon myself to order one of the same make that was destroyed, and have succeeded in borrowing a small engine which will operate this machine as soon as it arrives from Toronto, which should be in the course of ten days.\n\nAs for lighting, the Lister Company have loaned me a small engine that they had here, and I intend having this put up in the furnace room by tonight and we will then have lights on in the building.\n\nI brought from Regina with me Henry George, whom we have had in our employ all last summer, and he is now at work with four men, and I expect in about two weeks' time we will have the building covered in and perhaps in three weeks' time completed. I may say for your information that the building can be considered a complete loss from the ground up, and it would be easier to put up a new building than to take down and rebuild, which we are forced to do.\nlack of it and the fire department saved the situation. The members of the staff and the neighbors also did splendid work in checking the fire with buckets of water.\n\nIn regard to the cause of the fire I am completely at a loss to account for it. There is a little laundry stove in the laundry. This was allowed to die down about eleven o'clock in the morning. After this the matron was in the laundry for another hour, leaving everything neat and clean and in order. Another of the ladies was in after this and noted the order of everything. About five o'clock in the afternoon, the engineer was in the laundry and did not note anything wrong. At eleven o'clock in the evening two of the men went to see that the lighting plant was in order and found everything in good shape. The only thing that I can think of is that electric wires in some way ignited something, or that something was smouldering for a long time unnoticed, or that mice ignited matches in some clothes. I cannot see how it could start unless from such causes.\n\nI look for Mr. Graham tomorrow.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. F. Woodworth,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\nMay 4th 1925.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nYesterday I sent a wire to Dr. Scott informing him of the fire which broke out in the engine room and laundry. The engine room contains the lighting plant. These departments are pretty well destroyed although it is possible that something may be salvaged from the machinery which may be of some value. The walls of the building are in good shape, so that the actual damage to the building is not very great. The windows of the chapel which rises just next to the laundry were burned away, but this is all the damage that was done to the main building. The water system is not injured nor any other part of the school, so we are able to carry on as usual with the exception of our light and laundry. The light at this time of year is not a very serious matter as far as school life goes. We will be able to continue our laundry operations with tubs for the present. The fire broke out sometime after midnight. When we were aroused it had been burning for some time. The children were got out in good order and no one is any the worse.\n\nAfter I was able to size up the situation, I was convinced that the school could be saved and put in a call for the Edmonton Fire Department. They responded in splendid shape and were able to save the school from total destruction. I give the fire department great credit for their work. Our own fire protection was as we expected absolutely useless, that is the water protection. We soon used up the fire extinguishers, and were then helpless. No water reserve whatever. The wind, or\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of May 9th, 1925, No. 110-0-5A, in which you state that as the interim appropriation has all been exhausted, it will be impossible at the present time to send accountable advance for labour in connection with building operations at the Edmonton School, I have to say that I am today advancing the required amount from War Appropriation Funds here, as it is absolutely necessary to have money now to pay the carpenters etc., who are at work there.

Woodsworth, Esq.,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nEDMONTON, Alta.\nWhen I visited the Edmonton School a short time ago, the Principal complained to me about the windows, claiming that the frames were very badly put in and were not filled in up to the brick; that you could feel the draft blowing in under the sills three to four feet away. I looked into the matter myself and I found such to be the case. There was a space of an inch between the tile and the frame of the sash and the brick also.\n\nMy own opinion is that it will end in all the sash having to be taken out before a good job can be made. I do not know that the specifications called for this filling in, but even if they did not it was the duty of the Building Inspector to see that it was done if he knew his business. My opinion is that he did not know his business at all, and the Department cannot expect to get much for $6.00 a day when we are paying ordinary carpenters $8.00. It seems to me that on important jobs of this kind we cannot be too particular in getting number one men to supervise the work. I have recommended a man as Inspector for the Onion Lake School, but this particular man happens to be unfitted for heavy work; however, we cannot always get this class of man as Inspector.\n\nThere/\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThere is another matter I wish to bring to your attention, and that is the inadequate water supply for fire protection at the Edmonton School, and it seems to me that we should sink another well at this institution and put in a force pump halfway between the school and the stable. This could connect with the line that leads between the present pumphouse and the school, so that in the event of one well giving out the other could be brought into action. The second well could also look after the requirements of the school. I consider this a very important matter. With three or four hundred children in a place of this kind we cannot be too careful.\n\nI would also suggest to the Department that a night watchman be put on at this institution. We have this at Qu'Appelle School, and it seems to me that Elkhorn, Gordon's, Duck Lake, Edmonton, the two schools on the Blackfoot Reserve, and the two on the Blood reserve should have some kind of a patrol once or twice during the night.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

H. Weaver, well contractor, for $10.00.\n\nSome time ago we found that the well head was leaking badly not only wasting the water but causing considerable inconvenience. As this was a job for an expert workman I asked Mr. Weaver who had put in the well to superintend the job. We had all ready and supplied whatever labor was necessary. He and his man spent all day on the job. So the charge is very reasonable.\n\nYours Truly;\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nJune 5, 1925.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Pratt,\n\nWith reference to your request over the telephone yesterday, asking for a report regarding the repairs to the Edmonton school, necessitated by the fire in the laundry building and machinery-room, I beg to inclose herewith copies of my memoranda to the Minister of May 5 and 7, copy of letter from the Principal of the school and copy of report from Commissioner Graham, after he had visited the school. On approval by the Minister of my memorandum of the 7th ultimo, we wired Commissioner Graham as follows:\n\n\"You may arrange installation of Lister two unit equipment. Forward full report of damage with estimate of cost of repairs earliest possible date. Approve your action re repairs.\"\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nEquip Your Plant to Fight Fire!\n\nIf Fire attacked Your Plant to-day would you be Prepared?\n\nIn 1921 there were 25,916 fires throughout the Dominion. Property to the value of $45,015,930 was destroyed. Scores of workmen were thrown out of work, many were killed or injured. This condition is serious. Canada's fire loss is far too high. Something must be done.\n\nTo plant owners and business men who want their interests safeguarded from loss by fire the\n\nNATIONAL CHEMICAL FIRE ENGINE\n\noffers safe, sure and dependable service. It requires but little space, is easily moved about and has a fire extinguishing efficiency many times that of plain water.\n\nNo place too difficult or inaccessible to be reached with this apparatus. It is always ready for immediate service and is easily handled by one man. In addition the use of chemicals saves water damage which sometimes results in more damage than the fire. From standpoint of service, this is the least expensive type of fire extinguishing apparatus as the chemical charges are easily and economically obtained at any drug store.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES OF THE NATIONAL CHEMICAL FIRE ENGINE\n\n1. Has a capacity of about 40 Gallons of Chemical Solution.\n2. Carries a large Carbonic Acid Gas which acts as a blanket and spreads over a wide area\u2014often getting where water cannot reach and thus extinguishes a concealed fire.\n3. Requires no attention when not in use; costs practically nothing to maintain.\n4. The cylinder is made from the highest grade metal and coated with special metals to prevent corrosion. The head and bottom are made from special non-ferrous metals and so designed that the pressure is equally distributed throughout.\n5. The fittings are made from selected stock.\n6. The acid receptacle is made of de-silverized lead so as to be acid proof and is covered with sheet copper to prevent external injury.\n7. The wheels and smith work are standard in every respect.\n8. The Engines are tested at the factory to 350 lbs. hydrostatic pressure.\n9. 50 feet of best four ply Red Rubber Chemical Hose, tested to 400 lbs. pressure, with heavy brass couplings of tail and shank type with heavy brass clamps, are part of the equipment with each engine.\n10. Directions for operating are clearly given on embossed brass plate attached to each engine.\n11. Tread outside to outside of tires at ground, 40 inches.\n12. Space occupied when not in use (stands on end) approximately 50 x 50 inches.\n13. Weight empty\u2014approximately 340 lbs. Weight full\u2014approximately 870 lbs.\n14. Operating apparatus is placed in service by pulling it over on the wheels\u2014wheeling to the desired location, lowering handle and upper end of tank to ground\u2014opening valve on tank cap\u2014removing hose from hanger and bringing the nozzle into operative position.\n\nList Price $600.00\n\nMade By\n\nTHE NATIONAL MANUFACTURING CO.\n\nBROCKVILLE :: ONTARIO\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nC. REGINA, SASK., May 26th, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI wrote you fully on May 18th concerning the inadequate water supply for fire protection at the Edmonton School, and suggested that another well be sunk at this institution.\n\nIn addition to the above we should have a chemical plant installed at this point. I am enclosing herewith a pamphlet of equipment made by the National Manufacturing Company of Brockville, Ontario. The outfit shown therein seems to me to be just what is required at this school. It could be placed in one end of the main corridor and drawn to any part of the building; if necessary, it could be taken out of the building. I believe if we had had proper fire protection, the losses in the recent fire would not have amounted to $1200.00. In fact I am quite sure of it. I would therefore ask you to consider the matter of providing adequate equipment for this institution at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C.

Davies, Esq.,\nChief, Fire Dept.\nCity of Edmonton.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI responded to the fire call from the Indian Residential School at 1:49 A.M. May 3rd, there was a slough about a quarter of a mile away and finding we could approach near enough to use same I immediately called for No. 2 Pumper and we were thus able to extinguish the fire. The fire started in the Laundry Room. I found a coal heater in that room but as Mr. Woodsworth informs me that there was no fire in the heater that day I am of the opinion the fire started from a short circuit in the dynamo and possibly ignited the gasoline fumes. I would suggest that when rebuilding \"The Dynamo and Gas Motor be kept in separate rooms of fireproof construction with metal doors and metal sash on windows, and that no stove of any description be in the same room as gas motor on account of the fumes; No switch should be in same as dynamo and gas motor.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.)

I would not send any apparatus without someone being responsible for the charges the City makes and after a few minutes Mr. Woodsworth again phoned me and stated he would be responsible for the charges. I then dispatched No. 1 Combination and five men and the Deputy Chief and his Car, the Deputy phoned in that water was available from a Slough about a quarter of a mile away and I then dispatched No. 2 Pumper with eight Men.

I made thorough inquiry into the question of services rendered by this Fire Department and may say that I am convinced that it was through their help that the main part of the school was saved, as the cornices had already caught fire and the water system in connection with the school had given out. I take pleasure, therefore, in recommending the payment of this account.\n\nI enclose herewith copies of letters received from the Chief of the Fire Department and his Deputy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I wish to thank you for your assistance and have to state that a cheque is being directed to you under separate cover.\n\nI should be grateful if you would visit the school and make a report on the fire fighting equipment already installed in the building and offer a recommendation concerning what further apparatus should be supplied. It has been suggested that two 40-gallon \"National Chemical Fire Engines,\" made by the National Manufacturing Company, of Brockville, be purchased. Please let me have your opinion as to the value of this suggestion.\n\nPlease submit an account in duplicate covering your services in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Ferrier  \nSuperintendent of Methodist  \nIndian Schools and Hospitals in Canada\n\nBrandon, June 27th, 1925.\n\nThe Secretary,  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs,  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe fire at the Edmonton School revealed the condition of the outside frames of the windows and doors.\n\nThe window frames have not been properly plastered or pointed up. The frames themselves are set back from the brick veneer. In some cases the brick moulding does not even cover the entire space. The result is the air freely enters around the brick moulding and circulates freely behind the bricks. Thus the space between the brick veneer and the hollow tile, instead of being a dead air space, causes air to circulate freely around the entire building, except where the bricks may be close to the walls. Consequently the air enters the building in strong drafts around every outside window and door.\n\nThis must be remedied before we attempt to heat the building another winter. It can be done by removing the brick moulding and the inside casing from all outside windows and doors and properly plastering and pointing up the space. Why this was not done by the contractor and executed by the inspector when constructed is beyond my comprehension.\n\nFrom the experience the management had in the new Cocual-sleetza School at Sardis, during the severe weather last winter, I feel sure that this same condition prevails in all the outside windows and doors and the same remedy must be applied to this building before the coming winter.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPer GHD\n6th July, 1925.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI beg to quote as follows from a letter received regarding the conditions of the outside door and window frames at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, recently constructed by your firm:\n\n\"The fire at the Edmonton School revealed the condition of the outside frames of the windows and doors.\n\nThe window frames have not been properly plastered or pointed up.

Ltd. and myself, re the heating system at the Coqualeetza Institute. When you have read this you might return it to me in Toronto, if it reaches there before the 3rd of October, otherwise send it to Brandon.\n\nI would like to have discussed with you personally the great need of outside window and door frames for the Coqualeetza Institute and also for the Edmonton schools. This must be attended to before the cold weather sets in. I think a great deal of the trouble is due to the fact that the air flows so freely around the outside window frames and door frames, also that from the outside the air travels without obstruction except at the corners, between the outside brick and the tile keeping the walls constantly cold. If the outside moulding is taken off and the space filled up it will, to a certain extent, remedy the situation in both these buildings.\n\nWill you kindly see to this at your very earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Nov. 24, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter regarding the difficulty in heating the Education School, due to leakage of cold air around the windows, I would ask you to please obtain and submit to the Department a price for the caulking of the window frames with rubber. There is another process of sealing window frames, which has proved very successful in the East, that is by a paste of asbestos, asphalt and a small amount of tar, and which is manufactured by the Burford Co. It is applied with a machine called a gun. This machine applies the paste under pressure, and the piano is placed between the junction of the brick stop and the brick, and is very effective in excluding the air. It might be advisable if you can make inquiries among contracting firms in Ontario to see if this material and process is known there, as I think it would be more effective than caulking the frames. If a firm can be located who can do this work please obtain a price from them and submit same to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy\nand Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe INDIAN SCHOOL, EDENSTON, Ref. 110-0-5.\n\nFollowing our letter of July 9th, 1925, we now submit our final conclusion on matters referred to in your communication of July 6th and to Mr. Maclean's letter of March 16th, 1925.\n\nAs previously reported, we have had a thorough investigation made respecting the complaints made by the Principal, which we find are based on three general items:\n\n1. Draught through and around outside doors and windows.\n2. Leak in roof due to broken slates.\n3. Moisture in walls, presumably from gutters.\n\nMr. Woolsworth's report is not very flattering to us as contractors. We do not think, however, that anyone with a knowledge of the building industry would substantiate his reflection of blame against us. We will deal with the items in the order they are named above:\n\n1. It may be true there may be considerable leakage of air between sash and frame, and some between frames and brickwork. As stated before, it is impossible to provide against such things unless special provisions are made, which result in additional cost. Sash must be made loose enough to work without friction. The Edmonton building was so fitted. It is impossible to leave sash and doors in such a condition that no adjustment is necessary. The work was finished in the Fall, the dampest time of the year, and it is to be expected that both sash and frames have by this time settled into a condition of permanence. A general tightening up of\nthe window stops will do much to lessen the amount of draught. We would suggest, however, if more than this is required, it will be necessary to fit weather-stripping to the windows. This is the established practice of the Winnipeg School Board. All their buildings are weather-stripped, as it is realised that on windows not so treated leakage of air cannot be prevented.\n\nWith regard to air finding its way around frames, this is a feature that can scarcely be termed bad or even faulty construction. A certain amount of shrinkage is absolutely unavoidable, and, in addition to this, the construction of the walls, namely, a veneer of brick on hollow tile, makes it harder to provide a draught-proof connection without going to greater cost than is called for by contract.\n\nWhere more preventative measures are required, they are specified generally under one of the following heads:\n\nThe removal of brick-moulds and pointing by:\n(a) Ordinary mortar,\n(b) Takum packing, covered by mortar,\n(c) Sealing of apertures between frame and brickwork by Elastigum or other plastic substance.\n\nAll of these provisions cost money; nothing of the kind is asked for in our Specifications. We left a standard piece of work fully complying with the Contract. The fact that more is required to suit the Principal does not justify him in attributing his trouble to \"bad construction,\" etc. We are sure you will understand that competition in the building trade in Western Canada leaves no margin whatever for performance of work not specified, however much it is otherwise desirable that it be furnished.\n\nWe should be pleased to weather-strip all the windows and outside doors on the building for the sum of \u00a31,973, and if it is desired to remove brickmoulds and point spaces behind them, to do this on a cost-plus basis.\n\n2: The roof leaks are due to slates broken by hail or frost. All of them are due to breakages in valleys or where two surfaces meet at opposed planes. This may be caused in several ways:\n\n(a) Snow on roof melting in sunlight, and freezing after sun's rays have disappeared, and so repeating daily until an accumulation of ice is formed under edges of slates, and at edge of each surface.\n\n(b) Action of frost.\n\n(c) Hail.\n\nWe find the asbestos slates or shingles are extremely brittle in very cold weather, and like natural slate gives trouble under similar conditions. We followed makers' instructions implicitly. From twenty years' experience and actual observation\nin building work in the West, we find that wherever slate is used there is trouble from winter breakage from one source or another. There is no doubt that asbestos slates as used at Edmonton are in same category; in fact, we think they are not as efficient as slates under our climatic conditions. We could quote many Western authorities in support of statement that asbestos or slate shingles are not proof against damage by winter. This refers to valleys and such places where different planes meet in such a way as to hold snow and ice.\n\n(3): The moisture on walls appears to be due to a frost-burst gutter through ice formation, or to ice blocking conductor pipe. It is not attributable to any departure or omission of work that is required by contract.\n\nFrom the foregoing, we submit that matters complained of by the Principal are due to causes outside of our responsibility under contract. We feel convinced a fair appraisal of the situation by the Department will confirm our statements.\n\nIn September or August, 1924, we did some work on the Tower for the Department, and at that time we had our men go over the roof and take care of any small items they could find which needed attention.\n\nMay we ask that balance outstanding and due us on this Contract be paid? It is two years since building was taken over, and we should appreciate having final payment, which is really needed by us at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY, LIMITED,\n\n[Signature]\nPresident.\n**THE EDMONTON IRON FENCE AND WIRE WORKS**\n\n**STRUCTURAL IRONWORKERS**\n\nORNAMENTAL IRON FENCES OF EVERY DESIGN, WIRE SCREENS, WIRE SIGNS, FIRE ESCAPES, IRON STAIRS\nELEVATOR ENCLOSURES, BANK AND OFFICE RAILINGS, GENERAL BLACKSMITHING\n\n**TERMS CASH**\n\n| DATE | ARTICLES                                      | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | TOTAL   |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|---------|\n| Jan. 25 | Cutting a Key Hole in a Shaft, labour         |               |              | 10.00   |\n|       | Supplying one Shaft Collar and One Steel Key |               |              | 1.00    |\n|       |                                               |               |              | $11.00  |\n\nO.K.

I trust my action is acceptable to the Department.\n\n2nd- For some time we have had difficulty with our water supply. The stream from the well was very slow and small. It was necessary to pump several hours a day in order to meet our needs. I had Mr. Weaver, the man who installed our pump and drilled the well, come and examine the well. He said the thought it needed new leathers and rubbers so we pulled the pump out, and however it was found that the working parts of the cylinder were badly worn and in order to correct the leak it would be necessary to get a new cylinder. New rubbers and leathers made no difference. This was done and we now have the well in splendid working condition. Pretty much as it was years ago. It has worked six years now on the first cylinder and the sand and grit has badly worn the parts. I trust my action is approved by the Department. It was the only thing to do.\n\nI may say in regard to well matters, that we should have another well before long. For both house and farm requirements it is too great a tax on the one well. I believe Mr. Commissioner Graham has taken this matter up with the Department before now. We have a splendid well and a good system but it is not enough. I was talking the matter over with Mr. Weaver, and he said another well could be put down close to the one we already have and operated by line shaft.\nfrom the same engine. We have still considerable well piping left from the old well\u2014to go a long way. He says that he knows of a pump jack at the Government farm at Old River which can be purchased very reasonably, we can repair the old cylinder and have a new well for comparatively small cost. If the Department is disposed to consider a new well I shall be glad to give a diagram and prices.\n\n3rd\u2014We are in bad need of a little paint and varnish around the floors and walls. We can do all the work ourselves if we have the material.\n\n4th\u2014We would like to put in a few partitions and make a few changes in some parts of the building. I think V joint would do for the most part. A carpenter would probably be needed for a few days. We would like to put one partition at the boys' stairway. At present the dust and noise from the basement is very annoying. It would also make quite a difference to the drafts which at present exist. I think this would be quite an improvement. We would also like the space behind the basement stairways closed up. These corners form splendid catch-alls and also hiding places. We could use the spaces very well for storing cleaning materials which should be under lock and key. I shall be glad to have permission to go ahead with these changes.\n\n5th\u2014we should have a little plumbing done. A new sink in the room off the staff dining room, and some repairs to the big kitchen range.\n\nI trust that the Department will consider favorably these requests. In spite of their number, the cost will not be very great.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. P. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 23, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, concerning repairs at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Your action in securing a new cylinder for the pump at the well is approved. I should be pleased if you would indicate what materials would be necessary and estimate the cost for the following improvements mentioned in your letter:\n\n1. Painting and varnishing.\n2. Partitions.\n3. New sink for staff dining room.\n4. Repairs to kitchen range.\n\nIt is always advisable to forward estimates of the cost of any improvements or repairs requested.\n\nConcerning the advisability of sinking a second well, I should be pleased if you would forward the diagram and estimate. I am not hopeful that this can be authorized at the present time, as our funds are extremely limited and there is no provision for this purpose in our Main Estimates, 1926-27.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, June 15, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nProvision is made in the current appropriation for an implement shed, a chicken house and for cement and lumber for general repairs at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Please enquire concerning what is required and make arrangements for the activity. You should be guided by the instructions in the Deputy Superintendent General's No. 1-1-5 of yesterday's date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., July 23rd, 1926\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWith reference to your instructions regarding the incurring of expenditures, I wish to quote an extract from a letter received this morning from J. F. Woodsworth, Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, as follows,\n\n\"In a recent letter from Mr. Ferrier, he informed me that there was provision in the budget for fencing and buildings at this school. He also stated that you have instructions to carry out these repairs.\"\n\nI have no authority of this kind, and I think Mr. Ferrier should be so informed. I have instructions to carry out what repairs I think are necessary.\n\nThe Principal goes on to say that there is considerable fencing to be done and posts to be purchased, as they have nothing but willow posts on the place at present. Willow posts are what we are advocating all through our schools, with the occasional cedar posts, and these are what will be used at Edmonton unless I am instructed to the contrary.\n\nI regret that this matter is not yet thoroughly understood by Mr. Ferrier, as it only means trouble and unpleasantness for me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWm. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, August 21st., 1926.\n\nDear Sirs,-\n\nWith reference to cheque No. 5780 sent you on the 3rd February, re Edmonton Residential School, I beg to say that there was an error of $10.00 in your account dated 31st January 1924, Sheet No. 7. The item added $166.13 should have been $156.13. I have therefore to request that you will kindly forward to this Department at an early date your cheque for $10.00 in refund of this overpayment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent.\n\nMessrs. Claydon Co. Ltd.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDUPLICATE, FOR DEPARTMENT.\n\nBank of Montreal,\n\n$10.00\n\nOttawa,\n\nSept. 14th, 1926.\n\nRECEIVED from\n\non account\n\nIndian Funds.\n\nthe sum of Ten 00/100 Dollars,\n\nwhich amount will appear at the RECEIVER GENERAL'S credit with this Bank.\n\nSigned in Triplicate,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnt'd\n\nPro. Manager.\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 17th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that I left here on August 28th, to visit some of the Western Agencies.\n\nEDMONTON SCHOOL, EDMONTON AGENCY.\n\nI found a great improvement in the grounds at this school since my last visit. The Principal has given a great deal of attention to this improvement. The children at this school appear to be quite healthy, and I am told they are advancing well in their classroom work. The building was clean throughout, and everything in the way of machinery was in splendid working order. The Principal would like to have some slight changes made in the main hall. The stairs leading from the main hall to the basement are open, and he would like to have the doors fixed in with a door at the head of the stairs so there is a tremendous amount of draft passing all the time, which makes it almost impossible for us to live during the severe weather. I quite agree that this change should be made. It would not take much money for this work, and if you will give me the necessary authority I will see that it is done. The farm work in connection with this institution is up to its usual standard; it could not be much better. I am told that approximately ten thousand dollars worth of grain was raised here this year.\n\nThe difficulty in recruiting is evident here; there is trouble in getting the children from the Hobbs Agency. Some of the children who attended the Methodist Day School are now attending the Roman Catholic Boarding School, as the parents claimed they were Roman Catholic before they even entered the Day School on the reserve. There were a number of children still on the reserve who should have been in the Edmonton School, and I gave instructions to the Agent to see that they were sent without delay, and these instructions will be carried out.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, October 5th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to that portion of your report of the 17th ultimo on the Edmonton Indian Residential School regarding the request made by the Principal to have some changes made in the main hall, I beg to say that you may incur the expenditure necessary in having the stairs leading from this hall to the basement boxed in with a door at the head of the stairs, in order to prevent draughts passing up and down these stairs and to make the building warmer during severe weather.\n\nNo unnecessary expense should be incurred and as much of the labour as possible should be performed by the school management. Vouchers in the usual manner covering the cost of the material, etc., should be forwarded.\n\nIt is noted that the general conditions at this school are satisfactory and that there has been much improvement in the grounds surrounding the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., November 16th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nUnder cover of Department Numbers 110-0-5 and 110-0-9, both dated the 11th of June, certain expenditures were provided for at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Before the improvements named were commenced, these authorities, together with others, were cancelled and not subsequently renewed and as the expenditures are necessary I shall be glad if the Department will provide for them in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1927-28.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe United Church of Canada\nRev. T. Ferrier\nBrandon - Manitoba\n\nBrandon Industrial School,\nJanuary 14th, 1927.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn my communication to Dr. D. C. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, dated December 14th, 1926, I made a request for a grant of $5,000 for plant at the Edmonton Residential School. The requirements are as follows:\n\n1. Ice House and Cold Storage\n2. Implement Shed\n3. Cottage for the teacher's residence. Mr. and Mrs. Macdonald have charge of the class-rooms. Both are excellent teachers and it is desirable to retain their services. However, I think sleeping quarters provided outside would fill the bill. A portable sleeping cottage can be purchased for about two or three hundred dollars.\n\nSome new fence and general repairs.\n\nWe may not need all of the $5,000.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nAcknowledged\n\n[Signature]\n\nJAN 21 1927\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing vouchers Nos. 305 to 307. No. 306, in favour of the Brew Machine Company, for $56.15, covering an emergency repair to the pump; No. 306, in favour of the Norwood Foundry Company, for $15.00, covering emergency repairs to the kitchen range; and No. 307, in favour of Reed & Turnbull, for $35.85, covering emergency repairs to the furnace in the Principal's residence - are being paid. Vouchers Nos. 303 and 304, which are returned herewith, are for minor repairs and the amounts are inconsiderable. These should either be paid by the school management from the per capita or other earnings or you should adopt the plan in use at certain other Indian residential schools where the department endeavours to pay for all unavoidable repairs to the mechanical plant. The practice referred to is to deal with one plumber, one electrician, one hardware, one lumber firm for a stated period and, at the end of each quarter, submit certified accounts in duplicate from these firms, covering the materials and services supplied and rendered during the three months period. It is not necessary for me to point out that this method is preferable to a continual stream of accounts from various firms, all for small amounts. When the quarterly accounts are being forwarded, you should exercise care so that no items are included which should properly be met from the per capita grant.\n\nIn order that this letter may be a more complete writing concerning the Department's wishes relative to accounts, may I remind you that authority for expenditures other than minor ones should be secured from the Department before purchase, except in emergencies. You should secure competitive prices from the best available local sources when making purchases which involve expenditures of more than Fifteen or Twenty Dollars.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.

Edmonton Agency #310 amounting to $3.94 in favour of The Edmonton Paint and Glass Company, Ltd. for putting partitions in stairways Indian Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 110-0-5 dated October 6th, 1926.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 1\nDear Sir;\n\nThe Rev.T. Perrier, Inspector of Indian Schools, under the United Church, wrote me from your office while in Ottawa regarding the carking of the windows of this school. He asked me to write you regarding the mode of repair.\n\nI have a good contractor who has done work for us here, and whose judgment I trust. He says that he can make a very thorough job of the windows and completely stop the draft by taking out the inside frames and filling the space between the brick and the casings with plaster. Yesterday he took one of the windows out and showed me what was necessary and I am convinced it is right. This will not necessitate removing the brick mould nor the windows from the outside which would be a very long and costly job. He states that neither caulk nor gun composition would be satisfactory, which I think is correct. This man could start in right away and fix these windows up at a cost of $2.50 per window; this will include labor and material. I would strongly recommend that this work be done at once. The man is free just now but intends soon to take other work when the spring opens up. An immediate reply will be appreciated.\n\nI enclose a sketch of the portion of the window to be filled with plaster. At present there is little or no filling at the windows and the wind and air has free access to the rooms. The wonder is that we have been able to keep the building warm during these winter months.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodworth,\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nApril 8, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThere has been considerable correspondence regarding the windows of the Edmonton Indian Residential School. It appears that shrinkage is responsible for considerable draught and, in a high wind in the coldest months, it is extremely difficult to keep parts of the building at all comfortable. The Church authorities and the Rev. Principal have been in correspondence with the Department as to what remedial action can be taken. There is now a recommendation that the inside frames be taken out and the space between the brick and the casing filled with plaster. A local conscientious man, in whose judgment the Rev. Principal has confidence and who has done work at the school before, offers to undertake the work at a cost of $2.50 per window. This will include labour and material. Mr. Orr recommends that this offer be accepted.\n\nThere are some 250 windows and the cost of this improvement will be approximately $625. In view of the urgency of the matter, I wish to recommend that you give your authority. I have lately learned that $1000, which will be voted for an improvement at the Fort Simpson Indian Residential School, will not be expended this year, so funds will be available.

Ferrier\nBrandon - Manitoba\n\nBrandon Industrial School,\nApril 11th, 1927.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose you a statement and plan prepared by Mr. Woodworth showing the cost of material and what labor required to build a cottage for the farming instructor at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, the total being $5,000. This looks to be a very reasonable estimate. I have the figures submitted by different firms of the bulk of the material required. If necessary I can send these on to the Department.\n\nA reply at your earliest convenience regarding the construction of this building will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.

There is an item of $1,600 for an ice house and cold storage, which has also been requested by the church authorities.\n\nThere is an item of $5,000 for a double classroom at the Morley Indian Residential School, which is under the same auspices. I understand that the church authorities consider the cottage at Edmonton as more urgent. It might be advisable to get Mr. Commissioner Graham's recommendation as to which of the two buildings should be erected this year. I shall be pleased to have your instructions in the matter.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 12, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nFive thousand dollars is available for the erection of a double classroom at the Morley Indian Residential School. The Church authorities have represented that, equally desirable this year, if not more so, is a farmer's cottage at our school at Edmonton. I wish to arrive at a decision as to which building should be erected this year. Please make the necessary enquiries and let me have a recommendation at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, May 12, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th ultimo, with reference to the advisability of erecting a cottage for the farmer at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. There are no funds for this specific purpose and I am writing to Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham of Regina, asking for his opinion as to the relative urgency of this building and the double classroom for the Morley school. When his reply is received, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

I have a quotation from a local firm to furnish them F.O.B. our siding at .75\u00a2 per 7' tamarack post. There are about 1100 or 1200 posts to the car. We are badly in need of more general fencing. We have not had any new for some time beyond hog fencing, and some of our outside fences are in bad shape. That is the fences which were never done. I would also like some wire (page). We also require nails and staples.\n\nAuthority to make the necessary purchase will oblige.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, May 12, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to fencing materials for the Edmonton Indian Residential School. You may purchase 1200 tamarack posts at 15\u00a2 each, f. o. b. the school siding. You may also expend a small sum in the purchase of Page wire and nails and staples. I take it for granted that the price of 15\u00a2 per post is the best you can secure at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, #110-0-5 informing me that five thousand dollars is available for the erection of a double classroom at the Morley Indian Residential School, but that the Church authorities have represented that equally desirable this year, if not more so, is a Farmer's cottage at the Edmonton Industrial School.\n\nI am of the opinion that the erection of the cottage at the Edmonton School should be proceeded with this year, as I think they can get along at Morley very well under the present arrangements for another year. I think, however, that this cottage should be put up for four thousand dollars at the outside. I note that it is referred to as a Farmer's cottage. We have a residence for the Farming Instructor there now so that this cottage is probably for an extra member of the staff. The school authorities should freight every bit of the material gratis and I do not think it necessary to put in a full size basement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMay 25, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nWith reference to your 409-11 A of the 18th instant, I should be grateful if you would let me have your opinion as to the advisability of putting the erection of the cottage at the Edmonton Indian Residential School entirely in the hands of the school management. There has been forwarded to the Department a detailed estimate and an architect's drawing. If you consider the Rev. Mr. Woodsworth can undertake this activity, using as much of the school labour as possible, I should be glad to send him the necessary authority.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\n\nMay 26th 1927\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nHerewith please find enclosed a picture for your information, of the one of the windows as left by the contractor and which we are having repaired, by the authority of the Department. This is a sample window. It is no wonder that we could not keep warm. In fact it is a wonder that there is any heat in the building whatever.\n\nI find that the outside of the windows are very open and admit of a great deal of cold. Just as bad as the inside. I have given instructions to the carpenter to fill up some of these windows on the outside. This will probably cost about $50 for a window more, but it will make the job fairly complete. After a good deal of consideration I decided that this was necessary as there was nothing to stop the wind from getting all around the brick work and for an extra $50 I am sure it will be worth while. I request the permission of the Department to this extra. It will not be more than about $50.00 extra.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. P. Woodsworth.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 2nd, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing a photo of one of the windows of the Edmonton Indian Residential School as left by the contractor, and requesting authority to expend $50 in excess of the amount authorized in official letter of April 16th, last, in having the windows fixed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of this extra expenditure of $50 in order to stop the draft that enters the building between the brick work and the window casing. This will make the total amount allowed towards the cost of this work $3 per window.\n\nWhen the work is completed, you should forward an account as requested in the letter above referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I note the Department has a detailed estimate and an architect's drawing and I shall be glad if you will let me have a copy of the former and a blue print of the latter.\n\nI think it advisable that the work should be done under the supervision of the Department as the amount set aside and the plan should be definite and leave no room for doubt or variation. I am of the opinion that what is required ought to be erected for a sum of about $3000.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M.

I am enclosing an architect's drawing, which will show just what the school management has in mind. The following estimate of the cost has been secured by the Rev.

Fraser & Co. Ltd., for Tobacco Posts.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 110-0-5 dated May 12th, 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B. Woodsworth\nIndian Agent, Principal\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have your 110-0-5 of the 5th instant with reference to the proposed residence at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, enclosing an architect's drawing and giving an estimate of the cost, and I am of the opinion that the Department should not be called upon to erect a house such as is asked for. The suggestion of Mr. Woodsworth is that the house which is at present occupied by the Farmer, Mr. Goodland, and which is perhaps a better house than eighty per cent of our Farmers have and better than many of our agency houses, be abandoned by the present occupant and used as a dwelling for a married farm labourer whom it is proposed shall be employed instead of a single man, and that the proposed new building be given to the Farmer. I am utterly opposed to this. As I have said, the Farmer has a good house and if living quarters are required for a married labourer a simple cottage of the bungalow type might be built at a cost of $3500.00 at the outside and perhaps less if the school will supply the labour which they proposed putting into the house which is now asked for. It is unbelievable that a request of this kind should be made and I am quite satisfied that if the Minister or the Deputy Minister could see the building which is now occupied by Mr. Goodland they would agree that a new residence for the Farmer is quite unnecessary. As for having the school authorities undertake the work, I have already expressed the opinion that it would be a mistake to do this. There has been a great deal of talk going on at Edmonton ever since the outbuildings at this school were erected, and I think to delegate any additional work to the school authorities would be bound to cause comments.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nbarn at this school which was erected by the school authorities and paid for by the Department is one of the most expensive barns in the province of Alberta. The other outbuildings were also more costly than they should have been and the Department did not get anything like value for the money which they spent.\n\nIf the Department wish me to have a Labourer's cottage erected will you kindly instruct me and I will see that it is done.\n\nArchitect's drawing enclosed with your letter is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, July 16, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of April 11th, I have now to inform you that Mr. Commissioner Graham recommends that a cottage for a married labourer be erected at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, at a cost not exceeding $3,500. He considers that the classroom at Morley is not as urgent as this other building. I should add that the Commissioner considers the present farm instructor's home as quite suitable for the purpose and he does not recommend the erection of a building as shown on the sketch you forwarded, which, along with the estimate, is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nInspector,\nIndian Schools & Hospitals,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nBrandon, Man.\nJuly 20th,\n\nRev. Joseph Woodsworth,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Woodsworth:\n\nRe home for your farming instructor:\n\nMy own thought is that a cottage not exceeding $3,500 or $4,000 at the most is about all we should expect from the Department. If this money is spent for material and some skilled labor, together with the labor contributed by the school, ought to contract a house worth about $6,000 in the city of Edmonton. This suggestion is in harmony with the policy I have always pursued in the construction of out-buildings in connection with our residential schools, viz., the Department furnishes the material and the management the labor. If you are not prepared to furnish the greater part of the labor and the whole is let by contract you will have a much inferior house.\n\nIn any case, the enclosed plan is more expensive than I would feel justified in asking the Department for. I am addressing a letter to the Department at Ottawa and enclosing you a copy of the same. No doubt you will hear from Mr. Graham in due time. I trust the arrangement will be made whereby you will be able to make a large contribution in the way of labor provided by the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGRD\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nInspector of Indian Schools and Hospitals\nChurch of Canada.\n\nBrandon, Man. July 20th, 1927.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe matter of the necessity of a home as a farmer's residence at Edmonton was brought to my attention on a recent visit to the residential school there.\n\nIt is very difficult to secure suitable farm help of the kind required, from a single man. If a home is provided a much more permanent arrangement can be made. It was suggested to me that the new building be provided suitable for the head farming instructor and the present house occupied by Mr. Goodland, be used for his assistant. In this suggestion, I concur. I am enclosing you a copy of a letter I am sending to Mr. Woodsworth on this matter.\n\nIf this meets with the approval of the Department would you kindly give Mr. Graham, Indian Commissioner, all necessary instructions.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nGRD\nJuly 29, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nFunds are available for the erection of a farmer's residence at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Mr. Commissioner Graham recommends that he be authorized to erect a building which will be suitable for the farm instructor's assistant. He estimates the expenditure at $3500.\n\nThe Superintendent of United Church Indian Schools and the Reverend Principal at Edmonton are anxious of erecting a better and bigger residence. They have submitted plans with a full estimate of the cost, showing that approximately $5000 will be the expenditure. They are prepared to erect this building, using school labour, if the Department will pay the bills for the material and a little expert labour to the amount of $3500. The reason for this proposal is that they wish to have a new building for the present farm instructor, Mr. Goodland, who has been at Indian residential schools under the United Church for about 20 years. The assistant farm instructor, for whom a residence is needed, would then move into Mr. Goodland's present home.\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham is opposed to this proposal. He considers that the home in which Mr. Goodland is now living is quite satisfactory. He suggests that the Department authorize him to erect a labourer's cottage and he will keep the cost below $3500.\n\nPersonally, I believe it advisable to cooperate with the various school managements in the matter of erection of outbuildings. If they will provide all the rough labour and hauling, our outbuilding programme will be less expensive than if the work is done directly by the Department. In this particular instance, each scheme means an expenditure of $3500; but the church's proposal means a better building. Please let me have your instructions.\n\nDuncan C.

A.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\n\nREGINA, SASK., Sept. 26th, 1927\n\nDear Sir:\n\nActing on instructions contained in your letter No. 403-11A M, dated the 16th instant, I proceeded to the Edmonton Indian Residential School and made a careful survey of the building, and beg to submit the following report:\n\nFIRE ESCAPES:\n\nThere are at present two fire escapes situated at the back end of the main building. These are iron stairways reached from a window in a staff room at each end of the hall, and terminating about six feet from the ground. In case of fire, the children would have to cross a hall from their dormitories and pass through a staff room, and in the event of these staff room doors being locked there would be no means of reaching the escapes. It is, in my opinion, a very poor and inadequate arrangement.\n\nThe building comprises a basement, first floor, second floor and attic, and there are four dormitories\u2014two at each end on the second floor. I would suggest that a fire escape be provided for each of the four dormitories. Before leaving Edmonton I ascertained that there could be built by the Edmonton Iron Fence and Fire Works Company, I am attaching hereto a sketch of a single fire escape, and one section of each would be fitted with poles from the ground to the bottom of window sill is 34 feet. The fire escape would consist of an iron platform 2'6\" wide by 8' long. This platform would have an iron railing around it 3 ft. high, and would be attached to the side of the building flush with the bottom of the window sill, using screws to the wall with heads 6\" x 1\" long, which would hold it firmly. At each end of the platform there would be an opening 2'6\" square, through which a 5-inch iron pole would be placed from the ground vertically, and would be attached to the side of the building with brackets, to a height of five feet above the platform. This would enable the children when sliding down the pole to get a firm grip upon before leaving the platform. It would be necessary to have a window, the position used for these fire escapes is obtained, hung on hinges, with an easily operated fastener and opening outward so that there would be no danger of jamming. The price given me for four sets of these fire escapes, fully installed on the building, was $450.00.\n\nW. W. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe present fire protection consists of two stand-pipes which run vertically from the basement to the attic floor. These stand-pipes are connected with the automatic pressure tanks in the boiler-room on each floor. Fifty feet of canvas hose is attached to each stand-pipe, thus providing for two streams of water on each floor. This hose is folded in racks and I found it in poor condition, as it had cracked at the folds and was looking badly. It will have to be replaced with hose of better quality, and I had Underwriter's Insurance Company send me a sample which they tested in Edmonton. The trouble with this arrangement appears to be that the supply of water would be very limited, and in the event of the supply pipe between the pressure tanks and the stand-pipes becoming damaged, the water supply would be cut off and the apparatus would, therefore, be useless. It would seem to be advisable to provide independent water storage facilities for fire fighting and protection purposes only.\n\nI, therefore, obtained an estimate for the construction on the east of a concrete water storage tank and an independent unit for fire protection, consisting of an engine, centrifugal pump, and 300 feet of hose. In obtaining the estimate for a storage tank I included my plans sufficient storage for domestic water for connection with the boilers in the school. The water from the well could be used in these boilers, and they have been having their supply for this purpose from a slough. I would suggest a concrete tank 18 ft. wide by 40 ft. long, sunk ten feet in the ground. This tank would have a partition dividing it, and one end would be for hot water storage and the other to provide water storage for fire protection. It would be covered with a reinforced concrete slab ten feet above the ground level and with a plank roof at the ground level. After consulting with experienced men it is thought that by providing this air space of two feet between the concrete covering and the roof of the tank it would eliminate the danger from freeze. It is proposed to attach the supply pipe to the present pipe from the well to the pressure tanks. The connection would be made outside the building, so that when it was desired to fill the storage tank the water could be shut off from the pressure tanks and diverted to the storage tank. This would provide a direct flow from the well to the storage tank, without any connection with the building.\n\nRegarding fire fighting equipment: After consulting with an experienced engineer connected with the firm of Compton's Limited, in Edmonton, I find that an independent unit could be used in connection with this outside storage tank, consisting of a 12 hp. Gas Engine, 2\" Centrifugal Pump, and 300 feet of hose. The storage house is 10' x 10' and could be built on the east outside of the main building. With regard to the pump, a Dayton-Dow 2\" centrifugal pump is rated to pump water at the rate of 110 gallons a minute, and at the nozzle of a 300 foot hose will give 45 pounds pressure and will throw a stream of water 64 feet vertically and 47 feet horizontally. By having an independent...\nan independent unit of this capacity outside the building, any part of the building could be reached from the outside without interference from the fire. The unit could, by obtaining additional hose, be used in connection with protecting the outbuildings.\n\nThe following is an estimate of the cost, based on actual prices quoted. It might be possible to have these prices reduced when calling for actual tenders on the work:\n\n- Tank, 12x6x20, complete with partition, reinforced concrete slab and plank roof $1300.00\n- Pump house ........................................... $400.00\n- 12 h.p. 'Novo' Engine .............................. $485.00\n- Dayton-Bond 2\" Centrifugal pump ............... $200.00\n- 200 ft. smooth bore rubber-lined hose - 'Underwriters', to carry 50 lbs. pressure $142.00\n- 3/4\" Nozzle and extra coupling .................. $9.00\n- Lining, 3\" - 100 feet ............................. $75.00\n- 2 - 2\" Unions ......................................... $1.00\n- 4 - 2\" Elbows ......................................... $3.00\n- 3 - 2\" 'T's' ............................................ $2.70\n- 50 feet - 2\" pipe .................................... $10.50\n- 1 Foot Valve ........................................... $4.70\n- 2 Gate Valves .......................................... $4.00\n- 3 2\" Valves ............................................ $25.00\n- Digging drains ........................................ $75.00\n\nTotal ...................................................... $2753.00\n\nThe foregoing estimate was as accurate a statement of the cost as I could arrive at, and I think will cover the expenditure.\n\nI may say that I examined the building with a view of ascertaining if it would be advisable to place a storage tank in the attic for fire protection purposes, but find that the building is not constructed to carry the weight, and it would entail a considerable expenditure.\nexpenditure to reinforce the building and make it strong enough for that purpose. The independent turret that I have outlined could be utilized as a means of protection for the employees' residences, and as I have said, by getting additional hose, the outbuildings as well. This matter was taken into consideration in planning the scheme.\n\nWith reference to the fire escapes suggested, I would inform you that a similar arrangement is installed at the Conneaut Boarding School. When fire broke out in that school at three o'clock in the morning on November 26, 1915, the sisters and children left the building by way of the fire escape in very few minutes. It is, in my opinion, much more convenient than an iron stairway on the outside of the building.\n\nI trust that the foregoing report will convey the information desired by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Harrison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., Sept. 30th, 1927\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the fire protection at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, which report was made by Mr. Inspector Murison on instructions from this office.\n\nWith regard to the standpipes, I am quite satisfied that these are sufficient, provided extra care is taken by the Principal to see that the pressure is always kept on, and that immediately an alarm is given the pumps are started in order to keep the pressure up as much as possible. The Principal has had instructions on this point. Regarding the condition of the hose, this is not a surprise to me, as these hose go out of order in a very short time and unless closely watched and kept in repair they are next thing to useless. I have instructed the Principal to obtain new linen hose, which is highly recommended. The two existing fire escapes are not placed in the proper position; they should be at a point where they can be reached from a hall, and not from a bedroom as they are at the present time and this change should be made. I am also of the opinion that we should have sliding poles from a gallery at each dormitory. A price for these is submitted in the Inspector's report and is reasonable. With your authority I will take steps to have these changes made.\n\nWe have circularized all the schools about keeping their fire apparatus in good shape and inspecting same from time to time, and the necessity of having fire drill quite frequently.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOct. 6, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo together with a report from Inspector Morrison on the fire protection at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. You may arrange immediately to have the pole fire escapes provided for the dormitories. With reference to the existing fire escapes leading from the staff bedrooms, after examining the plan I do not see how it is possible to have these fire escapes open onto a hall, and I think it will be satisfactory if they are left as they are.\n\nIn the plan of this building every precaution has been taken to safeguard against fire. If you will examine the plans or the building you will notice that there are no fires maintained in the main building. The boiler room is located in the rear wing at the extreme end and at the farthest point from the main building. The kitchen and laundry are also located in this wing. The building itself is semi-fireproof construction and the electric wiring is all in conduit.\n\nIt was pointed out to me while I was there that the efficiency of the present fire escapes was affected by the way in which the doors leading on to the platforms were hung. Since my return I have examined the plan of this building, and find that if the doors had been hung in accordance with the plan they would not in any way block the fire escape. Kindly arrange to have the doors leading on to the fire escape platforms rehung as shown on the original plan of the building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nW.

A.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., October 14th, 1927\n\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nI have your No. 110-0-5, of the 6th instant, with regard to the fire escapes on the Edmonton Indian Residential School, and reply to say that I have already taken steps to have the new pole fire escapes placed.\n\nWith regard to the existing fire escapes, before making the change of doors I feel I should go further into this matter, as I cannot understand how they will interfere with the escapes if they are properly hung. To change them to open inwards as you suggest would be a mistake and would, in fact, be against the law in this province, and in all probability the Alberta law is the same in this regard. Chapter 179 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, Section 2, reads as follows,-\n\n\"In all churches, halls, houses or other buildings heretofore or hereafter constructed or used for holding public meetings or as places of public resort or amusement, and school houses of more than one storey in height, all the doors shall be so hinged that they may open freely outward, and all gates or outer fences if not so hinged shall be kept open by proper fastenings during the time such buildings are publicly used, to facilitate the egress of people in case of alarm from fire or other cause.\"\n\nSome years ago we had instructions from the Department to change all doors opening inward to open outward, and in several instances changes of this kind were made. I have a letter\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\na letter today from Father Levern, principal of the Peigan R.C. Indian Residential School, on the subject of fire escapes, in which he makes the following comment,\n\n\"All the doors leading to the fire escapes open in; I have always been wondering why Mr. Gardner Smith allowed the contractor to make that mistake.\"\n\nI have examined the plans of the two recently constructed schools on the Peigan Reserve and find that the doors do open inward.\n\nI am quite satisfied in my own mind that I should bring this matter to your attention before making any changes, and that the doors at the two residential schools mentioned should be made to open outward instead of inward. Kindly give me your instructions in the matter.\n\nI notice in your letter you state that the boiler room is located in the rear wing at the extreme end and at the farthest point from the main building. While this certainly lessens the danger of fire, it is not a positive guarantee that fire will not originate elsewhere; in fact the last and only fire we had at this school started, not in the boiler room, but in the electric wiring in the conduit, which goes to show that fire might start anywhere in the building.\n\nWhen we have the four pole fire escapes erected I feel that we will have a reasonable amount of protection, and rather than use the escapes with the doors opening inward I would suggest that we keep them locked and not use them at all, unless a change is made on the lines I suggested, viz:- have them entirely re-constructed so that there will be means of having the doors to open properly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOct. 24, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, regarding the fire escapes at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, I am sending you, under separate cover, a blueprint copy of the ground floor, first floor and rear elevation. From these plans it would appear that the doors leading on to the fire escapes can be made to open out, without hindering the passage on the fire escapes. Will you kindly indicate on these plans how the doors are at present hung, and the space they occupy when open, also the total width of the fire escape.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nREGINA, SASK., October 18th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nAfter the disastrous fire at Beauval, I have been reviewing the means we have at our disposal for the protection of life and property at our various residential schools, and on the 14th instant, I wrote you on the subject of the exits to the fire escapes at the Edmonton Residential School and those at the R.C. Residential School on the Peigan Reserve.\n\nOn looking at the plans of the St. Philips School, on the Keesekoonse Reserve, I find that the exit doors here also are provided to open inwards. I think this condition ought to be changed at once and before the school is occupied. The opening inwards of exits to fire escapes is considered bad practice in this western country, and I cannot recall an instance, in a modern building, where exit doors are not deliberately made to open outwards. In addition to this precaution, they are usually provided with double doors, not single, fitted with suitable bolts, which, when moderate pressure is exerted, will at once release the catches and allow the double doors to swing open freely. The type of bolt used is of such construction that the doors cannot be opened from the outside but only from the inside by the exertion of the pressure referred to. The arrangement for opening outwards minimizes the possibility of delay or panic, and the release of the bolts is accelerated when the doors are double, and therefore correspondingly lighter. These types of bolts and doors are so commonly used that I cannot understand how they escaped the attention of the Architect's Department.\n\nI should, while on the subject, comment on the fact that, in many instances at our schools,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Bsc.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nthe exits are reached through a small private room where access to them might be rendered extremely difficult by the carelessness, fright or timidity of the occupant. If provided for at the ends of the passage-ways, they are infinitely more easily accessible and direct.\n\nAt schools, where exit doors open inwards, changes ought to be immediately made which will preclude the possibility of a crush at an exit being so great as to render impossible the opening of the door.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. W. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOct. 26, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 19th instant, with further reference to the question of fire escapes you may arrange to have the doors opening on to the fire escapes open outwards, as mentioned in your letter.\n\nIt is very important that we have adequate fire escape accommodation in our schools, but it seems to me that it is still more important that all possible precautions be taken by the school staffs to guard against fire.

These were ordered by the Principal as being necessary in the utility building \"to protect the property there from the inroads of the boys\". He adds that he did not intend this item to appear on the account as the order was given on his own authority. As it was included, however, he submits it for the consideration of the Department and adds that if it is not acceptable, it can be struck out and paid for out of the school accounts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\nNovember 15th 1927.\n\nMr. W. M. Graham;\nIndian Commissioner;\nRegina Sask.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn further reply to your letter No.403-11A, of Nov. 1st, I enclose under another cover blue prints as requested. You will note that the actual construction is different from the blue prints and specifications. The plan of the ground floor and the first floor have been reversed. I have indicated with red ink the way they exist. I also enclose a pencil sketch of existing landing on ground floor and an extension which would be satisfactory and very cheaply and easily constructed. The ladder down might be either wood or iron. The new extension would of course require to be iron.\n\nThe door indicated on the pencil sketch is the storm door which opens outward. This could be converted into the main door and with the extension have plenty of room. At present as you will note the door blocks the exit.\n\nA good carpenter would be able to change the doors without a great deal of expense. It would require an iron worker to do the platform.\n\nI shall be glad to give all possible assistance in this work should you authorize the work.\n\nYours truly;\n\n(Sgd) J. F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo, under file No. 110-0-5, and my reply of the 1st instant, I have just received a letter from the Reverend Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, a copy of which I enclose. I am returning the blue prints.\n\nYou will notice that for some reason or other, the platforms of the fire escape designed for the first floor were placed outside the ground floor and vice versa. The width of the fire escape steps is 3 ft. and when landing at the ground floor level, the platform is only 2 ft. wide and therefore the exit door on the ground floor, when opened, blocks off a greater part of this platform. The remedy is as Mr. Woodsworth suggests, and as indicated on the pencil sketch which I attach, to extend this platform another 2 ft. and furnish steps from it to the ground level. It is unfortunate that Mr. Woodsworth could not have procured and given me an estimate of the cost of this, but it will not be very great and if this remedy is adopted on both landings on this floor, the opening of the door outwards will not in any way obstruct the passage-way on the fire escapes. As Mr. Woodsworth says in his letter, the doors can be changed without a great deal of expense and I think they ought to be.\n\nIf you will please instruct me, I shall arrange for the necessary alterations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

The item in the current Appropriation which is covering the expenditure of this new building is one of $5,000 for two classrooms at the Morley School. The church authorities and Mr. Commissioner Graham agreed that a farmer's residence at Edmonton was the more important. We felt, however, that $3,500 was all that we should put into a farmer's residence and you remember that the church is proceeding with the building and that we are to make reimbursement to the extent of this amount. As funds are available, I wish to recommend that $300 be allowed for furnishing the living room, dining room and one bedroom.\n\nRussell Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 7, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to furnishing the new farmer's residence at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, I have to authorize you to incur an expenditure of $500.

F. Woodsworth\nIndian Agent\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\nJune 13th 1928.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nHerewith please find enclosed the following Vouchers:\n\nVoucher 363 for $246.05 in favor of Hayward Lumber Co., Ltd.\nVoucher 364 for Marshall-Wells Alberta Co., Ltd. for $120.52\nVoucher 365 for $31.51 in favor of German's Ltd.\nVoucher 366 for $46.16 in favor of The Edmonton Paint and Glass.\n\nI may say that these accounts have been incurred in the erection of the farmers house, now completed.\n\nThese accounts are somewhat in excess of the amount authorized but I have found it quite impossible to keep exactly within the appropriation. As indicated in a former letter we have done all the rough labor work, and have employed but one carpenter. The wages of this carpenter was low in comparison with the work he did.\n\nBeing a brick house there were items of expense which we could not escape and which I did not foresee in the estimate. Sand for plaster and mortar, cement, and general supplies have accounted for all expenditure. You will find enclosed accounts for paint etc. The tenders from Marshall-Wells, and Edmonton Paint and Glass were practically the same so I bought for both to suit our preference.\n\nI trust these accounts are correct and that the Department will pass them for payment.\n\nThanking you for past courtesies,\n\nYours Truly;\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nJune 27, 1928.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe are in receipt of your cheque No.1505 $46.16 and as we are unable to reconcile this amount with our books, we would ask you to please advise which invoices you have covered by this cheque.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention to this matter, we are,\n\nYours truly,\nTHE EDMONTON PAINT & GLASS CO.LTD.\n\nManager-Credit Dept.\nOttawa, July 7th., 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to cheque No. 1501 for $46.16, I beg to state that this amount represents the following invoices for goods supplied to the Edmonton Indian Residential School, viz:-\n\n| Date | Amount |\n|------|--------|\n| Feb. 4 | $11.70 |\n| Feb. 7 | 1.30   |\n| Feb. 13 | .87    |\n| Feb. 24 | 2.17   |\n| Mar. 2 | 5.02   |\n| Mar. 7 | 4.06   |\n| Mar. 27 | 4.53   |\n| Apr. 25 | 11.68  |\n| May 3 | .53    |\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Manager,\nCredit Department,\nThe Edmonton Paint and Glass Co. Ltd.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, August 8, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that it was represented to Mr. Ferrier, of this Department, when he was in Edmonton during July, that a cement soft water storage tank is urgently required at the Indian Residential School. Rev. Mr. Woodsworth pointed out that this could be placed in the ground to the west of the boiler room and that he would be prepared to undertake it at a cost of $500. At present, they are pumping soft water for use in boilers and other machines by hand and the arrangement is very poor. Please let me have a recommendation in this connection without delay, as it has been represented that the improvement is quite urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI have your No. 110-0-5, of the 8th instant, with reference to the matter of providing a cement storage tank for soft water at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, at a cost of about $600.00. The size of the proposed tank is not mentioned, and it is, therefore, impossible to judge whether this is a reasonable cost or not. I shall take steps to find out just what the Rev. Principal expects to have built for this money. I cannot see that there is any great urgency for this work. I have visited this school on several occasions, and our Inspectors have also visited it, and no representation of this kind has been made, and I cannot agree that there is such urgency as your letter would indicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nW. REGINA, SASK., 25th August, 1928.\n\nWith reference to your No. 110-0-5, dated the 8th instant, I wish to advise you that I have discussed the question of the installation of a soft water storage tank at the Edmonton School with the Deputy Superintendent General, who directs that an item for consideration be placed in the Estimates for next year to cover this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\n\nSeptember 18th 1928.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAbout a year ago when the Deputy Superintendent General, Doctor Scott was paying an official visit to the school he intimated that this year there would be built at the school a machinery shed. I understood also from Rev. T. Ferrier that the expenditure necessary was provided in this year's budget. To date I have not had any word regarding this matter, or whether it is the intention of the Department to build this shed.\n\nIt may be pointed out that we have several thousand dollars worth of machinery purchased for the operation of the farm and no place to store it properly. As the Department is aware this is not a proper state of affairs on a farm of this size and occupancy.\n\nI shall be glad to know something of the wish of the department in this matter.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 24, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, and in reply, I have to authorize you to erect an implement shed at the Edmonton Indian Residential School at an estimated cost of $600. You should buy materials to the best advantage and use as much school labour as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B. A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI recently received a request from the Rev. Principal of the Indian Residential School at Edmonton to arrange for the purchase of a Ford Sedan car for the Farmer, Mr. H. Goodland, at the regular discount rate granted to officials of the Indian Department. I was able to arrange for the purchase of a Chevrolet Sedan for the same party in April, 1927, and took up the matter of the purchase of the Ford with the Canadian Motors, Limited, here and expected that there would be no difficulty. I am, however, in receipt of a letter from the local Manager stating that they are unwilling to make delivery of a Ford car to Mr. Goodland on a discount basis, unless the sale is covered by a Departmental requisition.\n\nI am of the opinion that Mr. Goodland is practically an employee of the Department, or in any event he works in an institution which is conducted under the supervision of this Department and that the car would be used a great deal on business connected with the school, and, therefore, there should be no objection to a sale being made to him at the discount rate. I think the Department will agree with me and I shall be glad to receive authority to be allowed to officially order the car for Mr. Goodland.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, October 9, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 403-11A of the 4th instant, with reference to the purchase of a car for the farm instructor at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. As this automobile would be used a great deal on business connected with the school, you may issue a departmental requisition. It is understood, however, that Mr. Goodland, himself, will be responsible for the purchase price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\nOctober 31st 1928.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nOwing to the corrosive action of the water at the school\nthe hot water tank connected with the Jacket Heater, has given out\nand it will be absolutely necessary to have it replaced. The surface\nhas been worn in some places almost as thin as paper and has sprung XXX\nseveral leaks. We have tried repairing the leaks, but find the metal\ntoo thin to be tapped. I request authority to purchase a new tank.\n\nI have enquired at the wholesale, Metals Ltd, and find that\na new tank will cost about $100.00. Of course it will be necessary\nto employ a plumber to install it.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 6th, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, requesting authority to replace the present hot water tank connected with the jacket heater at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, and requesting permission to purchase a new tank and have same installed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase, to the best advantage, of a tank of the size and type considered suitable, and also arrange with a plumber to install same. We note that you estimate the cost of the tank to be approximately $100. All costs in connection with the installing of this tank should be kept as low as possible.\n\nPlease forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nToronto,\nDec. 11,\n1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nPursuant to our conversation when I was in Ottawa last week re a grant for fencing, soft water storage, and some alterations on the top floor in connection with this school, the estimated cost is $2,000.00. I trust that this amount will be provided for in the Estimates that are to be placed before the next session of Parliament.\n\nYour favourable consideration to this request will be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

H. Gilmore.\n\nLast Friday evening the pump rods gave out. We did not get water again until Monday evening. All this time we did our best with ice, snow and any little quantities we had in private rain water cisterns etc. I secured Mr. Gilmore to assist with this work as he is an experienced well driller.\n\nThe Department is sufficiently acquainted with the situation to understand how serious a matter it is to be without water at a school of this size. We have absolutely no reserve supply for either a breakdown, such as we had, or for fire.\n\nI would strongly recommend another well.\n\nYours Truly;\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\nFebruary 9th 1929\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe. finishing a portion of the top flat of the Indian Residential School at Edmonton, with the object of accommodating pupils from the Brandon School during period of construction.\n\nThis can be done by finishing the two wings thereby making two dormitories, the East one for girls and a lady officer, and the West for the boys and a male officer. To accomplish this the following will be required:\n\n- 6000 ft. No.1 edge grain B.C. fir flooring $400.00\n- 1400 sq.ft.yds. wire lath plaster 955.00\n- 400 pieces 2x4-10 90.00\n- II rolls building paper 22.00\n- 800 ft. 8\" base 64.00\n- 4000 ft. beaver board (to cover rafters of roof behind plastered walls.) 200.00\n- 3 doors 39.00\n- hardware 30.00\n- One skilled carpenter 200.00\n- 10 electric drop lights\n- Two toilets with plumbing\n\nMr. J.S. Duguid who built the farmer's house and has otherwise been employed on the plant offers to do the carpenter work with the aid of school help for the sum of $200.00.\n\nThis estimate does not provide for heating, electric work and plumbing, which will have to be dealt with on its merits.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Schools.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nFebruary 16, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThere is an item in the Main Estimates for the finishing of the top floor of the Edmonton Indian Residential School. You will remember you approved of the scheme of sending some of the pupils of Brandon to this institution for the coming year or so, until the new building in Manitoba was ready. It will be necessary to effect this improvement before these pupils can be accommodated, and it is now timely to have the work commenced. If you approve of the scheme, Mr. Orr will examine the proposal forwarded by the church authorities, at an estimated cost of nearly $2,000, plus a little plumbing and lighting. The school management is prepared to effect the alterations on a day labour basis (with the exception of the lighting and plumbing) with an expenditure of only $200 for expert labour.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received a letter from the Reverend Mr. Perrier enclosing an estimate for the finishing of the top floor of the two wings of the Edmonton School. The estimate amounts to $2,000 outside of the necessary electric wiring, plumbing and heating.\n\nIn looking over the plans and checking up the cost it is considered that a much greater amount will be required to fix up the two wings, including the plumbing, heating and wiring. Before further consideration can be given to the matter, I would ask you to please obtain and furnish me with a detailed estimate of the work required, including the necessary wiring which will have to be done in rigid metal conduit, the additional heating and the plumbing. It will also be necessary to provide adequate fire escapes for the dormitory, and it is suggested that this can be done by the installing of the pole type escape at the rear of the wings. The fire escapes can also be made to serve the dormitories on the first floor. You should include in the estimate a price for the fire escapes.\n\nI would appreciate having this information at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D.

See Voucher 385.\n\nThe other invoices are all matters of absolute emergency. The chief item is that of the retubing of the high pressure boiler. You will note that Invoice 2022 is for the replacing of one tube which sprung a leak and put out the fire. Then several others gave out and we found that the others were practically gone. This is largely a matter of the water which we have to use and gives emphasis to the need of a soft water tank. This soda water eats through everything. There was absolutely nothing else to do than to have the tubes replaced.\n\nInvoices 2068 and 2155 are concerned with the repair of the laundry mangle. An old leak of three years ago again broke out and had to be repaired.\n\nI am quite aware that for an emergency bill this account is somewhat large, but there was nothing else for me to do. It was unforeseen and action was necessary immediately.\n\nI trust this account will receive the favorable consideration of the Department.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMarch 1, 1928,\n\nRev.

Mr. Ferrier for finishing the two wings of the top floor is quite insufficient. I have secured estimates from various firms as to the cost which are as follows:\n\nPlumbing and Heating - as per Standard Heating and plumbing ........... $2149.00\nElectric wiring - as per Colin Allan .......... 197.00\nLumber for finishing work - as per Cushing Bros. 967.00\nLumber for shelving and tables \" \" \" .. 135.00\nPlastering 1900 sq yds. (with wood lath) @ .77\nall material supplied except sand 1463.00\nPlastering 1900 sq.yds. (metal lath) do @ 1.22 2318.00\nHardware and paint ......................... 75.00\nFire escapes (three foot balcony) .......... 559.20\n\nOne carpenter overseer at $1.00 per hour...\n\n(Job to take about 5 weeks)\n\nI enclose a sketch of plumbing also one of the portion to be finished. The colored portion is that required to be finished which is about the same as that indicated by Rev. T. Ferrier except that space has been provided for store room which is necessary and which was not provided before. I have also allowed for two rooms at each end of the building as one at each end was not sufficient. Also a bath for staff members at each end. As suggested by Department the fire escape is in the rear at each end by pole. The p\u00e2le will be broken at the second floor as a drop of nearly forty feet to the ground is too much.\nA foot balcony on the fire escape will cost $645.00.\n\nRe. the plastering:- It will be noted that the metal lath will cost about $855.00 more than the wood lath. The prices here given include all labor and material with the exception of sand which will require a car load costing about $65.00. I may also say that if metal lath is used it will require about $150.00 worth of extra studs as the studs now there are not spaced right for the metal lath. So in all the metal lath will cost about $1000.00 more than the wood lath. The Department will have to decide which.\n\nI have put the carpenter's work in at $1.00 per hour as I have found the flat sum, say of $200.00 unsatisfactory. This job will likely cost between $250.00 and $300.00 for carpenter. We will of course give all the labor possible.\n\nThis finish is about as simple as possible in harmony with the finish of the rest of the building. It will be a real finish and will supply accommodation for all time. I would not however suggest anything less. These prices are very close. It is possible that a few extras may be necessary, but very little. It will be noted that with wood lath and three foot fire escape the total cost will be about $5910.00. It will be noted that $2905.00 is for Heating, plumbing, electric wiring, and fire escapes. It also raises Mr. Ferrier's figure about $1000.00, but I do not see how this advance can be escaped. If this figure is satisfactory to the Department I shall be glad of authority to commence operations as soon as possible as the time is short and we do not wish to be late for the incoming of the Brandon children. I shall be glad of any suggestions from the Department.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMarch 12, 1929.\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nIn the early summer, the main building at the Brandon Indian Residential School will be demolished, preparatory to the erection, on the same site, of the new school.

Woodworth,\nPrincipal, Edmonton Indian School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., April 2nd, 1929.\n\nInspection report on Schools in Edmonton Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to report that I visited the Edmonton Indian Residential School on Saturday evening, January 26th, and remained there until Tuesday, the 29th, and made a general inspection of the institution. Although I have visited this school on several occasions on special business, this is the first report I have submitted since March 3rd, 1924, just previous to the arrival of the first pupils at the school.\n\nThe Rev. J. F. Woodsworth has been in charge as Principal since the school was built. He is a hard worker and, after an examination of his accounts and records, I consider him a capable business manager. He has the interests of the school very much at heart and his time is very fully occupied. He acts as recruiting officer, keeps the books and records, and exercises general supervision over the activities in the school and on the farm. I found the staff composed of capable men and women. He is very fortunate in having such a good staff at the present time. Mr. Goodlands, who has held the position of Farmer at Branden and at this school for a period of about 30 years or more, has charge of the outdoor work, and Miss MacDonald, the Matron, is giving very satisfactory service. I found her very devoted to her duties and her time appeared to be occupied very fully from 6 o'clock in the morning until the children retired to bed.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nto bed. The engineer, Mr. Angel, is a very capable man and I found the equipment under his charge being kept in first class condition.\n\nBUILDINGS.\n\nI found the school building clean and tidy from the basement to the attic, and although the thermometer ranged from 45 to 55 degrees below zero during the period of my visit, the building was warm and comfortable.\n\nSince my last visit four pole fire escapes have been installed with access to them from the dormitories. I found the fire equipment in good shape.\n\nSome time ago I submitted a report on the water supply situation at this school, and I would again respectfully direct your attention to this question. There is only one well at this school. It is a very excellent well and the water is good for domestic purposes, but has too much soda content for use in the boilers and soft water has to be supplied. During the past winter, in the cold weather, the pump in this well broke and the school was without a water supply for three days. They had to haul ice for domestic purposes. This situation would be rather bad in the event of a fire taking place at such a time, and I would recommend strongly that a second well be sunk so that in the event of one pump getting out of order, and there is no doubt that it will in time, there would be the second well to fall back upon. The only water storage is provided in two 1100 gal. pressure tanks, and in the event of fire this would become exhausted in about 15 minutes. It seems to me that a cement water storage tank should be provided. I would also point out that we have no facilities for storing soft water at this school, and although...\nalthough we have a large roof surface, the rain fall during the summer is allowed to go to waste. A cement tank would provide storage for soft water which could be used in the boilers and would make unnecessary a great deal of labour which now has to be done to keep the boilers supplied with soft water.\n\nThe electric lighting plant continues to give excellent service, and the laundry equipment is in good condition.\n\nWhen visiting the dormitories it was noted that the mattresses which were originally supplied were in very poor condition; in fact, they are worn out and should be replaced. Even ticks filled with fresh straw would be much better than those now in use.\n\nFARM.\n\nThere is now a total of 500 acres under cultivation. The crop seeded last season consisted of 110 acres of wheat, 125 acres of oats and 40 acres of barley, which yielded 3,000 bushels of wheat, 5,500 bushels of oats and 1,500 bushels of barley. The grain was badly damaged by frost. The potato crop was good and they secured 2,000 bushels. The live stock includes 14 work horses, 35 cattle and 60 hogs.\n\nThey were milking 12 cows at the time of my visit. The boys do the milking under supervision. It was noted that the girls are not taught to milk cows. It is important that both the boys and the girls should become proficient in this work.\n\nThe accommodation for the cattle is not adequate. There are only 24 stalls in the barn for 35 cattle. A lean-to shed might be added to the barn at comparatively little cost to provide housing for the young\nEDMONTON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nFARM (CONT'D.)\n\nYoung stock. The cattle on hand were in very good condition. The hogs are a fine lot and nearly all that have been fattened for the Edmonton market have graded \"Select\" and No. 1. There are no poultry kept at this school, the reason given being that they have not been provided with a hen house. There is plenty of feed available, and I think that they should have a sufficiently large flock of hens to supply eggs for the institution.\n\nGENERAL.\n\nThere was no sickness amongst the pupils at the time of my visit. I attended their church service on Sunday and remarked that I did not hear any of the children coughing during the service. They presented a clean, well dressed, healthy and happy appearance. There were 58 boys and 63 girls in residence at the time of my visit and 2 girls attending high school in Edmonton, making a total enrolment of 113.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that I was very pleased to note the smooth manner in which the institution was running, and consider that this school is a credit to the Department.\n\nW. Morrison\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Agencies\nDear Mr. Scotti-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an inspection of the schools in the Edmonton Agency, which was made by Mr. Inspector Murison.\n\nYou will see from this report that the situation at the Edmonton Indian Residential School is all that could be desired and that the work is carried on in a satisfactory manner. The Inspector draws attention to the matter of the water supply at this institution, and I may say that, in my opinion, there is no necessity for digging another well, which might entail an expenditure of five or six thousand dollars. It does seem necessary, however, to have an additional supply of water on hand and it seems to me that we should have a reservoir near the school into which the water from the well could be pumped and from there would be pumped into the pressure tanks. On the other hand there might just be a supply of water pumped to a large underground tank for storage purposes, if we could be assured that this water would be used from time to time and the tank refilled so that it would be sure to be fresh. 1100 gallons of pressure does not seem to be enough for fire protection. I think in this you will agree with me.\n\nI would also draw your attention to what the Inspector says about the state of the mattresses in the dormitories. Good mattresses should be supplied in an institution of this kind that is so much before the eyes of the public. It gives a very bad impression to people-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Bupt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\npeople passing through these dormitories to see such poor beds. I think that fairly good mattresses could be bought for $3.50 each.\n\nThe farm at this institution is well conducted. The only regrettable feature is that the children are not being taught to milk the cows. This matter has already been taken up with you as it was brought to my attention by one of our Travelling Nurses. I do not feel like recommending that the Department build another barn at this school, as I think they should get along with what they have. I think the reason given by the Principal for not having hens is a very poor one. He knows perfectly well that had he made a request to the Department for a henhouse he would have had one. We can put up a henhouse there for about $300.00, built on the same principle as those at the University, and at our other schools.\n\nWith reference to the St. Albert School, everything there was found in good order as usual. You are quite familiar with the promises that were made to the Sisters with regard to the building of the laundry and what proportion of the expense the Department would bear, so it is unnecessary for me to go into this matter. You will be pleased to note, however, that the laundry has been completed and is apparently highly satisfactory.\n\nOn the whole the report on these two schools is quite satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nApril 10, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 405-11 of the 4th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Macdonald's report on the Edmonton Indian Residential School. I have directed that the question of an additional supply of water be studied, with a view to determining just what should be done at this school. Arrangements will be made to replace the mattresses in the dormitories when the top floor is being furnished in the near future. It is proposed to send approximately 75 of the Brandon pupils to Edmonton for a year or so, and the top floor at Edmonton is now being finished for this purpose.\n\nThere are no funds provided this year for the erection of a hen house, but there are two items in the Estimates for this school - $600 for the provision of a soft water tank and $400 for fencing. You might correspond with Mr. Woodsworth, with a view to determining the relative importance of the hen house and the fencing. When you have replied, authority will then be directed to you for whatever can be allowed this year.\n\nI was very pleased to learn that conditions are quite satisfactory at this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.,\nApril 18th 1929.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have to report that on Tuesday Morning April 9th, the sucker rods of our pump parted. Since then we have been without water and have only now got the pump operating and water once more into the school. We found that the coupling at a depth 80 feet had given out. This made it necessary to pull up the sucker rods and also the heavy 4\" pump casing. The work is very heavy and cannot be done in any case under two days with everything going well. If anything went wrong we might be out of water for an indefinite length of time. With the amount of water to be pumped, the inevitable friction, and the weight of the machinery, we may expect these breaks from time to time. Each time it is a lower coupling which gives out, and this requires so much more time. It is now about five years since the well was completely out so the couplings have become loose, and there requires considerable readjustment.\n\nNow I wish to point out that the well is a first class one. The water supply is all that can be desired as far as it goes. (we pump close to 10,000 a day at the present time). The pump is alright, but very heavy and requiring time to move it to say nothing of labor and machinery:- It is however the fact that we are liable without warning to be left without water for days or longer that is the serious fact, and this in a community of some 150 people to say nothing of stock or sanitary conditions, and also possible fire. I might say that just at the time we had the plasterers and they required about 20 barrels of water a day. In order to meet the need we had to take every boy out of school and carry water from the sloughs and ditches by the road side. This should not happen whenever any little repair of the pump is necessary, and yet we cannot do otherwise. I think it is\nunnecessary for me to further emphasize our need as these facts are doubt more or less familiar to you. The fact is we need another well which can be used as a relief well or an alternate. This is required immediately and I herewith request authority to arrange for test holes to be put down and if satisfactory another well be drilled. If this is agreeable to the Department I would be glad of a wire to that effect. In the meantime if the Department wishes one of their inspectors might visit me and make a report on the matter.\n\nThis well is quite another matter from further tanks, or rain water supply, or overhead stand-pipe, it is the matter of a water supply in case of a temporary break. We should get right at this in view of the coming of the Brandon children.\n\nI may say that we did all the work ourselves this time, the only expense being some tools and pulleys which were necessary, the accounts for which I shall forward later.\n\nYours Truly;\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nApril 22, 1929.\n\nMEMORANDUM: Mr. Scott.\n\nCommissioner Graham in his letter of the fourth instant draws attention to the question of water supply at the Edmonton School and advises that provision should be made to store an additional supply of water to supply the pneumatic tanks.

I received a reply in which he states that the soft water tank is urgently needed and he asks for authority to proceed with the work of supplying it immediately, as they are greatly inconvenienced by not having one.\n\nIn regard to the other question he would prefer to have a chicken house. He has not stated the size of it and, of course, the expenditure will be based on what his requirements may be. We built a large hen house for the R.C. School on the Blood Reserve last year at a cost of a little more than $500.00, and, if this amount could be allowed, I think it will be sufficient.\n\nWill you please advise me in regard to both these matters as soon as convenient.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C.

Deputy and Secretary.\nCOPY.\n\nCalgary, May 10th, 1929.\n\nThe Commissioner of Irrigation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my inspection of the water supply and fire protection apparatus at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nDate of Inspections - May 1 & 2, 1929.\n\nThe school is a four-storied structure of brick and hollow tile; there are about 150 children in residence there, and an additional 100 from Brandon are to be brought there temporarily during alterations at Brandon.\n\nThe water supply is obtained from a well about 320 ft. north of the school itself; while the quality leaves something to be desired, the quantity appears to be adequate. About 10,000 gals. per day appears to be used at present, and it seems fair to assume that another 6,000 gals. will supply the additional pupils expected.\n\nI am informed that the well has yielded 40 gals. per minute on test without any diminution or 57,600 gals. per day.\n\nThe reason why a second well is needed is that the machinery for raising the water out of the present well is in very poor condition and likely to break down at any moment; the power head is of an obsolete type and worn out while the piping and rods in the well have given much trouble and have had to be pulled out upon several occasions with makeshift equipment. The supply might be cut off for several days (or even weeks) while repairs are being made, and as the two pressure tanks (the only storage) only contain one hour's supply it will be realized that the situation is serious.\n\nThe best remedy is a second well; the only alternative is storage which would cost more than a second well is likely to do for anything more than a day's supply; moreover the soda or other salts in the water make its taste more unpalatable after storage.\n\nThe best site for the proposed new well appears to be near the northeast corner of the boiler house. While of course a well alongside the existing one would be more certain of striking a supply, it might be that it would reduce the yield of the first. Moreover for several reasons it would be more convenient to have the pumping machinery handy to the existing boiler room and electric light plant.\n\nThe proposal made by Mr. Woodsworth, the Superintendent, in which I concur, is to attempt to find water in the site selected at 175' to 200' (the depth of the existing well) and,\nif unsuccessful, to move over to the locality of the existing well, without spending any more on exploration work.\n\nTo drill say a 3\" test hole, fail to find water, and then drill at the second site might cost $1,200 and I should recommend that authority be given Mr. Woodsworth at the earliest possible moment to spend up to that amount on drilling. The case is urgent and the design of the rest of the system depends on where water is found. Well drillers are in great demand in Alberta at present, and if one can be found it would be unwise to let the opportunity slip.\n\nFrom the fire protection point of view the situation is equally serious. There are two (1\u00bd\") fire hydrants on each floor, eight in all dependent upon the same well and pump driven by a 7 B.H.P. engine.\n\nTo reach the top floor it would have to raise the water 160 feet in the well and then lift it about 56 feet in the building; there would be the friction in 175 feet of 4\" pipe, 330 feet of 3\", 100 feet of 2\" and 30 feet of 1\u00bd\". The volume and pressure obtained would be very small.\n\nAs the fire-nozzles are attached to the domestic service pipes, any failure in these due either to extra pressure or incidental causes, would reduce still further the volume and pressure available.\n\nTo remedy these conditions the following plant is proposed.\n\n(1) As already mentioned drill new well and install power head.\n\n(2) Construct storage tank for fire purposes, also rain-water tank having capacities of 21,500 and 11,300 gallons, respectively, as at Onion Lake School.\n\n(3) Install fire protection pump with a capacity of about 50 gals. per min. with a full head at the nozzles.\n\n(4) Install 14 B.H.P. engine with fast and loose pulleys at each end to work either new well power head or fire pump.\n\n(5) Increase number of pressure tanks from two to four.\n\n(6) Provide direct connection from five pumps to hydrants apart from service pipes.\n\n(7) Provide hose so that outlying buildings may be reached from hydrant in pumphouse.\n\n(8) Provide chemical protection as at Onion Lake.\n\n(9) Repair pumping machinery at existing well including new power head.\nIn accordance with the wishes of Mr. Woodsworth, the Superintendent, and Mr. Angel, the plant engineer, it is proposed to install the new fire fighting pump and engine immediately north of the present boiler house. The writer has weighed the advantages and disadvantages of this course, and agrees with them that these advantages outweigh the danger of fire in the building making the pumping plant inaccessible. The saving of time in reaching the plant and the ease of starting in a warm building are important factors and the new pumphouse (which will be mostly underground) will be of fireproof construction.\n\nConsideration has been given to the idea of driving the new service pump electrically, but Mr. Angel, the plant engineer, states that it would overload his plant. By the method proposed the 14 H.P. engine primarily intended for driving the fire pump, will also operate the new well lift. This will save the expense of a second engine or motor. When pumping against the pressure tanks for ordinary purposes it will use about 5 H.P. and it seems probable that this light duty will insure its being ready for use, better than if it stood idle. The consumption of gasoline will only be slightly greater than that used by a smaller engine. When pumping into open tank it will only require about 1\u00bd H.P. so that in case of a fire it might run both pumps if desirable.\n\nThe following is an estimate of the cost of the proposed works.\n\n(1) Drill and case new well (including allowance for test hole or holes.) allow $1,200\n\n(2) Rainwater and well water tank as at Onion Lake School 4,000 -\n\n(3) Concrete pump house and pressure tank shelter (north of present boiler house). 2,000\n\n(4) Plant in new pump-house\n\n1-14 B.H.P. engine Lister twin cylinder vertical\n1 fire pump. Lister 6\" x 6\" double\n1 Myers self oiling power head with rods, etc.\n2 pressure tanks each 3'6\" x 15'0\"\n1 Hydrant with Nozzle Hose hanger, etc. 2,600\n\n(5) Piping valves, etc. 1,100\n\n(6) Repairs to existing well & power head, allow 400 -\n\n(7) 500' linen fire hose with couplings to reach other buildings 250\n\n(8) Chemical equipment as at Union Lake 250\n\n(9) Additional cost if well has to be near existing well $400 to $700 700\n\n12,500\n\nContingencies 1,250\n\n$13,750\nIn concluding I should like to urge the necessity of this work being started at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) F.R. BURFIELD.\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of April 22 regarding the water supply system for the Edmonton Indian Residential School, I have received a report on this subject from the Commissioner of Irrigation, copy of which is enclosed.\n\nThe inspection of conditions was made as soon as possible after your instructions had been received, but owing to the fact that there was considerable detail to be obtained before plans could be prepared, it was found necessary to have further information obtained on the ground before submitting the report and plan showing the general layout of the existing plant and the proposed additional plant required.\n\nFrom this report you will note that the water supply condition at present is unsatisfactory and unreliable. Additional storage facilities to cope with fire conditions and an additional source of supply are needed in order to take care adequately of the school's requirements. The Commissioner advises that the scheme now outlined in the report herewith is along the lines discussed with Mr. Woodsworth, principal of the school, and that it appears to be adequate in every respect. He further points out that the existing pumping plant at the well is in such a condition that it is urgent that steps be taken immediately to provide a supplementary supply.\n\nI beg to recommend, therefore, that the scheme now being presented in the attached report be adopted and authority given to proceed with the work at as early a date as possible. The cost is estimated at $13,750., and I presume would have to be carried out by contract.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter No.110-0-5 of the 30th ultimo, in connection with certain improvements at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, in the way of installing a soft water tank and erecting a henhouse.\n\nI beg to point out that you have authorized the building of a henhouse at a cost of approximately $500.00, and the installation of a soft water tank at a cost of $400.00, which you state must not be exceeded. I wish to refer you to the Deputy Supt. General's letter dated April 10th, wherein he states that $500.00 is being provided in the Estimates to cover the installing of a soft water tank. I advised Mr. Woodsworth that $400.00 had been allowed and he points out that $600.00 was asked for, and that the only way the tank can be built even for the latter amount is by the school supplying all the labour, with the exception of one skilled workman. I should, therefore, be glad if the Department could authorize the original amount asked for, viz:- $600.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 23, 1929.\n\nSIR:\n\nI have your 403-11A U. of the 17th instant, relative to the installing of a soft water tank at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted that the Principal advises the cost of this equipment will be $600, instead of $400 as authorized in our letter of the 30th ultimo. The Department will approve of the expenditure for this purpose of an amount not exceeding approximately $600.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\nMay 20th 1929.\n\nThe Secretary:\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have to report that on Saturday morning we again had a break in our pump. We went right to work on it and by Sunday afternoon again had water and everything apparently in good working order. However during this time we were without water for any purpose. Fortunately this was a simple break, but is only a month since our last break, and we do not know when the next will be.\n\nYours Truly:\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMAY 27, 1929.\n\nCommissioner Graham has reported that the water supply system at the Edmonton School is not satisfactory and recommends that an additional well be provided. The Reverend Principal has also reported that an additional well is required.\n\nThe Dominion Water Power Branch were asked to have one of their District Engineers visit the Edmonton School and submit a report and recommendation for the water supply system for this building. This report has now been received and they recommend the digging of a second well and the providing of a storage tank for fire protection purposes, two additional pneumatic tanks and a fire pump together with extra fire fighting apparatus. They estimate the cost of this work at $13,750.00. It is evident from their report that some action should be taken immediately to remedy the existing conditions. If you approve of the work being carried out, I would recommend that the Dominion Water Power Branch be authorized to instruct their Engineers to proceed with the work on a day labour basis.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 31, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge and thank you for your 41167 of the 20th instant, enclosing copy of a report on the water supply system at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. I regret to inform you that there is no appropriation for this improvement and the matter will have to stand until next year, when I will have a further communication for you. I have to thank you for your cooperation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 31, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer further to your letter of the 18th ultimo concerning a supplementary water supply for the Edmonton Indian Residential School. I have also your letter of the 20th instant in this connection. A report has been received from the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service, and their recommendation involves an expenditure of $15,750. I regret that there is no appropriation for this purpose this year, and it will be necessary to secure a vote before the work can be authorized. A note has been made for next year's estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B. A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform the Department that I have made arrangements for the erection of the soft water cistern and hen house at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, and work will be commenced immediately. I would therefore ask to be supplied with an accountable cheque for $300.00 to pay wages, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 110-0-5.\n\nI have received your letter of May 31st with reference to the water supply system at the Edmonton Indian residential school, and note that as there is no appropriation for this improvement the matter will have to stand until next year. The Commissioner of Irrigation has been advised accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nMr. J.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MISS ANNIE LEDREW,\nTRAVELLING NURSE, DATED MAY 8th, 1929,\nON HER VISIT TO THE EDMONTON INDIAN\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n---\n\nOriginal on No. 110-0-13.\n\nGreat inconvenience is caused here by the school not having any large built-in ice chamber. With hot weather coming on, and so much meat being needed every day, there is no real sanitary way of keeping said meat. With so many more new pupils being added to the school, this problem will be even more serious. A large size ice chest is in pantry, but that is only large enough and fit to contain cooked foods.\nOttawa, June 21st, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMiss Ledrew, Travelling Nurse, in a report on her visit to the Edmonton Indian Residential School, states that inconvenience is caused by not having any large built-in ice chamber and that during hot weather there is no real sanitary way of keeping meat.\n\nI have to request that you will inform the Department regarding the present facilities for the keeping of meats and other perishable food supplies, and you should also state what further requirements in this respect are necessary. There are no funds specially provided for this purpose for the coming year. When giving information regarding the cold storage facilities which you consider should be supplied, you should also state the approximate cost of same, when consideration will be given to providing funds for the purpose next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Few if any extras have been found necessary. In connection with the plumbing there have been some necessary alterations in other parts of the building however to accommodate the extra children (1) We require extra kitchen space. This is found in a room next to the kitchen. I wish in this an extra sink and a door, or opening, put between the kitchen and the present bake room. This is easily done and will enable one officer to control the whole. (2) We will require more room in the lavatory for both boys and girls. I have suggested a galvanized trough connected with the sewers on both boys and girls side. This is the least expensive and most effective method which I can suggest. I also ask for a drain in the basement floor for flushing the floors. There is none at present, which is a great inconvenience. These are the only extras which I ask. They are very necessary and I have thought and planned about them for a long time and consulted with the plumber as to methods and costs. I trust the Department will approve of these changes.\n\nYours Truly:\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 9, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of May 15th, last, with reference to further alterations at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. I note that this involves extra plumbing, doors, etc. The Department believes that these alterations should not be undertaken as the large pupilage will be for the one school year, and I regret that I am unable to approve of these extras.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This is the fire escapes as mentioned in my letter of March 5th; See your letter No. II0-0-5 of March 18th 1929.\n\nNo. 326 in favor of Hillas Electric Co. for $189.50. This is a trifle better than my estimate as per Colin Allan.\n\nNo. 327 in favor of Beckett, Plasterer, for $1726.50.\n\nMy estimate for this job was over $2300.00 done on metal lath. (See your letter). However I did my best to cut down the number of yards for the metal lath. Just allowing them to plaster on the tile, when possible. Then in place of plaster we used the Beaver Board which just requires the paint. In this way there was quite a saving. I also cut the figure down $50.00 by using our own labor, which was not in my original estimate. The sand of course in this job was supplied separately by the Department.\n\nNo. 328 in favor of The Edmonton Paint and Glass Co. Limited for $129.38. This paint account includes paint for the finishing of the top flat and also for the painting of the machinery shed.\n\nSee your letter of September 24th 1928, No. II0-0-5. There is also included material for a little repair work and painting and the usual freshening up around the buildings. The school supplied all labor. I may say that it also includes the necessary annual going over of the children's dormitories, infirmary, and the bath rooms after the years use. The material was kept down to what was actually required.\n\nI trust these accounts are satisfactory.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.G.

Sir,-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing voucher No. 406 in favor of Cushing Bros. Ltd., for lumber supplied, I beg to state that there are a number of items in these accounts which require alterations.\n\nIn invoice No. 9051 the extension of 1013' is incorrect according to the description of the pieces.\n\nIn Invoice No. 9298 the extension of 22 BN casing 5-6 also appears to be incorrect with regard to the number of feet and the amount.\n\nIn invoice No. 8762 the extension of the two items for shelving are incorrect. They should be altered as well as the amounts.\n\nWith regard to the credit note for $20.83, it is stated that in invoice No. 9298, 272 ft BN Casing should be $3.00 net. In that invoice there are a number of items for casing which are charged at a higher rate, and I do not understand to which items the 272 ft. referred to belongs. The credit note also has an item of $1.14 for disc. on part of invoice No. 9300, but on referring to that invoice you will see that the disc. is taken off. I herewith return the voucher and beg to request that you will have the necessary alterations made wherever required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent.\n\nRev.

If these can be supplied by the Dept., as on a former occasion, I shall be glad.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth.\nOttawa, September 4th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo, requesting that 200 tooth brushes be supplied for the use of the Edmonton Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that the stock of these brushes which the Department had on hand has been entirely distributed. They were taken over from the Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment without cost to this Department. In future, when tooth brushes are required at residential schools, they will have to be purchased by the school authorities from their per capita grant or other receipts. We are unable, therefore, to comply with your request to be furnished with the above number of tooth brushes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F.

See my letter of March 5th, and\nyour reply of March 15th. Also my letter of May 15th and your reply of\nJuly 9th.\n\nI fear that my action in the case of the extra plumbing is\nout of harmony with your letter of July 9th. The latter came somewhat\nas a surprise to me as I felt that the silence of the Department from\nMay 15th constituted a sanction to my request. I know that this may\nappear to assume too much on my part, but the extras were urgent and\nI hope to show that these extras are necessary. I quite admit that I\nhave overstepped my authority.\n\nThe item of $86.62 is for repairs to the radiators in the\nchapel which were caught by the frost during one of the severe spells\nlast winter. I let the matter go at the time, but felt that when\nthe plumbing were here they should have been repaired. The item of\n$8.25 was a broken register face in the basement leading to the air\nflue. This was being used as a catch all and sometimes I found\nmatches and other dangerous things in it. I considered it should be\nrepaired. The item of $45.75 involved drain in each of the play\nrooms\u2014boys and girls side. When the school was built there was no\ndrain put in and no way of flushing out the play rooms. Since the\ndrains were put in things have been much easier. In the case of\nthe item for $74.33. This should have been in the contract. I was\nunder the impression that it was. This was an extension of the water pipe for fire protection, and is on all the other floors. I was sure that the Department would wish this connection made.\n\nThe next item of $14.30 is for an extra sink in a room adjoining the kitchen. In the first place I asked how much the sink would cost and was told that one was available for $15.00. One of a little different model, and that this was just half price. I considered that $15.00 was reasonable. I did not expect the labor and fittings would cost so much. However this has made a wonderful difference in our kitchen convenience. The next item of $500.40 came as a great surprise to me. I wanted a little extra space for wash basins. I did not want anything elaborate, merely a trough to hold granite basins and spill them down the sewer. After talking the matter over with the plumbers we decided on galvanized iron troughs to be connected with existing sewers. It must be remembered that we have over 200 children in attendance and only twelve basins in each wash room for their use, and only the two wash rooms. Now this is my story. Your reply did not come until really too late to alter my request and in the meantime these conditions were facing me. Of course I would not have gone ahead if I had received your letter sooner. Officially I have no excuse, but with the facts in the case I trust this amount will receive consideration. I have asked your inspector or Mr. Morrison to come in and see things when he is through next and if necessary make a report as to the necessity of the extras. I say say that this is the only amount which has exceeded the estimate and in most cases I have kept things down. If the Department wishes to investigate kindly pay the contract and let the other stand open.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 19, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing two vouchers in favour of the Standard Heating and Plumbing Company. I note your explanation concerning the extras. It is true that there was some delay in replying to your request of May 15th. The Department has decided to pay the amount in full and to await Mr. Inspector Hurison's report on the necessity of the extra plumbing which was undertaken. When this report is received, it will then be decided whether or not the amount of some of the extras should be deducted from the per capita grant of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

This has been arranged by converting the waste space on the top or attic floor into dormitories, Bath rooms, Washrooms and Bath rooms. The East and West wings have been converted into large well lighted and attractive dormitories for the boys and girls respectively with accommodation for 44 beds in each. The necessary radiators have been installed and connected up with the heating system. The water standpipes have been extended and provided with the necessary hose for fire fighting and a toilet provided in each dormitory. Clothes rooms with access to them from the dormitories and baths have been provided.\n\nFour staff rooms, two each for male and female members of the staff have been provided adjoining the dormitories.\n\nA bath room at each end of the hall has been fitted up. Ventilation is provided through the windows. I visited the dormitories in the morning and found the air fresh and sweet. Pole fire escapes with easy means of access thereto have been installed.\n\nThe space in the centre of the top floor is being used for storage purposes and there is now no space under the roof of the same building which is not being utilized for a useful purpose. The plastering finishing and plumbing work has been well done.\n\nThere were some alterations and installations made which were not included in the original estimate which I will explain in detail.\n\nDuring the severe weather last winter a number of sections in the radiators in the chapel burst and had to be replaced. 23 new sections have been installed and this entailed an expenditure of \u00a360.00. Tile work had to be done.\n\nTwo floor drains, one in the hall and one in the boys' playroom were installed. The floors in these rooms are concrete and are washed with a hose. The drainage necessary to carry off the water was and should have been provided when the building was first erected. These cost \u00a345.00.\n\nThe replacement of a broken register fan in the basement leading to the air flue was necessary to prevent it from being used as a depositary for rubbish. This costing, on account of the difficulty of obtaining a suitable fan, was \u00a315.00.\n\nThe kitchen space has been added by constructing an access to two small rooms by removing partitions converting the rooms which had been of little use into much needed kitchen space. A sink was installed at a cost of \u00a3114.35 and the work in connection with making and finishing the openings was done by the school staff. The added space was much needed and I consider that the expenditure was necessary owing to the increased work brought about through the increased pupilage.\n\nW. W. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nSaskatchewan.\nThe facilities for washing in the boys and girls wash rooms have been added to by the installation of four sinks made with heavy castings from one single iron frame. These sinks have been fitted with taps and drain connections to the existing pipes and ordinary wash basins are used in these troughs.\n\nThere are now 230 children in residence and some more will be arriving shortly. There are 107 girls in residence now and only 12 wash bowls were available for their use. It will be readily seen that some provision had to be made to meet the situation and the above remarks applies to the new wash room. The new installation is strong, convenient and very suitable. The cost $640, appeared high to me but upon examining the detailed account of material supplied and work performed everything appears to be in order.\n\nI am satisfied that the additional washing facilities are necessary to house the increased population.\n\nA new barn house, implement shed and threshing machine house have been completed. The barn in addition to the horse barn has been converted into a very good storage house.\n\nThe Pump Jack formerly in use has been disposed of and a Myers Pump Jack installed in its place. This is working very satisfactorily. When making the new installation it was found that the water level in the well has not changed during the past nine years.\n\nThe question of providing a water storage tank for an emergency supply and for fire protection is in my opinion an important one and every consideration that might be given consideration. The water supply in the present tanks is barely sufficient for domestic requirements and they have to be pumped full at least ten times each day.\n\nIn the event of fire the supply from the pressure tanks would not last long.\n\nI am informed that the matter of providing cold storage facilities is receiving consideration by the Department.\n\nThere are no facilities for keeping fresh meat or other supplies at this institution and they are very necessary.\n\nAs time goes on and the farm and live stock industries develop the need for adding to the accommodation becomes a pressing necessity. In this connection I would point out that a fine herd of 45 heads of cattle has been built up and the present barn could provide room for half that number. An addition to the barn is necessary in order that they cattle may be retained and the herd kept up.\n\nAnother hog house similar to that now in use is required to provide for the development of this industry and to care for the hogs on hand. There are 150 pigs on hand at the present time and they are a fine lot. The raising of hogs forms a valuable source of income for the school.\n\nAbout $800.00 in canned food supplies were provided through the live stock industry last year.\n\nThe light rainfall affected the returns from the farm and garden. The Farm produced 900 bushels of wheat, 5000 bushels of oats, 1500 bus barley and a large quantity of very good quality of green feed. The wheat out turn was disappointing being about one third of a crop.\n\nThe quality of the potatoes is excellent and between 1500 and 2000 pounds have been secured. The garden produce was generally small owing to the dry summer.\n\nIt gives me pleasure to state that I consider that the general conditions at this school are very satisfactory and reflect great credit to Mr Woodworth's management.\n\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Morrison\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nSir:-\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. Murison, written to me from Edmonton, which reads as follows,-\n\n\"When I was leaving Edmonton for Saddle Lake I saw Mr. Woodsworth at the station and he informed me that he had received a letter from the Department in which they stated that they were awaiting a report from me in connection with the renovations to the school building. I therefore stopped off here and am submitting my report in duplicate herewith.\"\n\nI beg to say that I had received no instructions from the Department, and I do not think it was the intention of the Department that Mr. Woodsworth should give these instructions to Mr. Murison, as they should have come through this office. I did not tell Mr. Murison to go to the Edmonton school, nor did he intend going there. Am I wrong in asking that instructions of this kind pass through this office, so that my files may be complete and I shall know what is going on in the field?\n\nMr. Murison's report is herewith submitted without comment from me, as I presume the Department does not wish me to comment on the matter or they would have written to me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, October 12, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 403-114 U of the 8th instant, with reference to a recent report of Mr. Inspector Murison's on extra plumbing undertaken at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nI may say the Rev. Principal wrote that he had asked Mr. Inspector Murison to make a report on this when he was next at the school. The Department replied to his letter in part as follows: \"It has been decided to pay the amount in full and to await Mr. Inspector Murison's report on the necessity of the extra plumbing which was undertaken. When this report is received, it will then be decided whether or not the amount of some of the extras should be deducted from the per capita grant.\"\n\nOf course, there was no intention that Mr. Woodworth should give instructions to Mr. Murison. The Department expected to find reference to the extra plumbing in Mr. Murison's next report on the Edmonton school.\n\nMr. Murison reports that the additional plumbing fixtures were really necessary, and, as the Department has paid the account, no further action is necessary.\n\nAs our estimates are now being prepared, I should like to have a special report from you regarding the needs at this school. The Department is favourably considering the providing of improvements to the water supply system. Mr. Murison in his recent report speaks of the need for cold storage facilities, an addition to the cow barn and a second hog pen. Please let me have your recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

Woodworth,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.,\nOctober 24th 1929.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWe use in connection with our operations at the school close to 500 gal of gasoline per month. At present we are keeping it in the Utility building along with other oils etc. During the winter we have in the same building three or four fires going for various purposes. This is our garage building and of course we have to keep a fire there. At times we have a fire in the forge which is in the same building. At times a small fire is needed in the root house which is in the basement. Of course the gas and oils are in a separate room but if anything happened there would be little left of the Utility Building.\n\nNow, I can buy a 500 gal. tank and a regular service pump for $95.00. The pump has been used but is as good as new, being a model not just the latest, but passing the license inspector. Mexican the price for the pump is less than half and they would install the whole thing for $37.00. I shall be glad to have your authority to install this tank and pump. I think the need is apparent.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 28, 1929.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nReference your letter twenty-fourth you may install\ngasoline tank and pump at estimated cost of ninety-five\ndollars.\n\nJ. D.

A new pump has been installed that is giving perfect satisfaction, so that as far as the water supply is concerned it is ample. If anything should go wrong with the pump an expert could be obtained from Edmonton in a very short time to put it right, and I am not looking for anything to go wrong. The question of fire protection is one that might be considered by the Department. Mr. Paulin, and others who are familiar with the situation at Edmonton say that we could easily provide another pressure tank within the school. This would not take up much room and would mean another 1500 gallons of water under pressure all the time. This would be much better than to have a tank in the ground outside, and should not cost much money if handled in the right way.\n\nWith regard,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWith regard to cold storage; every school should have a cold storage plant of some kind. One of the modern plants should be installed and there may be space available at the school at the present time where refrigeration could be put in.\n\nI do not think that an addition to the cow barn is necessary. What we do need is a cheap shelter for young stock, to keep them out of the wind, but to erect a barn would be a useless expenditure of money. I understand the additional space is required for young stock, yearlings and two-year-olds.\n\nWith regard to the matter of a second hog pen, I would point out that we have a wonderful hog pen at this school, 50 ft. long, with 10 compartments 10' x 10', five on each side, which will hold all the pigs that should ever be kept at an Indian school. These schools are not meant to be money-making institutions, and as the present hog pen will provide accommodation for from 50 to 60 hogs I am quite sure it is not necessary that we should build a second one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWm.

These tanks are new, but neither of these tanks nor compressed air water system, one third of the capacity of each tank is filled with air which leaves space for only eight hundred gallons of water in each tank, as water supply to the different buildings. The tanks installed are about large enough to supply two houses and perhaps the Kitchen of the School.\n\nWe have had considerable experience with compressed air water systems and our candid opinion is that they are not at all suitable for an Institution of this kind.\n\nOur recommendation to you would be to use a steel tank erected on a steel tower on a suitable foundation with a capacity of about 50000 gallons which would give an ample water supply and fire protection, which is not provided for at the present time and which you should certainly have. We would suggest that this tank be erected at about 110 to 115 ft. from bottom of tank to grade line. Such an installation could be erected at a cost of about Twelve Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($12,500) complete with conduits, discharge casing around supply, heating pipe and soil, foundation etc.\n\nOur Provincial Government have adopted the outside water tower, as recommended above, for all of their Institutions outside the City.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Standard Heating & Plumbing Co., Ltd.\n\nPer (Sgd.)

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs an engineer in charge of this plant I find it my duty to\nand without apology to condemn the water system absolutely, an\ninadequate to do the work required of it. Having had considerable\nexperience I am fully acquainted with the situation here, and having\ngiven the whole system a careful and thorough test find that the water\nsystem is nothing but a sad failure. The water supply tanks are\nof such small capacity that it is impossible to furnish water to\nsupply more than half our needs. To do this the pump is kept running\nalmost continuously. The pressure tanks are hoax in so far as\nservice is concerned, they simply cannot furnish the plant with the\nnecessary water supply. In case of fire no protection whatever would\nbe available with the present tank system. Toilets are completely\nout of order and will require a thorough cleaning and overhauling\nbefore they can function again. At present they all shut off. I can\nsee no remedy for our serious difficulty but large storage tanks where\nlarge volumes can be drawn without imperilling the supply.\n\nThe hot water is another problem to be met. The present\njacket heater is much too small for general purposes being but a\nregular household size only.\n\nI trust you will give these matters your immediate\nattention and that we will soon have the difficulty remedied.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"S.A. Coppen.\"\n\nEngineer.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.,\nMarch 25th, 1924\n\nMr. W.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is with regret that I must inform you that the water system of this plant is absolutely inadequate to do the work required. Briefly I make the following report after carefully and diligently giving it a fair trial. When full the water tanks carry a capacity of a little over 2000 gallons. Air and dead water take up about 2/5 of this space, leaving but a very small quantity of water to function. This makes it impossible to keep up constant and continuous pressure to supply all demands of the plant unless the pump is kept working constantly which is out of the question. Last week it was necessary to pump at least every hour of the day in order to supply water demanded, which resulted in muddy water being drawn from the well, an evidence of excessive pumping. Whereas large supply tanks would do away with the difficulty.\n\nIn consequence of this muddy water the toilets are now shut off and will require a thorough cleaning before proper working-order can result. Under present conditions, even if the pump were kept running at full speed no fire protection would be possible under the present system.\n\nAgain\u2014After carefully trying out the jacket heater, I find that this is much too small to heat the water required for general purposes. A much larger heater will be necessary to supply hot water demands.\n\nTrusting that you may give this your most careful attention at the earliest possible date;\n\nI am Yours truly,\n\n\"S.A. Corpen\"\nEngineer at the Indian Residential School, Edmonton.\nTHE STANDARD HEATING & PLUMBING CO.,\nEdmonton, Alta.,\nMarch 25th, 1924\n\nCommissioner W.M. Graham,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Water Supply Indian School, Campbell, Alberta.\n\nIn our opinion the compressed air system recently installed is altogether inadequate for an institution of this kind, and not suitable for such a series of buildings.\n\nThere is installed at the present time two tanks 42\" diameter by 18 ft. long which when full would hold about twelve hundred gallons each. As you are aware, using these tanks as a compressed air water system, one third of each tank is filled with air which leaves space for only eight hundred gallons of water in each tank for water supply to the different buildings. These tanks are shut large enough to handle the two houses and perhaps the kitchen of the school.\n\nWe have had a large experience with compressed air water systems and our candid opinion is that they are not at all suitable for an institution of this kind.\n\nOur recommendation to you would be to use a steel tank, erected on a steel tower on a substantial foundation, simple water supply and fire protection, which is not provided at the present time, and which you should certainly have. We would suggest that this tank be erected about 110 to 115 ft. from bottom of tank to ground line. Such an installation could be erected at a cost of about Twelve Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($12,500) complete with supplies, discharge, casing around supply, heating pipe and coil, foundation etc. Should you so desire we would be pleased to submit a definite price on tank as recommended above.\n\nOur Provincial Government have adopted the outside water tower, as recommended above, for all their institutions outside the City.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"The Standard Heating & Plumbing Co., Ltd.,\nPer \"J.W.

Graham,\nSuperintendent,\nEdmonton.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: the present water system.\n\nI regret to inform you that the water system as installed in this school has entirely failed to meet the requirements of the institution. At the time of the opening some one hundred and fifty persons were present including the parents of the children. Although every preparation for the event had been made the water system entirely failed to stand up to the needs. During the last two weeks with a normal attendance of some eighty-five people we are now without the use of the flush closets throughout the building. This is entirely due to the fact that the pressure system has been totally inadequate to operate the system. I would draw your attention to the fact that the toilets are dependent for their satisfactory operation on the constant pressure of the water. When this fails the closets fail to flush and there is not only a great waste of water, but also danger from disease and unsanitary conditions. For some time we did our best to operate these closets by turning them on and off by hand, but at last this proved such an intolerable task that they were finally shut off and used only with pails. It will be seen that in a new institution this is a very serious matter not only from the standpoint of health, but also endangering the life of the pupils as there is absolutely no fire protection from this source. The difficulty lies in the fact that the pressure tank system is inadequate, with our demand it is absolutely impossible to keep the pressure. To maintain our partial supply it has been necessary for the engines to pump from eight to twelve times a day. This without the laundry being in operation and without the use of the flush closets. A few gallons of drain takes the pressure off to such an extent that the whole system is rendered inoperative.\n\nIn order to relieve the situation for the time outside closets will be necessary.\n\nI would suggest that in view of the uncertainty of this system we should have some kind of a gravity system installed. This seems to be the only method adequate to meet the situation.\n\nI would also add that the water supply itself, that is the well, seems to be safe. In spite of the abnormal strain upon it the supply is keeping up and except for the temporary failing of the water there has been no indication that it is giving out. At present it is pumping at the rate of about 25 gal. a minute. I trust that it will be possible to have this system changed without delay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., APRIL 5TH, 1924\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWith reference to the water system at the new Edmonton Industrial School, I am enclosing herewith copies of letters received from Charles Kay, Inspector of Construction; Mr. Woodworth, the Principal of the School; Mr. Mould, the President of The Standard Heating & Plumbing Co. Ltd.; and from the Engineer. From these you will gather there is something wrong with the system, which should be remedied.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.H. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nR.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nAt Edmonton, March 25th, 1924.\n\nHon. Chas. Stewart,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Stewart -\n\nAs requested by you I visited the new school here yesterday, and I regret to say that conditions there are anything but satisfactory. The water system is utterly inadequate to supply the needs of the institution, and to use the words of Charles May, Sup't. of Construction, \"It is no good and never will be\", although it is constructed in accordance with specifications received from Ottawa.\n\nI was not satisfied taking the word of Mr. May alone on this matter, and I called up Mr. Gould, a Master Plumber, who had charge of the installation of this system, and he was equally as emphatic as Mr. May, and said that the system would never work satisfactorily; that it was a poor one and did not meet the situation, and he feels quite satisfied that the whole plant will have to be changed.\n\nAt the time of my visit none of the lavatories were working on the top floor, simply because no pressure could not be put to that point, and when pressure of 65 lbs. is put on the tanks it goes down in no time. The Engineer in charge of the works - a competent man - tells me that he has to go from nine to eleven times a day to keep pressure in the tank, and even when he does this it is not satisfactory. There is also a tremendous waste of money there, not only in the new building but on the outbuildings. Over $10,000 has been spent on a well 175 ft. deep. The barn cost between fifteen and eighteen thousand dollars; four barns could be built for this money, of the same size. There is a building outside that is used as a garage and work shop combined. This cost thousands of dollars. There has been waste all along the line, and if this matter had been in the hands of business men, thousands of dollars would have been saved.\n\nI learned that a new fence had been authorized, costing\n\nI think....\nI think it is $4,500. To my surprise I found the whole farm fenced with a pipe wire fence, which means that the cost is over twice as much as it should have been. I venture to say $2,500 was wasted here.\n\n---\n\nNote for Dr. Scott - (Remainder of letter deals with Blood Reserve)\n\n---\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) W.M.

This will be forwarded to you and you will then know what amount will be at your disposal for the construction of houses and various matters that you have decided upon, and from that point on you will have a free hand, always keeping in mind that you will be expected to keep within the appropriations. Any changes in detail will be left entirely to you. This is as I understand the matter. We will undertake our part to provide the money up to the extent of the appropriations. I am sure this should be entirely satisfactory and it will give you a free hand.\n\nI hope to get this detailed statement of work and expenditures away to you in a few days.\n\n---\n\nSince writing the above, a report has come in from Mr. Mould, and I am sending you a copy herewith.\n\nWith kindest regards, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nC.S.\nOttawa, April 9, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo:\n\nI am somewhat disturbed over your report on the water system at the Edmonton School. The other matters complained of, I fear are now beyond our control, but the water system undoubtedly will require immediate attention, otherwise an epidemic may break out at the school. I note that Mr. Gould confirmed Mr. May's opinion that the water system would never work satisfactorily. I have been trying to think of someone who thoroughly understands this business and is absolutely reliable, to send there to make a complete investigation. The architect here reports that the engine is an old one and did not have sufficient power to put the pressure up. He also states that the system gives satisfaction in other institutions. My own experience only extends to that of small plants in dwelling houses, and I know of a great number that are working successfully. At the moment I cannot think of anyone in Edmonton outside the plumbing business who has had very much experience with plants of this character. I do not know that the Ontario Land Engine and Pump Company make installations of this character, as well as the Bradford Company. If you know anyone in Edmonton or vicinity who is in this business, I would be glad if you would wire his name. I think it would be well to get a full report by a competent outside man in order that we might be assured that the right action would be taken to remedy the difficulty.\n\nWith reference to your wire re the dwellings on the Blood Reserve and the expenditure of $500, to connect up the water and provide drainage - As you know, we are cutting our expenditure to the bone and every hundred dollars counts. This matter was discussed with Mr. Orr and it was decided to build outside closets, allowing the connections to stand for some time until other buildings might require attention. It was not so much disagreement with your suggestion as the question of the necessary $500. I wish you would try and\n\n--------arrange\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, April 10, 1924.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Scott.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Graham's letter of the 5th instant and enclosed letters regarding the water supply system at the Edmonton school, I beg to say that when plans and specifications were being prepared for this building, consideration was given to the installing of a water tower, similar to that mentioned in the letter from the Standard Heating & Plumbing Co. It was not specified, however, on account of the high cost.\n\nThere is no doubt that the water tower system is superior to the pressure tank system, but both systems depend for their success on an abundant supply of water at the source of supply. The pneumatic tank system has been installed in all of the schools where a municipal water system or a gravity system was not available, and has proven satisfactory, but it is of course necessary to exercise care in the use of water throughout the building. It is not practical to install tanks larger than the ones used at the Edmonton school.\n\nIf funds are available I would recommend that a water tower be built to provide water supply and fire protection for the Edmonton buildings. The cost will be approximately $12,000.\n\n[Signature]\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, April 16, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Mould:\n\nI beg to thank you for your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the water supply system at the Edmonton School.\n\nIt will be impossible to consider, at the present time, the erection of an elevated tank, as no funds have been provided by Parliament for this purpose. I may say that we have many installations in our Indian schools similar to that installed at Edmonton, and they are giving good satisfaction. Some of the schools are larger than the Edmonton and some smaller. The success of the system, of course, depends on there being an adequate supply of water in the well and care being exercised in the consumption of water in the school.\n\nI would ask you to thoroughly examine the present system, including the engine and pump, test out the tanks and see that there are no leaks, and that all connections to the tanks are made at the bottom. It might be well to consider the changing of the Sloan valves on the toilets to low down tanks. Recently a new gasoline engine was authorized for operating the pump. Has this been satisfactorily installed?\n\nAs there is some doubt as to whether the well is capable of supplying the quantity of water required, I would ask you to give the well a twenty-four hour test, or a longer one if necessary, in order to make sure that there is an adequate supply of water in the well, for the various uses of such an institution as this. I would also like to know what buildings other than the main school building are obtaining their water supply from the pneumatic tanks. If this is the source of supply for the farm buildings, it may be necessary to provide an additional well for this purpose.\n\nI would appreciate receiving a full report on this matter with your recommendations at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Graham.\nOttawa, Ont., April 17, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nRe Edmonton Water Supply - Before receiving your wire, I had wired Mr. Mold of Edmonton for a report, which I have received and forwarded to you. I have wired for a further report as to water supply, and asking if in his opinion the installation of an additional pressure tank would not meet the situation. As soon as this report is received, I will send it to you. If you then think it necessary to have your own report on the matter again, you can so arrange. I am very anxious not to incur expenditure for an outside tank if it can possibly be avoided.\n\nIn the list of buildings and repairs forwarded to you-you will find an amount for a barn at this school. Do you think it possible to get along without this expenditure this year. I would be glad to have you give this matter careful consideration before you decide.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina.\nREGINA, SASK.\n\nHon. Ches. Stewart,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nApril 21, 1924.\n\nI would advise not acting on any report re water supply Edmonton involving an expenditure of much money. The man I propose sending thinks the system can be made to work.\n\nI am opposed to outside tank system such as Monro suggests too expensive. I would advise sending my man.\n\nW. H. GRAHAM.\nTELEGRAPH.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nApr. 22, 1924.\n\nW. H. GRAHAM,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nYour wire received re Edmonton School. Am wiring Mould to mail report direct to you. Upon receipt you can decide if necessary to send your man. I am opposed to outside task.\n\nChas. Stewart.\nCOPY.\n\nTELEGRAPH.\n\nDepartment of the Interior.\n\nOttawa, April 22, 1924.\n\nJ. W. Mould,\nPresident,\nStandard Heating & Plumbing Co.,\nEdmonton.\n\nWill you kindly mail duplicate of your report re Edmonton school water system to W. M. Graham, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Regina.\n\nChas. Stewart.\nRegina, Sask.\nApril 24th 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Stewart:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th inst., enclosing a report from Mr. J. W. Mould on the water system at Edmonton School.\n\nI do not think we will be called upon to pay $12,500 to erect an outside tank in order to get a water supply at this Institution. At the Qu'Appelle School where we have twice the number of pupils, we have a pressure system, which works entirely satisfactorily. What is needed here is a man to go over the system and stay there until he makes it work. I have a man who can do this. I think he will have to make a number of alterations in the system.\n\nWith regard to the second report you are calling on Mr. Mould for, I am waiting for this, and if it is not satisfactory, I will send Mr. Paulin from here. He thinks he can make the system go, and if he says he can, I have every confidence he will.\n\nYou state the Architect reports that the engine in connection with this system is old. He is mistaken. A new engine was installed, and it was working when I was there. The Department authorized this engine.\n\nI hope that from now on all matters pertaining to buildings will be dealt with from here. I believe we can get much more satisfaction.\n\nI am told by the Duck Lake Agent today, than an Engineer has been there laying out drainage, etc. Duck Lake is one place about which I had wanted to have something to say. I do not think the school should be placed alongside the existing school. I believe it was the intention of the Principal to have it too close, in my opinion to the existing building.\n\nWould you kindly find out why a man was sent to this school without even advising me.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nEdmonton, Alta.\nApril 25, 1924.\n\nHon. Charles Stewart,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 16th inst.\nre water supply at Edmonton Indian School.\n\nWe have checked over the different items referred\nto in your letter and find everything in order. We are also\nfully satisfied that there is ample water supply in the well.\nA new gas engine has been installed and is working very\nsatisfactorily. In addition to the School building two\nhouses are supplied from the present pneumatic tanks.\n\nWe note your remarks regarding compressed air water\nsupply at other schools stating that they are satisfactory.\nFrom information we have received, this is not correct but\non the contrary they are a continual source of trouble and\nannoyance. Our experience is that the only place where a\ncompressed air system is at all satisfactory is in a country\nhouse.\n\nYou have a magnificent building here on an excellent\nsite but the most important part of the equipment is in-\nefficient for the want of a good water supply and this you\nwill never have with pneumatic tanks.\n\nAs stated in your letter of the 5th inst., we still\nrecommend to you a steel tank erected on a steel tower,\nthe cost on installation is not a large expenditure when you\nconsider the fire protection you will have and a permanent\nwater supply for all purposes.\n\nIf a steel tank is erected, as recommended, there\nwill be no need to change the flush valves of closets to\ntanks.\n\nYour telegram of the 22nd, instant was received and\nwe have sent a copy of our report of the 5th inst., and\nalso a copy of this letter to W.M. Graham at Regina, Sask.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Standard Heating & Plumbing Co. Ltd.,\nJ.W. Mould,\nPresident.\nOttawa, Ontario.\n1st May, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Mould:\n\nMany thanks for the report contained in your letter of the 25th ultimo with regard to the water supply at the Edmonton Indian School.\n\nI am giving the matter further consideration, and will write you again in a few days.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.W. Mould, Esq.,\nPres., Standard Heating & Plumbing Co., Ltd.,\nEDMONTON, ALTA.\nMay 8th, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Stewart:\n\nWith reference to the water situation at the Edmonton School, Mr. Paulin the plumbing expert has just returned after having spent four or five days at the Institution, and I am delighted to inform you that he has been able to at least find out what is wrong, and before leaving had the pressure system working fairly satisfactorily. But before it will be a complete job, some work will have to be done on the plant.\n\nFirst of all, I may tell you that the two pressure tanks are not pressure tanks at all; they are hot water tanks with manholes, which should not have been supplied. Instead of being tapped for the supply in the bottom, as a regular pressure tank would be, they are tapped on the end and about eleven inches up. The result of this is that there are about 300 gallons of dead water in the bottom of the tank that is not used at all - might just as well have been so much lead; so this 300 gallons are to be taken off of the capacity of the tank, leaving about 900 gallons of actual space. Of this two thirds of the space would, under ordinary conditions, contain water and one third air. In addition to this Mr. Paulin discovered that both these tanks were water-logged; that is, they had too much water in them and not enough air. This is caused by there being no way to regulate the proper proportions of air and water in pumping. He procured a booster airpump, and had this installed, and the proper proportions will now pump into the tank. What will have to be done at once is to retap these pressure tanks at the bottom, close up the present opening, and tighten up the manholes in some way, as these allow a certain amount of air to escape.\n\nFlushometer lavatories are used in this building, but in order to make the system satisfactory Mr. Paulin recommends that we use low-down tank lavatories. These can be attached to the present fixtures without any great trouble or expense. The present lavatories could be sold at almost as much as they cost, as they have not been used to any great extent. Mr. Paulin thinks that on the whole a system like this would be more satisfactory, owing to the irregular pressure that naturally takes place in a system of this kind, as when anything goes wrong...\nthere is a great waste of water. Of course Mr. Paulin makes it clear to me that the flushmeter is a good closet under other conditions, but in connection with this particular system, he thinks that it would warrant the department making this change.\n\nKindly advise me if I may have seventeen tank lavatories sent up, and also whether Mr. Paulin is to take a man from here to put the system in Al shape. You might advise me by wire.\n\nI may assure you, in conclusion, that there is ample water at this Institution, the well was pumped for four and one-half hours, at the rate of 1200 gallons an hour. There was no noticeable depreciation in the water and it came out as clear as crystal. Another test was made for seven and one-half hours with the same result.\n\nI may also add that the system could be made even more efficient if say a 5000 gallon storage tank were installed. This tank would be made of concrete and lined with asbestos. The pump could be worked to this tank and from this tank it could be drawn off with an automatic electric pump, which would always keep the pressure up to a certain point. Of course this would be an ideal system, and it would take probably $1000 to $1500 to do this. If you wish to put this in, so much the better; but the system we have there is precisely the same as that at U'Ansele, that is, the water is pumped direct from the lake to the pressure tank. If the Government cannot see their way at the present time to do this, it might be done later on. Mr. Paulin assures me, with the changes suggested above, the plant will operate satisfactorily.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\nMinister's Office\n\nMay 13, 1924.\n\nMr. H. M. Smith,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter which the Minister has received from Mr. Graham, with reference to water supply at the Edmonton school. Mr. Stewart would like you to look into this matter and phone him this afternoon, as he thinks some action should be taken immediately regarding this matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. H. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\n\n[Handwritten note]\nChapman $100.00\nChambers $100.00\nTotal $200.00\nOttawa, May 13, 1924.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with further reference to the water situation at the Edmonton school.\n\nI am pleased to learn that Mr. Paulin has been able to locate the trouble and to discover that the system which had been installed cannot be considered in any way a proper pneumatic system. This was considered probable by the Department, and in giving Mr. Mould, President of the Standard Heating and Plumbing Company, Edmonton, instructions to inspect, he was given particular directions, as follows:\n\n\"I would ask you to thoroughly examine the present system, including the engine and pump, test out the tanks and see that there are no leaks, and that all connections to the tanks are made at the bottom. It might be well to consider the changing of the Sloan valves on the toilets to low down tanks. Recently a new gasoline engine was authorized for operating the pump. Has this been satisfactorily installed?\"\n\nIn his reply he did not deal specifically with these points, which lead me to authorize you to send Mr. Paulin to Edmonton.\n\nAs he evidently understands the requirements of the system, you may direct Mr. Paulin to make such changes as will render the tanks effective and put the system in good working order.\n\nThe Contractors, Messrs. Claydon Co., Ltd., have failed in carrying out the plans and instructions and will be charged with the cost of making the necessary changes. The Department is holding an amount of $1,000.00 on this contract, and we also have a written guarantee for the building; so that so far as the contractor is concerned, we are in control of the situation. They will be immediately informed of the facts and of our intentions in the matter.\n\nW.H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nWith reference to the substituting of seventeen low down tanks in place of the flushometers, you may authorize Mr. Paulin to make this change, and the tanks required should be purchased in Edmonton. Possibly some arrangement can be made with the firm from whom the tanks are purchased to take the flushometers in exchange.\n\nI am very pleased to hear that there is an abundant supply of water in the well. This being the case we will not at the present time install a 5,000 gallon storage tank, but will give the system when it is overhauled a fair test in order to ascertain whether it can fully meet the needs of the institution.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nCANADA.\n\nNo.406-11A.\n\nRegina, Sask., May 16th, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Stewart:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th inst. with reference to the water situation at Edmonton School.\n\nI will have Mr. Penlin go to Edmonton next week and put the system in first-class working shape. The cost, considering everything, will be very little, as I expect to be able to dispose of the flushometer tanks in Edmonton, at about what they cost; and the amount received will, of course, go against the low-down tank system. As I said before, I think everything will work out quite satisfactorily.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\n\nW. M.

It is possible that the flushometer closets should not have been specified, although I am not at all certain that if the pressure tanks had been properly installed, the closets would not have worked well. However, we will not specify them in any of our new schools.

Currie\nFort William, Ont.\nOct. 17, 1927.\n\nRev. Jos. Woodsworth,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nDear Bro. Woodsworth:\n\nYour night letter re-building site and telegram to Dr. Scott to hand just before I left Brandon. While I have acknowledged the same, this is a further reply.\n\nAbout two months ago, I wrote you and pointed out that your primary duty was to locate the place and size of your boy's playground, assuring you when this was done it would be a very easy matter to select the site for your new building. Since then you have sent me a couple of sketches of your campus, showing the site you have selected for the building and giving your reasons for this selection; but you have not a sketch of any kind as to where you intend the boy's playground to be. Had you sent the plans for a playground, the whole matter could have been settled at once.\n\nA short time ago Mr. Goodland sent me a friendly letter setting forth the advantages of the site of building, and a plea for me to endorse it. Since he did not deal with my objections, viz., that it was robbing the boy's playground of the west side. To his letter I replied, \"that I could not consent to a building going up now, nor at any time in the future, that in any way would interfere with the most suitable site of a boy's playground.\" I also informed him that Mr. Banner and that I had reason to believe Dr. Manning was also opposed to the site chosen by Mr. Woodsworth for the building. Had you the contents of this letter when you wired Dr. Scott?\n\nYou assure Dr. Scott that the site you have selected has no relation to the boy's playground and does not encroach on it. Did you make this clear to Dr. Scott when he was with you, and also state it as emphatically as your telegram does? If not, why did you not state in your message that Mr. Ferrier was of the very opposite opinion and this was his chief objection to your selection? I enclose you a rough pencil sketch of the site of the playground and its proximity to the main building. Kindly place on this the position of the site you have chosen, giving the distance it is from the playground, and also from Mr. Goodland's present home, and the main building. This will be a very easy way to prove your statement and of showing me I am wrong. All I desire is to secure the most suitable playground for the boys for all time to come.\nYou state in your message to Dr. Scott that you are held up in your building operations. Had you not received Dr. Scott's telegram to do and my interpretations of the same and instructions to build? If so, how were you held up?\n\nWhy have you treated my request for a sketch showing your selections for a boy's playground\u2014also my instructions as to where to build\u2014in silence and lack of courtesy, and adopted a mode of procedure that is hardly in harmony with the policy our Church has pursued in doing business with the Indian Department.\n\nI am quite agreeable to whatever Dr. Scott will advise. I have found him to be a man of sound judgment and high ideals, but we hardly do him justice, or ourselves credit, to ask him for a decision until we have placed before him all the necessary information.\n\nTo assist in this I am sending him a copy of this communication.\n\nWhile you and I may differ in judgement, we need not in spirit, and I trust that nothing shall occur to disturb the pleasant relationship that has characterized all our business transactions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nP.S My address for two weeks will be:\n\nC/o Dr. H.J.

Mr. Woodsworth dated October 17th, and also your telegram. When Mr. Woodsworth replies I should like to have a copy of his letter. I agree with you that there is no need for haste.\n\nNow that the question is again unsettled, I would prefer to give the final decision myself, and I think no harm will be done if I were to postpone that decision until you hear from the Reverend Principal. I am well aware of your position and desires in this matter, and I promise my sympathetic attention to the question in all its bearings.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal, Brandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nMcKellar General Hospital\nFort William, Ontario\n\nOct. 24, 27\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nEnclosed is a letter from Mr. Woodsworth, with his proposed plan for a boys' playground at the Edmonton School. This is the information that I requested over two months ago, and is all that I require to convince me that the location and size of the Boys' Playground and also of the fields are very satisfactory to me. It is also self-evident that the site selected marked on the plan for the new building does not encroach upon the Boys' Playground. I believe this to be in harmony with your views and judgment.\n\nI so kindly urge me and shall urge Mr. Woodsworth to continue building according to your instructions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\nOctober 16th 1924.\n\nDear Brother Barrier;\n\nI shall try another letter and sketch which is the same as the last two I sent you. However there may be more detail in this one. Kindly keep the different colored lines quite distinct.\n\nThe red lines now mark the bounds of the girls' and boys' playgrounds. The arrows on the boys' playground indicate that they can go as far as they wish north and east. This is where the boys have been playing for some time now, and we have found \"no man's land,\" 50 yard wide, a very satisfactory barrier between the boys and the girls. One of our problems has been to keep the boys away from the chapel windows and the kitchen windows where the girls are. As it is, the boys' playground is just off the door yard between the school and the utility building.\n\nNow kindly note the purple line. This is the playground which would exist according to your figures and distances. In your last letter your smallest distance West and East of main building which should be used as playground is 150 yards. Lair 750 ft. It is only 45 yards from the main school building across the lawn to Mr. Goodlands house. So your plan would cut the town in two, destroy all our roads, and make a mud hole of all that ground in front of the house. Besides having foot ball and other ball right in front of the house, and surely people have some rights of privacy even if they do happen to live at an Indian school. Moreover, all approaches to the utility building would be through the boys' play ground. Even if you do insist that the house be placed due north of Mr. Goodlands present house his front door would be within a few yards of the foot ball ground. I would like to draw your attention also to another rule you laid down in a former letter respecting play-grounds. You maintained that it should be at least 50 yards from any building. I cannot see where you are consistent. Again, six years ago when we were moving Mr. Goodlands house you insisted that it be removed from the exact spot where now you insist that I build this house. This was\nboundary, you said, it was too near the barn farm. The spot I have chosen is farther from the barn and yet, what I consider, to be, within the residential district.\n\nKindly note what I have marked \"Door Yard.\" This is exactly what it is. It is not a play ground as such. Of course I have no objection to the boys playing between the school and the utility building at odd moments and in what always be useless, but for organized play I cannot see its possibilities. The spaces are limited here. The coal is brought around here. The boys use this space for going and coming between barns and school. The entrance to the utility building occupies a good deal of room. I cannot see where you get a play ground out of it, unless you unite into one heterogeneous whole, playground, lanes, road-ways and four yards.\n\nI do not think I can say very much more. If this does not appeal to you or Dr. Scott, I must of course obey departmental orders. I have tried to be absolutely fair in my presentation of the case and have given you my opinions and convictions very frankly. I feel that my close contact with actual conditions as they exist on the spot should count for something, as should also my experience. I have submitted the location to several men of judgment and they all agree with me. Dr. Scott was very definite when he was here. I shall now leave the matter in your hands to decide with Dr. Scott.\n\nI remain\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nJ. F. Woodworth\nOttawa, October 26, 1927.\n\nRev. T.

There was the finishing of the top flat, the implement shed, the soft water tank, granaries, repairs to Utility building, etc. I have included the poultry fencing in this account although it should have gone through the Regina Office. I have also included expenses connected with the breakdown of the pump. We had to buy tools to take out the pump, but did all the work ourselves. The Department has been advised of all these operations. I bought a small amount of hog fencing. Recently the toilets on the boys side got into such bad condition that further repair was impossible, so I had to get some new tanks and one new bowl. They were all out of commission and nothing else was possible. We did the work ourselves. I trust this voucher is satisfactory.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nJ.P.

I note the explanation of the Department that the Department will have funds to meet this cost, would it be satisfactory for me to arrange with a local firm for delivery of lumber and defer payment until convenient to Sept. We require between four and five tons of lumber - shingles - and this wholesale would not be about $32.00 per M. As per telegram - we would also require paper and nails.\n\nIf this is satisfactory - I would be glad to go ahead with the work this winter.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nD REGINA, SASK., April 2nd, 1930\n\nR\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Inspector Hurison's report of an inspection made at the St. Albert and Edmonton Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThe report on St. Albert is very satisfactory. I would recommend that the Department meet the request of the Sisters at this institution that a grant be given the Callihoo girl so that she may attend Normal School in September. I believe this is a case where further education would be of benefit.\n\nI am glad to note that decent mattresses have been supplied for the dormitories at the Edmonton School. I should be glad to see the straw-filled mattresses discarded at all schools where they are still in use.\n\nI am not prepared to recommend that a second well be put down at this institution at the present time. There is more water in the existing well than can be used, and it seems to me that some means should be found by which this water could be pumped to different parts of the grounds. To sink another well would mean almost the same expense as was incurred in putting down the first one, and there is no necessity for this, in my opinion. The matter of saving money is not very much considered at this school.\n\nYou will-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\n18/1925 (this was urgent)\nYou will note that the cold storage facilities at the Edmonton School are very poor, in fact they could not be much worse. I would again repeat that I think we should install a Frigidaire plant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nI visited this school on February 7th, and made a general inspection of the buildings. I found the buildings and equipment in excellent condition. The main building was clean and tidy throughout. Since my last visit wool mattresses have been supplied for the dormitories, and they add materially to the appearance and comfort of the beds.\n\nThe fire fighting equipment was carefully examined and found to be in good condition. A soft water storage tank has been provided to supply the boilers with water, and has been a source of satisfaction.\n\nThe question of a second well, which was discussed some time ago, was mentioned to me, and I looked over the situation and find that if it is thought advisable to sink a second well, this could be put down in close proximity to the present well and the present pumphouse utilized for the second pumping unit. The discharge pipe from the\nfrom the second unit could be connected with the present main water pipe to the school. The only building required would be a small lean-to over the well to the present pumphouse.\n\nI found the hog pen in a damp condition owing to ice forming on the roof of the building. This condition is bad for the hogs, and it was noted that several were crippled with rheumatism. In order to avoid this condition, it will be necessary to have a ceiling put in to permit of an air space and proper ventilation.\n\nI have already reported on the desire of the Principal to develop cattle and hog raising, and if they are to increase their effort in this direction, it will surely be necessary to provide more housing accommodation for the stock.\n\nI would again point out that they have no storage facilities for meat, even in the winter time. I noted that their meat supply was kept in a small vestibule at a little used outside entrance to the building.\n\nTheir stock consisted, at the time of my visit, of 125 hogs, 34 cows, 7 calves, and 14 work horses. They sold 7 steers and 3 cows last fall for $937.00.\n\nThere were 207 pupils in residence at the time of my visit. They presented a clean and tidy appearance and there was very little sickness in the school. I consider this a very excellent institution, and am pleased to report that the Indians are looking upon it with increasing favour, as is indicated by the fact that practically every Protestant child of school age from the Saddle Lake Agency is in attendance, and when I subsequently visited the Saddle Lake Agency, I did not hear a complaint against this school and a number of the parents\nparents of the children expressed their satisfaction in connection with it.\n\nMr. Woodsworth, the principal, is energetic, capable, and earnest in his efforts to promote the best interests of his school. Miss McDonald, the Matron, is a very capable woman and appears to co-operate in a harmonious manner with the principal. Care appears to be exercised in the selection of the staff at this school.\n\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., April 15th, 1930\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that I was at the Edmonton Indian Residential School on the 8th instant, and went into several matters that had been pending for some considerable time.\n\nOne of the matters discussed was an additional water supply. There is only one well here, which is the sole source of water supply for the school, and if something should happen, such as the rods breaking or becoming disconnected in the well it might be a matter of days before it could be fixed and the school would be without water in the meantime. In the event of anything like that happening the supplementary supply would be imperative, and for this reason I feel like recommending that a second well be sunk.\n\nIf water can be reached at about 140 feet, the cost for drilling and casing should not be more than between $600.00 and $800.00. A pump and engine would, of course, have to be supplied, and this might cost another $600.00. However, I do not see how we can get along without this additional well. At one time I did think that some other plan could be devised, but after visiting the school and looking carefully into the situation I am convinced that this is the only course to follow. The total cost should not exceed $1800.00.\n\nAnother matter-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAnother matter that was brought to my attention was the necessity for lining the hog pen. This would take about 5000 ft. of lumber, which could possibly be delivered for $250.00. I would strongly recommend that it be allowed.\n\nThe need of a barn for young heifers and calves was also gone into. I am getting figures on this and they will be submitted to you. We have such buildings at other schools and I think one should be supplied here.\n\nThe matter of supplying a refrigerator has been brought to the attention of the Department before. This, of course, is absolutely necessary; it is just a question of what is the best type to install.\n\nThe Calgary Power Company's line passes by this institution and I do not think the Department should do anything about the lighting system until we can use this power.\n\nA request was also made to have two carloads of sand sent there for use in the small children's playground. This might cost $200.00 or perhaps a little more, and I think it should be allowed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nWhen I was at Edmonton a short time ago, I discussed with Mr. Woodsworth the question of supplying him with a rough shed for sheltering young cattle during the winter months, similar to sheds we have at other schools. He promised that he would submit a plan to me for this shed, and it was pretty well understood that it should be a simple type of building. I now get a plan for a most elaborate shed; in fact, it is not a shed, it is a barn showing subdivision, stalls, etc., for which the lumber alone will cost $1,297.90, to say nothing of the cost of construction. I am utterly opposed to spending $2,000.00, or anything like it, for a shed for the Edmonton School. We have erected one of the finest barns in Alberta there, and another good cattle barn last year, and he now wants me to erect a third. If the Department wish me to give him a cow shed, I will go ahead and undertake the work. When I was with Mr. Woodsworth, he never suggested anything like what he is now asking for. I find Mr. Woodsworth most extravagant in his ideas and unfair in his demands.\n\nKindly advise me what you wish me to do in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nApril 10, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. GR.\n\nMr. Graham's letter of the 2nd instant refers to a supplementary water supply at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. $4,000 is available this fiscal year for the purpose. You will note that Mr. Graham states there is no necessity for another well; but, if you refer to his 403-11 A of May 18, 1925, you will find that he wrote in part: \"I wish to bring to your attention the inadequate water supply for fire protection at the Edmonton School. It seems to me we should sink another well so that in event of one giving out the other could be brought into action. I consider this a very important matter.\"\n\nAttached hereto is the Dominion Water Power Engineer's report and estimate and also another communication of November 13, 1929, from Commissioner Graham.\n\nWill you please bring the matter to the attention of Dr. Scott and, when the decision is reached, let me know if the funds are going to be used.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nIt should be forwarded as funds are low.\n\n[Signature]\nR.M.\nOct. 26.\nMay 2, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 20th of May last year, with reference to the water supply system at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Since your report was submitted some of the items included in your recommendation have been carried out but no action has yet been taken regarding the providing of an additional well. Funds are now available for this work, but if possible I should like to provide the water supply system required at a more reasonable cost, and I will be glad to receive a report from your Calgary office with any suggestions for the providing of more water for this school at a more reasonable cost than mentioned in your letter of May 20th last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. MacKenzie,\nActing, Ass't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nMay 5, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 403-11A U. of the 15th ultimo, with reference to a supplementary water supply and other requirements at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. The Department has asked the Dominion Water Power Branch to report concerning a supplementary system. The earlier recommendation involved a large amount of money, and I am asking for an inexpensive scheme that would remedy the situation. Funds are available for the urgent improvement to the hogpen, at a cost of $250, and for two earloads of sand for the children's playground, and you may proceed with the work. Please see that no unnecessary expense is incurred.\n\nI regret there are no funds at the present time for a second barn for young stock nor for a refrigerator at this school. A refrigerator, of course, would have to stand until we had power, and I shall be glad to know definitely concerning the location of the Calgary Power Company's line.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nOn the 23rd ultimo I wrote you in regard to furnishing a cattle shed at the Edmonton Residential School. I have now received a modified proposal from the Principal, in which he states that, if he is furnished with $1,200.00, he can move and alter an old building which can be made suitable for the suggested purpose. I would recommend that this amount be allowed him, and I shall be glad to have the Department's sanction to make the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 16, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 403-11A U. of the 6th instant, with reference to a cattle shed for the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Funds are available for this improvement and you may proceed with the work. Your estimate should not be exceeded. Please keep in mind the general instructions in the Deputy Superintendent General's 1-1-5 of the 14th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant with reference to a supplementary water system and other requirements at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, and note that the Department has asked the Dominion Water Power Branch to report concerning a supplementary system. If when this report is received you find it rather an expensive proposition, I would suggest that you do not act on it, as from what I know of the Dominion Water Power Branch they have expensive ideas.\n\nWe could supply a well and pump for the amount stated in my letter of April 15th, namely $1800.00. When we drilled the existing well at the Edmonton School the drillers went several hundred feet beyond water, with the object of making more money, and the cost was very heavy.\n\nI do not think the school will suffer very much from the lack of a cow barn this year, although they should at some time be supplied with a barn for the young stock. However, I wrote you further on the 3rd instant, pointing out that the Principal has reduced his estimate for this barn to $1200.00.\n\nI am writing to the Principal regarding the improvement to the hogpen, and the supplying of sand for the playground, for which you say funds are available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir,\n\nI have received your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the water supply system at the Edmonton residential school, copy of which has been sent to the Commissioner of Irrigation with the request that he prepare a report giving any suggestions for the providing of an additional supply of water for this school at a more reasonable cost than that mentioned in my letter of May 20th last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWith reference to your No. 110-0-5 of the 5th instant, I have received from Mr. Woodsworth particulars in regard to the cost of connecting the Edmonton school with the Calgary Power line. He informs me that the Calgary Power line will run about two miles distant from the school; that practically all charges will be absorbed in the regular monthly tariff which will be chargeable to the school, but that there will be probably about $100.00 cost in connection with switchboard changes and that they may require $100.00 deposit as a guarantee. He adds that the only other charges will be the motors required, which will cost about $200.00 a piece. At the present time I cannot see that more than two motors will be necessary. The initial cost therefore, of the change, based on the figures the Principal has supplied, will be approximately $600.00. Mr. Woodsworth states that the rates which were quoted to him will nearly cut their present cost in two, while giving them twice as much service.\n\nI shall be glad to know if this expenditure will be sanctioned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMay 28, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 403-11A U. of the 22nd instant, with reference to power which will be available in the near future for the Edmonton Indian Residential School. You may make arrangements, when timely, to connect up with the Calgary Power line. I note that the installation will cost approximately $200 and that two motors, at a cost of about $200 each, will be required. The present generating plant at Edmonton will be used at one of our other schools - instructions in relation thereto will be directed to you at a later date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I would also like to fix up the room of the Matron a little, as I think her position at the school deserves some recognition. Mr. Goodland would like his two front rooms papered and also the front hall. The work of the decorator will cost $258.00. The carpenter will cost about $40.00. I would appreciate it very much if the Department would authorize this expenditure.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F.

The Appropriation for Indian Education is completely assigned this year and I regret that I cannot authorize any expenditure for this purpose. A note will be taken for next year's Estimates.\n\nI may say that the Department is hoping to proceed with a supplementary water supply, and this will, no doubt, mean an expenditure of all the funds that can be allowed for improvements at your school this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Most of it in connection with his treatment of Syphilis cases. This before the supply sent from Ottawa.\n\nNo. 457 in favor of Johnston's Drug Stores for $13.25.\n\nSome years ago we secured a very effective Prescription for Scabies from Dr. Holmes when he was medical officer. Since then we have been using this ointment whenever necessary. It costs $2.00 a pound.\n\nNo. 458 in favor of National Drug and Chemical Company Limited for $17.50. This is our quarterly drug account. Which I think is very low.\n\nNo. 459 in favor of The Edmonton Paint and Glass Co. Ltd. for $41.50. This account consists of a variety of material for repairing and freshening up the school and property. We have done the work with our own help. There was considerable repair work to be done after this year of having such a full school, and I wish to keep the plant in fairly good repair.\n\nUnder another cover I am sending forward the quarterly report for June 16th 1930. In the case of the two Brandon Boys who ran away on April 27th, I only counted their attendance to the date on which they left. The other cases are normal.\n\nOn July 15th I sent Elizabeth Cardinal to her father near Fort McMurray. I shall send the account later.\n\nThe Brandon Children were returned in safety to Brandon on July 9th. Every one was in good health according to the doctor's examination. I sent to Dr. Doyle a statement of their health and any recommendations by the doctor. We have had a good year with them and nothing to regret except the six boys who deserted. I trust the Department is satisfied with our treatment.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.J.

In order to repair it would cost at least $75.00 and then would be a questionable job. It has been in use constantly for five years. A new one will cost less than $100.00. I request permission from the Department to purchase a new heater. The old one is practically junk.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 25, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 19th instant, I have to inform you that the Department will approve of your arranging for the purchase and installation of a new jacket heater for use at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, to replace the present heater which has become practically useless. It is noted you estimate the cost of the new jacket heater to be approximately $100. After you have made the purchase, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. F.

We have hundreds of installations of Frigidaire equipment in Northern Alberta and would be very pleased to show you various types of installations.\n\nFrigidaire operates entirely automatically and maintains the same even cold temperature constantly. It is carefree refrigeration.\n\nWe have pleasure in submitting our quotation for a complete installation. We have right here in Edmonton a competent organization of course to handle this work, and be available for service should it ever be required.\n\nIn the construction of the refrigerator in the space you have selected, we will remove the two window frames and brick in that area, construct front partition, construct ceiling, run partition between allotted space to provide two rooms, install two refrigerator doors, cover all inside walls and ceiling with corkboard and a finish of portland cement. The refrigerator would have a front width of 9' 6\" by a depth of 8' and be 7' 6\" high. Hardware for the doors, asphalt for sealing corkboard, labor etc., is all included.\n\nWe will install two Frigidaire cooling coils type 150 F.F. (one being in each room) and there will be a model 'C' Frigidaire water-cooled Compressor with 1 H.P motor 110-220 volt A.C. Illustrations are enclosed herewith.\n\nThe complete total price installed $1,645.00\n\nTwo men will be sent to handle the installation, one a contractor to change over the allotted space into a refrigerator and then the other a Frigidaire expert for the Frigidaire installation. We understand that you can supply certain help for these men if required.\n1866F Cooling Coil\n\nModel C. Water-Cooled Frigidaire Compressor.\n\nWeight 29 lbs., Length 47\", Height 27\".\n\nBecause of its large capacity, the Model C compressor is particularly suitable for large display cases and tall-in-pantry type installations. It will also handle very heavy loads, thus simplifying installations of Frigidaire equipment.\n\nWe trust you will advise us if there is any further information we can supply. Details as to how the quotation is made up are available.\n\nYour order will certainly be greatly appreciated and we will look forward to receiving same. We can assure you of careful, personal attention, to same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBRUCE ROBINSON ELECTRIC LTD\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI enclose herewith specifications and a price on installing a Frigidaire plant in the school. On June 21st 1929, letter No.110-0-5 you wrote asking me to furnish information regarding cold storage facilities.\n\nThe enclosed plan will fit into a room just off the kitchen and by all means the most convenient place in the building. Along with Mr. Inspector Murison I considered an outside building, but this would mean considerable expenditure, including concrete and the extensive use of ice. The cost in putting up one like they have at St. Albert would be considerably more than the cost of this Frigidaire. This would be a walk-in cupboard and quite up to date. The recent installation of the Calgary Power has also made it possible to install this new system with economy.\n\nI asked the company to include all costs in their price, such as a little brickwork and connections etc. If we can save anything we will of course do so.\n\nI trust this plan will be acceptable to the Department.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nJ.F.

DIA\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith Voucher No. 476 in favour of the Electrical Engineers, Limited, of Edmonton, for $994.54, in connection with the installing of motors, lights, etc., at the Edmonton School, as authorized by Dept. letter 110-0-5 of the 23th May, 1930.\n\nMr. Woodsworth, Principal of the School, has exceeded his authority by nearly $400.00, and my opinion is that he could very well have taken the matter up with this office before spending this additional money.\n\nHe was asked in the first place for a full report covering what was actually needed, and he explains now that as the workmen proceeded they discovered extra work that would have to be done. This is probably true, but at the same time there are some things included in this account which were not absolutely necessary. He states that a new motor was put in for the cream separator. He should be written to and told that this installation should not have been made without the proper authority. He had lights installed in the pigpen. It was not necessary for him to do this until he had authority.\n\nThis is not the first time Mr. Woodsworth has exceeded his authority, in fact he generally does so, and then comes back with a letter of this kind. If we carried on all our business in this way we would be called upon to increase our appropriations at every turn. I think in future it would be well to have one of our officers go to the Edmonton School when there is work to be done, and outline same and close the contract.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, February 3, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Paget.\n\nMr. Ferri.\n\nI have noted the remarks written on Mr. Graham's letter of the 27th January with reference to Mr. Woodsworth's unauthorized expenditure at the school. Under the circumstances I do not think we should be asked to pay this and if he incurs unauthorized expenditures he should be prepared to charge it to his own revenue, which he should do in this case.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nOttawa, February 3rd., 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 27th ultimo, No. 403-11 A.U., enclosing voucher No. 476 in favor of the Electrical Engineers Ltd., of Edmonton, for $994.84, in connection with the installing of motor, light, etc., at the Edmonton Residential School, I am directed to state that, in view of the representations made in your letter, the Department does not think that we should be asked to pay the extra expenditure incurred by the Principal, which was not authorized, and he should therefore be prepared to pay these extras from his own revenue. The first item was authorized in the Department's letter of the 26th May last and will be paid when further funds become available, and an amended voucher covering that item only should be submitted later.\n\nThe Principal should also be informed that if he incurs unauthorized expenditure of this nature in future, he should be prepared to charge the same to the revenue of the institution. The voucher is herewith returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nW.M.

M. Graham;\nIndian Commissioner;\nRegina Sask.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI enclose herewith Voucher 477 in favor of Marshall-Wells Alberta Company Limited for .\n\nThis voucher to be charged to my appropriation of $1200.00.\n\nThese accounts include practically all the hardware used in connection with the repairs to plant since last April. It of course includes the hardware used for our barns etc., such as nails, screws, bolts etc. The item of $25.56 covers the fixtures for the doors. There is, you will note, a number of plumbing items. We put a water line into the pig pen. Did all the work ourselves. All the items are for plant, and will I trust be found in order.\n\nThis is I think the last of the accounts involved in that appropriation of $1200.00. The following is a summary:\n\nMoving old Barn .................. $86.00\nHayward Lumber Co. .............. 240.95\nNorthwest Lumber co. ............. 559.08\nEdmonton Paint and Glass co.... 29.95\nMarshall-Wells Alberta Co ....... 157.84\n\nTotal ................................ $1073.82\nUnused Balance .................... $126.18\n\n$1200.00\n\nAs indicated before considerable of this money has been used for other general purposes usually included under emergency so that in this appropriation I have not overstepped the mark. We have done all our own work and have made every item count. You will no doubt receive a report of our work from Mr. Murison.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSir:-\n\nI beg to forward Edmonton Residential School Voucher No. 477 for the sum of $157.84 in favor of Marshall-Wells Alberta Limited. I also enclose a copy of the Principal's covering letter, from which I gather that he received authority from the Department to expend the sum of $1200.00 on repairs etc., during the fiscal year. He refers to his appropriation of $1200.00 and it does not appear that I have any record of this on file. May I ask if there are many schools in the West submitting estimates direct to the Department independent of the estimates received from Indian Agents. It seems to me that some uniformity should be exercised with regard to estimated requirements of our residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 6, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 41167-W of May 16th, last, with reference to a supplementary water supply system for the Edmonton Indian Residential School. I write to enquire if there is any further report now available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 6, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 403-11 A.U. of the 30th ultimo, with reference to an account in connection with the Edmonton Indian Residential School. You did not enclose the voucher nor the copy of the Principal's letter. It is possible that he refers to the estimate of $1,200 for repairs during the year.\n\nCertain prairie province Indian residential schools, that do not come under the jurisdiction of any particular Indian agent, submit requests from time to time, either through your office or direct to Ottawa. This group of schools comprises the following: Brandon, Elkhorn, Qu'Appelle, Edmonton and St. Albert. Of course, practically all Indian residential schools forward requests for estimates through their church authorities.\n\nPrincipal Woodsworth has not received authority from the Department to expend any specified sum on repairs. I find that the only authority in this connection that was directed to him during the calendar year 1930 was permission to install a jacket heater, at an approximate cost of less than $100. This, of course, was an emergency. He has submitted a few small accounts for repairs to mechanical plant. Whenever funds can be found, the Department supplies at least the materials that are necessary to keep the government-owned buildings in repair. At other times, the principal is asked to meet the cost from school earnings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter 110-0-5 of 6th instant informing me that Edmonton School voucher 477 and copy of the Principal's letter were not attached to my letter of 30th ultimo. In reply I beg to say they were sent out for mailing clipped or pinned to the letter and I shall be glad if you will cause search to be made in case they have been placed on the wrong desk. It is possible that they found their way into the wrong envelope but if so it is difficult to understand why the letter, which arrived safely, did not accompany them.\n\nI will secure further copies from the Principal of the school.\n\nI may say the $1200.00 appropriation referred to is the amount authorized for repairs to the Cow Barn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR MURISON ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE EDMONTON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL JANUARY 20, 1931, FORWARDED UNDER COVER OF COMMISSIONER GRAHAM'S NO. 403-11 OF FEBRUARY 15, 1931.\n\n---\n\nThe cow barn provides accommodation for the milch cows only and part of the horse barn is being used to house the other cattle. A shed is required for the young stock and the Principal stated that if he were granted $600.00 for the necessary material he could have a suitable shed built and would have the work done by the members of the staff.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR MURISON ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE EDMONTON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL JANUARY 20, 1931, FORWARDED UNDER COVER OF COMMISSIONER GRAHAM'S NO. 403-11 OF FEBRUARY 13, 1931.\n\n---\n\nOriginal on No. 110-1-1.\n\nWater is piped from the pump house to the piggery and it will be an easy matter to connect the system to the cow barn. This system would be more efficient if a small pressure tank was installed in the pump house. A 500 gallon tank would fill the requirement.\n\n---\n\nnoted for K.S.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR MURISON ON HIS\nINSPECTION OF THE EDMONTON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL\nSCHOOL JANUARY 20, 1931, FORWARDED UNDER COVER\nOF COMMISSIONER GRAHAM'S NO. 403-11 OF FEBRUARY\n13, 1931.\n\n---\n\nThe fire hose and extinguishers were examined\nand found in good condition. The building is provided\nwith pole as well as iron stairway fire escapes.\nThe Principal pointed out that the pole escapes from\nthe dormitories were too long an unbroken drop and in\npractice serious injuries to the smaller children have\nbeen averted only by a member of the staff catching\nthem as they came down the pole. This danger could\nbe overcome by placing a landing platform at the second\nfloor which would cut the length of the drop in half.\nI would recommend that this be done.\n\nIt was also noted that there are no seating facilities\nin the boys' playroom and they have been using the wash\nstands to rest on. I would suggest that plank seats or\nlockers be furnished for this room. A second bath is\nalso needed for the boys. Only the tub is required,\nas there is a connection already in place and practically\nno expense will be entailed in installing the second tub.\n\nThe pumping equipment is working satisfactorily\nand there appears to be an inexhaustible supply of water\nin the well. I mentioned in a former report that a second\nwell would be advisable to ensure a continuance of the\nwater supply in the event of the pump in the present well\ngoing out of business as it did at one time leaving the\ninstitution without water for several days. I am still\nof the opinion that a second well would be advisable and\nupon looking into the matter I find that the present pump\nhouse is large enough to take care of both wells and the\noutlay for the additional well would be the cost of another\npump and sinking the well.\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., Feb. 13, 1931.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF ABOVE DATE NO. 403-11\nON FILE 110-0-1.\n\nYou will note what the Inspector has to say regarding the pole fire escapes, which have too long a drop. I think the suggested change would be made by the Principal and his staff if he were told that he should do it. Of course, if the Department will consent to attend to the matter he will not turn a hand to it.\n\nThe Inspector draws attention to the fact that there is no seating accommodation in the boy's playroom and they have been using the washstands to rest on. I think they should have seats of some description in their recreation room, otherwise they will sit on the floor. It would not cost much to put plank seats around the playroom, and this should be done.\n\nMention is made of the need for a second well at the Edmonton School. Personally, I cannot see why there is any more urgency for a second well at this point than to have second wells at all our schools.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\nOttawa, February 18, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 403-11A U of the 30th ultimo, in connection with the expenditure of the sum of $1200 for repairs, etc., during the present fiscal year at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that it is found all accounts, with the exception of the expenditure in moving old barn, $56.00, and the account of the Edmonton Paint & Glass Company, $29.95, have been received. The copy of the Principal's letter dated January 24th, last, regarding these accounts was also received. I regret that when writing you on the 6th instant in this connection these accounts were inadvertently mislaid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, February 18, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 403-11 enclosing Mr. Inspector Murison's report on his recent inspection of the Edmonton and St. Albert Indian Residential Schools.\n\nRegarding the Edmonton School, the Department notes that conditions generally are satisfactory.\n\nRegarding the pole fire escapes, the change suggested by the Inspector in having a landing platform placed at the second floor, to cut the length of the drop from the pole fire escape, should be carried out by the school authorities, and the expense required should be provided from per capita earnings or other receipts. I shall be pleased if you will arrange to see that this platform is installed.\n\nRegarding the seating accommodation in the boys' playroom, you may authorize that plank seats be installed around the playroom. It is considered, if the plank or other material required were supplied, that the staff could perform any labour required. Accounts may be submitted in the usual manner covering the cost of the material.\n\nRegarding the installing of a 500 gallon tank, which is required to connect the water system with the cow barn, and the erection of a shed for the young stock, I have to say that these requirements have been noted.\n\nA separate communication will be directed to you regarding the bread mixer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter No. 403-11A U of the 9th inst. to hand in reference to account of Electrical Engineers Limited.\n\nThe contents of the letter are noted. According to request I herewith forward an amended Voucher No. 476 in favor of Electrical Engineers Limited for $590.45.\n\nIn doing this I would also request that this be not considered a settlement in full of this account by the department and that I be given a further opportunity of presenting a further Voucher for the other amounts involved. I do not consider it at all just merely on a point of formal authorization to refuse payment of some at least of these accounts.\n\nI quite admit that technically I am in the wrong and that I have exceeded authority, but on the other hand no new work was undertaken and practically all the work was necessary in order for the lights to be at all possible in the school. I think the department will admit that the contract was kept within bounds.\n\nI could not foresee all the repairs and adjustments which were necessary. Some years ago we had a fire here which was blamed on wiring. I was told by the electric people that for the new power much that was done was unsafe or would not pass inspection. What would the department have me do with numerous shorts and grounds? I would suppose that in these matters a principal would be allowed to exercise some discretion. If I had attempted to make any elaborate changes or additions it would have been different, but with the exception of the two items of the old invoice; viz:- Invoices Nos. 2898 and 2897 both amounts $26.25 and $17.10 respectively practically all has been work necessary to put the electric system in working order both for safety and utility.\n\nTake for instance the item of $11.00 connected with installing the push button. I was told that as a matter of law and safety this was necessary as there had to be some means of stopping the motor which was in the next room. The alternate was a cumbersome shift rod which had to push the belt...\nOff the pully. This would have necessitated another pully and the cost would have been about the same. If an official of the Department had been there I would respectfully suggest that he would have done about the same as I did, as indicated in a former letter most of the cost is labor. There was a lot of time spent but not wasted and the Department is aware of the charges of skilled mechanics. If the Department does not wish to pay this extra account, I would appreciate some word as to what they would have had me do under the circumstances, or what could have been done by anyone.\n\nAnother matter:- The Department authorized last year the expenditure of $1200.00 for a new pig or cattle barn. I sent in vouchers for only $1073.62 leaving an unused balance of $126.38. In these vouchers I included many items usually sent into the Department as emergency, such as plumbing, etc. I also drew a small load of lumber for the Lister people for erecting the two engines sent to Saskatchewan. We used all our own labor and I did my best to save the department in every way. Would it be in order to request that this unused $126.38 be applied on this electric account. $200.00 is a lot of money to take out of per capita for capital expenditure. I do not mind paying some for taking a little independent action, but another $400.00 on the top of assuming the main construction charge is rather heavy. I know that I have done this more than once, but I have always asked for inspection and my action has always been approved.\n\nI trust this letter has not been too long or too detailed, but I feel that I have much to justify any initiative in the matter. I may add that at this time we had dozens of children sick in bed with measles and flu and were without lights, so I was anxious for the work to be completed. I trust that you will forward this letter, or a copy, to Ottawa with this further information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. J. F. Woodsworth\n\nPrincipal.\n\nI believe you have a copy of the complete account.\nSir:-\n\nAdverting to Department letter 110-0-5 C of the 3rd instant, I beg to enclose herewith voucher No. 476 for the sum of $96.45. I also enclose a copy of the covering letter from the school principal, setting out the circumstances under which the extra expense was incurred. Will the Department please advise me if the amount saved on the barn can be applied towards the expense incurred in connection with the installation of the electric light.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

On opening the sewer pipe leading from the septic tank it was found that this pipe was actually higher by 3\u00bd inches than the outlet itself. Of course this had gradually blocked up and when we found out the trouble the water was running out the door of the tank. It was a dirty mess both inside and out, but is again in fine order, with the former defects remedied and a much better gravel for filtering purposes. See my letter of December 30th 1924.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nREV. J. F. WOODSWORTH, B.A.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA, 10th, 1927.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nSome time ago I received a letter from Mr. Commissioner Graham stating that The Department objected to paying an extra of some $400.00 on an account connected with the recent installation of the Calgary Power. I wrote the Department a second letter making a full explanation of the circumstances but to date I have not received a reply. I wrote the letter through Mr. Graham and enclosed with it an amended voucher no. 476 for $596.45. My request was that the Department reconsider this account at least in part.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 24, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to voucher No. 476, for $596.45. The Department has given favourable consideration and the account will be paid as soon as funds are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nReferring to the third paragraph of your letter No. 110-0-5 dated February 18th, in connection with putting in extra platforms to reduce the length of the drop from the pole fire escapes at the Edmonton Residential School, I may inform you that I have made further enquiry into this matter, and find that this work cannot be performed by the Principal and his staff. The cutting of the pipes and the installation of the platforms entails more work than I had at first anticipated.\n\nThere are 6 pole escapes from this building; two at the east, 2 at the west, and 2 at the north sides of the building. This will necessitate the installation of 6 new platforms. The Principal suggests that the 3\" poles at the east and west ends of the building be replaced with 2\" poles as the 3\" poles are too large for the smaller children, and also that the openings be made smaller at the upper landings as the little children are frightened when reaching over too big a hole.\n\nThe Edmonton Iron Fence & Wire Works have submitted a price of $790.25 for the material and work in connection with the suggested changes. This would mean a heavy expenditure from the school earnings, and the question of payment might be re-considered by the Department. I am enclosing a sketch of the suggested changes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 1, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 403-11A U. of the 28th ultimo, regarding the pole fire escapes and the putting in of extra platforms to reduce the length of the drop at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that it will require six new platforms and that the pole fire escapes at the east and west ends of the building should be replaced with poles of smaller dimension than those at present in use; also that the opening in the upper landing be made smaller for the little children. The estimate which you submit for carrying out the above improvements has been noted. The expenditure required will be noted for our Estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention Deputy Minister:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn November last we completed work at the Indian School here to the value of $1,002.64. Up to date no portion of this account has been received at this office.\n\nWe would appreciate it very much if you would look into this matter and if our account is in order have a cheque mailed to us covering the amount.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nELECTRICAL ENGINEERS LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nBranch Manager\nOttawa, April 9, 1931.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, regarding payment of your account for the electrical work carried out by your firm at the Edmonton Indian Residential School to the amount of $1002.64.\n\nIn reply I have to say that a cheque to the amount of $596.45 was recently forwarded, which is the full amount this Department is providing in payment of your account. You should look to the Reverend Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School for payment of the balance due.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nElectrical Engineers Limited,\n10165 - 101st St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI have received your letter of February 6th with regard to a supplementary water supply system for the Edmonton Indian Residential School, and regret the delay in replying to this letter.\n\nWe have not yet received any further report from Mr. Tempest on this matter, but he has been requested to arrange to have one prepared as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Since the fire six years ago it seems that every so often this happens. Otherwise the mangle is in good shape and I am glad the cost is not more than it is.\n\nI trust this account is in order;\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nCalgary, July 3, 1930.\n\nThe Commissioner of Irrigation,\nDept. of the Interior,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my inspection in connection with the proposal to improve the water supply of the Edmonton Indian Residential School near St. Albert, Alberta.\n\nDate of inspection: June 27, 1930\n\nSince I reported on this water supply on May 10, 1929, several improvements have been made. In the first place an underground rain water tank has been constructed of about 9,000 gals. capacity. Water is drawn from this by means of a steam ejector to supply the small service tank from which the boilers draw their supply by their own injectors; provision is also made for heating the tank by means of a jet of steam; last winter, the rain water supply being insufficient, snow was shovelled into the tank and melted by this jet. This work appears to have been very economically carried out.\n\nThe power head or pump jack which was condemned in my last report has been replaced by a new Myers self oiling power head; repairs have also been made to the drop pipe and pump rods in the well which makes them more accessible.\n\nAdditional hydrants have been provided in the building.\n\nIt has been proposed, and I understand sanctioned, to bring power in from the Calgary Power Company's line which I believe is about 1\u00bd miles away at present. I have not concerned myself with the details of this, but assume for this report that three phase, 60 cycle, 110-120 volt electricity will be available.\n\nI further understand that the purchase of a 7\u00bd h.p. motor to replace the gasoline engine driving the pump jack has been sanctioned.\n\nThe proposed improvements outlined by Mr. Woodsworth are briefly as follows:\n\n1. To drill a new well about 20 feet from the existing well in a position where he feels sure of tapping the same supply at a depth of 165 or 175 feet; the power head at this well to be worked from the same motor as the existing well by means of a line of shafting.\n2. To put in two additional 1000-gallon pressure tanks in line with the existing two and a small one at the pump house to supply the stock watering troughs.\n\nIf we accept the general principle of these improvements I should modify them slightly. The location of the new well is chosen because Mr. Woodsworth feels certain that it is possible to get water there from the same source as the existing well. This is quite true, but I think that if a new well is drilled it is worth while attempting to strike an independent source of supply. Last year there seemed to be good reasons for putting the new well near the boiler house and I think these reasons still hold. I consider that an expenditure up to $400 would be justified in trying out another site before returning to the locality of the original well.\n\nIn any case I should prefer the pumping machinery on the new well to be entirely separate unit. This need not entail increased expenditure as a 12\" strike power head with air compressor attachment coupled to a 5 h.p. motor with automatic starter equipment can be purchased for less than the price of the power head on the existing well and will be quite sufficient to supply the school. The provision of an automatic starter will ensure the pressure tanks being reasonably full at all times instead of practically empty as they must be in the mornings at present.\n\nThe proposed small pressure tank in the pump house can be almost automatically eliminated. A check-valve will be needed above each well to prevent one pumping into the other; at present there is a check-valve at the pressure tanks in the boiler house which prevents back pressure on the well. If this be removed to just above the well the farm trough can be fed from the pressure tanks.\n\nThe cost of this installation will be as follows:\n\nAllowance for trial well (may not be needed) $400\nCost of well 175 feet deep with 5 5/8 casing 4\" drop pipe, brass cylinder and cypress rods. $1000\nMyers 12\" stroke self oiling working head with 5 h.p. 3 phase motor, air compressor and automatic starter. 420\nTwo 1000-gal. pressure tanks each $500 1000\nValves and piping 80\nHousing pump, motor and pressure tanks 400\nContingencies 300\n\n$3600\n\nIf a well of good quality and quantity be obtained and this machinery be installed, the school will have a first class water supply for domestic purposes.\n\nI do not feel that the same can be said about fire protection. The two existing pressure tanks and the two new ones will have a total capacity of 4000 gallons but when deduction is made for air space, and the probability of them being partially empty, about 2000 gallons is the\nmost that can be relied on in case of fire. This might give about twenty minutes supply at two nozzles, in which time the two pumps would supply about 400 gallons additional.\n\nThere is the rain-water tank with a capacity of about 9000 gallons; it had to be filled with snow last winter, and is almost empty at present. The water in it is there to be used and is only replaced when rainfall occurs. In the circumstances I do not consider that any expenditure on pumping machinery to make it available in case of fire would be justified. If water is in this tank when the fire brigade arrives from Edmonton it will be available for them to use.\n\nAlthough the main shell of the building is of brick and hollow tile construction this quantity of water appears to be a somewhat meagre provision. If development is to be along the lines set out above further pressure tank storage can be provided at 80\u00a2 to $1.00 per gallon of water actually available for fighting fire up to the limit that the Department is able to spend.\n\nOn the other hand a 20,000-gallon elevated tank 100 feet high (the building is about 50 feet) would cost in the neighbourhood of $8,000 and could be kept practically full so that water would be available at about 40\u00a2 per gallon.\n\nBy the method outlined in my report last year some 20,000 gallons exclusive of rainfall would be available for fire fighting purposes at a cost on an equivalent basis of between $5000 and $6000 or about 20\u00a2 per gallon. This system suffered from the disadvantage that it would be necessary to start up an engine if a fire should occur.\n\nAs regards the pressure, the pressure-tanks would give the best pressure at first, while the pump method would give more than the elevated tank, but the last mentioned method would be the least liable to break down.\n\nIt is very difficult to decide upon a recommendation without some knowledge of how much the Department is prepared to spend and unwise to make partial expenditures which do not form part of a co-ordinated whole.\n\nIf the Department is only prepared to spend some $3000 or $4000 then the scheme set forth seems to be the best, but if the amount they have available exceeds $6,000 and particularly if it amounts to $6,000 I should recommend that it be spent upon storage and fire fighting equipment rather than well drilling.\n\nThe existing well is an excellent well; its quality is fair although it contains some soda which makes it unpalatable after storage. In quantity it is quite adequate. It is said to have yielded 40 gallons per minute on test without lowering. When I was there last week the pump was only making 18 strokes per minute or about 10 gallons. Even on a laundry day it would apparently not run more than half time so that there is a large reserve supply.\nThe case for an additional well is based upon the possibility of a break-down. This might happen through the failure of the engine or motor drive or of the power head or of something going wrong in the well itself such as a break of the rods or the drop pipe. I am also informed that sand is coming slowly into the well and that at some date it will require cleaning out.\n\nThe repairs to the well have removed most of the dangers of a break-down there and the existing gasoline engine might serve as a stand-by to the motor already sanctioned, so that the case for an additional well does not seem so strong as it was a year ago.\n\nIf storage is provided the objection to using the stored water for drinking purposes could be overcome by bye-passing it and using directly from the existing system; while the taste might be endured for the time when repairs are being made.\n\nI am not prepared to say that a second well will not be required at some date but my own opinion is that with adequate storage it can be indefinitely delayed.\n\nMy report of last year included a considerable amount for piping separate firelines to the hydrants and for other fire fighting equipment, which may be eliminated if it is not considered desirable to spend so much money. It would also appear that by helping the contractor with labour and cartage Mr. Woodsworth can carry out concrete and building work at a cheaper rate than a direct contract can be let at.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) F. R. Burfield\nSir:\n\nI am attaching for your information two copies of Mr. F. R. Burfield's report dealing with his inspection in connection with the proposal to improve the water supply at the Indian Residential School near St. Paul, Alberta.\n\nFrom Mr. Burfield's report you will note that he is not altogether in favor of drilling a second well in the vicinity of the present one but prefers to drill at another site first and so have an entirely independent source of supply. On this point I quite agree with Mr. Burfield, should it be found necessary at any time to put down another well.\n\nIt is pointed out in the report that it is exceedingly difficult to arrive at any conclusion until we are advised what funds can be made available for improving the water supply conditions at this site. It would seem that by the construction of an elevated tank of some twenty thousand gallon capacity, one hundred feet high, adequate fire protection would be ensured and no doubt the present supply would be sufficient to take care of this reserve. If, on the other hand, sufficient funds are not available for this expenditure\u2014which Mr. Burfield has estimated at approximately eight thousand dollars, the other minor changes which he has suggested in the earlier part of his report would seem the most desirable.\n\nWe are of the opinion that under existing conditions there is not adequate provision for fire fighting. If a fire occurred, especially in winter, it could be handled more expeditiously with an automatic pumping system. Also, an elevated storage tank affords greater security than any other kind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sgd.) J. S. Tempest,\nCommissioner of Irrigation.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Reclamation,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of February 5th last regarding a supplementary water supply system for the Edmonton Indian Residential School, I find that a further report by Mr. F. R. Burfield was sent you on July 15th last, but I enclose herewith an additional copy of this report together with copy of the covering letter received from the Commissioner of Irrigation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nEDMONTON, May 12th 1931\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nA year ago, on June 14/30, I wrote the Department requesting authority to have my house redecorated, this with a little carpenter work to cost about $300.00. This work also to include some decorating to Mr. Goodland's house and also the room of the Matron. The Department stated that at the time funds were not available, but that a note of the item would be made for this year. If funds are available I would appreciate an appropriation for this purpose in the near future.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, May 27, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, requesting authority to have the Principal's residence at the Edmonton Indian Residential School redecorated, also to have some redecorating done to Mr. Goodland's house and the matron's room.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that our appropriation for the current fiscal year was considerably reduced, and it is only possible to authorize the more urgent repairs at residential schools this year. I regret, therefore, that there are no funds available to provide the cost of the above redecorating.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal, Indian Res. School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nREV. J. F. WOODSWORTH, B.A.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nEDMONTON, May 26th 1931.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nOur Silo which was erected some years ago is going to pieces with the rot caused by moisture. It can be repaired by putting upright planks about ten feet up from the bottom and putting iron clamps around to draw the joints together. The silo will not stand the pressure of another year, and a repair now would do for some time. I do not know exactly the amount required to do the job. We would do most of the work ourselves. It would take about 1500 feet of lumber (plank) and four girdles of iron with necessary bolts etc. I would think it would take from $100.00 to $125.00 to do the job. I would be glad if the Department would authorise this work.\n\nYours Truly:\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 4, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to the repairs required to the silo at the Edmonton Indian Residential School and giving an estimate of the cost of the materials required in having the repairs carried out.\n\nIn reply I have to say that our appropriation for the present fiscal year has been considerably cut and I regret that the Department will not be able to provide the funds required in having the repairs to the silo carried out. Could not the school arrange to have the cost of these repairs paid from their per capita earnings or other receipts?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nFeb. 12th 1931.\n\nMr. W. M. Graham;\nIndian Commissioner;\nRegina Sask.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nYour letter No.403-IIA U of 9th Inst. to hand in reference to account of Electrical Engineers Limited.\n\nThe contents of the letter are noted. According to request I am herewith forward an amended Voucher No.476 in favor of Electrical Engineers Limited for $596.45.\n\nIn doing this I would also request that this be not considered a settlement in full of this account by the Department and that I be given a further opportunity of presenting a further Voucher for the other amounts involved. I do not consider it at all just merely on a point of formal authorization to refuse payments of some at least of these accounts. I quite admit that technically I am in the wrong and that I have exceeded authority, but on the otherhand no new work was undertaken and practically all the work was necessary in order for the light to be at all possible in the school. I think the Department will admit that the contract was kept within bounds. I could not foresee all the repairs and adjustments which were necessary. Some years ago we had a fire here which was blamed on wiring. I was told by the electric people that for the new power much that was done was unsafe or would not pass inspection. What would the Department have me do with numerous shorts and grounds. I would suppose that in these matters a\nPrincipal would be allowed to exercise some discretion. If I had attempted to make any elaborate changes or additions it would have been different, but with the exception of the two items on the old invoice:-Viz:- Invoices Nos.2896 and 2897 with amounts $29.25 and $17.10 respectively practically all has been work necessary to put the electric system in working order both for safety and utility.\n\nTake for instance the item of $15.00 connected with installing the push button. I was told that as a matter of law and safety this was necessary and as there had to be some means of stopping the motor which was in the next room. The alternate was a cumbersome shift rod which had to push the belt off the pully. This would have necessitated another pully and the cost would have been about the same. If an official of the Department had been there I would respectfully suggest that he would have done about the same as I did. As indicated in a former letter most of the cost is labor. There was a lot of time spent but not wasted and the Department is aware of the charges of skilled mechanics. If the Department does not wish to pay this extra account I would appreciate some word as to what they would have had me do under the circumstances, or what could have been done by anyone.\n\nAnother matter:- The Department authorized last year the expenditure of $1200.00 for a new pig or cattle barn. I sent in vouchers for only $1073.82 leaving an unused balance of $126.18. In these vouchers I included many items usually sent into the Department as emergency, such as plumbing, etc. I also\nDrew a small load of lumber for the Lister people for crating the two engines sent to Saskatchewan. We used all our own labor and I did my best to save the Department in every way. Would it be in order to request that this unused $126.82 be applied on this electric account. $400.00 is a lot of money to take out of per capita for capital expenditure. I do not mind paying some for taking a little independent action, but another $400.00 on the top of assuming the main construction charge is rather heavy. I know that I have done this more than once, but I have always asked for inspection and my action has always been approved.\n\nI trust this letter has not been too long or too detailed, but I feel that I have much to justify any initiative in the matter. I may add that at this time we had dozens of children sick in bed with measles and flu and were without lights, so I was anxious for the work to be completed. I trust that you will forward this letter, or a copy to Ottawa with this further information.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nI believe you have a copy of the complete account.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nREV.

I did not receive a reply to this letter so am sending this copy to you for consideration. I have nothing further to add, except that $400.00 seems a lot to take from my per capita grant for work so obviously necessary.\n\nYours Truly:\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 10, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication which you forwarded to Mr. Commissioner Graham, Regina, in reference to settlement in full of the account of Electrical Engineers Limited covering the cost of work carried out by them at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the full amount the Department was able to provide in settlement of this account was $596.45. Our appropriation has been considerably reduced for the current year, and I regret that it will not be possible to pay the balance of the account rendered by the above firm. We will be unable to apply the unexpended amount in the erection of the cattle barn towards payment of the expenditure incurred in the work carried out by Electrical Engineers Limited, as all our accounts for the last fiscal year have now been closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

A. Lister & Company (Canada) Limited for $50.56.\n\nThe Department will note that the total account is $650.56. This includes the price of the pump which was put in the pump house in September 1929, in exchange for the one sold to Burns and Co. for which I received $600.00. This left me considerable money to spend on repairs to the lighting plant, which was a Lister plant. This $50.56 is the balance over and above the six hundred dollars which I have paid in repairs for the lighting plant. The Department will note that I have paid this $600.00. This lighting plant was taken over by Mr. Graham last fall. This account has been held and I am now trying to get it settled.\n\nI trust this voucher will receive favorable consideration from The Department.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 15, 1931.\n\nRev.

Ltd. for $24.71.\n\nSee your letter F. 110-0-5 of 10th Inst.\n\nYou will note that in this corrected voucher I have added an item which was omitted in the previous voucher, but is quite in order as a necessary repair, and should have been included.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that on my recent visit to the Edmonton Residential School I was surprised to see that the roof of this building is in bad shape and will require considerable repairing and painting at once. A large number of the asbestos slate shingles have blown off and will need replacing. Upon examination it will no doubt be found that others are in bad shape. The ridge board has blown off and will have to be replaced. The woodwork around the windows and doors outside will certainly have to be painted next spring and an amount should be put in the school estimates to provide for this. In my opinion this work cannot remain over for another year.\n\nReverend Woodsworth, the Principal, has an idea that we should extend the fire escape nearer to the ground or build some kind of platform for landing purposes. I question whether this should be done. I think that if a fire took place some person could catch the children as they come down. However, I would like to have your opinion on this.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOct. 1, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIt has been reported to the Department that the roof of the main building is in need of repair. Would you kindly submit a full report with an estimate of the cost of making such repairs as are absolutely necessary to the roof of this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSECRETARY.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodworth,\nPrincipal,\nEdmonton Indian School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nW. REGINA, SASK., 27th October, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nOn the 19th ultimo I wrote you drawing attention to the immediate need of effecting some repairs to the roof of the Edmonton Residential School, which I was surprised to find in bad shape. I have not heard from you on the subject, and, as the matter is urgent, I think steps ought to be taken at once to remedy this condition. Will you please let me know if the matter is being attended to. I also drew attention to some outside painting which ought to be provided for next year. I hope this is being given attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 12, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of the first ultimo, regarding the roof of the main building at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Please let me have a full report with estimate of the cost of any repairs that are absolutely necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, November 12, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your 403-11A U., of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the repairs to the roof of the Edmonton Indian Residential School. The Department wrote to the Reverend Principal upon receipt of your earlier communication, asking for a report with estimate of the cost. I have not yet heard from him, so I am writing again in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton Alta.\nNov. 21st 1931.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nCtawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn reply to your letter of Oct. 1st 1931 No. 110-0-5 and also that of Nov. 12th, I may say that I have at last some information regarding the repairs to the roof of this building.\n\nAs far as I can learn there is no agent here for the asbestos slate shingles which were put on this building in the first place. Then it will be necessary to send to Winnipeg to get any shingles of this type. Yesterday I had an agent of this shingle firm out to the school to look into the needs of the case. The shingles which were put on were of the lightest nature and evidently were put on very carelessly. About 120 feet of the ridge shingles are off. Have from time to time been blown off by the wind, and several dozen of the flat roof shingles, also some of the flashing. The ridge shingles will cost about $60.00, the other shingles $23.50 for the six pieces, and the flashing and other material say $16.50, making a total for material of about $100.00. The labor may be estimated at about $50.00, and roof work is not very easy. This is just an estimate, but I think it is fairly close.\n\nYours Truly:\n\nJ. F. Woodworth\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 27, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, giving an estimate of the cost of the materials required in repairing the roof of the building at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure of approximately $150 in the purchase of the shingles, flashing and other materials required, and for the labour.\n\nAfter the repairs have been completed, please forward your account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the materials and for the labour employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mr. Woodsworth informed me when I was making an inspection of the school that, if this bread mixer could be used at any other point, he would be glad to turn it over. Recently the Reverend Henry Ellis, Principal of the C. of E. Indian Residential School at Onion Lake requested me to take up the matter of getting a bread mixer for him. I informed him regarding the one at Edmonton and at the same time wrote to the Reverend Mr. Woodsworth. I am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Woodsworth stating that he would very gladly turn over the bread mixer to Mr. Ellis if he had proper authority.\n\nI would recommend that the authority be granted to make this transfer with the understanding that Mr. Ellis pay the transfer charges. I would be glad to have the Department's decision at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Morrison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 3, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A C.E. of the 25th ultimo, regarding a power bread mixer surplus to requirements at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, and recommending that this machine be transferred for use at the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department understands this machine is of 2 bbl. capacity, and it is thought it would be too large for the requirements at the Onion Lake C.E. School. You might state if the Onion Lake School has sufficient power to operate the bread mixer and also if you consider it would not be too large for practical use at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nNOV 12 1932\n\nW. REGINA, SASK., 24th November, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 110-0-5, dated the 2nd instant, with reference to transferring the bread mixer from the Edmonton Indian Residential School to the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School. I may say that I have examined this mixer and am satisfied that the Onion Lake School has sufficient power to operate this bread mixer. It is not necessary to operate the machine at its full capacity, and, in view of the fact that this bread mixer has never been used and has been lying idle at the Edmonton School, if the Principal of the Onion Lake School wants it and is willing to pay the transportation charges, I cannot see that there should be any serious objection to letting him have it. The Principal understands that, if supplied with this machine, its possession must not in any way interfere with teaching the Indian girls the art of bread making by hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. Harrison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 15, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A C.E. of the 8th instant, regarding the transfer of the bread mixer which is surplus to requirements at the Edmonton Indian Residential School to the Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School. It is noted that the last named school has sufficient power to operate this bread mixer, and that it could be put to practical use at the school.\n\nProvided the Principal of the Onion Lake C.E. School will pay the transportation charges, the Department will approve of the transfer of the bread mixer. We are writing the Reverend Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School and requesting him to arrange to ship the bread mixer when he hears from either the Principal of the Onion Lake Indian Residential School or yourself. I would request that you also take up the matter with the Principals of both these schools and have them make the necessary arrangements for the shipping of the bread mixer without expense to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, November 15, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department understands that you have surplus to requirements at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, a power bread mixer, 2 bbl. capacity. The Principal of the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School, Lloydminster, Sask., has requested, through the office of Mr. W. Murison, Inspector of Indian Agencies, to be supplied with a bread mixer for use at his school. The Inspector states that the mixer referred to above would meet the requirements at the Onion Lake School and that there is sufficient power to operate the mixer.\n\nMr. Murison is being informed that the Department will approve of the transfer of the bread mixer to the Onion Lake C. E. School, provided the Principal pays the cost of the transportation. Mr. Murison will arrange with you and the Principal of the Onion Lake School regarding the forwarding of the bread mixer, and, when you hear from him, I would request that you arrange to have the mixer shipped to the Onion Lake C. E. School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nEdmonton Indian Res.

Our Appropriation was so greatly reduced, that this was the full amount allowed. The Department is paying the voucher which you submitted. This will therefore leave the sum of approximately $250 available for the balance of the current fiscal year. You may incur expenditure, from time to time, up to that amount. I may say, however; it is considered that quite a number of the items on the accounts which you submitted are a fair charge against the school funds and should be paid, in future, from per capita allowance or other receipts of the school. It is necessary, this year, that you use every endeavour to keep all expenditures within the amount appropriated, as any expense over that amount will have to be met from school receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\n\nJune 19th 1933.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nLttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI received today your letter of 14th inst. No. II0-0-5 in reference to the voucher in favor of the Edmonton Paint and Glass Co. I may say that the total account sent us by this firm for repairs was nearly twice the voucher sent to you, and if there were a few items which might have been charged to my school account it was more than made up of the accounts for repair which I have paid.\n\nI note your reference to the balance of $250.00 still remaining to my credit for expenditure outside the per capita grant. As a matter of information: Does this amount include the grants usually made by the Department for advanced education and transportation? Or are these over and above this $250.00. If I am confined to this amount I shall have to curtail my advanced education next year.\n\nI presume this amount does not touch medical services.\n\nIf possible I would like to have this information before holidays, as a number of things hinge on it.\n\nYours Truly:\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 26, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the amount provided in our Estimates for the current fiscal year for the Edmonton Indian Residential School. I regret that our letter of the 14th instant regarding this amount is not quite clear. The sum of $300 is all that is provided for repairs, replacement to equipment and general expenditure.\n\nRegarding the advanced educational grant, the Department will decide this matter when we have a list from you of the pupils who will be taking courses in higher education during the next academic year.\n\nThe total amount that can be allowed your school for transportation expenses this year is $200. This includes expenses for children going on holidays, for new pupils entering the school and for pupils who are being discharged at the end of the current academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nOctober 9th 1933.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn regard to our jacket heater which some time ago commenced to leak. I request permission to purchase a new heater and have the account charged to my appropriation for repairs. The new heater will cost approximately $100.00.\n\nThis matter was discussed with Mr. Sutherland during his recent visit to this school.\n\nYours Truly;\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nOctober 9th 1933.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nHerewith please find enclosed Voucher #71 in favor of\nThe Drew Machine Co for $45.00\n\nThis voucher has been corrected in accord with request of\nMr. Sutherland during his recent visit to this school. I trust it\nwill be found satisfactory and charged to the appropriation made\nto this school for repairs. I may say that this repair is just\nanother of the repairs which have been made on the mangle which\nwas injured in the fire of seven years ago. A leak has broken out\nfrom time to time for which repairs have been necessary. This time\nthe repair was more extensive and I hope will be permanent.\n\nYours Truly;\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 17, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 9th instant, I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase of a new hot water jacket heater, at a cost of approximately $100.00, for use at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. The cost of same is to be included in the appropriation allowed you for repairs and equipment, as mentioned in official letter dated June 14th, last. As stated in that letter, the sum of $300 is all that is available for all purposes at your school this present fiscal year. After the purchase of the heater has been made, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nI have also the account which you forwarded, in favour of the Drew Machine Company, for $45.00, covering the cost of welding casting for large mangle. This account is being paid and charged to the appropriation mentioned above. You will observe that, after paying this account and the cost of the jacket heater and including the account in favour of the Edmonton Paint and Glass Company, Limited, for $50.97, there will be only the sum of approximately $105 available from the appropriation provided for your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.

This is required for general repair work. We need gates, repair to brick work, certain board protectors for windows and other necessary repair jobs. At present we have not a stick of lumber on the place.\n\nI would also like permission to purchase fencing and screening for windows and hardware to the extent of $25.00.\n\nBoth these items to be charged to my appropriation. I may say that the heater will not cost more than about $75.00, so there is still a margin available for school purposes.\n\nSee your letter of October 17th 1933., No. II0-0-5.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 22, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant, I have to say that you may incur an expenditure of approximately $50.00 in the purchase of lumber, sand, and lime, for general repair work at the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Further, you may purchase fencing, screening for windows, and hardware, to the extent of approximately $25.00. The cost of the above supplies is to be included in the appropriation allowed you for repairs and equipment, as mentioned in official letter dated June 14th, last.\n\nAfter the purchase of these materials has been made, please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It seems that about every year the outlet gets clogged up, and as it is no fit job for the boys of the school I send for proper help from town. It appears that the gravel gets clogged with the solid material and has to be cleared away. The siphon is not working properly, and it would be quite an expensive job to put it right, so this cleaning out once a year or so is perhaps the best way. In the meanwhile, there is sufficient gravel and purifying process not to cause any danger to health.\n\nI saved $25.00 on my tank heater, so there will be sufficient out of my appropriation to meet this account.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F.

As indicated the balance of the account amounting to $27.27 is being paid out of school funds.\n\nIn looking over the repairs necessary to barns I find that a lot of work is necessary, so I am putting the greater part of this year's appropriation into this department of our work. We are not building anything absolutely new as items might indicate, but taking the two buildings which we now have and putting them in one.

As this account was not receipted, it is necessary to issue the cheque in favour of the company and it will be sent to them. If you have already paid their account, you should arrange with them to adjust the matter with you.

Dept. letter of March 28th 1936, No. II0-0-5.\n\nAs requested I enclose herewith retail in reference to the item \"Making on Fittings\" in the account of J. W. Mould & Son. I am attaching same to invoice.\n\nIn reference to the first paragraph in which the account of the Norwood Foundry Co. Limited was returned. It is stated that payment cannot be considered at the present time. Does this mean that I may present this account later, and perhaps in a different form? In the meantime I shall pay the account of school funds, as it should have been attended to long ago. If I remember right, the work was done, probably in March but accounts not rendered until later. In any case I rather neglected the account.\n\nRe. Dept letter of 2nd Inst. No. II0-0-5.\n\nI may say that I have not paid this account, so the Department cheque direct to the firm is quite in order.\n\nI appreciate the action of the Department in paying the full amount of the account-$III.35. This will about make up the amount which the Department could not pay in the case of the Norwood account.\n\nI trust all will now be in order.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F.

If the Principal wishes to apply this amount towards the purchase of a refrigerator, instead of spending the amount in carrying out repairs, the Department would have no objection. He should be definitely advised, however, that there will be no amount available for repairs if the money provided is utilized towards the cost of a refrigerator. If he purchases the refrigerator, he should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost, and payment will be made to the amount mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

If The Department wishes I shall be glad of a further supply.\n\nYours Truly;\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 3, 1937.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, requesting that refills be supplied for 12 Foamite fire extinguishers and 12 fire guns, which are in use at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is considered that you can obtain the necessary chemicals to recharge these refills from a firm in Edmonton, and you may arrange for the purchase of same. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department, when payment will be made.\n\nWhen the refills are received, you should see that they are installed in the extinguishers and that the extinguishers and all fire fighting equipment are placed in good condition and ready for immediate use in case of fire.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Two years ago I spent it, largely upon the rebuilding of the pig pen. Last year the $300.00 went in part payment of a Frigidaire. This year I wish to rebuild our silo. I may say that this structure has entirely gone to pieces. It is about ten years old, and the timbers have rotted away, so we have torn it down as it was unsafe. The material in a very moderate new structure will cost over $300.00, we are prepared to pay labor costs, besides considerable other repair. I would be glad if the Department would authorize at least $300.00 for this work.\n\nI am trying to keep this plant, and am using considerable school monies in doing so. The Department has something worth while here, so I am asking its cooperation.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F.

Of course immediate action was necessary. A trench twenty five long and eight or ten feet deep in the frozen ground had to be dug. This was of course no job for boys and I had the work done by men accustomed to that kind of labor. Our own engineer looked after the mechanical work. We had to purchase a new length of pipe and have it cut etc. The repair work is finished satisfactorily, and the trench being filled up. For over a day we were without water, but we managed to get along. This is the first time in nearly 14 years since the water main has been put in, that it has caused us trouble.\n\nI trust that I may send the necessary accounts to the Department.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.F. Woodworth  \nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 21, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, you may submit an account for the expense incurred in replacing a section of the water main leading from the pump to the school.\n\nWhen the above account is received, the Department will decide what amount, if any, can be allowed for repairs at the Edmonton Indian Residential School during the present fiscal year. I may add that, owing to present regulations, it is doubtful if we can authorize that repair work be carried out in the same manner as in previous years. However, this will receive final consideration at a later date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. F.

During the last year and a half there have been some eight breaks which have required digging and repairing, usually at a cost of some $10.00 a break. Recently the breaks have been more frequent. Last week a break and again this morning. It is now about 15 years since this pipe was installed with the opening of the school, and the constant vibration has worn the joints and by friction has caused holes in the pipe where a little pebble has been in contact. Evidently this whole main line requires to be renewed. It is about 300 feet from the pump house to the main building. It will cost between six and seven hundred dollars to dig this and replace the pipe and make adjustments. The repairs which we have made have been for the most part temporary, the leaks being held with clamps.\n\nI request authority to have this work done during the holidays. I mentioned the matter to Mr. Schmidt when he was here last week. No doubt he will make a report on it.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth  \nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nJune 17, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with reference to the water supply pipe from the well to the main building of the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nI note that you estimate the cost of replacing this pipe and making the necessary adjustments at between $600.00 and $700.00. In preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year it was found possible to include an amount of $300.00 only for repairs, improvements and any new equipment that might be necessary at the Edmonton Residential School. The present set up of our appropriation makes it impossible for us to expend a larger amount than is specifically provided. Under these circumstances you will note that we only have $300.00 available.\n\nWe have no objection to using this amount to cover part of the cost of repairing the water supply pipe provided the balance could be met from school funds.\n\nIf you wish us to use our share for the purchase of the new pipe that is required you should let me have full particulars in order that the matter may be placed before our Purchasing Branch. The new purchasing regulations require that all articles for which we are supplying the funds shall be purchased by our Purchasing Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. F.

The work must be done and we are glad to avail ourselves of the $300.00.\n\nI note your remarks regarding purchasing agent for materials etc. May I suggest that I send you three or four competitive prices from Edmonton dealers. I do not know your methods, but I would like to get as much as possible out of the $300.00 - it is possible that I may be able to pay for some labor out of this amount. In regard to labor I think I can do better by a contract price than by so much an hour. Before anything is done I would like to hear from you again.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F.

Woodsworth for $65.00 for digging drain in connection with our water supply as per correspondence.\n\nHarold is my eldest son attending University. He was home a few days before sessions started when the matter of this work came up. He offered to do the work as cheaply as anyone else, being anxious to earn a little money for his course. Being harvest time it was very difficult to get help and so I decided to let him go ahead.\n\nEarlier in the year when I first wrote to you I had secured a price from Cris Skove who had done considerable work for us in digging drains and cleaning our septic tank at times. For the 300 feet which we originally intended to dig he gave us a price of $117.00, which even at that time of year was considered very reasonable. I have put in an account for Harold of $65.00 which is considerably less than that figure. We decided that 200 feet was sufficient, so you will note that the charge is reasonable. I trust this acct. is satisfactory.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\n\nFebruary 14th 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI believe that for repairs to plant I have still about $100.00 left for the fiscal year ending March 31st 1939. See your letter of June 17th 1938, No. II-0-5. There was a sum of $300.00 available for repairs to plant. Of this amount, $134.30 went to Marshall-Wells for pipe for drain. See my voucher of Nov. 23rd 1938. Then $65.00 was expended for labor in digging drain.\n\nIt is now 15 years since this school was opened and naturally repairs are beginning to be necessary. For some time we have been repairing toilets and bowls, but during the coming year replacements will be necessary, also plumbing of various kinds. Also four lengths of fire hose is practically useless. I would like permission to spend $100.00 on repairs as indicated in enclosed quotations. These quotations have been obtained without committing the Dept. in any way and are for your information, and will perhaps expedite matters.\n\nMetals Limited appear to have the lowest figures.\n\nI may say that for next year extensive repairs will be necessary on our low pressure heating boilers. The tubes of these are about gone. And it will require more than $300.00 to put them in shape.\n\nI trust these matters will receive your favorable consideration.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76\nSHIP TO Rev.

Since then the boiler inspector has been around (August 31st) and has recommended that our High Pressure boiler be retubed as soon as possible. This recommendation will of course take precedence over the needs of the heating boilers which our engineer thinks may stand over for another year. The retubing of the High Pressure boiler will cost approximately $200.00 counting both labor and material. We will also require gauges costing about $15.00. I would request authority to have this retubing with gauges attended to as soon as possible.\n\nAbout a year ago the Secretary will recall I had about 200 feet of the main pipe of our water supply replaced at a total cost, counting labor, of something like $200.00. See my Vouchers Nos. 945 and 946. I left 100 feet, which up to that time had not given us any particular trouble, thinking that it might not be necessary to replace this length of pipe. However this spring several leaks broke out and I decided to replace this portion of the pipe. I bought the pipe at Marshall-Wells where the former order had been placed. See Voucher 945 and had the work done. I absorbed all labor so that my only request for this job is material\u2014amounting with credit to $95.85.\n\nI may say that the total distance between the pump house\nOttawa, October 28, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, in connection with repairs required at the Edmonton Indian Residential School, an amount of $215.00 will be allowed for retubing the high pressure boiler and purchasing new gauges.\n\nBefore paying the attached account, it will be necessary to submit the account in triplicate, attached to the usual voucher forms. With reference to the deduction of $10.65, you should show on the voucher in what manner this amount was reached.\n\nThere is a notation on the Marshall-Wells Alberta Company Limited account, stating that 2% discount is allowed if paid within 30 days. When such notation appears on an invoice, present regulations require that the deduction be made, no matter when the account is paid. When you resubmit the account in the manner desired, favourable consideration will be given to payment.\n\nyours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. F.

The heater which we discarded was some eight or nine years old, and completely gone. The usual life time of these heaters is usually not that long. So I got a new one. I settled all accounts for fittings and labor, but have left the main item, with the hope that the Department might pay for this item, which is part of permanent equipment.\n\nI may say that during this fiscal year I have not requested any funds for repairs etc. Usually the Department has allowed me some $300.00 for such repairs. I would be glad if I might have this Metals Limited account for $76.37 settled by The Department.\n\nI enclose copy of account merely for reference.\n\nMay I ask for an early reply.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nMarch 3, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo the Department is prepared to consider payment of the account of $76.57 for the purchase of a hot water tank heater for the Edmonton Residential School.

H. Ashdown Hardware Co. Ltd., for $266.70. This is for repairs to our pump jack, which were absolutely necessary in order that the pump should not entirely give out. On the advice of my engineer I sent away for these repairs and the work was done during the holidays. I may say that the pump was installed a good many years ago and has given us very little trouble. However, the engineer stated that various parts were wearing down very seriously owing to vibration and general wear and tear and unless something was done immediately, it would probably involve a great deal of expense and trouble. I therefore thought it best to order the parts and have the work done.\n\nI may say that the operation cost us considerably more than this invoice. We absorbed the matter of the labor and a great many small items for minor parts purchased locally. However, all of the parts mentioned on this invoice had to be ordered from the United States and this invoice is the only one I am asking the Department to meet as part of maintenance of permanent plant. It has been the custom of the Department to allow me some $300.00 for repairs each year and this is the only repair bill, I believe, that has been sent in this year.\n\nI trust the Department will be able to meet the bill. I am only sending along one copy of the account so that you will be able to see what it is and if acceptable, I shall have copies made out in triplicate and properly certified to.\n\nI have not presented this account before on account of pressure of business but I trust that as it will be in before the end of the Government fiscal year, you will be able to deal with the matter satisfactorily.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJFW/R\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nMarch 5th, 1942.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of Feb. 11th, 1942, file No. 110-0-05, in connection with Inspector Scott's report re lighting and ventilation of a school room.\n\nI may say that one particular room is referred to in this report. The room has had this condition ever since the opening of the school some 18 years ago. It is quite true that both the lighting and the ventilation are very poor but they are exactly as laid out by the Department in building the school. The classroom is situated in the school so that only one side is open to daylight and that is the West side. There are four windows lighting the room. In comparison with modern classrooms, this is decidedly antiquated. There are four electric bulb outlets in the room and it may be that the only solution would be to turn 100 watt lamps in these but it would be rather expensive. On the other hand, while the Inspector's report may be correct, I do not think the criticism is very serious, and after a little personal investigation, I find that most of the children can see fairly well. However, the lighting is poor.\n\nThe ventilation is very decidedly bad. This room is ventilated, as are our other classrooms, by means of a flue through which pass heated steam pipes. This may work fairly well in extremely cold weather when the pipes do heat the flues but in ordinary weather there is little draft in these flues, and for a classroom there seems to be very little movement of air around these ventilators. The only way we can ventilate this room is to open the doors and windows but you will realize that during cold weather it is not desirable to have the children exposed to drafts of cold air.\n\nSince receipt of your letter, I have arranged that during recess and noon hour, the doors and windows of this room be opened to allow as much fresh air as possible to get in this room.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nJFW/R\nOttawa,\nMarch 13, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Company's account for $266.70. I am prepared to recommend payment of this account. Please have the usual voucher in triplicate forwarded.\n\nI would point out that I may have some difficulty in securing payment of this as all purchases over $50.00 should be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The roof of the latter - Government owned - is leaking badly in several places. The water running down the inner walls is doing considerable damage. Repairs should be made to the roof without delay.\n\nThe Roman Catholic School is twenty-two miles from the Agent's office and the United Church School is twenty-three miles - both off the Reserves.\n\nJ.E. Morris,\nWelfare Division.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nJune 14th 1944\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of June 7th No. II0-0-5 in reference to the leaky roof as reported by Mr. Morris. I presume Mr. Morris had in mind the condition of the walls in various parts of the building which were in bad condition owing to the seepage of water through the brick work, which is destroying the plaster and brickwork.\n\nI may say that this is due to a structural defect in the construction of the building. The gutters under the eaves are placed too close to the bricks, then when the snow and severe frost comes it bursts the metal gutters at the seams and the water comes through the walls with the above result.\n\nThis condition has existed since the school was built 20 years ago. I am quite sure that the matter has been brought to the attention of inspectors and agents from time to time, but it is possible that I have not made any direct report to Ottawa. However we have plastered and repaired the walls from time to time ourselves and kept things looking fairly decent. However the condition has now got beyond us and requires extensive alterations. It is no use re-plastering without reconstruction of the entire gutter and eaves system. There are about 600 feet of eaves and this will require a considerable outlay, possibly running into several thousand dollars. Owing to the nature of the repair and the extent of the work I would suggest that the Department authorize me to secure the services of a competent contractor who would be able to give a more exact figure and also supply the Department with a more detailed description of the work to be done. At present I can only guess at the required outlay, but Mr. Lobb, the engineer, thinks the job would run perhaps to three or four thousand dollars. There is a small job on the roof where the asbestos shingles have blown off, and also the steeple which is poorly constructed and which lets in the rain. This might be repaired for $150 or $200. (present costs).\n\nI may say that if serious structural losses are to be avoided the sooner this work is done, the better. This rain water is beginning to seriously eat into the brickwork of parts of the school.\n\nIf the Department would like further information regarding this matter I shall be glad to furnish further details, but for the present I think this letter covers the general outline of required repairs.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nJune 21, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School,\nTen miles from Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nIt has been brought to our attention that owing to trouble with the roof of the above-mentioned school the walls in various parts of the building are in bad condition, owing to seepage of water through the brickwork. This destroys the plaster and brickwork. The Principal writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The condition is due to a structural defect in the construction of the building. The gutters under the eaves are placed too close to the bricks, then when the snow and severe frost comes it bursts the metal gutters at the seams and water comes through the walls. The condition has now got beyond us and requires extensive alterations.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI beg to report that the pump in the deep well at the Edmonton Indian Residential School has had to be repaired before the children could return to school. I was informed by Rev. Mr. Woodsworth, Principal, of the school that the repairs have now been made and that the water supply is now good; the children will be returning to school starting Monday September 17th, 1944.\n\nI am advised by Mr. Woodsworth that the cost of repairing and taking the pump out of the well will be approximately $100.00.\n\nG. C. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nUp to this time we had been doing the work entirely with our own help, but three of our helpers were young Indian boys. I felt that it was necessary in view of the urgency of the situation to secure competent men to assist in the work of replacing the casing. This morning four extra men are busy on this job.\n\nI have kept Mr. Laight, the Indian Agent, informed regarding the progress of these operations. I was also talking to Inspector Schmidt this morning and told him of what we are doing. I trust that this report will meet with your approval, and that you will give me permission to submit to the Department all accounts necessitated by this break in our water supply. You will appreciate the fact that the complications involved in this breakdown of our well has been entirely beyond our control and it has involved immediate action on my part to meet it. I do not think anything has been done beyond that which is absolutely necessary.\n\nThis well misfortune has also seriously interfered with the incoming of the Indian children from their holidays. I have communicated with all agents concerned regarding our delay and have informed them that as soon as the well situation is cleared up that arrangements will be made to bring the children back.\n\nThe Department will understand of course that it is impossible for us to live here without water or to operate the school without our deep well. As it is the staff and our families at present are trying to get along on the small supply we had on hand in our pressure tank. This is now nearly exhausted.\n\nI trust that my action is satisfactory to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. F.

It is some three years since the sucker rods have been up and the flow of water indicated that these repairs were necessary. Some months before this we had ordered these repairs through Gorman's Limited, but as they had to come from the States it was only a couple of weeks ago that the repairs came to hand. The first operation was quite simple and the well was once more in operation. For a day it worked satisfactorily and then quite suddenly the water supply dwindled off once more. Upon pulling the sucker rods the second time we found that they were alright. It then became necessary to pull the well casing. We found the thread of the bottom link practically eaten away by chemical action and by vibration. It became necessary to entirely replace the whole one hundred and twenty-five feet (125 feet) of the four inch (4\") galvanized pump casing. This casing is over twenty years old and an engineer was very emphatic that it would be very unwise to put any of this casing down again. He had for his reason our former experience with the piping from the well to the pressure tanks where a first break was followed at all seasons of the year by numerous other breaks. And in view of the costly nature of the well we felt that we could not take any such risk.\n\nWe were able to secure after a good deal of difficulty a sufficient supply of this galvanized casing to make a completely new and satisfactory pump outfit, and this was put down in the well.\n\nWe expected that the operation would be completed yesterday afternoon, but when within ten feet of the bottom we found that the sucker rods stuck some place in the casing. After numerous efforts we were forced to give up for the time being.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nSeptember 9, 1944\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince writing my letter of the 8th, we have been successful in getting our water supply, so for the time being everything is quite satisfactory.\n\nIn connection with the well, I think you should be informed regarding the condition of this very expensive and essential piece of equipment in connection with this school. One might say that the well, more than anything else, is absolutely essential in carrying on any kind of work, either institutional or in connection with the farm. While the pump casing was up, I had a well-driller examine as well as he could the outer well casing. This has been in use some twenty-two years now and he reported that there were signs of deterioration some distance below the well. If this is taken in time it may save a very valuable well and also a possible disastrous cave-in. I would suggest that perhaps next summer this be attended to while the children are on their holidays.\n\nI understand from Mr. Schmidt that Mr. McDougall is likely to be here in connection with repairs to the roof. I shall mention the matter of the well to him when he comes and he may make a report to you. In any case I would ask you to take this information regarding the well as an independent report and keep it in mind for the future action.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, September 15, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Woodsworth:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 9 and to thank you for the information you submit with respect to certain repairs that may be necessary to the well at your school.\n\nIt is noted that it is your intention to discuss these repairs with Mr. McDougall at the time of his visit to the school. You should, in my judgment, also discuss them, if you have an opportunity, with Inspector Schmidt. I am particularly anxious that an item covering the cost of this work should be included, if at all possible, in the 1945-46 estimates.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

It is noted that an expenditure of approximately $7000 will be necessary to handle the repairs that are required. As no provision was made for this expenditure in the current year's appropriation, it is regretted that we cannot authorize you to proceed with the work at the present time. However, the amount is being included in our estimates for the fiscal year 1945-46 and as soon as we are definitely informed that this item has been allowed we will advise you. As requested, I return the pictures which you forwarded.\n\nDirector.\nOctober 7th\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Repairs to Edmonton Indian Residential School, Alberta.\n\nWe are now in receipt of a report prepared by Mr. A.R. McDougall of our Banff office, after his inspection of roof conditions at the above. The report has been analyzed by our Architect and comment is furnished for your information as follows:\n\nThe building erected over twenty years ago has never had any major repair work, and is now badly in need of extensive roof repairs, repairs to interior plaster work and to a lesser degree, repairs to exterior brickwork.\n\nWhile a concealed eavestrough built into the cornice is considered to be the source of most of the trouble, the asbestos shingles have become loosened, and sections of the ridge roll are missing. Nearly all metal flashing needs repair or replacement, and the louver openings in the cupola are so built as to admit water to the roof space.\n\nThe concealed eavestrough has proven unsuitable for buildings subject to heavy snow and severe frost conditions. It is placed behind the top members of the cornice, above the face brick in the wall, and due to continual expansion and contraction from freezing and thawing of ice retained in the trough during the winter, the joints in the metal lining have been forced open. As a consequence the brick and tile walls have become saturated, the wooden members of the cornice are rotted and plaster on the inside as well as brickwork on the exterior face of the walls has suffered considerable damage.\n\nTo overcome the existing condition, it will be necessary to remove the concealed trough and rebuild the cornice. Extension members should be spliced to the rafters and the cornice should be rebuilt to provide additional projection for an exposed eavestrough. While Mr. McDougall does not refer to them, the attached photographs show that only portions of the rainwater conduits remain in position. These conduits appear originally to have spilled rainwater on the ground against the building. They should be replaced, and should be furnished with bams to divert roof water away from foundation walls.\n\nMr. McDougall has obtained an estimate from the Poole Construction Co. of Edmonton covering various items as follows:\n\n(a) Renewing cornice, and installing 4\" eavestrough........................................$4900.\n(b) Repairs to roof shingles, flashings and louvers in cupola.................................304.\n(c) Repairing plasterwork..........................250.\n(d) Painting cornice, all exterior sash, frames and doors.................................945.\n(e) Repairs to front steps.........................25.\n\nTotal........................................$6424.\n\nWardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurvey and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nMr. McDougall's report makes no reference to the need for painting exterior sash, frames and doors, nor to the repairs to front steps included in the Poole estimate. Further the Poole estimate shows no specific cost for repairs to brickwork or renewing rain water leaders. Mr. McDougall states that a large proportion of the estimated cost of renewing the cornice would be for the erection of scaffolding. The attached photographs show deteriorated paint work and it is felt considerable economy would be effected if all work could be carried out while the scaffolding was in place.\n\nTo cover items described as necessary but for which no estimate has been furnished, as well as to provide funds for engineer's expenses, it is considered likely that a total expenditure of about $7,000 would be required.\n\nMr. Walker and Mr. McDougall recommend that the repairs should be undertaken as soon as possible, and we concur in their recommendation.\n\nWhile at the Edmonton school, our officer noted several other items which should be pointed out to the Indian Affairs Branch. These are as follows:\n\n1 - The brick walls supporting the heating boilers are crumbling and should be repaired.\n\n2 - A large flatware ironer in the laundry, which has been welded after having been in a fire some years ago, is allowing the escape of steam during operation. It appears advisable to obtain cylinder replacements for the machine.\n\n3 - Most of the fire escapes at the school, as shown in the photographs, are equipped with poles instead of steps below the top fire escape balconies.\n\nMr. McDougall reports that some of the smaller Indian children cannot use this method of escape. Consideration should be given to providing the usual steel stairs and rails for all such units.\n\nSince we have only been furnished with the one set of photographs attached, and as Mr. Walker states they were taken on a privately owned camera it would be appreciated if you would return the prints when they have served your purpose.\n\nEncls. 3\n\nChief Engineer.\nOctober 13th, 1944.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Repairs to Edmonton Indian Residential School, Alberta.\n\nOwing to shortage of engineering staff it was impossible to send an officer to make this inspection until the middle of September and I am now enclosing a summary, dated October 7th, of the report prepared by Engineer A.R. McDougall, of the Engineering and Construction Service, following his inspection.\n\nIt will be noted that considerable repairs are necessary and that the cost of these are high due to scaffolding that has to be erected to permit work on the cornice. It appears that the latter will have to be largely renewed. You will note that the total expenditure is approximately $7,000 and that these building repairs should be undertaken as soon as possible.\n\nYou will also note that certain other repairs are suggested by Engineer McDougall and which are listed under Items 1, 2, and 3.\n\nA set of photographs are forwarded herewith, for your information, and these might be returned when they have served your purpose.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nDecember 21, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Repairs to Edmonton Residential School\n\nI desire to refer to your memorandum of October 13, reporting on the condition of the roof of the above-mentioned school. We have been unable to reply to your memorandum sooner, due to the fact that at the time your memorandum was received funds were not available for carrying out the work. Recently, however, it has been decided to use some funds provided for another purpose and arrangements have been made to transfer to your Branch the amount of $7000. It is possible that it would not be practical to do the work during the winter months, but it is felt that at least the material could be secured between now and the end of March. There are plenty of buildings at the Edmonton School in which this material could be safely stored.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, January 30, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRe: Repairs to Edmonton Residential School.\n\nI desire to refer you to my memorandum of December 21, last, with reference to the roof of the above-mentioned school.

You will recall that in connection with the repair of our well last summer I submitted to the department, among others, vouchers from Crane Limited. I have from time to time forwarded these statements to you but so far they have received no word from you, whether it was the intention of the department to pay these accounts. You may recall at the time that in my covering letter I stated that these accounts were in the nature of emergency repairs to the plant.\n\nI kept both the department and the Indian agent informed as to the progress of my operations and the department does not appear to have any objection to work that was being done. I would greatly appreciate some word from the department as to whether these accounts would be honored by them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth.\nPrincipal.\n\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, February 19, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Woodsworth:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, I regret that there was some delay in paying the balance due Crane Limited, namely $131.23. However, this account was passed for payment early last week and a cheque will reach Crane Limited in the very near future.\n\nI am pleased to note that you have returned to duty and trust that your health has improved.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.

The amount of $7,000 that was made available in December last was consequently returned to you in February.\n\nIn order that we can make plans for supervision of various works in this coming season, would you kindly advise me if a sum not less than $7,000 can be made available for these repairs this year.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, April 23, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 19th instant, I am requesting the Representative of the Treasury to transfer to your Branch the amount of $7,000.00 in order that you may make immediate arrangements for carrying out the repairs to the above mentioned building.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, April 22, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY.\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease transfer to the Surveys and Engineering Branch an amount of $7,000.00, required for reconstructing the roof and other repairs.

This amount is included in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1945-46 and the Surveys and Engineering Branch wish to complete the repairs as soon as possible.\n\nActing Director.\nAugust 30, 1945.\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nFurther to our report of July 26th describing the immediately necessary repairs to eliminate the infiltration of water into the above building, a general examination of the school reveals the necessity of further repairs and replacements to the building and equipment, to which the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch should be directed. In particular, the following items are noted:\n\n**SEPTIC TANK**\nA large proportion of the shingles of the pitched roof have been removed by pupils, exposing the sheeting and allowing water to enter the tank. The sheeting will doubtless deteriorate unless recovered.\n\n**REAR DOORS**\nThe double exterior panelled doors to both boys' and girls' entrances at the rear of the building have been damaged by pupils kicking mud from their boots. Although repaired roughly by planks, the doors are ineffective in keeping out the weather.\n\n**IRON STAIRS**\nThe iron staircases throughout the building have corroded in places. This is particularly true of the flight from the basement to the ground floor where the stairs are rusted away for several inches at the junction of the risers and treads, and badly pitted where treads abut the stringers. The mastic material of the treads has broken away. It is considered that the deterioration of material of this flight constitutes a possible hazard to the safety of the pupils.\n\n**ROOF, BOYS ENTRANCE**\nThe galvanized iron roof leaks, allowing water to enter the passage.\n\n**CEILINGS**\nThe ceilings of ground floor classrooms are stained and some patches of plaster have deteriorated, due to overflowing of dormitory toilets on the floor above.\n\n**ATTIC DORMITORIES**\nThe plaster walls where the heads of beds are placed is broken along the entire length of wall, and the destruction of plaster is likely to continue unless a dado rail is placed here.\n\n**BASEMENT PIPES**\nThe galvanized iron cold water pipes are corroded, containing an Alkali deposit which has caused deterioration, and leaks are being continually repaired.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nLAUNDRY\n\nThe flatwear ironer is being used with difficulty; steam escaping from the heaters. It is considered not possible to make further repairs.\n\nBOILER BASE\n\nThe face of the brick base has crumbled along all four sides.\n\nBOILERS\n\nThe school engineer reports that the tubes of one Low Pressure Boiler will soon be beyond repair. The insulation to these boilers is broken in many places. The vertical tubes of the High Pressure Boiler require constant attention and the engineer stated they are not likely to last much longer.\n\nThe water for the heating system is obtained from a large concrete storage tank, to which rain water leaders from the roof are connected.\n\nBASMENT TOILETS\n\nTwo toilets have loose soil connections and are movable from the floor. These and other toilets have loose and damaged floor fastenings. The metal partitions have rusted and their connections have broken away from the floor. Only the wall attachments hold them in place.\n\nBASMENT FLOORS\n\nThe basement floors are of rough concrete, and not mastic as shown on original plans. They are difficult to clean and to keep in a sanitary condition.\n\nBASMENT WALLS\n\nThe exterior cement finish at top of these walls has broken away in many places, exposing the concrete aggregate to the weather, and possibly is permitting the absorption of moisture into the exterior of the walls.\n\nFIRE ESCAPES\n\nThe fire escapes have landings provided with poles to the ground, and are not practical for younger pupils. In this connection, it may be noted that in order to keep the older boys and girls within the dormitories during the evenings, locks have had to be attached to each of the doors and windows leading to fire escapes.\n\nSTORM SASH AND SCREENS\n\nDue to lack of help during the war, the storm sash have been allowed to remain in place during the summer and only where rooms are occupied have screens been used. The storm sash and screens are badly in need of paint.\n\nREAR ENTRANCE\n\nThe approach to the rear entrances becomes very muddy in the spring and fall and is the cause of much mud being carried into the building. The Principal would like to see these rear areas paved. The soil is clay and is of gumbo consistency when wet.\n\nPOTABLE WATER\n\nThe water supply, except for the boilers, is from a 160 feet deep well with a 4\" pipe and 6\" casing.\n\nThe water contains sodium carbonate in solution and is of a chalky colour when it comes from the faucets. When allowed to settle, a small amount of soda settles to the bottom of the receptacle, leaving the water clear. The taste is not unpleasant. The Principal states the water has a slight laxative effect.\nMinor repair work is carried out by the school staff. In one case noted, however, a structural change was made which might have had serious consequences, and it is strongly recommended that such alterations be referred to this Service. The alteration in question involved the cutting of an opening through the 17\" wall between the kitchen and bakery rooms, and a piece of structural steel was employed to support the brickwork above, which is now resting on the third course of the door frame. The wall in question is a bearing wall, and the first course of brick above the door frame is loose; but it is felt that the arching action of the upper brickwork has prevented any serious consequences.\n\nNo estimate of the cost of carrying out this work would be possible without further examination and investigation.\n\nThe items noted herein, are presented for the information of the Indian Affairs Branch in determining any action they may decide to take.\n\nChief Engineer.\nExtract from Report of Surveys and Engineering Branch, dated August 30, 1945, re Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\n1. SEPTIC TANK\n\nA large proportion of the shingles of the pitched roof have been removed by pupils, exposing the sheeting and allowing water to enter the tank. The sheeting will doubtless deteriorate unless recovered.\n\n2. REAR DOORS\n\nThe double exterior panelled doors to both boys' and girls' entrances at the rear of the building have been damaged by pupils kicking mud from their boots. Although repaired roughly by planks, the doors are ineffective in keeping out the weather.\n\n3. IRON STAIRS\n\nThe iron staircases throughout the building have corroded in places. This is particularly true of the flight from the basement to the ground floor where the stairs are rusted away for several inches along the undersides of the risers and treads, and badly fitted where treads abut the stringers. The mastic material of the treads has broken away. It is considered that the deterioration of material of this flight constitutes a possible hazard to the safety of the pupils.\n\n4. ROOF, BOYS ENTRANCE\n\nThe galvanized iron roof leaks, allowing water to enter the passage.\n\n5. CEILINGS\n\nThe ceilings of ground floor classrooms are stained and some patches of plaster have deteriorated, due to overflowing of dormitory toilets on the floor above.\n\n6.

The insulation to these boilers is broken in many places. The\nvertical tubes of the High Pressure Boiler require constant attention and the engineer stated they are not likely to last much longer. (see bottom of page)\n\n10. BASEMENT TOILETS\n\nTwo toilets have loose soil connections and are movable from the floor. These and other toilets have loose and damaged floor fastenings. The metal partitions have rusted and their connections have broken away from the floor. Only the wall attachments hold them in place.\n\n11.

In one case noted, however, a structural change was made which might have had serious consequences, and it is strongly recommended that such alterations be referred to this Service. The alteration in question involved the cutting of an opening through the 17\" wall between the kitchen and bakery room for a door. No structural steel was employed to support the bearing above, which is now resting on the wood cap of the door frame. The wall in question is a bearing wall, and the first course of brick above the door frame is loose; but it is felt that the arching action of the upper brickwork has prevented any serious consequences.\n\n(Add to No. 9)\n\nThe water for the heating system is obtained from a large concrete storage tank, to which rainwater leaders from the roof are connected.\nSeptember 12th, 1945\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: General Condition - Edmonton Indian Residential School Building.\n\nWhen a member of our Architectural Staff visited the above school in July for the purpose of arranging a contract for repairs to the roof, coping, and walls of the above building, he made a general inspection of other features. It is thought you might be interested in his report, and a memorandum from Mr. Mills dated August 30th, with summarized information, is attached herewith.\n\nYou will note that a good deal of work of varying nature is required. Very little of it could be reasonably undertaken by contract. A competent caretaker with the assistance of a handyman, could undertake a large amount that has to be done.\n\nAn annual amount for maintenance of this residential school building would permit the staff to do this work in the next year or two and get the building back to fair condition.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, September 15, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Woodsworth:\n\nI enclose, for your information, an extract from a report recently received from the Surveys and Engineering Branch in regard to the Edmonton Indian Residential School. They feel that a great deal of the work could be done by your engineer, with an assistant.\n\nI would like you to give careful consideration to their suggestions, and as regards any item which you think should receive immediate attention, I would appreciate it if you would let me know at what cost it could be carried out. When replying, you should refer to the items by number. As soon as we have your reply, your recommendations will be given careful consideration.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Indian Agent Faunt who, I am certain, will be glad to assist you in estimating the cost of the repairs.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J.F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 15th, addressed to Mr. Woodworth, copy of which was sent to me, I beg to state that I went out to the school yesterday afternoon and checked over the different items referred to in the report with Mr. Woodworth & the school engineer.\n\nIn this letter I will only deal with the items which I consider are most important, which should be given immediate attention. The other items will be dealt with in a later report.\n\n1. Septic Tank\n\nAs reported, the shingles of the roof have practically all disappeared, but I do not think these were removed by the pupils. The shingle nails have all rotted through & the wind just wires the shingles off at will. While I was there I saw several of the remaining shingles disappear in this way.\n\nI would suggest that for the present, the sheathing of the roof be covered with two thicknesses of tarpaper, secured in place by lathes, then in the spring the roof could either be shingled with good shingles which are impossible to obtain now, or another layer of shiplap could be put on over the tarpaper & tarred. I think this would make the most satisfactory job.\n\nHowever, outside of putting on the tarpaper, none of this work can be undertaken now, on account of the condition of the septic tank itself, which has not been cleaned out for several years \u2014 is filled right up with solids \u2014 though it may be providing drainage, I am satisfied it is not functioning as a septic tank.\n\nWhen inspecting the tank, I noted that quite a number of the rafters had sagged away from the sheathing, caused by the rotting of the nails \u2014 it will not be possible to do anything towards remedying this condition until the tank has been cleaned out.\n\nI understand the cleaning of this tank has cost $75.00 on previous occasions, but I very much doubt if it can be done for that now and I would suggest that a sum of $100 be set aside for this so that Mr. Woodworth be authorized to have the work done. The tarpaper & lath nails will cost about $18.00 & I have told Mr. Woodworth to purchase this & get it on, before the snow comes.\n\n2. Basement Toilets.\n\nI checked on the toilets throughout the building & for the most part they are not in very good shape. It will be necessary to install six new bowls \u2014 in one, the base is also broken & will have to be replaced. Three new cisterns\nwill also be required to replace three that are so badly\ndamaged that they are of no further use.\n\nWith regard to the metal partitions, I would suggest\nthat where the floor connections have rusted off, pieces\nbe welded on to these uprights & the uprights reset in the\nconcrete floor. To do this it would be necessary to bring\na welder out to the school, but this would be better than\ndismantling the partitions & taking the uprights to Edmonton.\n\nThe material necessary could all be get ready & the\nwelding itself would not take long.\n\nThe installing of the toilet bowls & cisterns could\nall be done by the school engineer, but it is just possible\nthat he might require a little help with the base of the one\ntoilet.\n\nThe cost of the different items mentioned above would\nbe as follows:\n\n| Item                          | Cost |\n|-------------------------------|------|\n| Toilet Bowls                  | $6.00|\n| 3 Flush Cisterns              | $1.00|\n| Welding partitions & material (est) | $20.00|\n| Fittings for toilets (agt)    | $10.00|\n| Work on toilet base & material (est) | $20.00|\n| Unforeseen                    | $5.00|\n\nTotal: $75.00\n\nI would recommend that this work be done immediately\nand although there are no bowls or cisterns in stock in\nEdmonton at present, a shipment is expected about next\nThursday & in order that we may be in on these, an order\nhas been placed for the number required, but if there are\nany objections to this, the order can be cancelled without\nany trouble, as there is a long waiting list for such\nfixtures.\n\nJ.T. Faunt,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nWhen out at the Edmonton School yesterday, I noted that a start had not yet been made on the repairs to the roof, walls &c., and as the season is getting late & there is considerable mortar & brick work to be done, I think it time that the contractors get going.\n\nIt is true that they have had a certain amount of material on the ground since the beginning of the month, but that is not helping the building any, and I had thought you might possibly jack them up a little.\n\nI asked Mr. Woodsworth if he had a copy of the contract, as I wanted to see exactly what work was covered, but he said he hadn't a copy.\n\nCould he be furnished with a copy, in order that he or the school engineer, who is quite a capable mechanic, could check on the work being done to see that it conforms with the terms of the contract.\n\nI myself would also like to know what is covered by the contract, in order that I may make recommendations regarding certain other repairs & improvements which are not included in the contract.\n\nNow that the outside shell of the building is going to be put in shape, I think now would be the time to consider the putting of the interior in shape also, if not this year, then next.\n\nI think it is shameful how the various buildings in connection with this institution have been allowed to\nDeteriorate, for the lack of the expenditure of a few dollars at the time it was noted these repairs were necessary.\n\nI might say that sections of the brick veneer on most all of the farm buildings on the Farm Instructor's house are falling away & steps should be taken immediately to tie these back into place, but I am going out there next Wednesday to make a thorough check on what requires to be done and will make you a report.\n\nJ. A. Faint,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 4th October, 1945.\n\nMr. J.T. Faunt, Indian Agent, Winterburn, Alberta.\n\nWhen I wrote to Mr. Woodsworth on September 15th enclosing an extract from a report received from the Surveys and Engineering Branch, I overlooked quoting the following:\n\n\"FIRE ESCAPES\n\nThe fire escapes are landings provided with poles to the ground, and are not practical for younger pupils. In this connection, it may be noted that in order to keep the older boys and girls within the dormitories during the evenings, locks have had to be attached to each of the doors and windows leading to fire escapes.\"\n\nWe have issued specific instructions on many occasions to the effect that doors and windows leading to fire escapes must not be locked. It is a simple matter to install an electric bell in the monitor's room with a wire leading to the doors. A small transformer may be required and this could be obtained at a cost of about $1.50. If a door is opened, the bell rings in the monitor's room and at the same time if a fire should occur, the doors are unlocked. This is a very important matter and I trust that you will arrange with the Principal at once to carry out our wishes.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 4th October, 1945.\n\nAIRMAIL\n\nMr. J.T. Faunt, Indian Agent, Winterburn, Alberta,\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 22nd ultimo with reference to the Edmonton Residential School. The Department approves your action in authorizing the purchase of shingles to repair the roof of the Septic Tank. We will also allow an amount of $100.00 for cleaning this tank. If the school management would clean this tank once a year, the condition mentioned in your letter would not occur.\n\nThe Department approves an expenditure not exceeding $175.00 for the purchase of new equipment and supplying labour in connection with repairs required for the toilets. You may also have the metal partitions repaired.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nI would appreciate it if you could send a copy of the contract to the Principal, Reverend J.F.

Haddow, Contractor.\n\nEvidently work began immediately after your Indian Agent wrote you on September 22nd, as on September 30th scaffolding had been erected and a certain amount of brick work and roof repairs had been accomplished. Owing to a shortage of asbestos shingles a suggestion was made that asphalt shingles be used along the eaves, but the contractor has been advised to make every endeavour to obtain asbestos shingles as specified.\n\nIn regard to the work to be undertaken under the contract, Mr. C.M. Walker, our Supervising Engineer at Banff, has been instructed to furnish the Indian Agent and the School Principal with a schedule of items covered by the contract for their use in making recommendations and obtaining estimates on additional work that may be required by the school and is not included in the present contract.\n\nIn order to avoid confusion in work items it is suggested that your school principal advise Mr. Walker of new items of work that he thinks necessary, and the latter can confirm with him as to whether or not these are in the present contract.\n\n(over)...........\nSome of the additional work required, such as repairs to the iron stairs, might also be better undertaken by the school staff.\n\nIt is believed the contractor is fully aware of the need of expediting the work as much as possible, and no doubt he will put forth his best efforts.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 19th October, 1945.\n\nMr. J.T.

C. Haddow, Contractor, dated October 8th covering a number of additional repair items required at the school, but not covered by Haddow's present contract. This estimate was requested by Indian Agent Faunt and referred to in the report of Mr. Walker dated October 3rd.\n\nWith regard to repairs for out-buildings, Mr. Haddow advises that maintenance of these buildings, in his opinion, has been seriously neglected. Our officer, who visited the school last July concurs in this, and from his observations can verify Mr. Haddow's conclusions in the following estimate of repairs, necessary to put these buildings in a state of stability and temporary repair.\n\nThis estimate is for work considered essential and does not attempt to include all repair work that should have been done during past years for adequate maintenance of the structures affected.\n\n(A) Repairs to outlying buildings.\n\n1. Farm Supervisor's Residence -\n   Porch - Excavate and construct new footing under existing wall, construct new concrete wall on south end and repair existing concrete walls. Remove existing brick walls of porch and main wall above and rebuild same; Replace deteriorated roof boards and shingles on roof; Renew flashing and paint sash and door --------------------- $ 150.00\n\n2. Horse Barn -\n   Repair existing brick veneer walls by bolting to backing; Remove and re-construct one brick arch; Provide beam filling at eaves and re-build two corners of wall; Point cracks in brickwork and grout cracks in concrete walls. Take down and rebuild brick veneer on east wall. Repair double doors at south-east corner; Repair eaves troughing and downspouts --------------------- $ 350.00\n\n3. Hog Pens -\n   Remove four defective wooden floors and wooden runway and replace by 4\" concrete floors and runway on cinder fill, joining up to existing concrete pen floors --- $ 500.00\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n4. Cow Barns -\n\nRe-build brick veneer on walls at north-west and south-west corners of building; Anchor with angle irons bolted to corners of framework. Beam fill under eaves of above. Remove brick veneer on east wall from silo to southeast corner and on south wall to door, and replace with siding. Fill out on south wall with 2\" x 4\" studing and siding. Point cracks in brickwork. Renew shingles above brickwork on west wall $250.00\n\n5. Pump House -\n\nCover shiplap walls with brick veneer. Repair chimney and provide coping to same. Point cracks in brick walls. Provide and place new shingles where former L joined present building $150.00\n\n6. Garage and Workshop -\n\nRepair porch entrance to basement by constructing new footings under existing walls, with toothing, grouting and pointing for existing concrete foundations $150.00\nRepair exterior stairs and door $100.00\nPoint brickwork $15.00\n\nTotal for out-buildings--$1465.00\n\n(B) Additional repairs to school building.\n\n1. Protection to Boiler Room Entrance.\n\nConstruct covered porch by reinforced concrete piers and beams tied to main wall at ground level, the front beam to be set down to form step with a reinforced concrete slab set at same level as existing door threshold. The porch to be constructed of 2 x 4 studs, sheathing paper with siding on exterior walls and finished roof. Provide and erect glazed door and frame at porch entrance and new door at main wall, including hardware and painting $190.00\n\n2. New doors to Boys' Entrance.\n\nProvide and erect both outer and inner double doors and frames. Outer doors to be glazed and equipped with panic bolts. Inner doors to have double swing hinges with push plate but no lock, all to be painted with approved paint $190.00\n\n3. New doors to Girls' Entrances.\n\nProvide and erect outer double doors and frames, glazed and equipped with panic bolts. Provide double swing hinges to existing inner doors with push plate, but no lock, painted with an approved paint $140.00\n\n4. Kitchen ceiling.\n\nRemove paint on existing metal ceiling and repaint $20.00\n5. Laundry ceiling.\nRemove paint on existing metal ceiling and repaint ------------------------------- $ 30.00\n\n6. Dining Room ceiling.\nRepaint dining room ceiling and walls ------------------------------- $ 40.00\nTotal for School Building ------------------------------- $ 610.00\n\nThe cost of rehabilitating the outbuildings as estimated by Mr. Haddow is $ 1485.00 which together with his estimate for additional items on the school building amounting to $610.00, produces a total of $2095.00 for work which should receive consideration in the near future. This estimate is considered reasonable. It may also be stated that exterior woodwork of all out buildings, is in need of painting, but this item has not been covered in Haddow's estimate.\n\nIn addition to work covered by the contract now being carried out, and the items referred to above, there is still a considerable amount of work that should be done, as outlined in our report of August 26th last. These items may be listed as follows:\n\n1. Septic Tank - Cover existing roof sheeting with T & G. lumber with white lead caulked joints, laid at right-angles to existing sheeting.\n\n2. Roof, Boys' Entrance. - Repair leaks in galvanized iron roof.\n\n3. Classroom ceilings. - Replaster portions of ceiling which have become loose and paint to match existing ceiling.\n\n4. Attic Dormitories. - Repair plaster of walls, provide and place wood dado rail at level of heads of beds.\n\n5. Water Pipes. - Renew all basement galvanized iron cold water pipes.\n\n6. Boiler Base. - Wrap existing brick boiler base with mesh or 1/4\" wire and place 6\" of concrete around same.\n\n7. Basement Toilets. - Replace soil trap connections to 2 toilets and repair soil trap connections to others. Repair 6 metal partitions between toilets.\n\n8. Exterior Basement Walls. - Repair exterior cement finish where aggregate is exposed.\n\n9. Rear Entrances. - Lay a 5\" concrete pavement at rear of boys' entrance, area approximately 480 sq. ft. and concrete pavement at rear of girls' entrance, area approximately 730 sq. ft.\n\n(Over)\nIt is estimated that the latter items to which we have drawn attention would entail an additional expenditure in the neighborhood of $1500.00.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that the work could now be carried out in favourable weather, it is felt that the Indian Agent should obtain an estimate embracing all repair items, and the arrangements should be made to have all remaining work carried out at the same time.\n\nT. S. Mills\nChief Engineer.\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nAbout a month ago Mr. C.M. Walker, our supervising engineer at Banff, referred to an estimate of additional work requested at the above school by Indian Agent Faunt. This repair work was additional to that covered by the contract with Mr. J.C. Haddow.\n\nThe Engineering and Construction Service have now received an estimate from the contractor on what are considered essential items, and I am enclosing herewith a copy of memorandum dated 25th October from Mr. Mills, giving details and prices. The additional expenditure involved is approximately $2065.00.\n\nYou will note that this does not attempt to include all repair work that should have been done during the past years if adequate maintenance work had been undertaken.\n\nDirector.\n| Sales Ticket No. | Date   | No. | Feet | Price | Ck. | Dr. | Cr. | Balance |\n|------------------|--------|-----|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|---------|\n| 34781            | Oct.12 | 2   | Rolls #1 Tar Paper | 2.13 | 4.26 |     |       | 4.26    |\n\nAddress: Indian Residential School, Winterburn c/o D.

Haddow of Edmonton on the above school, we are in receipt of a letter from the contractor, dated October 9th last, in which he advises that the school authorities appear to be under the impression that the painting of storm sash and screens should be included in operations now being carried out. The need for paint on storm sash and screens was pointed out in a report prepared following an inspection by an officer of this Service in July last, but as it was felt that this was an item that might reasonably have been undertaken by the school authorities, it was not included in the Haddow contract.\n\nThe contractor estimates that to paint the storm sash numbering 281 units and 12 storm doors, the cost would be $375.00. The number of screens fit for use and replacement for unserviceable screens, has not yet been determined.\n\nMr. Haddow, however, has been requested to prepare an estimate of cost for repairing, replacing and repainting window screens, and to submit it to this office for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch for their consideration. When this information is received, we will advise you further on the matter.\n\nT. S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nNovember 3, 1945.\n\nRe: Repairs to Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of the 17th ultimo in which reference was made to repairs and replacements of window screens at the above, we are now receipt of a letter from J. C. Haddow, who is carrying out other work at the school, in which he states that after examining all of the screens it is his opinion that 20 of these should be replaced and that of the balance a considerable number require repairs. For replacements, repairs, and painting of all screens, Haddow has submitted an estimate of $235.00.\n\nWhile carrying out repairs to the roof in the vicinity of dormer window sills, Mr. Haddow has found 2 sash in the dormers to be dry rotted and which should be replaced. He also reports that the paint on the spire has washed off and that repainting is necessary. He has submitted a tender for replacing the sash and repainting the spire which amounts to $100.00. None of these items were included in the original contract. We consider the prices submitted to be reasonable, and it is recommended that authority be granted to have these items carried out, while the contractor is still at the school, with funds already provided for contingencies.\n\nThe contractor is pressing for a decision regarding painting of the storm sash referred to in our memorandum of October 17th. While funds already transferred, would cover item referred to above, they would not be sufficient to provide for repainting the storm sash. It is recommended, therefore, that if Indian Affairs decide to have the storm sash painted now, while the contractor is still at the school, it should be handled as a separate item from the contract, and payment made by Indian Affairs on the basis of the contractor's certified accounts.\n\nWe would appreciate instructions on these matters as soon as possible.\n\nT.

I must therefore place before you our views regarding the operation of residential schools\u2014which are based on an agreement relating to the maintenance and management of Indian Boarding Schools, issued in 1911, and which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been changed in any principle. I have no doubt that you will find in the original files that the Methodist Church entered into this agreement.\n\nWithout going into too many details, this agreement or contract is that the Church will support, maintain and educate, in a manner satisfactory to the Superintendent General, a certain number of Indian pupils. The conditions are as follows:\n\n(1) Re Admission: This has not much bearing on the problem which we have to face.\n\n(2) The Church agrees to provide at the school teachers and officers qualified to give the pupils religious instruction at the proper times; to instruct the male pupils in gardening, farming, the care of stock, etc.; to instruct the female pupils in cooking, laundry work, etc.; and, generally, to give a proper education to these children.\n\n(3) To supply the pupils of the said School with suitable and sufficient clothing, subsistence, lodging accommodation; and also to supply the said School with mechanical tools, seeds, and all other articles and equipment necessary.\n\n(4) To keep the pupils clean and free from vermin.\n(5) It is also provided that the Superintendent General and any person or persons named by him shall have the right to inspect the School.\n\nThe Superintendent General, on the other hand, covenants:\n\n(1) To pay to the Church at a certain rate per annum for every pupil, and so on.\n\n(2) To provide the pupils with medicines, school books, etc.\n\n(3) To maintain the buildings at the School, when they are the property of the Government, in good condition and repair, and to provide proper sanitation and sanitary appliances.\n\nThat, in general, is my understanding of the contract, and from that I come to the conclusion that if the Church cannot do these things on the amount which is paid it we have to foot the bill. If, on the other hand, by reason of circumstances, there is some slight profit, that belongs to the Church and to no one else. You can understand that if we enter into a contract with the Department to educate children for a certain sum and lose money, and then if the Government says that if we have a slight surplus it belongs to them, the whole business will have to be revised; and I for one would most cheerfully hand over to the Government the financial responsibility for running these Schools.\n\nI hope that the Church will present to the Committee its views on the responsibility of the Government for Indian Education. I am only mentioning the conditions as they are in the contract in so far as they refer to the Edmonton School.\n\nFrom Inspector Gooderham's report, it would appear that the children have not received the care which the Agent at Hobema and the parents of the Saddle Lake Agency think should be theirs. I can only say in answer to this that, if there are any complaints about any School, I think they should be handled through the proper channels, namely, the Agent, the Inspector and the Church; and until we have a report that the conditions in a School are not satisfactory, we must assume that neither the Agent nor the Inspector has any complaint.\n\nMay I say that I think it is very unfortunate that these complaints concerning the general administration of the School at Edmonton were not made sooner; but there is not much point in discussing the past, except in so far as it may lead to a better state of affairs in the future. I sincerely hope that some Inspector will visit the Schools from time to time and, if there is any complaint about the education, clothing, or\nOttawa, August 30, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of an air mail letter dated August 28, 1946, received by me from Inspector Gooderham.\n\nIt is unnecessary to state that the reports recently received by this branch from Inspector Gooderham and Doctor Stone with respect to conditions at the Edmonton school have been to me and to the officials here rather disturbing. The general impression in the department up until now was that the Edmonton school was one of our most up-to-date buildings and one of the most efficiently operated institutions of its kind in the Dominion. It is just possible that Doctor Woodsworth's health in recent years has not enabled him to keep a close grip on the administration of the school. He also may have experienced difficulty in securing clothing and in securing capable help. Other school principals have found it necessary to appeal to us from time to time for discarded military clothing and have had this clothing remodelled for distribution to the pupils.\n\nMay I direct your attention particularly to Mr. Gooderham's reference to the sum of $14,700.00, which appeared as a surplus at the time of the last audit report in 1945. Would it be possible to proceed with certain repairs at the school on the understanding that these repairs would be paid in part from the surplus fund and from departmental appropriations? In view of the fact that Mr. Gooderham considers it undesirable to open the school until October 1st, I am personally of the opinion that we should proceed with substantial repairs and the redecorating that seems necessary, at once. It is not my intention to reply to Mr. Gooderham until I hear from you.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nActing Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street, West,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files (RG 10, Volume 6351, File 753-5, part 4)\nOttawa, August 28th, 1946.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nMr. C.M. Walker of our Banff office, advises that during an inspection of the above school buildings, the school stationary engineer drew attention to the soil pipe branch connecting a water closet to the soil stack in the boys' dormitory on the second floor. It was found that this pipe was completely eaten through, had been patched with a lead sheet, but continues to leak, the leakage running down the wall of the classroom below. As the pipe branch is beyond repair, it is felt that it should be replaced without delay.\n\nIt is recommended that the Indian Affairs Branch authorize this item to be carried out as maintenance by the Indian Agent.\n\nJ.

I am advised that six new toilets were authorized some time ago, three of which were purchased at the time and this one can be included in the three remaining. The school were able to locate a new toilet and owing to the scarcity of all plumbing material, they considered it advisable to go ahead with the work.

Hoey\u2014\n\n...3\n\ngeneral hygienic conditions, that we shall be advised immediately.\n\nI come now to the question of repairs. I most certainly cannot agree to the proposal that any part of the sum of money which is now at the credit of the Edmonton School should be employed in repairs to the building. That simply cannot be done. The buildings belong to the Government and consequently must be maintained by the Department. In that connection, may I point out to you that in cases where the Church owns buildings, the Auditor General forbids the expenditure of Government money on church buildings, and I am quite sure that the Auditor of the United Church would take a similar dim view of our right to expend money on Government property.\n\nI note in Inspector Gooderham's statement that he says that Mr. Staley found no clothing and very little bedding in the stores of the School, and that he has purchased over $6,000 worth for delivery about the middle of September. He thinks that some of the School funds could be used for redecorating and that Mr. Staley wishes to be advised. I must say, quite frankly, that I do not understand that at all, because when I met with Dr. Woodsworth, Dr. Hart, our Superintendent, and Mr. Staley in Edmonton, we decided that this balance would be available for proper purposes.\n\nIn connection with this balance, it must be remembered that a good deal of it is due to the fact that Dr. Woodsworth has disposed of considerable farm equipment and that this represents a considerable part of the accumulated surplus; but there was a surplus ten years ago, which had come about by the fact that farming operations had been more than usually successful.\n\nI have advised Mr. Staley that he is free to spend the $6,000 which he needs in the purchase of clothing and, generally, in replenishing the stocks of the School; and, further, that if he needs to purchase farming equipment, we shall be glad to agree to this being bought out of the surplus. I have done this, not only because of the local situation, but by reason of a resolution of the Board, passed this year, which says that when a considerable expenditure is contemplated by the School Principal, it shall be authorized by the Board. We passed this resolution because it will be obvious to you that it might happen that a Principal would incur a very large expenditure which could not be met out of current revenues, and, consequently, we would find ourselves, as has sometimes been the case, responsible for considerable expenditures which had not been authorized.\n\nFinally, it is expected that out of this surplus\u2014which will not be very large due to the necessity of replenishing the stocks, etc.\u2014we shall continue to pay Dr. Woodsworth's salary until the 30th\nMr. R.A.

We think that, after many years of service, this is not an unreasonable thing to do; and, further, that we have ample precedent in the case of Mount Elgin, where similar action was taken some years ago when Mr. McVitty retired as Principal.\n\nApart altogether from the fact that I think it is a wrong principle for the Church to spend money on repairs to buildings belonging to the Government - other than minor repairs which are done yearly, - I think it is obvious that the amount of money which is counted as a surplus at the School will very largely be used up in replenishing the stocks and making repairs to mattresses, etc., which will obviate any further complaints.\n\nI have only to add that we want to co-operate with you; but, at the same time, we think that if there are complaints, they should be made at the proper time. I am well aware of the fact that Inspector Gooderham cannot be held accountable in any way for the situation, but I am informed that these criticisms of the Indians have been going on for some time, and surely the Agent or Agents should have advised the then Inspector, who would then have passed on the information to you and then you would have passed it on to us.\n\nMay I ask if I have your permission to send a copy of Inspector Gooderham's report to Dr. Thomas Hart, our Superintendent of Missions, on whom we are laying more responsibility in regard to Indian Schools.

Haddow, was not able to complete the repairs under his contract last year, because of bad weather, and the work will be undertaken shortly.\n\nIn the meantime, further deterioration has occurred to the kitchen roof, and additional work required will involve an added expenditure of $195. We are advising the contractor to undertake this work, and it is expected it can be paid for out of the amount of $1600 that we asked you to provide in your 1946-47 estimates.\n\nIt has also been found that in addition to the window screens that were replaced, repaired, and painted by the contractor last year, forty others have been found to be in too bad a condition for repairs, and twenty other screens now require new wire cloth. The total additional cost for work on the screens is estimated at $134.00.\n\nIt is not expected that this latter sum can be taken from the $1600 referred to, and as the work is of a maintenance nature it is suggested that you authorize your Indian Agent to have it done as a maintenance charge apart from the Haddow contract. Your Agent could either have it done by the contractor for the sum mentioned, or bring in some local carpenter to undertake it.\n\nDirector.\nJune 28, 1946.\n\nMr. J. T.

The Surveys and Engineering Branch advise that the contractor who is working at the school at the present time is willing to repair these screens for $134.00.

This amount is required in connection with uncompleted work, contractor's holdback, and contingencies and supervision at the above-noted school.\n\nDirector,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJune 20, 1946\nAt the request of Mr. Indian Agent Faunt I went with him yesterday to help survey the Edmonton School. You are aware that the present Principal is retiring, to be replaced by Rev. E.J. Staley. Plastering and some other repairs have apparently been authorized and are being done.\n\nThe whole building, with the exception of the Chapel, needs re-decorating but this is not a health matter except perhaps on the basis of morale of the pupils and staff.\n\nThe following repair will have to be made at once and before the school re-opens:\n\nReplacement of a length of sewer pipe leading from a toilet on the second floor, west end, down through the floor and into a standing sewer which descends through the southwest class room. There is a place in this pipe about 1\" X 6\" corroded completely through. Mr. Lobb, the school Engineer, has repaired it with putty, etc., but it is now beyond repair. The operation will be difficult and possibly expensive as the connection leads over the top of a steel beam. I suggested that a new route be followed. Mr. Lobb knows the details.\n\nIn addition to the above I recommend strongly the installation of one bath tub and two shower heads in the boys' basement wash place. There is only one tub and one shower now, and the school population is likely to increase this year. Present facilities are inadequate.\n\nI was told that the Principal or Indian Agent has authority for the purchase of about 12 new toilet bowls and tanks, but that they are hard to get. Every tank in the school is corroded past safe use and many of the toilet bowls are broken and patched. Anything that could be done to hasten\nthe getting of these fixtures should be done. The wash basins in the basement wash places are very badly chipped and eaten away by the sodium charged water available at the school. They are perhaps only moderately insanitary, but they are discreditable looking to say the least. It is suggested that replacement be deferred until they can be replaced by a stainless steel trough about 12 feet long with hot and cold taps above so that the pupils can wash in running water, directly from those taps and not in the trough or in wash basins. Taps of small calibre or small delivery could be installed to conserve water. Washing in basins is not a clean process at any time. The taps, of course, would have to be of the mixing kind.\n\nStainless steel is recommended as the only material I know of which will resist corrosion by the kind of water available at this and probably other western schools. The water at this school has attacked even the clay of which the present enamelled basins are made.\n\nThe drinking water installations are not very satisfactory in the basement play rooms. Drinking fountains of the gush type were originally installed but were unpopular and hard to keep in working order. Not one, in fact is working now. I am not sure that a common tap turned sidewise can be improved upon, but it should have some sort of guard to prevent contact with the mouth, and should be fed by a pipe which will not be heated by nearness to some warm object. This paragraph is of general application. Drinking facilities are important at any school. No new ones are immediately suggested at the school in question.\n\nThe whole institution shows the effect of lack of maintenance during the war. It is in fact badly run down. Considering this, it is clean from a soap and water point of view.\n\nThe immediate action recommended in this report is authority for repair of the sewer pipe, but it is intended to re-inforce other recommendations which will be submitted by the Indian Agent or Principal.\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.B.,\nMedical Superintendent,\nIndian Health Services,\nAlberta.\nOttawa, August 23, 1946.\n\nMr. G.

It was my impression that the Principal at Edmonton had ample funds at all times to keep the Institution in a good state of repair. Why he did not do so is exceedingly difficult to understand. The condition of this school, now brought to our attention, emphasizes again the urgent need for proper and thorough inspection of Indian residential schools by our Indian Agents and by our Provincial Inspectors. In making this statement, I have not in mind the academic work carried on in such schools, but rather the condition of the buildings, including the farm buildings, and particularly the sanitary condition of the dormitories and lavatories. Unless we can make up our minds to do this in the future, the whole residential school system is apt to become completely discredited in the minds of the public.\n\nI have been in touch with the Reverend Doctor Dorsey by long distance telephone this morning and we are convinced that it would be a mistake to postpone the opening of the school until October 1st. Such a postponement would involve family allowance payments and a number of other such matters that should be avoided, unless the obstacles confronting the Principal are simply insurmountable. Would it be possible for the Principal to open early in September, even though the enrolment might be comparatively low? Should\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nActing Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY,\nAlberta.\nShould it not open until October, the condition of the school and the reasons for the postponement are likely to become subjects of public discussion and I am anxious to avoid this if I can possibly do so.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Staley at Morley, and it would be appreciated if you could discuss the matter with him personally.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nStatement\n\nFolio\n\n19\n\nM\n\nIn Account\n\nwith\n\nTerms:\n\nLighting: Ceiling + Walls\n1 coat Spray Daylite, 1 coat\nPaint redating Enamel.\n\nEntire Building (Interior)\nshall consist of 2 coats\nSpray Daylite)\nStatement\n\nAug 17 1946\n\nM Indian School\n\nIn Account Resident House\n\nwith Fred Agnew\n\nTerms: $325.00\n\nSpecific details:\n\n- Ceiling & Backval not included\n- Bedrooms & Closets Closets\n- 2 coats enamelled on Ceiling\n- Walls\n- Woodwork - Local Satin Finish\n- Varnished\n- Kitchen & Bathroom - Ceiling\n- Walls - Local Paint - Local Enamel\n- Woodwork in Bathroom Painted\n- Kitchen - Varnished\n- Doors not included\n- Living Room, Dining Room\n- Cupboard Lower Shelves\n- Ceiling - Wall - Painted\n- Woodwork - Varnished\n- Ceiling Painted 25\u00a2 per roll\n- Wall Paper 50\u00a2\n\nPrice $325.00\nCALGARY, August 28th, 1946.\n\nVIA AIR MAIL\n\nR.

A. HOEY, ESQ., Director, Indian Affairs Branch, Government House,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Painting and Repairs, Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nAttached is copy of an estimate on the painting required, given by Mr. Fred Ayris, 12904 - 112 Ave., Edmonton. Mr. Ayris is a painter who has had a great deal of work with the Board of Education, at Edmonton Schools, and his work is reputed to be of high calibre.\n\nHe has quoted by floors, as well as by the yard, for one or two coats. This price is in line with that being currently charged in Edmonton.\n\nIf the entire contract cannot be undertaken at present, Mr. Staley and I recommend that the work be done in the following order of priority: 1. Basement, 2. First Floor, 3. Second Floor, 4. Third Floor.\n\nMr. Faunt was instructed to go ahead with the plumbing work in the dormitory, e.g., the soil pipe and closet repairs, this being an immediate requirement.\n\nThe school engineer has one heating boiler ready for use; the second one, which has been in operation for many years, has leaky tubes which should be replaced before winter. Laundry equipment is passable, but arrangements are being made, I believe, to send out washing to the Chas. Camsell Hospital Laundry, so that there is no immediate requirement here.\n\nThese things are mentioned as they might constitute quite an item for plant overhaul before winter.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nA/Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nCALGARY, August 26th, 1946.\n\nR. A. HOEY, Esq., Director, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nYour letter dated the 24th was received yesterday. I had only then returned from the official opening of the Charles Cassell Hospital and the installation of Mr. Robertson as Clerk-in-charge, Edmonton Agency.\n\nThis school was inspected on the 23rd and over the weekend I had advised the Regional Director of Family Allowances, the Agents at Hobbema, Saddle Lake, and Edmonton that it was not likely to be open for pupils in September.\n\nMr. Staley was immediately contacted at Morley, and in the afternoon we got together to discuss the whole situation.\n\nI had found the interior of the building in very great need of painting, repairs to plaster, as well as some plumbing and heating repairs. Mr. Staley had an Edmonton painter give figures on the decorating, and as it totaled over $6,000.00, I arranged to meet him, when a price by the yard was secured. Repair to a plumbing fixture and soil pipe is necessary in one dormitory before it is occupied but the building, otherwise, can be fully occupied now. I would, however, advise against this.\n\nMr. Staley is still at Morley but hopes to get to Edmonton when relieved; possibly next week. He states that he found no clothing and very little bedding in store at this school and has purchased over $6,000.00 worth for delivery about the middle of September, at the earliest. The mattresses are old and filthy and generally the dormitory equipment is in poor condition.\n\nIn this connection, it is to be reported that pupils returned home from the school with itch; this was reported to me by the Agent at Hobbema and by parents in the Saddle Lake Agency recently; the latter adding that their children were lousy. The school may not be responsible but bedding and mattresses should be thoroughly examined before used again.\n\nParents do not want to send their children back to this school as it is today; of this, I am quite certain. I suggest that cleaning up and redecorating be done before they are asked to do so.\n\n(over)\n...are asked to do so.\n\nThis will be costly; much of the work should have been done from year to year, and Dr. Woodsworth now admits it. Agent Faunt brought it to the attention of the Branch in 1945, but there is nothing in the Estimates, but a memo; Apparently Mr. Woodsworth carried on independently.\n\nHe stated to me that he never asked for a money expenditure outside of the per capita grant, either from the Board of Home Missions or this Department; he financed from revenue created at the school.\n\nThis brings up another point. From the Auditor's report of 1945, it is noted that Mr. Woodsworth holds Victory Bonds in the amount of $14,700.00 plus whatever funds remain in the Current banking account. To whom does this money belong? If it represents school funds could not part be used in redecorating and purchase of supplies and equipment? I believe it is very important to know what will be done with the Bonds, and I know Mr. Staley wishes to be advised.\n\nThe postponement will not seriously affect Family Allowance payments; they will be continued to the parents from lists forwarded by the Agents to the Regional Director in September. Such arrangements had been made for all children in the Province where school facilities are not available. I also believe that we will be less open to criticism from the delay in opening than we will be if the school is opened in its present condition. In all this, Mr. Staley concurs.\n\nUnder separate cover are submitted the estimated costs for painting the interior of the school and the assistant Principal's house, with some explanations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

The cost of this work is estimated at $335.00. Also enclosed is a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated October 17th last, regarding the painting of storm sash and storm doors, the estimated cost of which is $375.00.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Mills advises that funds already transferred to Engineering and Construction Service will be sufficient to pay for the replacement, repair and painting of screens, etcetera, amounting to $335.00. We concur in his recommendation that this work be done and your approval thereof is requested.\n\nWith regard to painting the storm sash, it is noted from your memorandum of November 7th that funds are not available for other repairs estimated at $2,065.00. However, if $375.00 can be made available, it is suggested that the school principal be instructed to arrange with the contractor, Mr. J.C.

The Department is extremely desirous that this work be done immediately. Other repairs that are required at the school will be considered next year, as owing to weather conditions which, I understand, exist in the Edmonton district at the present time, there is no likelihood that any more outside work can be done in the immediate future.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Indian Agent Faunt, in order that he may advise us when the work is completed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

We have been in communication with Mr. Staley both by letter and wire and he strongly recommended the purchase from War Assets Corporation of 50 complete double decker beds and 150 mattresses. Apparently these were available at some camp close to Edmonton and Mr. Staley expressed the definite opinion that these would be suitable for the school.

These will be ordered later.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. E.J. Staley,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEDMONTON, Alberta.\nActing upon the request that an inspection be carried out at the school, I visited the premises, inspected the plumbing installations and fixtures, and also the sleeping accommodations.\n\nFor various reasons, many of the plumbing fixtures have become unfit for use. I noted that a battery of eight wash basins in the boy's wash room was in a badly cracked and decrepit condition. Therefore, cleansing of the basins could not be satisfactorily carried out. If I may venture an opinion, I should say the condition of the basins was caused more by abuse than by actual wear and tear. However, be that as it may, the wash basins are of no further use as such.\n\nThere were also two toilet fixtures and flush tanks in the boy's section (basement floor) in bad condition and should be replaced. In this section also, I noted one shower, whereas provision in the layout of the piping was made for three showers. Two are missing for reasons unknown to myself, but I see no reason why all these should not be made usable.\n\nOn the second floor there are two toilets with flush boxes that need replacing and also one on the ground floor.\n\nOn the girl's side of the building, there are five toilets with flush tanks in bad repair in the top floor dormitory, second floor dormitory and smaller girl's dormitory, respectively.\n\nIn addition to those already mentioned, I would recommend that the two tub baths be made available at the institution at the beginning of the school sessions.\n\nIn the infirmary portion of the building, two new toilets should be provided.\n\nI carried out an inspection of the mattresses used in the dormitories and noted many of them in such a condition as to be unfit for further use, in fact those inspected represented a good percentage of the total number of beds available, which would indicate that a complete set of new mattresses was needed. The felt content used for the building up of the mattresses had become lumpy and must be uncomfortable for the user. In many instances the felt was falling out by reason of the outer material being badly worn and torn.\n\nI might add that the cause of so many flush toilets being in bad condition is by reason of their being lined with copper which together with steel causes electrolysis with resultant rusting and pitting of the metal. I should recommend that all such copper lined tanks be replaced with either porcelain or plastic tanks with preference for the porcelain.\n\nI noted one instance where a 4\" water pipe was pitted and leaking, and which understood was to be replaced immediately.\n\nSEPTIC TANK SYSTEM. The tank, which I was told, was a combined septic tank and filter bed, was found to be out of commission as such. The cement tank was full and the contents flowing through the emergency pipes without being subjected to any treatment whatever. In other words the tank was only doing the duty of a cesspool with the added danger of the sewage matter flowing out in the same condition as it entered the tank.\n\nI would recommend that the tank be thoroughly cleaned out and converted into a septic tank with the filter with the filter media removed, as I believe the media is the chief cause of the plugging of the discharge pipes. The syphon for the purpose of discharging effluent from the second chamber should also be put in working order.\n\nJ.

Butterfield\nProvincial Sanitary Inspector.\nCalgary, October 2nd, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nFurther to our report of the 28th August, and departmental telegram of the 6th September, this is to report that an intensive inspection was made of this school on the 30th September.\n\nThe Principal had exceeded the authorized expenditure:\n\n(a) Renovating.\u2014 The basement - boy's and girls' play-rooms, wash-rooms and the pupils' dining-rooms had been completely re-decorated; and the stairways leading to the basement; a small room on the ground floor, which was in very bad shape, and is designated as the boys' reading room, had also been re-decorated; and on the first floor, two girls' and two boys' dormitories had been done -- at an approximate total cost of $1,500.00.\n\nIt must be said that all this work was very badly needed.\n\n(b) Boilers.\u2014 The boiler inspector had gone over the heating plant, and one of the boilers proved dangerous under pressure, and permission was not granted to use it unless it were re-tubed, and fittings that had burst or were pitted, replaced; fortunately tubes, which are very scarce, were located and this boiler put into working order at a cost of approximately $500.00.\n\n(c) Plumbing.\u2014 Necessary plumbing fixtures -- repairs and replacements -- totalled approximately another $500.00.\n\nThe grand total expended will be approximately $2,500.00. Mr. Staley explained, that so far as the plant repairs and replacements were concerned, he had no other alternative but to proceed as ordered; in this it is agreed.\n\nWith regard to the renovation, nothing was found to have been done which could very well have been left undone, and still expect the Indians to have the regard for the institution that it is hoped to get.\n\nThe above is not all: With knowledge of the past spread of skin disease at this school, the Principal had an inspection made by the Provincial Sanitary Officer; this gentleman's report is attached hereto. Enclosed also is a letter from Dr. E.L. Stone, who made an inspection of the septic system in company with the writer. From these reports it is clearly seen that something has to be done to make this institution more sanitary before the pupils get settled therein:\n\n1. \u2014 The bathing facilities are inadequate, and to complete same, two (2) bath-tubs must be purchased, at an estimated cost of $200.00.\n2.- Eight (8) toilet bowls and tanks are required, at an approximate cost of $400.00.\n\n3.- The Septic Tank must be cleaned, and then put in running order. Though we are not familiar with this type of plant, it is thought the total cost cannot be very great, if the plant is working at all; it will be mostly labor.\n\n4.- Repairs to a utility building which is allocated for vocational training, will total around $500.00. There are 24 broken windows which must be repaired and replaced.\n\nThe total cost of the above, for which immediate authority is asked, should not exceed $1,000.00.\n\nFurther, it is to be reported that the contract placed by Mr. C.R. Gorrie of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, in 1946, was not completed, and it was only during my inspection that the flat roofs over the kitchen were being done; these roofs had been so bad, that water poured into the kitchen during every rain storm. This is mentioned because the account for this work will no doubt be submitted very shortly.\n\nIt was also pointed out by the Principal that there is very little bedding, and that he will require same to the value of $1,000.00.\n\nDouble-decker beds, mattresses and palliasses are being supplied this week by war Assets Corporation.\n\nMr. Staley has a complete staff, a splendid supply of food-stuff, and the Agencies from which the pupils are to be drawn have been advised to send them in on the 9th instant. This is the earliest possible date on which the School can be opened.\n\nPlease wire regarding the items for which immediate authority is asked.\n\nG. H.

Boiler foundation is crumbling. Rebuild when convenient. There is deep pitting on crownsheet, particularly around the base of the staybolts. Use more lime to check this pitting. Note: Boiler retubed September, 1946. Near right handhole, inside, deep pitting.\"\n\nThe certificate for the other boiler reads as follows:\n\n\"Boiler foundation is crumbling. Rebuild when convenient. Lower bank of tubes is badly pitted. Also crownsheet is actively pitting. Use more lime to check this pitting. Renew water column piping.\"\n\nI shall be glad if you will bring these several matters to the attention of the Department, with a view to having the necessary repairs effected before winter sets in, if possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.J.

The porch should be torn down and rebuilt on a better foundation, as the existing footing wall is shivered and broken so badly as to be useless.\n\nOf course the porch could be eliminated, but, if so, the existing platform would have to be extended, necessitating a certain amount of foundation work and the brickwork on the house would still have to be toothed in and brought up to the door on both sides and over the door to the window sills.\n\nThere is no doubt also that this procedure would seriously detract from the appearance of the house and would not be a great saving in cost.\n\nI (OVER)\nI would say that to take down the porch, install proper concrete foundation and rebuild as it should be done, would run anywhere between $300.00 and $350.00, with the latter as the outside cost, if the work is done before freezing weather. If it is left until then and we have to protect the concrete and the brickwork against frost, the cost will be correspondingly higher.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) \"JAS. C.

Robertson,\nActing Indian Agent,\nEdmonton Agency,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Robertson:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copies of letter received from Mr. Jas. C. Haddow, Contractor, Edmonton, in connection with the porch on the Farming Supervisor's house at this school.\n\nMr. Haddow submitted a tender for the doing of this work along with other work in October, 1945, but apparently the Department did not consider the job urgent, as nothing was heard about it. The figure submitted at the time was $150.00 so you can readily see from the figure it is estimated will be required now to do the work, that the porch is getting into really bad shape.\n\nI am submitting Mr. Haddow's letter in order that you may place the matter before the Department and if it is decided that the work should be done, I would suggest that it be done immediately.\n\nIf it should be decided that it should not be done now, I would suggest that it be undertaken as early as possible in the spring, along with a lot of other work, which it has been recommended should be done to the buildings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. J.

The explanation for this increase is that the war Assets Corporation shipped a better quality mattress than the one on which they originally quoted.\n\nThe item of $178.50 which has been deleted from the account, covers the cost of Mattress covers which had not been authorized.

Robertson Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nEdmonton Agency,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Robertson:\n\nWe recently had occasion to use one of our fire hoses to flush out a drain, which had become clogged and found that the fabric was rotted through in many places, rendering it useless so far as fire protection was concerned.\n\nAn inspection was then made of the other hose throughout the building and it was found that a large proportion of this was in a leaky condition.\n\nIn order to have the minimum of safety for the building we should have at least eight, fifty feet lengths of 1\" hose and one, one hundred feet length, with what they call I think, expansion couplings.\n\nAn inspection was also made of the Fire Guns and Extinguishers throughout the building and ninety per cent of these were found to be out of repair and useless as fire-fighting equipment.\n\nWe should have at least two dozen of these placed at strategic points throughout the building and in this connection I might mention that I was recently in the warehouse of the War Assets Corporation in Edmonton and they had a wonderful supply of various types of this equipment, some of which was absolutely new & had never been unpacked.\n\nThey had also a quantity of hose, but unless this was new, it would be dangerous to touch it, as it might have been put away wet & would be in no better condition than what we have.\n\nThis is a matter that should have immediate attention, as, in the event of our having a fire, we would be in rather a hopeless position in trying to put it out.\n\nCopies to Inspector Goodrum and The Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.J. Staley\nPrincipal\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nNovember 21st 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nNow that Winter has set in, I have deemed it necessary to put on a night watchman, in order that fires be maintained and that a proper watch may be kept on the steam heating system which is not in a very good state of repair, the pipes leading throughout the building being badly corroded and liable to give way at any time, which they have been doing for some considerable time.\n\nIn this connection I believe it has been the practice of the Department to make an allowance of $40.00 per month during the Winter months towards the salary of such a man and shall be glad if you will give consideration to making such an allowance for this school during this Winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J. Staley\nPrincipal.\n\nCopies to Mr. Inspector Gooderham and Mr. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 26 November 1946.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson, Clerk in Charge,\nWINTERBURN, Alta.\n\nWe have received a letter from Rev. Mr. Staley, Principal of the Edmonton School, requesting a grant for a night watchman. We only allow such grant at schools where we consider an extra fire hazard exists. We have never allowed a grant for a night watchman at the Edmonton School and have no funds for this purpose at the present time.\n\nMr. Staley has also forwarded a copy of his letter of the 21st instant, addressed to you. With regard to the fire hose requested, please let us know if the couplings are standard iron pipe thread. If not, a sample of the couplings should be forwarded to this office.\n\nWith regard to his request for additional fire extinguishers, you should let us know if 24 are necessary. If so, what size is required. If you can obtain a price for these from War Assets Corporation in Edmonton, you should do so and advise us.\n\nBernard F.

I have been in touch with the War Assets Corporation in Edmonton and while they have a large quantity of these on hand, they not for sale as yet.

As a matter of fact there is not a single piece of equipment, water or chemical, in that section of the building in which the kitchen, laundry and boiler room are located, nor in the chapel which is on the floor above them.\n\nIn view of this condition we have taken the liberty of ordering three Fire Guns in order that we may be in a position to handle any flash fire which may occur in the kitchen and pending your action in furnishing the equipment asked for.\n\nAlso while giving consideration to the question of supplying fire fighting equipment, I trust you will give favorable consideration to the matter of a night watchman for the school.\n\nI might say that I am considerably worried as to what might happen in the event of our having a fire, not only on account of the lack of suitable equipment, but on account of the antiquated system of fire escapes on the building, where the children would have to climb up onto window ledges four feet from the ground in order that they may get onto the ladders outside.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J.

E.J. Staley, would like to have a copy of the plans of this building, together with an outline of the drainage system and the lighting system. This school was erected during the fiscal year 1923-24.\n\nThe Principal states that he is considerably worried as to what might happen in the event of a fire. One of his statements in this regard reads: \"On account of the antiquated system of fire escapes in the building, the children would have to climb to window ledges four feet from the floor in order that they may reach the ladders outside.\" It is thought that in using the word \"ladders\", the Principal means fire escape. If you have a plan of the building, it will probably show the fire escape.\n\nActing Director.\nFROM OCT. 9 1933\nTO DEC. 20 1946\n\n222033\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6351)\n\nFile 753-5, part 3\nEdmonton - Industrial School - Building Maintenance Accounts. 1929-1933\n\nFile 753-5, part 4\nEdmonton - Industrial School - Building Maintenance Accounts. 1933-1946\n\nFile 735-5, part 5\nEdmonton - Industrial School - Application for Inspection of Construction. 1920-1925\n\nFile 753-5, part 6\nEdmonton - Industrial School - Accounts - Building Maintenance - Supplies. 1947\n\nFile 735-5, part 7\nEdmonton - Industrial School - Accounts - Building Maintenance - Supplies. 1947-1949\nIndian Industrial School\n\nIn regard to $10.00 due Beatty Bros. for barn plans:- I can only say that theirs was ONE of the plans submitted, at our request.

In the meantime we are having to haul all our water from the river, a distance of about two miles. For drinking water we have to go to the city, a distance of about five miles. This work takes the time of one man and two teams of horses, and even then we often cannot supply the various groups of workmen with sufficient water to keep them going. When we get water one of our greatest difficulties will be solved.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nIndian Industrial School\n10356 121 street,\nat Edmonton Alberta.\n\nAugust 11th 1920.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of August 4th to hand (No. 522,194-5)\n\nAs requested I shall forward the cancelled cheques to you as receipts for the wages paid. I was under the impression that the numbers of the cheques as given on the pay-lists would be sufficient.\n\nIn regard to the salary of Mr. L.D. Parney, the contractor, I may say that your decision to pay him a salary of only $250.00 is I think very unwise, and should not be final.\n\nWhen this work was started early last spring I was commissioned by Mr. Ferrier to have charge of the operations, getting out the plans and securing suitable men to undertake the work. A number of contractors were anxious to take the work, and it was only after due consideration that I asked Mr. Parney to be the contractor. He was recommended by a number of independent sources to whom I went for advice and information. I have not yet found a man who gives Mr. Parney anything else but the highest recommendation for honesty and efficiency. He has been a resident of Edmonton for some 15 years, and has done some of the best work in the city. For some years he was employed by the Provincial Government, and was contractor, or head foreman, on the government buildings. When Mr. Ferrier came in touch with him, he congratulated me on my choice of a contractor. He also wrote a letter to Mr. Scott expressing his satisfaction with the work of Mr. Parney, see Mr. Ferrier's letter of March 18th.\n\nIn this letter Mr. Ferrier states that he has engaged Mr. Parney.\n\nIt seems unfortunate that our terms of engagements are not satisfactory to the Department, particularly as we understand that this was part of our responsibility.\nIndian Industrial School\n\nBefore the matter is definitely settled, I think the Department should state their basis on which a contractor should be employed. I asked Mr. Parney his terms. He stated $375.00 a month. I left the matter until Mr. Ferrier made his next visit. We discussed a ten per cent commission on the work cost which is a common basis for a contractor to work upon. I pointed out to Mr. Ferrier that this would mean about $4000.00 for this year's work, so the total cost this season will easily be $40000.00. On the present basis Mr. Parney will receive about $3000.00 or less even if the work continues up into December, which it will not. No doubt the Department is aware that at the present time, owing to the uncertain markets contractors are not taking contracts for a whole building program, either a salary or commission basis are taken for work. In our case the wage basis is far the best. As regards the price you offer: At present I am having to pay one of the foremen at the rate of $250.00 a month, or nearly so. James W. Jensen gets $1.00 an hour. In town common carpenters get .90\u00a2 an hour. I can hardly offer Mr. Parney this when he has charge of the whole work: Cement work, brick work, well drilling, and everything connected with the construction. Besides this Mr. Parney is putting his entire time on the work, not eight hours a day, but twelve and thirteen hours a day. He bought a car in order to do the work. He is away at six in the morning and does not get back until eight at night. His work is making it possible for us to put up a plant which is complete as far as it goes and I will gladly welcome any inspection of our work. I shall be glad to have suggestions as to better methods of doing a good job, but we cannot afford to lose Mr. Parney for $375.00, at least this year. A new contract may be made next year. I have probably written at too great length on this subject, but I think that the matter will stand some discussion. I would respectfully suggest that Mr. Parney be engaged at the original figure.\nIndian Industrial School\n\nIn regard to $10.00 due Beatty Bros. for barn plans:- I can only say that theirs was ONE of the plans submitted, at our request. They made out the plans according to our instructions at the time and we used them as a basis for subsequent plans, so while they were not entirely satisfactory for our later plans, yet they were not entirely useless.\n\nIn regard to the contract for well drilling:- I sent you the contract as written by Mr. Redamel with my letter of May 6th. See note under \"Voucher 6\" of that letter. I think you will find the letter among the mass of material I sent you at that time.\n\nI also have your letter of August 6th. I shall be glad to give you a weekly report of our work.\n\nAt present the barn is about completed with the exception of a few details, and the fitting of fixtures.

When Mr. Scott returns to Ottawa I shall place your explanations before him and inform you of the result.\n\nIn regard to the contract for well-drilling, I beg to say that the only document received from you under cover of your letter of the 6th May last was the enclosed letter from Mr. Rodarmel.

Parney, viz:- $375.00 a month.\n\nThe Principal has paid Mr. Parney at the rate of $375.00 a month since 1st April, but the Department has only allowed $250.00 a month, and we have made refund to the Principal at this rate for the months of April, May and June only.\n\nThe Principal continues to pay Mr. Parney $375.00 a month and his name appears on the pay lists received to date.\n\nIf Mr. Parney is to be allowed $375.00 a month a further payment of $375.00 will be due Mr. Woodsworth for the months of April, May and June.\n\nIn connection with Mr. Parney's work I would call your attention to Mr. Wollard's Report of the 10th September forwarded by Mr. Graham under cover of letter dated 17th September.\n\nOttawa, 1st October, 1920.\n\nChief Accountant.\nMAGOON & MACDONALD.\nARCHITECTS, EDMONTON, ALBERTA.\n604-7 TEGLER BUILDING.\nH.A.MAGOON, L.I.C., R.I.B.A., A.A.A.\nG.H.MACDONALD, B.Arch., A.A.A.\n\n835 Tepler Building\nApril 6, 1921.\n\nRev.

This would involve taking tenders, if any, certifying as to payments due on contractors' estimates, which would be checked by us, and giving constant oversight to the construction by visits to the site, assisting the contractor to interpret the intent of the plans, and elaborating same where requiring further details.\n\nWe believe this would be of the very greatest assistance to you in obtaining a satisfactory building and maintaining a proper check on the builder, and is customary in such circumstances.\n\nThe fees would be the usual customary allocated to such services or as further arranged with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nArchitects\nApril 23rd, 1921.\n\nSirs,\n\nReverend Mr. Ferrier has handed me today your letter of April 6th, with reference to the supervision of the proposed new Indian Industrial School near Edmonton, Alta.\n\nReplying to this letter I beg to say that your application has been noted for consideration when the services of an inspector are required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Scott,\nDeputy-Supt-General.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nWith regard to the proposed new Residential School near Edmonton, Alberta, I have felt constrained to write to you to say that I would much like to be appointed as Inspector of Construction to supervise the carrying out of the Department's building plans for that very important Institution. I believe I could render satisfactory service there. My past record and building experience are known to the Department, particularly, perhaps, in consequence of the School we erected at Kuper Island B.C.\n\nI do not wish to presume to stress my desire for the Edmonton appointment. As a loyal servant of the Indian Department I am prepared to serve to the best of my ability wherever my superiors decide I can be of the most use. I understand that it is the Department's intention to erect a Hospital and a Stock Barn on the Blackfoot Reserve here; and if it is your wish, Sir, that I remain here in connection with this work, or serve anywhere else, it will be my pleasure to do so. However, should my services be more helpful in connection with the larger work at Edmonton, I can only say, in the language of the immortal Dickens, it will be another case of \"Barkis is willing\".\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.

Recently we requested them to advertise for an Inspector of the Work during the erection of the Edmonton school, and I inclose the poster herewith. It was a mistake on the part of the Civil Service Commission to ask you to pass upon the applications, but, as it is imperative that the appointment be made at the earliest possible date, we will let the advertisement go on.\n\nIf you get any applications, rush them to the Department.

Mr. Smith is known to us, having done work for the Department before, and Mr. May has decidedly excellent recommendations. Mr. Bury and Mr. Donaldson are Civil Engineers, and for that reason, so far as our work is concerned, I have rated them much lower.\n\nAs Mr. May lives at Edmonton, and the building is just on the outskirts of the city, he is much more conveniently situated, and considerably less expense in travelling would be involved.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nGovernment of the Province of Alberta\nOffice of the Fire Commissioner\n\nDecember 23rd, 1946.\n\nFrom: J. H. Leyland, Esq.,\nLethbridge, Alta.\n\nTo: R. H. Moore, Esq.,\nSupt. of Insurance & Fire Comm'r.,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nFire Inspection Report\nRe - Edmonton Indian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nIn view of the recent tragic fires which have occurred causing loss of life instructions have been received from Mr. Moore, Superintendent of Insurance & Fire Commissioner, Edmonton, Alta., to inspect all buildings of public assembly, and therefore, while in the St. Albert district, a thorough inspection was made of the above residential school.\n\nThe following is a description of the various buildings inspected, their occupancies and recommendations to remedy fire hazards found therein:\n\nADMINISTRATION BUILDING\n\nThis building is three storey and basement - construction brick - interior walls lath and plaster. Built 1924.\n\nOccupancies:\nBasement. Wash and bath room, boys and girls playrooms, furnace room, laundry room, kitchen, boys and girls dining room and furnace room.\n\nRecommendations basement:\nIt is recommended that a stand pipe be connected with the present water pressure pipe in the corridor - North & South wall, with hose and hose bracket - 100 feet of 2\" iron hose, to service dining room, kitchen, washroom and boiler room. Approved type of fire extinguishers to be installed in all of the above mentioned rooms; furthermore, all drop cords or extensions from ceiling outlets be removed and rooms wired to conform with the present Canadian Electrical Code.\n\nFIRST FLOOR\n\nOccupancies on this floor are as follows:\nOffices of the principal, The Rev. E.J. Staley, and Assistant Principal, J.A. Feunt. Secretary's office, Staff dining room, Sewing room, two playrooms each end of corridor. (East & West) and Church Chapel.\n\nRecommendations 1st floor\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\n(continued)\n\nHose or hose brackets attached to standpipe be replaced - present hose perished. Flexible electric extensions cords from existing outlets in sewing room dining room (staff) class rooms and corridors be removed and re-wired to conform with Canadian Electrical Code. Pilot light to be installed over electric iron. Extinguishers S & A type to be thoroughly checked and tagged.\n\nEnd FLOOR\n\nOccupancies of this floor are as follows:\nFour children's dormitories - located\nNo. 1 N.E. corner - accommodates 15 double beds - 30 children - ages 6 years to 12 years\nNo. 2 N.E. corner - accommodates 15 double beds - 30 children - ages 12 years to 16 years\nThe other two dormitories are located at the east end of the building, and are duplicate of the last end. There are also staff bedrooms.\n\nRecommendations - see Fire Exit facilities.\n\n3rd FLOOR\n\nThe whole of this floor is presently closed off. It is periodically used as dormitories. At present used as storage for beds and mattresses.\n\nRecommendations - see Fire Exit facilities.\n\nFIRE ALARM SYSTEM\n\nBuilding has the 'break glass type' on own transformer - system services all floors, but not connected with staff residences. Recommend that system be carried to staff quarters.\n\nFIRE EQUIPMENT\n\nThere are two standpipes which service the building. Each floor has hose 1\u00bd inch linen, 50 feet; this is attached to hose bracket, with nozzle. Recommend that all hose be condemned and replaced - hose has been in use since 1924.\n\nEach floor has two S & A type fire extinguishers 5 gallon - located each end of corridors - east & west ends. These should all be thoroughly checked and properly tagged.\n\nFIRE EXIT FACILITIES\n\nA very unusual situation exists in connection with these facilities and should be remedied immediately. Fire exit other than main inside\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School\n(continued)\n\nstairway - South centre of building is by the way of double sash windows, located in each of the children's dormitories. In order to reach the sill of each window it is necessary for the children to step up some four feet from the ground level. Because of their short build they cannot do it, while therefore necessitate older children rendering assistance. Such exit facilities are inadequate for an occupancy of this type and would recommend that windows be removed, standard doors installed and to be equipped with approved type of panic bolts. There are two other exits, but these are located in the two staff bedrooms, doors are kept locked and the children deprived of their access.\n\nFIRE ESCAPES\n\nTwo stairway type - located North Wall\n\" pole type \" West Wall\n\" pole type \" East Wall\n\nThe two stairway type are so situated that their use would only be for the staff, access to these are gained through the two staff bedrooms. Bedroom and exit doors are kept locked at all times.\n\nThe pole type of course is the children and as previously mentioned exit to these are gained through a sash window. From the window sill abutting the wall is a small platform and it is by these means the children are expected to make their escape in the case of fire. At the time of this composition no thought has been given to 30 or 40 below zero weather. It is difficult to imagine any person and especially small children, being able to safely make their escape from the building in the event of fire by means of this type of escape. One hundred and thirty children in night attire would, in my opinion, never be able to evacuate the building by means such as are available, especially in winter when the metal would be covered with frost. I would recommend that these pole type of escapes be removed and two steel tubular ones installed at North and East walls, that inter-connecting doors be installed to connect each dormitory and standard door exits to replace windows and equip each door with approved type of panic bolt.\n\nNIGHT STAFF\n\nNil. None provided by the Department.\n\nWater Supply\n\nThere is only one well which meets the ordinary requirements of the building - that is general use. I should also mention that this supply is used by the residences.\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nThere is no reserve and any extra demands made on the well would run it dry. Water supply would be inadequate to put out any fire should there be a rapid spread. Would recommend that supply be increased.\n\nBOILER ROOM\n\nCement walls and floor - contains three boilers - two low pressure type of 40 lbs. each and one high pressure of approx. 100 lbs. Coal fed. Room has two exits - North and South walls. Engineer in charge. From midnight until six A.M. each day no person is in charge of the boiler room. Furnaces are banked down for the night and left. The matter of a night watchman has been brought to the attention of the Department of Indian Affairs by the present principal, but the Department stated that seeing no provisions had been made in the yearly estimates for the payment of one the services of a watchman would have to wait.\n\nThe above is one of extreme importance and I would recommend that the services of an night watchman be secured. It is quite evident that if a fire ever started in this building a large loss of life would result.\n\nOUTSIDE BUILDINGS\n\nThese consist of the following:\nHorse barn, Cow barn, Hog barn, utility building, roothouse and garage.\n\nThe hog barn is the only building which has a supply of water and that is through a half inch pipe. No facilities in any of the other buildings in case of fire. Recommend that approved type of fire extinguishers be installed.\n\nSTAFF RESIDENCES\n\nNo fire extinguishers. Recommend they be installed.\n\nREMARKS:\n\nInspection shows that buildings have been allowed to deteriorate to a very marked degree, though its cause has not been through the present Principal. Numerous conditions at present prevailing should be remedied. In the matter of fire exits and escapes these should be attended to at once, same applies to all electrical wiring, water supply and fire fighting equipment. In the interests of fire prevention such conditions should not be tolerated especially where the boiler room is concerned. A second engineer, or night watchman should be added to the present staff.\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nFIRE DRILLS\n\nI omitted to mention that periodic fire drills are held under the supervision of the School Principal. Members of the staff, when available, constitute the volunteer Fire Department.\n\n(sgd.) J. H. Leyland, Insp.\n\nH. R. Moore, Esq.,\nFire Commissioner,\nEDMONTON, Alta.\n\nForwarded for your information.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nFire inspection Report\n\nThe Provincial Fire Commissioner submitted the attached report to Dr. Stone, Medical Superintendent, Dept. of Health & Welfare, and he has passed it on to this office. In a covering letter from the fire Commissioner he states that his Department has recently undertaken inspection of public buildings in the Edmonton area, with a view to the elimination of fire hazards, and the recommendations respecting egress and public safety. Certain fire fighting apparatus is now being supplied to this institute, but of course not as complete as this inspection report requires. Your attention is drawn particularly to the report on existing fire exits and the recommendations. You will also please note that the inspector recommends a night watchman.\n\nThe type of fire escapes in this and many other schools is certainly unsatisfactory, and in this I have always felt there was great room for improvement. Failing the ability to supply good fire exits, the next best thing is to supply (temporary of course) a competent night watchmen. In this and other large residential schools a night watchman should be supplied, if at all possible.\n\nThe report is submitted for your consideration and comments.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nIndian Residential School  \nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA  \nEDMONTON  \nALBERTA\n\nJanuary 14th 1947.\n\nThe Secretary,  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nDepartment of Mines & Resources,  \nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn talking with the engineer at the school, I learned that the electric motor at the pumphouse had not been checked for about twelve years and as it has seen a lot of service during that period, he thought that a checkup and a possible rewinding might be warranted.\n\nHe also informed me that two or three years ago, when he was changing some valves in the cylinder in the well, he noted considerable wear in the cylinder and it might be possible that replacement of the cylinder would be called for this year, when the cylinder, valves & rods were being checked.\n\nReplacement of the cylinder I would imagine, would be an expensive job, as I understand it is 4\" in diameter and about six or seven feet long, but of what make I have been unable to learn.\n\nI thought it best to advise you of these conditions in order that you may be prepared to meet the expense, should it become necessary to incur same.\n\nIn connection with the cylinder, I understand that the one in the well has been in use for over eighteen years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J. Staley  \nPrincipal.\nWe cannot see any reason for keeping the doors locked in the two staff bedrooms when the dormitories are occupied. You should inform the principal immediately that the Department expects these doors to be kept unlocked so that if necessary the children can use these exits.\n\nSome years ago we decided to allow an amount for night watchmen to certain Indian residential schools where it was felt a definite fire hazard existed. We never previously considered the Edmonton school in the class just mentioned. However, in view of your recommendation, we are prepared to allow an amount of $40.00 a month until April 30, 1947 towards the salary of a night watchman at the Edmonton school. It should definitely be understood that this is only a temporary measure.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, 22 January 1947.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant enclosing report submitted by the Provincial Fire Commissioner regarding the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nAt the request of the principal, we have arranged within the last month, to have our Purchasing Branch secure 24-1 qt. fire extinguishers, 500 feet of hose, and 12 refills for foamite fire extinguishers at present in the school. The commissioner's report reads as follows regarding the fire exit facilities:\n\n\"A very unusual situation exists in connection with these facilities and should be remedied immediately. Fire exit other than main inside stairway - South centre of building is by the way of double sash windows, located in each of the children's dormitories. In order to reach the sill of each window it is necessary for the children to step up some four feet from the ground level and some of the children being so small it would therefore necessitate older children rendering assistance. Such exit facilities are inadequate for an occupancy of this type and would recommend that windows be removed, standard doors installed and to be equipped with approved type of panic bolts. There are two other exits, but these are located in the two staff bedrooms, doors are kept locked and the children deprived of their access.\"\n\nWe are not certain if the commissioner's suggestion can be carried out without effecting the building. However, you may make inquiries and let us know. In the meantime it would be advisable to have permanent steps made leading to the windows which are used as an exit to the fire escape.\nOttawa, 22 January 1947.\n\nMr. E.A.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated.\n\nVoucher No. 342-46\nDate November 16th, 1946.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nJanuary 22nd, 1947.\n\nRe: Fire Escapes - Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your notation dated January 4th, 1947, on Indian Affairs memorandum of December 20, 1946, and in particular dealing with the Principal's statement in respect to fire escapes, our officer who made an inspection of the School during July, 1945, reports that the window sills are somewhat high for young pupils, particularly in the attic dormitories where the windows are, as stated, 4'-0\" above the floor.\n\nThe Principal's reference to \"antiquated system of fire escapes\" is borne out by our officer's report of August 30th, 1945, in which the following item occurs:\n\n\"Fire Escapes. The fire escapes are landings provided with poles to the ground and are not practical for younger pupils. In this connection, it will be noted that in order to keep the older boys and girls within the dormitories during the evenings locks had to be attached to the doors and windows leading to the fire escapes.\"\n\nThe above item refers to fire escapes, which apparently were not included in the original design to provide fire exits from dormitories and classrooms. Two standard fire escapes are shown on original plans at the rear of the building and are in place.\n\nReference was also made to the doubtful utility of the type of fire escape under discussion in a memorandum dated October 7, 1944, with photographs attached, in which it was recommended that consideration be given to providing the usual steel stairs and rails.\n\nThe blue prints requested are being prepared and will be forwarded when ready.\n\nJ.

Stanley\nPrincipal\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nFebruary 6th 1947.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome few months ago you authorised the purchase of fifty double decker beds for this institution and these were duly received and have proved very satisfactory indeed.\n\nThe pupilage in the school however, has now reached the 130 mark and more pupils are continuing to come in, so that we could make good use of a further twenty of these beds and would be very pleased if you would authorise their purchase.\n\nWe do not need mattresses for these, as we got fifty extra before, as they were such a good buy.\n\nWe however are up against it for blankets, as it is just impossible for us to buy them and if you can help us out to the extent of two hundred or even one hundred, it will be greatly appreciated.\n\nWhen we took over the administration of this school the bedding was in a deplorable condition, necessitating tremendous outlay on our part and it has got to the point where we cannot do any more.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J. Staley,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 13th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Staley:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th inst., the Department approves the purchase of an additional twenty double decker beds for the Edmonton school. It is noted that you will not require mattresses as you already have a supply of these.\n\nOwing to the lack of funds we regret that we cannot authorize the purchase of blankets.\n\nFire extinguishers are difficult to obtain and it usually requires several weeks or even months before delivery can be obtained. However, we are communicating with the Pyrene Manufacturing Company and asking them to expedite delivery.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard W. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. E.J. Staley,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nc/c to E.A. Robertson, Winterbury, Alta.\nOttawa, February 13th, 1947.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe: Purchase order 15826\n\nThe above ordered twenty-four one quart fire extinguishers for the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nWe are extremely anxious to have fire extinguishers at this building as soon as possible and anything that you can do to expedite delivery would be very much appreciated. If possible, you could ship part of the order at once and the balance later.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard M. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPyrene Manufacturing Company\nof Canada, Limited,\n91 East Dominion Roadway,\nToronto 8, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to your letter of Jan. 23rd, 1947, in connection with repairs to motor and pump cylinder at Edmonton Indian Residential School well.\n\nI understand that it has been the practice to pull the cylinder, rods, etc., each year during the summer vacation for a check-up and I would recommend that when this is done this coming summer, that the services of an electrician be secured to check the motor, also that the cylinder be inspected by a competent well man and replacements made if necessary.\n\nE.A.

Robertson, Indian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 8th inst., with reference to the motor and pump cylinder in the well at the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, you may arrange to have a check up made of the cylinder, rods, etc., during the coming summer. If necessary, the services of an electrician can be obtained to check the motor. It is understood that you will keep all costs as low as possible.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCalgary, Alberta,\nFeb. 12th, 1947.\n\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nThe Principal of this school has made a request that he be supplied with a wide carriage Typewriter.\n\nWould the cost of this be met if it could be secured through the War Assets Corporation? There is no doubt that it would be an advantage in making out returns and reports.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, February 18, 1947.\n\nMr. C.H. Gooderham, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 12th instant requesting authority to purchase a wide carriage typewriter for the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nWe have not purchased any typewriters for Residential Schools in the last few years. This action was partly due to the fact that typewriters were in very short supply.\n\nIn your letter you intimate that a typewriter could be secured through War Assets Corporation, I presume you refer to the Alberta Branch of the Corporation. At what cost could a wide carriage typewriter be purchased?\n\nBernard W.

He states that if the material could be made available, most of the repair work required to be done, could be attended to during the summer holidays by members of the school staff and with no additional cost to the Department. Many pipes show signs of being eaten right through, and in attempting to replace a section it gives way.\n\nIn regard to the showers and washbasins for the boys, it was noted on our first inspection of this school that the water tanks were in very bad condition, and it is understood that they were the subject of criticism by the Sanitary Engineer. The Principal would prefer two stainless steel troughs with overhead taps, so that the boys could wash their hands and faces under the taps and where there would be a continuous flow of water.\n\nIn regard to the showers in the washroom, there would originally appear to have been three showers, but two of them have completely disappeared and the one remaining is unusable. The Principal indicated that he had found these showers were indispensable. By using them it was possible to avoid the spread of skin disease, and he contended that the showers were much more suitable than bathtubs. In this we were in agreement.\n\nThese requisitions are submitted in the hope that they will be favorably considered and orders placed for the supplies and articles mentioned therein.\n\nG. H.

Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nReferring to your 110-0-5, W.T.I., of February 18th, regarding the typewriter for the Edmonton Indian Residential School, I am now advised by Mr. Robertson, that the wide carriage machine is not available at present.\n\nThis will therefore be left in abeyance for the time being.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to your letter of Dec. 19th, 1946, in regard to desks required by Edmonton Indian Residential School and my reply of Dec. 31st, advising that they required 10 No. 1 model \"J\" and 20 No. 3 model \"W\".\n\nThese desks have now come to hand and No. 5 desks have been supplied instead of the No. 3. I note that P.O. No. 16036 calls for No. 5 desks.\n\nThe School advise that the No. 5 desks are altogether too small for their requirements and that the local representative of the Loyer School Supply Co., advises them that there would be no difficulty in disposing of the No. 5 desks here and replacing them with No. 3 desks in the next carload coming forward. There is, I understand, a slightly higher price for the No. 3.\n\nWill you please advise if this can be arranged.\n\nM. A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nA Modern Solution\nto a Very Old Problem\n\nSPERZEL\nSANITARY TOILET SEATS\n\nSPERZEL COMPANY OF CANADA\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA\n\nCATALOG NO. 300\nModel LP20\n\nSELF-RAISING SEAT\n\nMODEL LP20 embodies all the sanitary and efficient features that Sperzel has always offered, yet new comfort has been added. The seating area has been nearly doubled and the pads are so shaped that they follow the contour of the body perfectly.\n\nRemember these advantages in using SELF-RAISING SEATS\n\n* Remains perpendicular to the bowl when not in use... always stays clean, dry and sanitary.\n* Removes the need for costly urinals... every bowl serves as bowl and urinal.\n* Lowers toilet room maintenance costs... self-raising seats eliminate fear of contamination.\n* Provides cleaner toilet rooms... encourages proper use of facilities.\n\nThe scientific construction of Model LP20 provides the maximum in SANITATION, EFFICIENCY and COMFORT. The seat consists of two black double-strength plastic seat pads that have been REDESIGNED to give greater comfort and yet do not permit unnecessary bodily contact. These pads are connected by a black plastic-covered steel yoke. The spring raising mechanism is a self-contained unit, enclosed in a plastic housing with a black plastic cap.\n\nModel LP20 is available also in all white.\n\nSPERZEL\n\nModel 50\n\nSELF-SUSTAINING HINGE\n\nBLACK\u2014MODEL 50 FOR REGULAR BOWLS\nMODEL 50R FOR ELONGATED BOWLS\n\nNew Model 50\u2014With Self-Sustaining Hinge\n\nSolid one-piece moulded plastic seat. Made from Phenolic Resin\u2014the most durable and desirable of all plastic materials for toilet seats.\n\nOpen front, closed back, less cover, conventional pattern seat. 1/4\" thick throughout with 1\" thickness at the hinge. Oversize replaceable rubber bumpers. Hinge is entirely self-sustaining. Seat will swing to any degree and remain in position. Cannot be slammed up or down but is easily raised or lowered. Hinge construction is solid, rugged and durable. It will not break or freeze and is designed to last indefinitely.\n\nSPERZEL OF CANADA\nModel 50\nSELF-SUSTAINING HINGE\n\nNew Model 50\u2014With Self-Sustaining Hinge\u2014In Gleaming White Finish\n\nSolid one-piece moulded plastic seat, made from Phenolic Resin. Finished with a gleaming white Roxalyn enamel baked on under high heat. This is a tough finish that does not easily scratch or mar, and does not turn color.\n\nOpen front, closed back, less cover, conventional pattern seat, 3/8\" thick throughout with 1\" thickness at the hinge. Oversize replaceable rubber bumber. Hinge is entirely self-sustaining. Seat will swing to any degree and remain in position. Cannot be slammed up or down but is easily raised or lowered. Hinge construction is solid, rugged and durable. It will not break or freeze and is designed to last indefinitely.\n\nSPERZEL OF CANADA\n\nModel 20\nSELF-RAISING SEAT\n\nSperzel Model 20 has a definite place in modern industrial and public washrooms. It was designed especially for such installations.\n\nModel 20 offers the real solution to the acute problem of washroom sanitation. The two plastic seat pads differ from those of Model LP20 in that the seating area is reduced. They offer the absolute minimum of contact yet furnish ample support. The pads are smooth, polished and non-porous. There are no crevices or inaccessible places in which germs may lodge. They are unaffected by chemicals ordinarily encountered in the washroom. The open construction allows easier, more efficient cleaning, yet does away with the need for constant cleaning.\n\nModel 20 for Regular Bowl\nModel 20E for Elongated Bowl\n\nModel 40\nSELF-SUSTAINING HINGE\n\nThe pad and yoke construction of Model 40 is identical to that of Model 20. The hinge construction is identical to that of Model LP40.\n\nThe difference in pad construction of Models 20 and 40 from those of Models LP20 and LP40 can be readily seen by comparing the dimensional drawing on this page with those on pages 3 and 4.\n\nDimensional Drawing\n\nModel 40 for Regular Bowl\nModel 40E for Elongated Bowl\n\nSPERZEL\nConstruction\n\nThe construction of the spring raising mechanism used on ALL Sperzel Self-Raising Seats is shown above. Note that it is a self-contained unit, enclosed in a plastic housing with a black plastic cap. It is completely sealed. Moisture or dirt cannot enter.\n\nThe large torsional spring easily lifts the seat to a 90\u00b0 angle, while the smaller spring acts as a flexible check mechanism which will allow the erected seat to be forced back beyond the normal position without causing any flush tank, or other obstruction, and will return it immediately to the vertical position without damage.\n\nThe use of Sperzel Seats does not involve the replacement of bowls. All Sperzel Seats fit ALL standard toilet bowls with 5\u00bd\" bolt hole centers.\n\nDimensional Drawing\n\nMODEL LP20\n\nModel LP40\n\nSELF-SUSTAINING HINGE\n\nModel LP40, like Model LP20, has been REDESIGNED to offer greater safety.\n\nThe seat pads and yoke are identical in construction to Model LP20. The hinge mechanism, however, is a vast improvement over all other types of self-sustaining or check hinges and is offered only by Sperzel.\n\nThe hinge bolts are enclosed in individual housings, made of the same indestructible black plastic material of which the pads are made. This model is equipped with a patented Sperzel spring tension unit that prevents the seat from falling.\n\nWhen tightened onto the bowl, it exerts a constant pressure which holds the seat to whatever position it is raised...a self-sustaining hinge.\n\nThe construction and design of this model makes it extremely rugged and serviceable. It will withstand long years of very hard usage. Model LP40 is also available in all white.\n\nModel LP30\n\nModel LP30 is identical in construction to Model LP20 with the exception that the self-raising spring mechanism is omitted. Pads, yoke, housing and plastic cap give this model an excellent appearance.\n\nThis seat is ideal for installations in the better class of women's restrooms.\n\nModel LP30 is also available in white.\nSperzel Sanitary Toilet Seats are designed exclusively for use in industrial plants, theatres, office buildings, hotels, hospitals, state and governmental institutions, and, in fact, wherever public washrooms are maintained. These seats are the most sanitary and efficient toilet seats available and are by far the most economical.\n\nSPERZEL COMPANY OF CANADA\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Plumbing Equipment for the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nReferring to your letter of March 18th, 1947, to Mr. G.

After coming over here I had a Mr. Skov who had done the job previously, come out and look at it, but though he promised to come back and do it, he never showed up, so I would suppose his stomach would not stand it.\n\nI was able to make other arrangements late last year however and had the job done and the tank is functioning again as a septic tank.\n\nWhen you stop to think that it had not been cleaned out for over five years, you can possibly imagine the accumulation of filth that had to be removed.\n\nIf you cannot locate the letter of authority I refer to, I think the Provincial Health Inspector's report & the recommendation of Dr. Stone and Mr. Inspector Gooderham will be sufficient authority.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.J.

If this were done it would prolong the life of the tanks by several years.\n\nWould you please take the matter up with the Department with a view to having the expenditure authorised.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.J.

Gooderham, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary.\n\nRe: Repairs to Pig Pen Floor, Edmonton\nIndian Residential School\n\nI have received an inquiry from Mr. Staley as to whether the repairs to pig pen floor which he was under the impression had been asked for in our 1947-48 estimates, had been authorized.\n\nI cannot find that repairs to this building were specifically asked for but they will need the building very shortly as they have a dozen or more cows to fatten soon and the flooring is in very bad shape.\n\nIt will require 4 cu. yds of ready mixed cement to make the repairs, cost approximately $40.00.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Repairs to Pig Pen Floor,\nEdmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nAttached is copy of a letter received from Mr. Robertson, Indian Agent, Edmonton Agency, which is self-explanatory.\n\nI cannot find out whether this item was provided for in the 47/48 estimates, but nevertheless the repairs would appear necessary. A damp floor can prove very harmful to pigs and can cause or aggravate the disease known as chronic swine erysipelas.\n\nG. H.

E.J. Staley, Principal\n\nEDMONTON INDIAN AGENCY\nJUN 20 1947\nWinterburn, Alta.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton Agency,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Robertson:\n\nIn connection with the redecorating etc., which were estimated for last year for this school, I am submitting measurements of some of the rooms, which really should be done and as we had anticipated having these done during the holiday period, I thought it better that you have the figures in order that you may submit them to the Department.\n\nI would presume they would want to call for tenders for the work to be done on a yardage basis, or they might have in mind the furnishing of the paint and having us do the work ourselves with the help of two or three of the bigger boys, who of course would have to be paid. We could not however undertake to do the ceilings as they are of corrugated metal and would be better done with a spray gun, in which case we might have difficulty in getting anyone to undertake the spraying of the ceilings, without having the full job of painting to do.\n\nThe linoleum in the halls on the first and second floors, as you know, is all worn out and should be replaced and if it were decided that this should be done, it would require 190 square yards. I would suggest that some kind of a grey marble pattern be supplied, which would not show tracks as the old brown linoleum did.\n\nThe Mastic floors in the children's dining room, pantry and back kitchen have become badly pitted and are hard to keep clean and sanitary and some kind of resurfacing should be done. There is a firm, The Taylor Tile and Contracting Co. in Edmonton who do this kind of work and was wondering if it would be in order to have their expert look over the floors and suggest what had best be done, in reason.\n\nThere is another matter that I mentioned to you on one of your recent visits and that is that there is not a water tap or basin in any one of the dormitories, which means that if a child should want to have a drink during the night, he or she has to go down to the basement to get it. This is something that should be remedied before the school is reopened in September.\nThe tables and benches in the children's dining room also, are in a state of repair and drew unfavorable comment from Miss McCready when she visited the school in the spring. I would recommend that something be done about replacing these and if it is decided to do this I would recommend that the tops be either plastic or linoleum covered.\n\nIt is our intention to do considerable touching up and painting throughout the building during the summer and with this in mind I would request that we be furnished with the following:\n\n- 5 gals each of Cream, Ivory and White Enamel.\n- 5 gals of White paint.\n- 5 gals of Green paint (Outside).\n- 5 gals each of Turpentine and boiled oil.\n- 4 each of 2\", 3\", and 4\" brushes, good quality.\n\nWhen the painting was done last fall in the children's dining room it was considered that the burlap on the lower portion of the walls should be replaced and the plaster repaired, but it was impossible to obtain new burlap, so the old was painted over, but it was not a good job. Burlap is now available and I am satisfied that if the material were furnished the members of the staff could repair the plaster, put on the burlap and paint same. Could you ask that this be done, please.\n\nThe electric wiring throughout the building drew unfavorable comment from the Provincial Fire Inspector, when he visited the school and recommendation was made that it be given attention and I think during the forthcoming holiday period would be the best time to do it and would recommend accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.T. Waunt,\nActing Principal.\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary.\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter from the Edmonton Indian Residential School, in regard to redecorating, repairs, etc., for the school.\n\nThis matter was discussed with Mr. Gooderham in Edmonton on June 28th and with his concurrence, I would recommend that the requests of the School be given preference as follows:\n\n1. 15 gals of paint, 5 gals each of turpentine and boiled oil, 12 brushes, for touching up and painting throughout the building.\n\n2. Redecorating of 2 class rooms, now in poor shape, at once and balance of redecorating if funds available.\n\n3. Purchase of burlap for dado in dining room and painting of same.\n\n4. Purchase of linoleum for halls and chapel.\n\nI will endeavor to secure estimate of cost of repairs to mastic floors in the dining room, pantry and kitchen, also to the tables and benches in dining room and will submit this later.\n\nI would also recommend that the electric wiring mentioned be inspected by a competent electrician and any necessary replacements made.\n\nI shall be glad if you will ask the Department to give this matter preferred attention as any repairs should be made during the summer holidays, and while Mr. Faunt's letter is dated June 4th, it was not received in this office until June 20th and as I was paying Treaty all last week, I did not have time to attend to it until today.\n\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. B. F. Neary\n\nAttached is copy of a letter from Indian Agent Robertson, as well as a letter written by Mr. J. T. Faunt, assistant principal, Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will note that some redecorating and repairs should be done at this school during the summer months, and these are covered fully in Mr. Robertson's submission.\n\nFor your consideration, please.\n\nG.

E. J. STALEY, PRINCIPAL\n\nYour file 110-0-5(1)\n\nEdmonton\nXMEREX ALTA.\nJuly 14th 1947.\n\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the absence of Mr. Staley I have opened your letter to him of July 9th in regard to War Assets Corporation account for Mattress Covers supplied to this institution, to the value of $178.50.\n\nThis account was sent to you through the Edmonton Indian Agency, and was also returned through him, with the remarks that as the account had not been authorised it could not be paid by the Department.\n\nAt the time the account was sent in, it was explained that these slip covers were required as a protection to the mattresses which had been supplied by the Department and for which we were very grateful. In the event of their becoming soiled they could be taken off and washed and replaced on the mattresses, which has been done to all of them since the closing of the school at the end of June.\n\nI might go on to explain that when Mr. Staley took over the school, everything was in an extremely run down condition and extensive repairs and replacements were necessary, the cost of which could not begin to be met out of the per capita grant and I might just as well be frank and say that we have not had the money to pay this account and we are only hoping that the grant for the July - September quarter will enable us to get straightened around.\n\nThere has been practically no revenue from the farm, which had been allowed to get into a run down and weedy condition and had been leased to outsiders, who allowed it to get into a worse condition. Practically all the livestock had been sold off and all of the machinery so we had to start from the ground up, you might say, but, we are hopeful.\n\nI think under the circumstances and considering the fact that the covers are for the protection of the Department's property, payment of the account might well be considered by the Department and this I would urgently request. The other account for $37.50 will be taken care of by Mr. Staley on his return from holidays.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.T. Faunt, Asst. Principal\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Voucher No. 293-47, in favor of the Cockshutt Plow Co., for $2184.27, covering tractor and power machinery purchased by the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nLetter of explanation from the School is also attached, from which it would appear that the machinery was purchased without authority.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 17th, 1947.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson, Indian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing vouchers for $2,184.27 covering the cost of tractor or power machinery purchased by the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nNo authority was given the principal of the school to make this purchase; besides it is not the general practice of the Department to supply farm machinery to residential schools and no provision was made in the current year's appropriation for this expenditure.\n\nUnder the circumstances the Department cannot consider payment of the account which is returned herewith.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\npp/mcd\nOttawa, July 18th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Faunt:\n\nWe have your letter of the 14th instant with reference to purchases made by the Indian Residential School from War Assets Corporation.\n\nAs you state in your letter, the purchase of the mattress covers was not authorized by the Department. It is simply impossible for us to control our expenditure if every principal of a school assumes responsibility of incurring without authority, expenditures which the Department is expected to pay. In future we will expect that authority will be obtained for any disbursement for which you expect the Department to provide the funds.\n\nThe future policy is outlined above but we have decided to pay the amount of $178.50. Please certify the account and return to me immediately.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Staley will pay War Assets the other account amounting to $37.50.

Robertson,\nIndian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Robertson:\n\nI was wondering if you had heard anything from the Department in connection with the work requiring to be done at the school, as outlined in my letter of June 4th.\n\nThe holiday season is slipping along and it would be a whole lot better for all concerned if the work could be undertaken during the holidays.\n\nThere is also the matter of the footings under the boilers which should be given attention during the next six weeks and before the school reopens.\n\nThese footings as you know are of brick and have become badly broken and eaten away and there is danger of their collapsing completely; in fact at one place the bricks have given way and there is an open hole through into the ash pit, making it impossible to control the fire.\n\nThe boilers would have to be jacked up an eighth of an inch or so, the old bricks or what is left of them taken out, new bricks put in and the boilers lowered again into place.\n\nAt the back end of the boilers the asbestos bricking used for insulation has fallen away to a considerable extent and we are therefore losing a considerable amount of the heat generated in the boilers and this also should be given attention.\n\nI have been trying for several weeks to get a man to come out and look at the boilers and last night I finally got a bricklayer to come out and look things over and he figures he could come out in about three weeks or now and do what is to be done.\n\nIn the meantime I thought it well to bring the matter to your attention, so that I would be in a position to give this man the go-ahead signal when his services become available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCopy for Department\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Repairs, Edmonton Indian School...\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of letter received from the Edmonton School in connection with repairs required to their boilers, also an estimate of the cost of repairs from Wm. Clevette, Brick-Layer.\n\nMr. Staley has phoned me this morning advising that they found one of the boilers leaking and on having the Saskatoon Welding Co., Edmonton, look it over, they found that it was in very bad shape, the bottom of the boiler being badly corroded and nearly eaten through in several places. The Boiler Inspector was called to look it over and he advised them that under ordinary circumstances he would have to condemn the boiler but as it was impossible to replace it at the present time, he would send them a statement of the minimum repairs he would require before he would pass the boiler. As soon as this comes to hand I will send it to you. In the meantime, will you please advise if it will be in order to go ahead with the repairs he orders. It will probably be quite an extensive job but is absolutely necessary as they must have heat.\n\nThe Welding concern are unable to give me any estimate of the cost as they do not know just what will be required until they get the boiler torn down.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 5th, 1947.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson, Indian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the\nlst instant, we approve an expenditure of $120.\nto repair the foundations supporting the two\nboilers in the basement of the Edmonton Residential\nSchool.\n\nWith reference to the repairs to the\nboiler, you may arrange for the repairs that the\nBoiler Inspector considers absolutely essential.\nWe hope that you will keep the cost as low as pos-\nsible.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would\nlater forward us a copy of the Boiler Inspector's\nreport.\n\nBernard F.

Staley, Principal\n\nMorley, Alta.\nAugust 4th, 1947\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Robertson:\n\nI am now in receipt of written report from the Boiler Inspector in regard to the condition of the boilers in this institution.\n\nThey would appear to be in much worse condition than I had anticipated, necessitating the doing of a considerable repair job, before we can use the boilers next winter.\n\nIt would appear that in the beginning and before the large soft water cistern was installed, the water from the well was used in these boilers. You yourself have seen the effect this water has on all metal work in the building and presumably the corrosive action once started has continued ever since, with the result that the plates have been eaten right through.\n\nWhen speaking to you about the condition of the boilers, I was not aware that the well water had ever been used, but on talking to the engineer on his return from holidays, I learned that the soft water cistern was not put in for some time after the school was built.\n\nI understand you have already taken up the matter of having the necessary repairs effected immediately. It would be much nicer if this could be done before the school reopens in September.\n\nI am enclosing the account from the Provincial Government for the inspection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.M. Fount,\nAsst. Principal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Repairs, Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing copy of letter received from the Edmonton School, also copy of letter from the Inspector of Boilers as to the repairs required to the boilers at the school before they can be passed and approved for operation.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Fire Escapes - Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nOn an inspection of this school in June, I was impressed by the inadequacy of the fire escapes. The only egress from some of the large dormitories was through windows, and it was learned that these windows had invariably an ordinary and storm window on them during the winter months when the danger of fire is greatest. This practically prohibited the use of the windows as fire escapes, because the storm windows were fastened on the outside.\n\nIt was suggested, as a temporary measure, to remove the storm windows and weatherstrip the ordinary windows in order to keep out the cold.\n\nSince that time, the Principal got more expert advice on fire escapes, and submitted herewith is a copy of his letter addressed to Mr. Robertson, Indian Agent, Edmonton Indian Agency.\n\nThe suggestion of a door in place of a window is certainly better than than the use of a window as a fire escape. It is also the least costly method of giving more fire protection to the pupils. It had been my suggestion to do this, but at that time the principal was not acquainted with the buzzer system used in some of the other schools. He has since stated that he finds that it can easily be installed and is very effective in keeping control of the movement of pupils at all times.\n\nI would recommend that doors, secured by panic bolts, and a light buzzer system be installed as soon as possible.\n\nG.

We find from the account that the firm is asking a payment of $938.94.\n\nYou will note from the last paragraph of our letter that we expected you to keep the cost as low as possible. Did you supervise the work that was done and did you obtain quotations from other firms?\n\nPlease let us have specific information regarding the manner in which this work was handled. We also require a detailed account from the company.\n\nThe item of labour on the account enclosed appears very high. How long was the firm employed in doing the work?\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq., Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Alberta, Calgary.\n\nRe: Fire Escapes, Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nReferring to your letter of Aug. 11th, 1947, to the Department in connection with the above.\n\nThe best bid I could secure for the installation of the six doors in place of the windows, including the panic bolts, is $750.00. This would appear to be entirely out of proportion to the additional protection it would afford.\n\nMr. Staley feels that with the additional fire extinguishers provided and the recent repairs made to the fire fighting equipment, they are fairly well protected, and suggests that the replacement of the windows be postponed until such time as funds are available for the installation of an up-to-date system to replace the present poles.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Fire Escapes, Aderton Indian Residential School\n\nMay I refer to my letter of August 11th, file 110-48-3, when it was recommended that doors with panic bolts, replacing windows as fire escapes, together with a light buzzer system be installed. I enclose herewith a copy of a letter from the Indian Agent, Mr. Robertson, stating that the installation of doors with panic bolts will cost $710.00, and that the Principal has recommended that nothing be done at present.\n\nI do not concur in this. If it is thought that the cost of the replacement is prohibitive, then there remains one other alternative, which I am sure you will agree, that is to install weatherstrip on the windows so that the storm window can be left off during the winter. The fire escape is certainly of no value and the windows, most of which are solidly fixed to the wall, must be opened before the pupil gets on the fire escape. Furthermore, the value of fire extinguishers is very limited. In buildings made mostly of inflammable material, such as lumber, fire is likely to be used even though the fire is small, but immediately fire spreads to some outside before noticed, and in the natural wind conditions, the fire extinguishers may prove of little value in protecting life.\n\nIf doors are not going to be installed, then I seriously recommend that authority be given to put on weatherstripping and give instructions that the storm window be placed at the fire escape. The cost should not exceed $100.00.\n\nWhen you reply would you please send it direct to the Indian agent and a copy to this office.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. H.

He has forwarded to us a copy of your letter to him dated September 13th. The estimated cost of the changes suggested by Mr. Gooderham appear very high.\n\nPlease arrange to have the metal weather strip applied to the windows so that storm windows can be left off during the winter. No storm windows should be placed at the fire escapes. Mr. Gooderham states that the cost should not exceed $100.00.\n\nBernard F.

Robertson,  \nIndian Agent,  \nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Robertson:\n\nAs you know, the basement of the Utility building at this institution is used for the storage of vegetables and in order to serve this purpose, the concrete walls were lined with hollow tile brick to provide insulation.\n\nOn one of your recent visits I pointed out to you that all this brick along one side and one end of the building had been broken out and that the vegetables stored came in direct contact with the concrete walls.\n\nLast year we suffered considerable loss from the freezing of vegetables exposed to the concrete walls down which the frost crept and into the vegetables.\n\nI had thought that if I were to set in 2 x 4 or 2 x 6 studs against these outside walls and sheet them up with common boards and then fill in behind the boards with sawdust or planing chips I could prevent a recurrence of this loss.\n\nThe lumber required for this purpose will run around 1000' & will cost in the neighborhood of $70.00 and was wondering if you would ask the Department for authority to make this purchase in order that I may go ahead with the work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.T. Haunt  \nAust. Principal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter received from the Edmonton Indian Residential School in connection with the purchase of 1000 ft of lumber to be used in replacing the tile lining in their root cellar, total cost $70.00.\n\nIf funds are available, I would recommend that this request be granted.\n\nA. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 9, 1947.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson, Indian Agent, Winterburn, Alta.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, the Department approves the expenditure of $70.00 for purchasing lumber to replace the lining in the oil burner at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/RM.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Voucher No. 49-47, $154.00, in favor of F. Ayriess, Edmonton, covering decorating done by him to two sitting-rooms and Chapel at the school, also to Farmer's residence at the school.\n\nMr. Ayriess advises that he has never been paid for this work and I have no record of it having been vouchered from this office.\n\nI am also unable to find that any authority was given by the Department for the expenditure.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nAirmail\n\nOttawa, October 16th, 1947.\n\nRe: Decorating - Edmonton Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Staley:\n\nPlease find attached voucher submitted by Mr. Indian Agent Robertson covering decorating done by Mr. Ayris to the sitting rooms and the chapel at the above school, and also to the farmer's residence.\n\nI understand that Mr. Ayris has never been paid for this work.

The paper on both the walls and ceilings of these rooms was in very bad shape and in many places was hanging loose. This was caused by the leaky roof which had been repaired by the year before.\n\nIt was an unsightly mess and Mr. Ayris having offered to do the two rooms for $50.00 we told him to go ahead and do the job, hoping that the money might be forthcoming from somewhere to pay for it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.J. Staley\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School  \nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA  \nEDMONTON  \nALBERTA  \n\nOctober 24th 1947.\n\nMr. F.A. Robertson:  \nIndian Agent,  \nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Robertson:\n\nWhen you were at the school some little time ago in connection with the estimates for 1948-49, the condition of the heaters in the pump house and milk room was drawn to your attention, with a view to authority being obtained for the purchase of two new stoves.\n\nYou will possibly also remember that one of these heaters collapsed last spring with the result that a fire was started in the floor between the pump house and the milk room above and had it not been that the engineer at the school had been able to go down there the building might very easily have gone up in smoke.\n\nYou at that time authorised us to buy a new stove, but they were hard to get and having wired up the old stove as well as we could, we were able to get through for the season, but it will be impossible for us to go through the winter with the two stoves we have.\n\nWould it be too much to ask, that you take the matter up with the Department with a view to the necessary authority being obtained for the purchase of the two new stoves so urgently required. Winter may be clamping down on us at any time and it would be well to be prepared against frost damage to our water system.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.J. Staley,  \nprincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter received from the Principal of Edmonton Indian School in connection with two new heaters required for their pump house and milk room.\n\nThe pumps are in the basement of this building and the milk rooms above them. The present heaters are completely burned out and I would recommend that two new \"Quebec\" heaters be purchased at a cost of approximately $25.00 each.\n\nE.A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to your letter of Sept. 23rd, 1947, returning voucher No. 402-47, in favor of Saskatoon Welding Co., for $1223.94.\n\nDetailed account from the Saskatoon Welding Co., and is now attached to voucher which is returned herewith. In regard to quotations from other firms, would say that these boilers were in such condition that the Inspector intended to condemn them until it was pointed out to him by one of his assistants that this action would mean closing the school as no new boilers of this kind are available at present. We could not find any other firm who would even consider looking over the job and it was only after a great deal of talking that we were able to persuade the Saskatoon Welding Co. to undertake the work. When the boilers were torn down they were found to be in even worse condition than was at first thought.\n\nIn regard to supervision of the work, I was at the shop once while they were working at the job and once when they finishing. The boiler inspectors were there four times to inspect the work being done and either Mr. Stalgay or Mr. Faunt were in the building all the time the work was being done and inspected it on numerous occasions.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 12, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nThis is a Government-owned school and I enclose for your information a copy of the report of the Assistant Chief Inspector of Boilers for the Department of Public Works in the Province of Alberta.\n\nWe authorized the Agent to proceed with the repairs and he has now forwarded an account of $1,223.94. In connection with the account, I enclose a copy of the Agent's letter dated October 30th, 1947.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. Coding is as follows: 516-753-10-091.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nAsst. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, November 12, 1947.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson, Indian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 30th ultimo returning voucher 402-47 in connection with the repairs to the boilers at the Edmonton Residential School. We are submitting the account to the Purchasing Branch.\n\nRegarding your letter of November 1st, the Department approves the purchase of two Quebec heaters at a cost of approximately $25.00 each for the pump house and milk room at the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nPlease point out to the principal that in view of the large expenditure already involved at this school during the current fiscal year, no further funds will be available.\n\nBernard F.
