I always give candy, nuts, and either popcorn or cakes. But a year ago I decided to just give the candy and other sweets at Christmas and keep the presents until the last day of the June term, as I find it more difficult to have a fairly regular attendance from sugar making until after potato planting than any other term in the year.\n\nEver since I have taught I have given a little present. Always bought them when I went to Owen Sound for my vacation. I always took the names of the pupils in the register so as to know the number of presents to buy. For the boys I generally got a picture book, a neck tie, or a pocket-handkerchief.\nfor the girls either hair ribbons, bells, or a fancy string of beads, pocket handkerchief or muslin to make an apron for each. They take better care of a fancy article than of a useful one.\n\nLast summer I bought 15 belts, when taking so many I got them for 15\u00a2 each. Got 7 books for the boys at the same price. The belts and books I still have until the end of this term. I might have given more expensive presents but did not think I could afford to.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\nyour obedient servant,\nJ. H.

I paid the Mason and sent the duplicate accounts to Mr. Hagan the day after.\n\nThe chimney had to be taken down to the peak of the roof.\n\nThe fence is not put up around the school yet. I heard Mr. Hagan the last time he was here ask the Chief why it wasn't up yet. The chief said the Indians didn't want to help to put it up without being paid for their work. They think especially since they sold butter, that the Department has so much of their money, that they should be paid for all they do for the school or grounds.\n\nI remain dear sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJessie H.

So I got $1.00 worth of candy, 50\u00a2 nuts and 50\u00a2 worth of cakes. If the Department is willing I could get a nice little present for each with the $8.00 before the June vacation.\n\n(Sgd.)

Of course went to the school house, found the desks all removed and carried into the teacher's room. The floor was disturbed and scratched by what appeared to be river boats. I found everything in a mess. Had often forbid the Indians using the school house for dancing purposes. They would say the school house was their own and they could do as they pleased with it. I summoned the notorious William Johnson and Louis Breckwood, before me to know by what authority they went into the school house and I made them promise not to do so again but the desks back as they got them scrub the floor and pay the cost of the constable in the matter, and I may say, thus they shook hands with me and thanked me heartily for being so easy with them. I have heard since that they had introduced drink there and sold it. That there were two Indians and a white man drunk. I cannot prove who brought the liquor there, so I dispense it as I have reported, there may be some of the teacher's things stolen but I cannot tell until she comes back. If I have any control or authority over the school house I will show it or we will soon have no house.\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are a number of private homes where she could Board, but it is a village, with good society, some very fine people live there it is nearly 12 miles from the school, as soon as BlueSky comes home we will see about the house, and I will report your obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Bagan\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nMEMORANDUM,\n\nScheels Branch.\n\nOn February 5th, I visited the Serpent River reserve near Cutler.\n\nThe house which the Indian Robertson desires to sell for a school is apparently in good repair, having been built about four years ago. It has a hardwood floor and the ceilings and walls are sheeted. It is set on posts. There is a small lean-to at the back suitable for storing wood. Robertson does not desire to rent the house but offers to sell for $450.00. Sufficient land would go with the school to make a reasonable sized playground. There is a wire fence around the lot.\n\nThe desks from the old school are stored in a neighboring Indian's house. There are sufficient of these for 24 pupils. There is also a bed and dresser used by the former teacher. The teacher's desk is at present in the church and in this desk are several school books and scribblers.\n\nThe Chief was absent hunting but his wife stated that there were 22 children of school age on the reserve.\n\nA teacher could secure excellent boarding accommodation in Cutler which is 1/2 mile distant.\n\nPhilip Wilson\n\nIndian Affairs.

The house is 22x16 width end to the road, 2 windows in the end and a window on each side, one story high, not plastered, just a shell, no partitions, a fairly good floor, I would not consider it worth very much, but I have not examined it closely, will go down and make a thorough examination if you order me to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSamuel Hagan\nIndian Agent\nThersalon\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, February 14th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 3lst ultimo, I beg to say that Mr. Phelan of this Department, who was at Spanish River School, last week visited the Serpent River Reserve and looked over the building that the Indian Bluesky (Robertson) desires to sell for a school.\n\nThe building is frame in good condition with hardwood floor and both walls and ceiling are sheeted. Sufficient land would go with the building to make a reasonably sized playground. Of course, in the event of the Department purchasing the building it would be advisable to have it well fumigated.\n\nBluesky asks $450 for this house.\n\nKindly advise the Department if you consider this is a fair price.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nS. Hagan, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nTheessalon,\nOnt.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 14th inst. and No. 15717-5 Re Blackboy Building I beg leave to say that I visited the house in question and examined it thoroughly and find it in good repair. It is 16 feet wide inside and 32 long with a very good woodshed on the end, when the wood would be put into the shed. The teacher could get it without going outside, or if the teacher wished to Board here he could live in it. The house would require a window put in on each side, but Mr. Berson informs me that we have the windows to spare in the old school and it would only cost the time putting them in. It would be well to paint the floor and perhaps the walls and ceiling; there are also about 3/4 of an acre of land fenced with good wire on three sides which belongs to the house.\n\nAnd now for the price he wanted $450.00 but if it suits the Department we can get it for $400.00 as I told him it would cost us quite a bit to have it fixed up, and he agreed in the presence of Mr. Berson to take $400.00 for it, and I think it is a very cheap building. It is very much worth the money he is moving out of it this week and we could be ready to start the school the first of April next.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6162, file 427-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI also have a letter from Rev. J.A. Desautels, principal of Spanish Industrial School. He has an idea of a teacher for cattle, as he has informed the Department and is in communication with another that he thinks would suit. I have not been to Sagamore lately but I think the school is ready for use. I would strongly advise the purchase of Blush's house at four hundred dollars as it is certainly very reasonable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSamuel Shagan\nIndian Agent\nSheraton\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Agent Hagan reported that the Serpent River school house was burned to the ground on the 5th of November last, but the school furniture and contents of the building were saved.\n\nMr. Hagan was informed that the Department would be prepared to continue the school, if a suitable building could be secured. He wrote the Department that there was a house about one hundred yards from the old school that would answer the purpose very well and that he had been waiting for the return of the owner to see if he could secure the building, which he is the only suitable one in the place.\n\nAs Mr. Phelan was going to Spanish with twelve children from here and Caughnawaga, I asked him to go on to Outler and try and see the owner of the house and report on the condition of the building and the terms on which it could be had. His report is hereunder.\n\nFather Desautels, who was here this week, told me he knew the building well and considered it should be obtained, as there are fully 25 children of school age living at Outler who could attend, and that the building is well worth the price asked for it, $450.00.\n\nGood boarding accommodation can be had less than half a mile for the Indian village and a teacher to replace Miss Gallagher, who resigned, can be had at once.\n\nMr. Kent Hagan recommends the purchase of this building and says it can be bought for $400.00. See letter under.\nOttawa, March 3, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 19th ultimo I beg to say that the Department has decided to purchase the house and lot belonging to the Indian named Bluesky on the Serpent River Reserve, which you recommend as suitable for school purposes for the sum of $400.00, the price named by you. I am now sending you a form of Indenture, in duplicate, which you will be good enough to have executed by Bluesky and returned to the Department, when a cheque for the purchase money will be sent you for Bluesky. Under Section 169 of the Indian Act you are empowered to take Bluesky's declaration as to ownership.\n\nYou will please see that Bluesky's full name is inserted in each document and that the description of the property is given with reasonable certainty, the length and breadth of the lot should be given in feet and inches, and you should state in the description in the body of the document that it covers the property as now fenced. The date of execution should be filled in and the blanks in the declaration to be made by Bluesky filled in.\n\nWhen returning the documents you should give an estimate of the probable cost of getting the building fitted up for occupation at an early date. The Department has a teacher in view who will be available as soon as the necessary repairs are made; these should include the placing of the desks in position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Hagan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMarch 12th, 1919\n\nIn answer to your letter of March 3rd, and numbered 151717/18 re purchase from Bleasby at Kona Butte.\n\nI went down the line yesterday and found that the Indian Bleasby was away on the spring hunt, and is not expected for some days. I met the constable Mr. Benson there and he measured the ground, that fenced around the house we are buying, and he considers it should be painted and two windows put in one on each side and it should have a chimney of brick or cement blocks. One hundred dollars, at most, should do all the improvements needed. I do not think we can get a carpenter or mason for less than $5.00 per day, as soon as Bleasby comes home I will have the papers signed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Hagan\nIndian Agent\nThereson\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, March 17, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant in reference to the purchase of the house on the Serpent River Reserve belonging to the Indian named Bluesky.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to make any repairs or alterations to this building until the Indenture which was sent you has been executed by Bluesky and you will be good enough to see that this is done as soon as he returns to the reserve.\n\nIn the meantime, the Department would like you to furnish a detailed estimate of the cost of painting the building and making the necessary alterations. I am enclosing a sketch which shows approximately where the two additional windows and the chimney should be placed. It is considered better to place these two windows on the east side of the room, instead of one on each side, as this will give the children better light. The windows should be a good size.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\nAsst.

The party who built the closets mistook my order. We had talked the matter over and the contractor was going on with the work as soon as he had time. Then I got a letter to report further before before we build the closets which I reported to them and they mistook me and thought I wanted the closets put up right away. So they went right at them and the first thing I knew they had them built. I may say they are very well done. There is no exception. They put in a drawer which is never cleaned. I am sorry they blundered but we have the closets all right and hope it will pass.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSamuel Heyan\nIndian Agent\nThersalon\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nExtract from Report of Inspector Bennett on the Serpent River Indian Day School. November 17, 1919. Original on 15/17/17.\n\nSCHOOL FURNITURE.\n\nThe damper in the stove pipe is broken. It means a school full of smoke and poor fires. The cold weather is almost here and this needs absolute attention.\n\nTeacher.\n\nThis teacher pays $30.00 per month and new management is taking over the only boarding house there is and it will mean $32 or $36 per month. At present no hot water can be obtained by boarders unless they go across the road for it. The mill has closed and the best of the population has departed. The previous teachers had a room of their own in the school. It was burnt. The boarding and rooming facilities are poor. Do what you can.\n\nBUILDINGS, etc.\n\nAt present this temporary building needs to be banked for the winter. It needs painting. The wood-shed leaks bad. One of the closet doors is off.\n\nSgd. J. M. Bennett,\nInspec. Separate Schools,\nOttawa, November 27, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nInspector Bennett, who has recently visited the Serpent River Indian Day School, states that the damper in the stove pipe is broken and that a new piece of pipe with a damper is needed at once.\n\nYou will be good enough to secure this and have it placed in Serpent River School immediately.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the school needs to be banked for the winter, that the wood shed leaks and that one of the closet doors is off. You will be good enough to have these repairs attended to also.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nSamuel Hagan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should forward proper vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSamuel Hogan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\n\nYour Asst.

I also agreed to pay William Nahmawon No. 16 of the Band to Bank the school and he agreed that he would do so. I am not aware of any leakage in the roof of the barns that we use for a workshop but I will have fixed. The closet door must have come off recently as it was all right when I was there. May day it is very hard to get anyone to do work when he can get any person who has to pay an agent wages, every worker in this country gets wages but Indian Agent. Will try and everything required done as soon as I can get any to do it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Hagan\nIndian Agent\nThessalon Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The windows need cleaning and the floor is in urgent need of scrubbing. He also states the \"lean to\" and school building need shingling.\n\nI have therefore to request that you will be good enough to have the stove pipes cleaned and polished. You should also purchase a wash basin, two drinking cups and a looking glass. You will also be good enough to have the windows in the building cleaned and the floor scrubbed. As soon as the cleansing above mentioned is completed and purchase of the articles required made, you should forward properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYou should furnish a report as to the shingling required, and state whether, in your opinion, it is absolutely necessary that this work should be done this coming summer.

A well, with a pump, should at once be placed in the school yard or adjoining yard.\n\n2. The school yard should be cleaned of manure and rubbish.\n\n3. There are three buildings at north side of yard, in adjoining lot. They are old half broken down and seem to be of no service, and they are filled with old manure and rubbish, hides, old clothes and bones. These are sources of danger to the health of the school children. They should be torn down at once, the best part of the lumber removed and the debris completely destroyed by fire.\n\n4. There are three closets close to the school fence, in adjoining yards, that are not clean or in a sanitary condition. They should be removed to some distance from the school yard and the pits properly filled up.\n\n5. The door on one of the school closets requires attention so that it will close properly.\n\n6. There are twenty-eight pupils and only eleven double seats and two chairs. More seats are required.\nJOHN J.

He also states that the school yard should be cleaned of manure and rubbish, and that there are three closets close to the school fence, in adjoining yards, in a very unsanitary condition, which should be removed to some distance from the school and the pits properly filled up.\n\nI would be pleased if you would endeavour to arrange with the owners of the three old buildings and the closets to have them removed, and you should have the school yard cleaned of all manure and rubbish.\n\nThe door on one of the school closets should be repaired, as it will not close properly, at as early a date as possible.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you regarding the well, and what arrangements you have been able to make regarding the removal of the buildings and the closets referred to by the doctor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Public school which has 3 rooms, 14 x 24 feet can be bought for $500. There will be enough lumber in it to build a school, or residence attached for teacher.\n\nSaw the man who built the school also saw our lumber. He tells me there was about 40 thousand feet of lumber in the building. He said he could get lumber at a reasonable price. We could have these buildings pulled down to make room for new residences built at a reasonable price. There would be enough lumber. Besides the school at Spanish Reserve, there is also all the windows, doors etc., for the buildings.\n\nIf the Department sees fit to build the school, as requested some time ago, it should be a good thing, as the building is only about 7 years old. The lumber is fine.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I beg to say that our funds this present fiscal year are limited. Could you arrange with the Spanish River Lumber Co. to obtain the public school building, payment for same could be made next April, when our funds for the next fiscal year are available. If so, arrangements could be made early next spring to have this building taken down and the lumber used in the erection of the schools above mentioned. It is thought that the present arrangements for carrying on the work at both these schools could be continued until the new buildings can be erected.\n\nRelative to the repairs required at the Serpent River School, I would refer you to our letter of the 13th instant. You may arrange to have the minor repairs absolutely necessary carried out. Only the work necessary to make this building comfortable during the coming winter should be performed at the present time.\n\nPlease take up with the Spanish River Lumber Co. the matter of obtaining the public school building, payment for same to be deferred until next April and advise the Department whether or not they will comply with this arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

The lighting system is not what the Department of Education call for as the light should all be on the left side of the school. The outside privies were in very poor condition and dirty. It will be necessary to have two new toilets built. I found that the open pail and common drinking cup were in use. I would recommend a covered water tank with tap at bottom be provided and sanitary drinking cups be secured.\n\nIn conversation with the school teacher I was told that your Department intended to build a new school. Would you kindly let me know regarding this.\n\nI also visited the Mississaugi Indian Separate School on June 25th and found that the only ventilation in this school was from the windows raising from the bottom. I also found the open pail and common drinking cup. The windows in the outside privies were broken and it will be necessary to have these replaced with either glass or screening.\n\nThe school will have to be properly ventilated with cold air inlets and window baffles which will deflect the draft over the heads of the children.\n\nI will be making a return visit to this school immediately after the holidays and I hope that the necessary improvements will have been made by that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.B.

However, you should arrange, during the present summer holidays, to have the toilets thoroughly cleaned and placed in a good condition. Any repairs required should also be carried out. You may arrange for the purchase of a covered water tank with tap at bottom. It is considered that a tank of from four to six gallons capacity would be satisfactory. You may also purchase the number of enamelled drinking cups necessary for the individual use of the pupils.\n\nRelative to the Mississauga Indian Day School, you may also arrange for the purchase of a covered water tank with tap at bottom for this school and the number of individual enamelled drinking cups required for the pupils' use. You should arrange to have the necessary repairs made to the windows in the closets and to have the toilets themselves thoroughly cleaned and placed in a good, sanitary condition.\n\nPlease have the water tanks and cups delivered when the schools reopen and the repairs and cleaning of the toilets carried out before the schools reopen.

A school not as large as the one at Sagamok but large enough to accommodate at least 30 pupils, with the teachers residence part of the building. If a new school cannot be built a lot of repairs will be needed before the autumn term commences.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAgent.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant no provision was made in our current year's appropriation for the erection of a new school on the Serpent River Reserve at Cutler, Ontario. Mr. Christianson, Superintendent of Indian Agencies, and Inspector McGookin expect to visit your Agency this week and I have requested them to discuss with you the school situation on the Serpent River Reserve and they will report on their return to the Department. If it is decided that it would be advisable to erect a new school on this Reserve provision for same can likely be made in our appropriation for the next fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nC.

The late Mr. Ferrier on passing through looked it over but nothing was done. There are no sawmills near and lumber would have to be brought in for building purposes, but it would be advisable to have these Indians removed to a place where employment would be steady.\n\nC. F.

Joseph Barker, S.J., in connection with the proposed new school on the Indian Reserve at Cutler, Ont., have been given careful consideration.\n\nNo provision has been made in the 1939-40 estimates for the erection of a new school at this point during the coming year. The officials of the Indian Affairs Branch are not convinced that a new school should be established on this Reserve the resources of which seem to be wholly inadequate to meet the needs of the Indian population. Inspector McCookin in a recent report states:\n\n\"There are thirty-seven families resident on this Reserve which contains 26,700 acres. These Indians are in very poor circumstances through no fault of their own. The Reserve is little more than a rock pile.

In their present surroundings they cannot make a living.\"\n\nWe are communicating with the Indian Agent in an attempt to discover if a better building for school purposes can be secured by the Department.

Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nPP\nOttawa,\nMarch 20, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of March 2 with reference to the letter received from Mr. Thomas Farquhar, M. P., regarding the Serpent River Indian day school on the Indian Reserve at Cutler, Ont.\n\nWhile this Branch recognizes that a new school is required at this point we have hesitated to recommend its erection due to the reports received from our Inspector. I quote from Mr. McCookin's report dated July 7, 1938:\n\n\"Ojibbeways of Lake Huron; population, 147. There are thirty-seven families resident on the Reserve which contains 26,700 acres. These Indians are in very poor circumstances through no fault of their own. The Reserve is little more than a rock pile. It would be impossible for the most diligent and experienced white farmers to make a living on this land. We can never hope to make farmers of these Indians. They have a few acres - 15 or 20 - under cultivation, mostly gardens. They have six horses and two cows, the total stock on the Reserve.\n\n\"A few years ago there were twelve lumber mills operating in this section. The lumber business gave the Indians steady work the year round. Today only one mill in Blind River is operating. There is no work of any description for these Indians. They sell a little pulpwood when it is in demand and go berry picking in season. Every family is receiving relief.\"\n\"The future of these Indians is a problem which will have to be faced sooner or later. In their present surroundings they cannot make a living.\n\n\"Until it is definitely decided what is to be the ultimate future of this Band, I would hesitate recommending the building of a new school or a programme of house building in the meantime.\"\n\nAt the present time the school is being conducted in a rented building and I am writing to the Indian Agent with a view to ascertaining if some better building could be secured. Under the circumstances I feel that this is all that we can do at the present time.\n\nI enclose draft reply which might be sent to Mr. Farquhar.\n\nThe correspondence which you forwarded is returned.\n\nDirector.\n\nFeb 21/35\nOttawa,\nMarch 22, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe day school on the Serpent River Reserve near Cutler is in bad condition but officials of this Branch are not convinced that a new school should be established on this Reserve owing to the fact that there appears to be no adequate resources for the Indians on the Reserve on which they are located.\n\nOn the first occasion on which you visit this Reserve you should make careful inquiries with a view to ascertaining if there is any other more suitable building that could be rented for school purposes. If not you should let me know the approximate amount that would be necessary to put the present building in reasonably good condition. The funds at our disposal are limited but we would be prepared to provide some funds in order to make the building as habitable as possible under the circumstances.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR.P.G. Lawrence, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n762 Queen Street,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSpanish, Ontario,\nFeb. 17th /39\n\nMrs. Thomas Farquhar, M.P.,\nMindemoya, Ontario.\n\nDear Mrs. Farquhar:\n\nSome months ago I called upon you in your home to speak to you of our dire need of a new school on the Indian Reserve at Cutler, Ontario, and I promised to gather the necessary information for you to work upon in your insistent demand before the Department. I am enclosing a map of the Reserve, two copies of the resolution passed in a special council of the Indians at Cutler, and signed by the Chief and his Councillor, a few pictures of the present disgraceful and unhealthy school and a list of the children of school-age and those who will in a few short years have to walk the bloody paths of education.\n\nThe present school is certainly a disgrace and is so uninhabitable that there are scarcely ever half of the children on the school register, present at one time. A glimpse at the pictures of the school and especially a few hours spent inside it during any winter day would be a satisfactory explanation to any reasonable person of the ever poorer and poorer attendance.\n\nWe trust, Mrs. Farquhar, that as the champion of our truly worthy cause, you will bend every effort to the task of procuring a new school for us before the beginning of the new school term in September 1939.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n(sgd) Joseph Barker, S.J.,\nIndian Missionary\nOttawa,\nMarch 20, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Farquhar:\n\nThe letters received by you from the Rev. Joseph Barker, S.J., in connection with the proposed new school on the Indian Reserve at Cutler, Ont., have been given careful consideration.\n\nNo provision has been made in the 1938-40 estimates for the erection of a new school at this point during the coming year.

P. G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRPGL/R\nSault Ste. Marie,\nMay 6th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 36-2-5 of March 2nd, I beg to state that I have visited the Serpent River School and was unable to find any other suitable place to rent.\n\nIn my opinion, if school is going to be held at Gutler at all, a new one is what is really needed. As far as trying to make any repairs to the present one, it is just throwing away money.\n\nBut if, as you say, the present one has to be used, storm windows are needed, tar paper to fix the roof and the teacher's quarters need repairing inside. I would estimate that $150.00 would be sufficient to make any temporary repairs needed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRGCL/R\nOttawa,\nMay 9, 1939.\n\nEX'D\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant in which you state that a new school is required to replace the present Serpent River school. As no funds were provided for this purpose in the current year's appropriation it is impossible to provide a new building at the present time.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter it is noted that you estimate the cost of repairs to the present building at $150.00. I presume that this covers both material and labour.\n\nIf the cost of the material exceeds $50.00 you will have to forward full particulars regarding what is required in order that purchase may be made by the Purchasing Agent. You should also let me know if it is your intention to employ Indians to do the work. If not, please state the tradesmen required and the approximate length of time their services will be necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR.P.G.

Father Barker visited the Department this week and brought up the question of school accommodation at the Serpent River school.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of May 9 no funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a new building this year. The Department has, however, made a special note of the necessity for improving the school accommodation at this point and very careful consideration will be given to the matter when we are preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nHowever, it should be possible to make some improvements to the building so that it will be reasonably habitable for the coming academic year. In official letter of May 9 you were authorized to expend an amount of $150.00 for material and labour. As no accounts have been received it is presumed that you have not yet taken any action in the matter. I should, therefore, appreciate it if you would make immediate arrangements to make the necessary repairs to the Serpent River school on the understanding, of course, that their cost will not exceed the amount mentioned in official letter of May 9.\n\nThe building should be well banked and this will have a tendency to make it warmer for the winter.\n\nR.P.G. Laurence, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nIf the cost of the material required exceeds $50.00 you will have to forward full particulars regarding what is necessary in order that purchase may be made by the Purchasing Agent. Only Indian labour should be employed to do the work.\n\nI will expect to hear from you in the near future that this matter is receiving your attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.,\nJuly 31st, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter July 29th, 96-2-5, I beg to state that I expect to go down to the Serpent River Reserve this week and I will then look into the matter of repairs for the Serpent River School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

New tar paper is being put on where necessary. The outside toilets are being put in satisfactory condition. I think that when these repairs are completed, the school will do for this winter, although it is in very poor shape.\n\nThe teacher wanted her residence re-decorated, but I think myself, that it would only be a waste of money to do so this year as the building she is occupying is not worth it. I would strongly recommend, if it is at all possible, that a new school and teacher's residence be built next year, as the present ones are in such poor condition.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. P. G.

However, due to the improbability of any improvement in the economic status of these Indians and also due to the conditions confronting us at the present time the Department hesitates to make any heavy expenditure for erecting a new school.\n\nFrom your letter I understand that the repairs that you have recently made will put the building in a reasonably habitable condition for the coming winter. I am anxious to know if there is any possibility of renting any other building. In speaking to Inspector McGookin he suggested the possibility of securing a building formerly used either as a Church or a hall by the Anglican Church. Would it be possible to rent this building and, if so, do you consider it would be an improvement on the building at present used?\n\nI should appreciate receiving, as soon as possible, your comments regarding the whole situation on this Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.F.G.

Marie, Ont.,\nNovember 17th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 36-2-5 of September 28th, I beg to state that I have looked over the Anglican church at Cutler which Inspector McGookin suggested might be rented as a school. My opinion is that it would not be suitable for the purpose.\n\nThis church is built on a rocky knoll with no room for a playground. On two sides of the building, the rock slopes off very abruptly which would be dangerous for small children. It is also in a very exposed position and I am inclined to believe that large drifts of snow would form around it during the winter.\n\nTo put this building in shape for use as a school, it would take a considerable sum. The roof would have to be reshingled, a wood shed and toilets built, the plaster repaired inside, a new chimney and some windows built. Also, a board walk would have to be built for about fifty feet and steps up to the walk. The owners would doubtless make these necessary repairs if they were assured of a long lease. Even if these repairs were made you would still not have a very satisfactory condition as the school would not be on Indian land and the rent would have to be such as would take care of these necessary repairs.\n\nMy opinion is that it would be just as well to put up with the present school until such time as the Department feels justified in building a new one.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nREGL/R\nSault Ste.

Marie, Ont.\nJune 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Indian Day School on the Serpent River Reserve near Cutler is in bad condition, as you doubtless know. Last year the sum of $150.00 was spent on it fixing the foundation and repairing the leaks in the roof to put it in shape for the winter.\n\nThe roof in the teacher's quarters this year needs repairing and the school needs a porch and painting, both inside and outside. The only way of entrance at present is through a lean-to at the back, which is also the woodshed.\n\nI estimate that it would take about $250.00 to make these necessary improvements. By painting the place and adding a porch it would improve the appearance of this school 100% and help to make this school last for a few more years. With the exception of repairing the roof of the teacher's quarters, the rest of this work is not absolutely necessary, but would greatly improve matters if it could be done.\n\nIf, due to the serious nature of the times, it is considered inadvisable to make these improvements, at least the repairs to the roof of the teacher's quarters should be made, for which the cost of material and labour would be approximately $40.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.P.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nJune 21, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant regarding the Serpent River Day School I realize that this building is not in good condition but you will appreciate that due to present conditions it is impossible for the Department to consider expending the amount that would be necessary to properly repair it.\n\nYou may, however, expend an amount not exceeding $40.00 in making the necessary repairs to the roof of the teacher's living quarters. It is noted that this amount covers the cost of both material and labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

Marie, Ont.\nOctober 15, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOnly nine of the fifteen desks in the Serpent River Reserve Indian Day School are fit for use. The present enrolment is twenty-eight, twice as many attending the school as previously. The shortage of desks is very noticeable. The children are too crowded and many of the desks too small for a number of the children.\n\nTo remedy this situation, six double or twelve single desks for Grades 5, 6 and 7 are required.\n\nIf the purchase of desks is approved, it may be possible to secure a number of second-hand ones at a reasonable cost from the Public School at Sprague, as I understand the attendance at that school has been reduced considerably and they have some school desks for sale.\n\nWill you kindly advise if these desks can be supplied?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.P.G. Laurence\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nOctober 20, 1941.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant in which you advise that there are some second-hand desks available at Spragge which could be used at the Serpent River School. Provided you can secure the number of desks necessary for an amount under $50.00, you may arrange immediately for their purchase and delivery. In the event of the Spragge School Board requiring more than the amount mentioned above you should again communicate with this Branch before purchasing the desks.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Phair, M.B., D.P.H.)\nChief Medical Officer of Health\n\nJTP:MI\nThe Dept. of Health,\nToronto\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI had the closest source of water tested recently and the water was \"D\". I sent word of this down to the Department of Indian affairs along with some other remarks on attendance and am told I had better look for another job. Can you tell me who looks after the prevention of communicable diseases on a Reserve? We've had chicken pox, skin diseases and all sorts of things. To cap the climax just after that terrible storm when our waterholes were so far under that we had to melt snow a mother came in a great dither because her child said I was making nasty remarks about people. I thought the youngster just worn out with the struggle for existence but today testing her hearing I find her totally deaf in one ear. These remarks caused her father the Chief to complain. He is not particularly interested in a pure source of water though takes excellent precautions against any unsterilized draught but I still have the interest of the children at heart. Exposure of this class to typhoid might infect a big military camp if any of the visiting men-at-arms might commit the indiscretion of drinking water. I assure you they would do so only if suffering great pangs of thirst as they are all carefully instructed to take good care of themselves.\n\nBetter stuff is plentiful.\nIt it is twentieth century wisdom to confine my teaching of these children to assuring them that their Angel Guardian watches over them from above I hope the Department of Health give me that statement in writing. I thought they ought to have a supply of good drinking water. If you cannot take any step in the matter would you do me the favour of sending this letter on to the Medical Branch of the Indian Affairs in Ottawa? We are close to white towns, these people travel and our Doctor is a very much overworked man. A person set at leisure like myself is the only one who can kick about things. We need only to see the Gestapo drive up take these children off to be gassed in the interest of sanitation and the troops can lay down their arms. Germany is winning as long as we can not even ask for clean drinking water.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMrs. Florene Prud'homme\n\nTeacher at the Indian Day School,\n\nCutler, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nMay 2, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo enclosing copy of a communication you recently received from the teacher of the Indian day school at Cutler, Ont. We do not appear to have received direct from the teacher the communication to which she referred in this letter. I am, therefore, writing to the Indian Agent requesting him to investigate conditions and submit a report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ.T. Phair, Esq., M.B., D.P.H.,\nChief Medical Officer of Health,\nDepartment of Health,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMay 2, 1948.\n\nEX'D A\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which the teacher of the Serpent River Indian Day School recently forwarded to the Department of Health at Toronto. We do not appear to have received the communication to which the teacher refers. Certainly we did not suggest to her that she give up duties because of any complaints she might have made regarding conditions. Our reason for writing to her recently suggesting that we could not retain her services for the coming academic year was due to the report we had received to the effect that the Indians were not satisfied with her services and, as a consequence, were not sending their children to school.\n\nI should appreciate your investigating her complaints at the earliest possible date and submitting a complete report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 2nd, 36-2-5, enclosing copy of a letter which the teacher of the Serpent River Reserve Indian Day School forwarded to the Department of Health at Toronto.\n\nI have investigated her complaints about the closest source of water and had this water tested by the Department of Health, Sault Ste. Marie, and they report that this water is now \"A\". The previous bad report on this water was very likely due to the surface water running into the creek this Spring.\n\nThe water that has always been used for drinking at this school is not the creek close to the school but one about 300 yards East of the school at the old school house. I had this water tested as well and it was found to be \"A\" also.\n\nI asked Mrs. Prudhomme what her complaints were about the water and the only complaints she had were that the children drank the water out of the creek she had received a bad report on, after she had told them not to. During the severe storm this winter she used this water for one day only for drinking but only after she had boiled it.\n\nThe Chief stated that he had heard no complaints about the water and knew nothing of the matter.\n\nWith regard to that part of her letter which reads as follows:\n\n\"Can you tell me who looks after the prevention of communicable diseases on a Reserve? We've had chicken pox, skin diseases, and all sorts of things\".\nDr. Hamill states that he had one case of chickenpox and did not hear of any more although he has been in the school on various occasions. He also states that he was not aware of any great outbreak of skin disease, or all sorts of things, whatever that may mean. Some of the children may have had impetigo, which had been prevalent in this section last winter, even in the town schools. The doctor knew of some cases on the Mississauga Reserve but not on the Serpent River Reserve. If Mrs. Prudhomme knew of any such cases she failed to report same to the doctor when he visited the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.P.G. Laurence\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nMay 25, 1943.\n\nEX'D A.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 27th ultimo and my reply of the 2nd instant, with reference to the communication which you received from the teacher of the Indian school at Cutler, Ont. A copy of the teacher's letter was forwarded to the Indian Agent and I enclose, for your information, a copy of his report. It is evident from our Agent's report that the teacher was slightly exaggerating the matters about which she was complaining.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ.T.

T. Phair, M.B., D.P.H.)\nChief Medical Officer of Health.\n\nJTP:LN.\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you doubtless know from previous correspondence, the Indian Day School on the Serpent River Reserve at Cutler is in a very poor condition and presents an unsightly appearance.\n\nLast year, a lean-to of two rooms was attached to the rear of the school for the teacher's quarters. This addition was not painted and it should be painted now along with the rest of the school. The windows in the school room are of different sizes and are ready to fall out of the casings. New casings should be made for them all. The outside siding has sprung in many places and new siding should be put in to replace the rotten boards.\n\nIf these, and a few other minor repairs were made and the school painted, it would improve the school's appearance 100% and help to make the building last until such time as the Department feel they are in a position to build a new school.\n\nIn last year's estimates, I requested $200.00 for improvements to this school.\n\nKindly advise me if you think it possible to make any of these necessary improvements this summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.P.G. Laurence\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, funds are available for an expenditure not exceeding $200.00 on repairs and improvements at the Serpent River Day School. Please forward a requisition for the materials required in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYou should also let me know the approximate cost of the labour and the name of the man whom you wish to employ. I will then be in a position to advise you if he is acceptable.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

C. Indian Day School requesting, among other things, 33 single school desks for the school room and a pump and sink for the school house.\n\nThe school desks are badly needed as the double desks in use at present are, as Mrs. Ellis states, falling apart. They are also too small for the children and crowd them together, which is very uncomfortable for them.\n\nIf at all possible, these single desks should be supplied, as it is hard for the teacher to get the best out of the children if they are not comfortably seated.\n\nThe attendance at this school has been the best this year that I have seen.\n\nThe pump and sink requested are also necessary, as water has to be carried a long way for this school. Previously, the teacher did not live in the school, so a pump was not necessary, but now that the teacher resides at the school, one is required. The approximate cost for material and labour to instal pump, sink, and make cesspool would be $50.00.\n\nRPGI/MY\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 13, 1943.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing requisition for supplies for the Serpent River School.\n\nRegarding the school desks, it is not possible to secure these at the present time, due to the fact that the end of the fiscal year occurs on March 31. School desks are very difficult to obtain due to the shortage of certain articles which are used in their manufacture. We will, however, give the matter further consideration later in the year and endeavour to secure new desks for this school for the academic year 1943-44.\n\nYou may have the pump and sink installed at a total cost of $50.00, which includes both material and labour. Purchase of the following articles is approved:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Description          |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------------------|\n| Board ft. lumber      | 30       | 10' x 12\" x 1/2\"     |\n|                       | 50       | 10' x 12\" x 1/2\"     |\n| Hand saws             | 2        |                      |\n| Coping saws           | 2        |                      |\n| Hammer                | 1        |                      |\n| Draw knife            | 1        |                      |\n| Paint brushes         | 5        | 1\"                   |\n| Pkg. needles          | 1        |                      |\n\nWith reference to the request for gelatine for the duplicator, we usually purchase this through the Purchasing Branch but we have lately been informed that there will not be any more available for the duration of the war.

He further states that all these desks are in good condition. In addition to the cost of the desks there would be an expenditure of approximately $10.00 for transportation.

Under the heading \"Structures and Parts - New Construction\" there was included a request for certain day schools at a total estimated cost of $590,000.00.\n\nOn his return to the office this week from an inspection trip, Mr. Arnell brought to my attention the situation at Serpent River Reserve, located near Cutler, Ont. - Electoral District of Algoma East.\n\nSeveral years ago the school was destroyed by fire and since that time we have been using a former Indian house as a school. This building has now reached a stage where it is practically impossible to repair it. There are approximately 35 children of school age and Mr. Arnell strongly recommends that provision be made in the Appropriation for the fiscal year 1946-47 for a combined school and teacher's residence on this reserve.\n\nThis would involve an additional amount of $8,000.00.

There are 35 children on the school roll.\n\nThe size of the school room is 32 feet long by 15 feet wide and 8 feet high. This is a very unhealthy and unsatisfactory condition. The pupils are crowded too closely together to be able to work in comfort. In the cold weather when the stove is going the children near the stove are too warm and this tends to give them colds.\n\nThe matter of a new school for this Reserve has been under consideration for years.

If my suggestion is feasible, it is the only manner in which we can provide increased accommodation on this reserve before 1947, or it might even be later.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| DATE     | ARTICLES                        | FOLIO | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | TOTAL |\n|----------|---------------------------------|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|\n| 1945 Sept. 18 | To 4\u00bd yds Table Oil Cloth       |       |               |              |       |\n|          | 1 pkg Tacks                     |       |               |              |       |\n|          | 1 qt. white paint               |       |               |              |       |\n|          | 1 qt. tan paint                 |       |               |              |       |\n|          | 1 large door bolt               |       |               |              |       |\n|          | 1 hasp                          |       |               |              |       |\n|          | 1 screen door                   |       |               |              |       |\n|          | 3 rolls tissue                  |       |               |              |       |\n|          | 1 Stick Fast                    |       |               |              |       |\n| Nov. 26  | 8 Rolls Toilet Tissue           |       |               |              |       |\n|          | 1 Dust Pan                      |       |               |              |       |\n\nTotal: $10.15\n\nIndian Affairs.

A location on the site was found to be suitable and measurements of the area were taken. The accompanying Plan, Index No. 835, Sheet 1, indicates the extent of the site chosen. An alternative site, seven-tenths of a mile closer to Cutler was inspected, and while the soil conditions and drainage were suitable, the location would not be as convenient for 29 of the 34 pupils registered as that decided upon.\n\nOur Engineer then proceeded to the Mississauga River Reserve, where investigation of that site proved same to be acceptable in all respects. Measurements were taken and are shown on Plan, Index No. 836, Sheet 1. Photographs of both sites are attached.\n\nOur Engineer reports that potable water from wells should be easily available and drainage from the proposed schools ought to cause no difficulty.\n\nOur officer returned to Ottawa the morning of April 23rd.\n\n(Sgd.)

She has allowed the room to\nbecome rather untidy and her personal appearance leaves\nmuch to be desired. Discipline seems easy and the children\nspeak out well. They are well behaved on the whole.\n\nThis teacher spends too much time in\ncorrection and I told her that she should let the children\nwork by themselves more and thus develop responsibility on\ntheir part.\n\nThere are three girls in Entrance, only one\nof whom is ready for the examinations. The attendance of the\nother two has been poor.\n\nThe teacher's quarters are inadequate.\nIn Arithmetic these children tested fairly well. In Spelling they rated very highly. The enrolment is as follows:\n\n| Grade | Enrolment |\n|-------|-----------|\n| 1     | 13        |\n| 2     | 4         |\n| 3     | 4         |\n| 4     | 3         |\n| 5     | 4         |\n| 6     | 5         |\n| 8     | 3         |\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1. A definite priority should be given to the construction of a new school at Serpent River during 1948-49.\n\n2. Miss Robicheau was advised to begin work on a Second Class Certificate. She is a good teacher but needs brushing up and also to improve her personal appearance.\n\n3. If Miss Robicheau does not improve, then she should be moved to a primary room or a two-room school. I do not consider that she is capable of teaching the higher grade pupils unless she gets a better certificate.\n\n---\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBPE/HH.\nOttawa, March 13, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nSerpent River Indian Day School.\n\nOne of the most urgent of our building requirements for day schools in 1948-49 is the erection of a one-room school on the Serpent River Indian Reserve, near Massey, Ontario. At the present time classes are being conducted in a dilapidated old store which is very badly overcrowded. There are some 36 children crowded into a very narrow space and conditions are most unsanitary. The teacher's quarters are minute in size and most inadequate in every other respect.\n\nOur Superintendent of Education recently inspected this school and reports that we are fortunate to have a teacher who will put up with these conditions.\n\nLast year we included a sum for the construction of a new school in our estimates but were unable to interest a contractor in this work. Mr. Indian Agent Laurence was successful in getting a contractor interested in a school at Mississauga, near Blind River but could not interest a contractor for Serpent River.\n\nTherefore, it would be appreciated if we could be advised of any good carpenter who would undertake the construction of this school on a day labour or labour contract basis. We would provide the necessary materials through the Departmental Purchasing Agent as we have a complete list of all materials required for the construction of this standard school building. We have found that this system of erecting schools has worked very well elsewhere and are quite willing to erect the Serpent River School on the same basis.\n\nDirector.\n| Item | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| 1    | Miss Robichon |\n| 2    |             |\n| 3    | Case Heinz |\n| 4    | Veg Soup 600 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

I saw him again recently and he stated that he would be able to let me know for certain some time next week.\n\nIn the meantime, on one of my trips to the Serpent River Reserve, I talked to a Mr. J. Arthur Bernier who is at present building a small Hotel at Spanish, Ontario, five miles from the Serpent River Reserve, and he stated that he could build the school if he could start right away as he had other work to go to as soon as he finished the Hotel, which, he stated would be about the first of August. On my return to Sault Ste. Marie, I sent him a copy of the Plans and Specifications for this school. I am enclosing herewith, for your consideration, letter received from him in connection with same.\n\nYou will note that his estimated cost of building this school is much higher than the cost of constructing the Mississauga School.\n\nKindly advise me regarding this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nRPGI/MY\n\nR.

My charges would be\n$2100.00 this is fine and a reply\nby wire would be appreciated.\n\nYours Truly,\nJ.A. Bernier\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Indian Day School with Teacher's Quarters, Serpent River Reserve, Sault Ste Marie Indian Agency, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to your notation of July 21st on Mr. Hoey's memorandum dated July 19th last, with which were forwarded tenders from Geo.V. Hannah of Sault Ste Marie, and J.A. Bernier of Spanish, Ontario, with relevant correspondence from Superintendent Lawrence, you are advised as follows:\n\n(a) The tender of Geo.V. Hannah, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nMr. Hannah under date of July 9th, submitted an estimate of $18,500.00 and indicated he would accept a fixed fee of $1,290.00. This fixed fee is approximately 6%. For this fixed fee, Mr. Hannah would supply all labour and material.\n\nSuperintendent Lawrence took further action in obtaining a second quotation by telephone from this contractor, which was for supplying labour only at a lump sum for labour, and a fixed fee for his own services, or $1,000.00. Under this arrangement, materials would be government issue, supplied and accounted for, by the Department.\n\nComment:\n\nThere is no justification for the expenditure of the amount of $18,500.00 for labour and materials on the one-roomed school with teacher's quarters. The rate of his fixed fee is reasonable.\n\nProvided Mr. Hannah is equipped as a contractor, and could submit an estimate of the cost of labour for approval, it would be satisfactory to enter into an agreement with him at a fixed fee of $1,000.00, which works out at about $12.00 per day for a three months job.\n\n(b) The tender of J.Arthur Bernier, Spanish, Ontario.\n\nMr. Bernier submitted a tender under date of June 29th for a lump sum of $19,000.00. He states that this price is based on cost plus 15% including payment for carpenters and other tradesmen at current rates.\n\nUnder date of July 13th, Mr. Bernier submitted an alternative tender, wherein he estimates the cost of the building at $19,000.00, and for construction he would accept a fixed fee of $2,100.00.\n\nG.E.B. Sinclair, Esq.,\nActing Director,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nComment:\n\nThe estimated cost is excessive, and the rate of Mr. Bernier's fixed fee is high, being slightly above 11% of the estimated cost. It is not considered to be in the interest of the Department, to take any further action with Mr. Bernier.\n\nOnly Mr. Hoey's covering letter bearing your notation has been detached for our records, the other correspondence being attached hereto, for return to the Indian Affairs Branch as requested.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nEncs.\nAugust 3, 1948.\n\nMr. R.P.G.

The school at present is operated in an old store building and the teacher is living in the warehouse at the back.\n\nIn spite of all our efforts, we have not been able to get a tender submitted at a reasonable price. The previous two tenders received were submitted to the Lands and Development Services Branch and it was felt that both these estimates were high. Mr. George V. Hannah of Sault Ste. Marie submitted an estimate of $18,500, and Mr. Bernier of Spanish, Ontario, submitted a lump sum tender of $19,000. Mr. Hannah stated that the only other way he would be interested in the construction of the school, would be an estimate cost of labour with a fixed fee of $1000, for himself provided he could start the foundation within two weeks time.\n\nMr. Indian Superintendent Laurence has now been able to obtain a third tender and this is submitted herewith for your consideration. It has been submitted to Lands and Development Services Branch for their advice and their comment is as follows:\n\n\"With reference to your marginal notation dated August 30th, on Mr. Hoey's memorandum to you of the 25th ultimo, we have examined the composite tender submitted to Indian Superintendent Laurence, and consider the interests of the Department would be best advanced by arranging with Emile Marier of Massey, Ontario, to...\"\nfurnish his own services and supervise construction for a lump sum fee of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00).\n\nUnder this arrangement labour and materials would be Government issue, chargeable directly to the Indian Affairs Branch\".\n\nI would recommend that you approve the erection of this school under the supervision of Emile Marier, whom our Superintendent has recommended as being reliable, for a lump sum fee of $1000.00.

M. Vincent,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nMemorandum:\n\nSerpent River Indian Day School,\nSault Ste. Marie Agency.\n\nThis is one of our most dilapidated schools and we have been trying for two years to interest a contractor in erecting a new one. The school at present is operated in an old store building and the teacher is living in the warehouse at the back.\n\nIn spite of all our efforts, we have not been able to get a tender submitted at a reasonable price. The previous two tenders received were submitted to the Lands and Development Services Branch and it was felt that both these estimates were high. Mr. George V. Hannah of Sault Ste. Marie submitted an estimate of $18,500, and Mr. Bernier of Spanish, Ontario, submitted a lump sum tender of $19,000. Mr. Hannah stated that the only other way he would be interested in the construction of the school, would be an estimated cost of labour with a fixed fee of $1000, for himself provided he could start the foundation within two weeks time.\n\nMr. Indian Superintendent Laurence has now been able to obtain a third tender and this is submitted herewith for your consideration. It has been submitted to Lands and Development Services branch for their advice and their comment is as follows:\n\n\"With reference to your marginal notation dated August 30th, on Mr. Hoey's memorandum to you of the 25th ultimo, we have examined the composite tender submitted to Indian Superintendent Laurence, and consider the interests of the Department would be best advanced by arranging with Emile Marier of Massey, Ontario, to...\"\nfurnish his own services and supervise construction for a lump sum fee of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00).\n\nUnder this arrangement labour and materials would be Government issue, chargeable directly to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nI would recommend that you approve the erection of this school under the supervision of Emile Marier, whom our Superintendent has recommended as being reliable, for a lump sum fee of $1,000.00. Most of the other labour would be Indian and the Department would buy through our Purchasing Agent all materials. It is felt that in this way we can erect the school at a much more reasonable rate than by the contract prices mentioned above.\n\nDirection.\n\nEncl:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6162, file 427-5, part 4)\nMr Lawrence\nSainte Marie\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have studied the blue print which you have left with me, and would consider three different wage agreement on this job.\n\nFirst, I would supervise the work until completion for one thousand dollars.\n\nOr, I would do the same work for monthly salaries of three hundred and fifty dollars. If you prefer I would accept a salary of seven per cent plus charge of cost.\n\nAm returning blue print with this letter.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nEmilie Marier.\nSend the following message, subject to the conditions on the back thereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\n13-10-5 (E)\n\nOttawa, September 14, 1948.\n\nMr. R.P.G.

Original on file 77-13.\n\nOn the Serpent River Reserve we found that good progress was being made in pouring the foundation for the new day school, there had been some worry about lack of cement, but it was hoped to get sufficient to complete the job, there was very little other material on hand, complaints being made about the length of time it took to get purchase orders through, if the material arrived in good time it would seem that there was a good chance of getting the building completed before the weather got too severe. Houses were being improved on this reserve also by the same method as was used on the Spanish River reserve.\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Nov. 22 | To 10 boxes of kleenex supplied the Serpent River R.C.

SCHOOL,\n\nMiss E.M. Robicheau, teacher at the above named school, has requested that a garage be built at this new school, also that a flagpole be erected and a pulley clothesline be put up and that a medicine cabinet be built somewhere in the school.\n\nWith reference to the garage, there will be enough lumber left over to build one for her car. The only new material required would be roofing paper and insul brick for the siding.\n\nI would recommend that while we have the carpenters there, a garage be built for this school. It would not add much to the cost and now a days it is more or less a necessity.\n\nR.F.G. Laurence\nSuperintendent Indian Agency\nSault Ste. Marie Ontario.\n6th January, 1949.\n\nMr. R.P.G.

It is understood that there will be no heavy expense necessary.

Mr. McLean is willing to rent the house, and as his residence objection was it being too far toward the winter time from other Indian villages, we can obtain Bleakly's house for the teacher.\n\nThere are 2 stories, one a cooly place, the other a house, a table & chairs.\n\nMr. McLean said he would rent to the Dept. at a nominal rental.

Porter\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nSince my return to Cutler I boarded at the hotel thirty-one days, awaiting some furniture. Then I came out to live in this house the department rented. I remained nine days and was obliged to return.\n\nThe store agent Rathen sent here is too small.\nIt holds eighteen inch (long) wood, and there isn't any that length here, besides it is too small to supply heat enough in cold weather.\n\nI had to cook my meals on a heater, which made it very awkward for me.\n\nThe house has no foundation apart from the corners, and is a very cold shack with plenty of bed bugs. I could not sleep at night and had to leave.\n\nThere is no water fit for use within one...\nhalf mile, as Mr. Allen\nforbid us to use the\nwater from the ditch,\nwhich is almost dry.\n\nI am very sorry\nyou put some expense\nin this house, and\nI am quite willing\nto finish my term\nfrom the hotel at the\nsame time, if you\nsee fit to engage\nanother teacher. I shall\nbe willing to resign\ncould not think of\nliving in this house\nalone at night. There\nare too many drunkards\non the road shouting\nand swearing.\nAwaiting a reply\nfrom you in the near future,\n&c.,\nRespectfully Yours,\nEva MacAndrews.\nOttawa, Oct. 27, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have yours of the 23rd instant, informing the Department of unsatisfactory conditions at the Teacher's Residence at the Serpent River Indian Day School. I have noted that you are willing to complete the term for which you were engaged, but that you will live at the hotel in Cutler.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department has learned, with regret, of the difficulties which you have had to face, and I wish to thank you for carrying on your duties without interruption, in spite of unpleasant experiences. I am writing Mr. Agent Rothera, explaining in detail the situation. We will endeavour to satisfactorily dispose of the equipment which we placed in the teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Eva McAndrew,\nTeacher,\nSerpent River Indian Day School,\nCutler, Ont.\nOttawa, Oct. 27, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Miss McAndrew, Teacher of the Serpent River Indian Day School, finds it impossible to live in the teacher's residence and is again boarding in the town of Cutler. Miss McAndrew reports the presence of bed bugs in this rented house; claims that the stove is too small for heating purposes; that the house has no foundation and is very cold; that there is no water fit to drink within one-half mile; and that there are too many rowdy characters around for her to remain alone at night.\n\nWill you proceed to Cutler as soon as convenient, and if Miss McAndrew is still of the opinion that it is impossible to live in this rented home, you should try to cancel the lease and make the best disposal possible of the residence equipment which we have lately purchased. If the stove and any other articles can be returned, you should make arrangements in this connection. The accounts will in the meantime be kept on file, unpaid, until we receive your report following your visit to the Serpent River Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. F. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to letter of Oct 27, I am glad to learn the teacher at Kamschatka school near Fort River Band being unable to live in the house, has decided that I received a letter from her stating she had gone back to the trading house. I would tell me the reason why she saw me. I went down next day to report once again your letter.\n\nThe store I got was a small cold store, the same as at Kamschatka. I found a bed, a table, a wood stove which I consider large enough for any dwelling. The house is situated away from the road, maybe she is nervous being alone. Have made arrangements with myself to take care of the store, also with Mr. Sage to take care of the bed, spring mattress, a little bed, chairs, if I am unable to procure with the other articles that have been bought here. Maybe there could be used some of the other articles.\n\nI wrote to Mrs. McLean who is coming after Christmas to tell her that the house would not be rented after Oct 31st telling her the reason.\n\nThat it is infected with bedbugs.\n\nI shall report just as soon as I have delivered the goods back and in credit slips over what goods were returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

If it is possible to rent this building at a reasonable rate, and if you consider it satisfactory, it would solve the problem for sometime of providing suitable living accommodation. Please inform the Department as soon as you can get in touch with the owner as to whether he will rent this building. You should state the rent that would be charged and the period for which he would agree to lease the same. Please also state whether there are any furnishings on hand which were supplied for the use of the teacher's residence in the fall of 1922 that could be utilized in this building. If it is impossible to obtain the house mentioned by you, the question of building an addition to the school building to be used as a teacher's residence will receive consideration, but it would not be possible to undertake the work until next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This will be the full period for which this cottage will be required. You may arrange for the purchase of the following supplies to fit up this cottage to make it comfortable for the teacher's use, viz: a stove, bed and bedding, table, a small quantity of dishes and kitchen utensils. It is not intended that any expensive articles be supplied. The department will expect you to obtain the furnishings required at the lowest possible cost competitive prices if possible being obtained. Please arrange for the rental of this cottage and the purchase of the furnishings required at as early a date as possible. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred. It might be well to obtain a brief agreement in writing signed by the Indian owner of the cottage covering the rental of same for a period of 6 months from the 1st instant at $6 per month. Any articles which you have on hand should be used in furnishing the cottage.\n\nThe question of providing permanent living quarters for a teacher in connection with this school should receive your attention. Please report whether it would be possible to build an addition to the school building which would provide the accommodation required, also whether you could arrange for the purchase of the material required and the fitting and oversight of the labour. You should bring this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring in order that if it is decided to have this arrangement carried out the work can be done during the coming summer months. Please give as full particulars as possible regarding the size of the addition you would recommend be erected. The approximate cost of the lumber and labour should also be stated. If you consider it would be inadvisable to erect an addition to the present school building, please state the cost of fitting up a suitable house near the school. The Department will expect you to give this matter your consideration and furnish a full report early next spring as to what you would advise be done in order to provide permanent living accommodation for a teacher at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As the teacher states she is quite comfortable in the school building and is willing to live there until next spring, no further steps need be taken to rent the house from Lewis, the Indian owner. If the stove, bed and other supplies which you ordered have not been delivered, you should arrange with the dealers to cancel the order. If, however, any of this material is required in making the quarters occupied by the teacher in the school comfortable, you may keep same and forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nRegarding the building of an addition to the school building next spring to provide suitable living accommodation for the teacher, it is noted that you have taken this matter up with a number of contractors and that you will furnish at an early date an estimate of the cost of the material and labour in erecting the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Owing to the cost, we do not desire to prepare plans and call for tenders, and would prefer, if you can arrange to do so, that you purchase all material required after obtaining competitive prices, also that you engage the labour, under a competent foreman, and keep proper time sheets of the men's time. It is considered that a two roomed addition would be sufficient. This could be of the dimensions given on the sketch which you enclosed. The Department would have no objection to Mr. Geo. P. Sandie being engaged as foreman. The total cost of the two roomed addition, including material and labour, should not exceed approximately $700. We note that it will be necessary to move a shed and make certain repairs to the present school building. If it is decided to proceed with the erection of the addition as outlined above, this work could also be done at that time.\n\nAn early reply is requested stating whether you could arrange to purchase the material, engage the labour and oversee the work as suggested above, and, if you can do so, definite instructions will be given you in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This work will have to remain over until the summer holidays, next, when it is hoped there will not be the same difficulty in arranging for the labour required. You should again bring this matter to the attention of the Department not later than the middle of May, next, and at the same time furnish a definite suggestion as to how you would recommend that the work be done, if possible stating whether you can have the work carried out in accordance with the proposed suggestions in our letter of the 11th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nOttawa, May 5th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. J. M. Bennett, Separate School Inspector, has forwarded a communication which he received from you relative to the erection of a combined school building and teacher's residence on the Serpent River Indian Reserve. Previous correspondence has been had with you regarding the question of building an addition to the present school building to provide living quarters for the teacher. The funds at our disposal this present fiscal year are limited, and it will hardly be possible to consider the erection of a new school with living accommodation for a teacher. Owing to the fact that the mills have closed at Cutler, where a number of Indians formerly obtained employment, the question arises as to whether there will be any likelihood of them removing from Serpent River to other Reserves in the near future to obtain employment. I shall be pleased if you will state your views regarding this, as it would not be advisable, if there is any likelihood of the Indians leaving Serpent River, to undertake the expense of providing a new school building, especially as it is considered that the present classroom facilities should be satisfactory for the purpose.\n\nRegarding the question of the erection of an addition to the present school building, the Department considers that it might be possible to rent a house near the school that could be used as a teacher's residence. If this could be done, it would save the expense at the present time of building an addition to the school. It is necessary that all funds at our disposal this year be used as economically as possible, and if a house could be rented for a few years, it would save considerable expense in building. The Department would like you to visit Serpent River at your early convenience, ascertain if a house is available, and also whether the Indians intend to reside permanently on the Reserve, and inform the Department fully as to your opinion in the matter, having in view the most economical arrangement possible to provide accommodation for the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM INSPECTOR'S REPORT ON THE SERPENT RIVER INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, APRIL 2, 1925.\n\nI understand that the Indian Agent was here in January talking of a new teacher's residence. Now, before such is done, if it is the intention of the Department, I would suggest that a combined school with two rooms or so for the teacher be built instead.\n\nPresent classroom building is satisfactory as far as the interior is concerned but it will only be a matter of a few years when much may have to be spent on its upkeep and renovation. It certainly is only a temporary schoolhouse at present. I feel it would be unsatisfactory to build a residence alone. The classroom need not be very large as the total enrolment will hardly exceed thirty.\n\nJ. M.

Bennett,\n\nInsp.\nApril 30th 1925.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear sir;-\n\nI am enclosing a letter that I received from Mr. Rothera, Indian agent at Thessalon.\n\nKindly peruse it and return.\n\nPersonally I feel that the old school at Kenabutch (Seppent River) should not have money wasted on it in repairs. It was only temporary in the first place. It is good enough inside but not otherwise. I feel that if you intend building a teachers house it would be wise to build a classroom with it. Two rooms for the teacher with a classroom and cloakroom and a woodshed and suitable toilets would remedy the matter once and for all.\n\nThis is only a recommendation which I felt I should call to your attention.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJ.M. Bennett\nOttawa, May 5th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. J. M. Bennett, Separate School Inspector, has forwarded a communication which he received from you relative to the erection of a combined school building and teacher's residence on the Serpent River Indian Reserve. Previous correspondence has been had with you regarding the question of building an addition to the present school building to provide living quarters for the teacher. The funds at our disposal this present fiscal year are limited, and it will hardly be possible to consider the erection of a new school with living accommodation for a teacher. Owing to the fact that the mills have closed at Culler, where a number of Indians formerly obtained employment, the question arises as to whether there will be any likelihood of their removing from Serpent River to other Reserves in the near future to obtain employment. I shall be pleased if you will state your views regarding this, as it would not be advisable, if there is any likelihood of the Indians leaving Serpent River, to undertake the expense of providing a new school building, especially as it is considered that the present classroom facilities should be satisfactory for the purpose.\n\nRegarding the question of the erection of an addition to the present school building, the Department considers that it might be possible to rent a house near the school that could be used as a teacher's residence. If this could be done, it would save the expense of the present time of building an addition to the school. It is necessary that all funds at our disposal this year be used as economically as possible, and if a house could be rented for a few years, it would save considerable expense in building. The Department would like you to visit Serpent River at your early convenience, ascertain if a house is available, and also whether the Indians intend to reside permanently on the Reserve, and inform the Department fully as to your opinion in the matter, having in view the most economical arrangement possible to provide accommodation for the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Besides, our funds this year are extremely limited, and it will not be possible to provide the money required in putting up a new school building. The Indian band have no funds which could be used for the purpose.\n\nWe are again taking this matter up with Mr. Rothera, and requesting him to state his opinion as to whether there is any likelihood of the Indians leaving this Reserve in the near future, and also whether it would not be possible to make arrangements for living accommodation for a teacher by the rental of a house that could be used for the purpose. Failing this, we might be prepared to erect a small addition to the present school building. When we have full information regarding the situation at this point, every consideration will be given to providing comfortable quarters for a teacher.\n\nThe communication which you received from Mr. Rothera is returned herewith as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6162, file 427-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nIn answer to letter of May 5th 1923.\n\nHave visited Cutler & called in some of the families living there & by obtaining board & lodging for the teacher for next term. The answer given is if we are still in the employ of the Company & are allowed to remain, I shall make the manager & tell him at Cutler & the Company will erect a small cottage for the teacher next term. I spoke to Miss H. Dewar & she expects resign & would recommend that a young teacher be appointed for the distance from the cottage & the school will be about a mile & half. Miss Dewar felt she cannot work that distance.\n\nAm in the hope that accommodation can be had at one of the houses, but in particular it will stand before the term commences. We will have buying supplies for furnishing the cottage, but if need will be necessary to furnish the cottage.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nC. J. Rothera\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6162, file 427-8, part 1)\nOttawa, May 26th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with further reference to the question of obtaining suitable living accommodation for the teacher of the Serpent River Indian Day School. We note that it will be possible to rent a cottage for the teacher's use if it is found impossible to make other arrangements for her board. Owing to lack of funds, the Department does not wish to incur any expenditure in building at this point if it is at all possible to either rent a house or obtain boarding accommodation for the teacher elsewhere.\n\nWe note that the teacher may resign at the end of the present school year. If so, you should obtain her resignation in due time and forward same to the Department.\n\nPlease inform the Department definitely at a later date as to the arrangements you can make for proper boarding facilities for a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. Bothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nOttawa, August 6, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nIn a letter dated the 3rd instant, Miss Jean McDermott asked the Department if she is to return to the Serpent River School on September first. She states that, when you advised her that you had rented a cottage for the use of the teacher, she requested you to apply to the Department for a transfer to some other school. In your letter of July 16th, last, you stated that Miss McDermott had forwarded her resignation. Apparently she was only desiring a transfer, but we are not re-appointing her until a further report is received from you.\n\nWith reference to a residence for the teacher at this school, the Department was not aware, until the receipt of Miss McDermott's letter, that you had arranged to secure a cottage in Cutler. An official of the Department expects to go to Spanish next week and it is the intention for him to arrange to meet you in Cutler and give consideration to the question of securing proper quarters for the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary\n\nC. F. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nSir,\n\nThe teacher at Lemoineville school, Sergeant River Band, has been compelled to leave her boarding house as she cannot keep it anymore due to lack of funds. She has no place to go.\n\nShe has a cottage near the school and had it repaired by the government. She also got enough furniture from the company's boarding house. However, she cannot afford to buy a stove or any other appliances. She cannot afford to buy a stove or any other appliances.\n\nShe has obtained a little money in cash, so it was urgent that she should be able to keep the school house at least. She stayed with an Indian family but could not stay any longer, so had to do this without permission. With a stove for cooking, everything will be comfortable for her.\n\nKindly advise if this can be obtained.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that you have obtained a cottage near the school and have had it papered and the floor painted, also that you obtained enough furniture to make the house comfortable.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and installation of a cook stove of a type that would be suitable. You should, if possible, obtain competitive prices and make the purchase of the stove from the firm quoting the lowest price. If any stove pipe is required, you may also purchase same.

The name, series, number of grade and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\n\nAda Bush\nTeacher.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that I have examined this requisition, and that the articles asked for by the teacher are necessary and are such as are in use in the Provincial schools.\n\nIndian Supt. or Agent.\n\nA separate form to be used for each school.\n\nForm No. 99.\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, September 14, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of a requisition from the teacher of the Serpent River Indian Day School for bedding, furnishings, cooking utensils and a range for the use of the teacher's residence.\n\nIn this connection, I have to say that when this residence was first furnished, and at different times since then, a considerable amount of furnishings, dishes, etc., were supplied. The Department will, however, approve of your arranging for the purchase, to the best advantage, of the following: 1 mattress, 6'x3'; 1 bed spread; 1 comforter; 1 pair flannelette blankets. The above bedding, while serviceable, should be as inexpensive as possible. You may also purchase 1 wash boiler; 1 pair towels; 1 dish towels; 1 teapot; inexpensive curtain material for 6 windows; 6 curtain rods; also a few cooking utensils, such as pans and dishes. Please forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the above purchases.\n\nRelative to the linoleum; cupboard; folding couch; rocking chair; rug for bedroom and a new range, I have to request that you will forward the cost of these supplies, also state the necessity for same. You should state the quantity of linoleum required, and the purpose for which it is required, also particulars as to the rug for the bedroom. You should also state the need of supplying a folding couch and rocking chair. Particulars should also be given regarding the cupboard, the purpose for which it is required and the cost, also if you recommend same, whether it could not be built locally, or would have to be purchased.\n\nRelative to the request of the teacher to be supplied with a large range, I would point out that a stove at a cost of $30 was supplied in November, 1928. You should report as to the necessity of providing this large range, as it is thought the amount of cooking the teacher would require to perform could be carried out on the stove which has been supplied.\n\nIn forwarding requests of this nature in future, you should give information as to the necessity and the cost of the various items asked for, as it is necessary that your recommendation be received before authority can be given to make the purchase.\n\nWhen we have a reply giving the information asked for regarding the above items, further consideration will be given as to whether they can be authorized or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon,\nOnt.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to letter of Sept 14/29 in regard to furniture. Rock chair rug for bedroom would recommend these be purchased. Had the floor painted last year but it is very bare without old cloth or anything on it. Also the cupboard is needed, so it would be cheaper to buy than build as there is no mill nearby so lumber would have to be bought outside.\n\nIn regard to the Range. The stove is a cord stove, but the firebox is small & the teacher says it does not cook very well. Maybe when she is accustomed to it, it will be alright. Will wait for a while.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nC. E. Stirling\nOttawa, October 1st, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to the request of the teacher of the Serpent River Indian Day School for furnishings for the use of the teacher's residence, I have to say that you have not furnished the information asked for in our letter of the 14th ultimo relative to the quantity of linoleum required, the cost of same and also the cost of the other furnishings mentioned. However, as it is noted you recommend that they be supplied, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the quantity of linoleum required, also for the purchase of a rocking chair and a small inexpensive rug for the bedroom.\n\nRelative to the cupboard, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a cupboard that would be suitable for the purpose for which it is required.\n\nYou should see that all the above equipment is obtained at the lowest possible price, having in view the supplying of serviceable articles. When the above supplies have been delivered, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred; also accounts covering the cost of the supplies which you were authorized to purchase for the use of the teacher's residence in official letter of the 14th ultimo.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to supply a new range at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have Mr. Elias personally for a number years, and found him to be a painstaking teacher, and an exemplary man when residing in this section of the County. I have no doubt if he was stationed at Shawanaga his influence would be very much to the benefit of the Band as an educator, and a spiritual adviser, in the ways of conducting themselves as they should.\n\nThe salary of four hundred dollars would be well spent for the benefit of the Band. He would act as Secretary, and Interpreter, for them as well as Teacher. I would recommend his engagement in preference to many of the young female teachers that are out for securing such a school as a preliminary practice.\n\nover\nMEMO\n\nto leave for another school or some other pursuit more congenial to their taste.

Cape Croker School 15 mos. 1877-8\n\n(b). Tangier 3 \" 1878\n\n(c). Parry Island Ryerson School 15 \" 1878-9\n\nThe efficiency of my labor as a teacher will be read in the enclosed printed report of the late J. George Hodgins Deputy Minister of Education of Toronto Ont. to show that I have taught the children\nParry Island, to the satisfaction of the authorities then concerned.\n\nII. After serving five years as an assistant missionary for Parry Island Indian Mission, I was again appointed for Christian Island Indian Mission both of Methodist Church. For the latter I remained four years while here I was received probationer for the Ministry.\n\nIII. In year of 1887, I attended the High School at Cobourg for two years, the third class teacher's course. I did not write for the teacher's examination; for at this time I was received into the full membership of the Ministry. In year of 1889, I was appointed for Walpole Island Indian Mission of the Methodist Church.\n\nIV. In year of 1899 I asked to be left without a station for one year. In view of engaging myself in the Evangelistic work, I lived in the town of Parry Island.\nenclosed herein two cards to cards\nto show, that I have taken classes in\nthe Cobourg Collegiate Institute.\n\nII.\u2014I resigned from the Methodist Ministry\nin Canada in view of extending my work\nas Evangelist to the Indians of the State of\nMichigan, in year of 1900, with the letters\nof my standing honourably, but in service.\n\nIII.\u2014I was invited to take charge of\nan Indian Mission at Petoskey Mich.\nIn year of September 1894, to 1907. I lived\nin the City, Petoskey Mich. Two letters herein\nenclosed, one to show my acceptance to the\ninvitation, and one to show that I have hon-\nourably left my charge of Petoskey Indian\nMission, under the Grand Traverse District,\nMichigan Conference, Methodist Episcopal\nChurch. Therefore I enclose my roll of\nparchments or my letters of standing both\nof Canada, and that of the United States\nof Methodist Churches, for the Department to\nexamine. They are valuable to me,\nso please return them to my address after\nthey were examined.\nLastly, the last two places I have laboured as an evangelist were Cape Croker Indian Mission with Rev. Robt. H. Rogers of Colpoys Bay, Bruce Co., Ont., and for 7 weeks under Parry Island Indian Mission with Rev. David Macomine as missionary of Parry Island Dist.\n\nI will therefore offer myself for a trial of three months or six, as the Department may please. Should therefore my service prove satisfactory to the Department, let me be engaged; if not then dismissed on my merits, or be dismissed on my demerits, of course my constant shift from one place to another have lost some of my valuable testimonials which might have been use to me in this matter. With this facts I conclude my letter.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nW.R. Elias\nSouthampton\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of August 24th instant\n\nI beg leave to inclose you a letter from Mr. Elias, who is an applicant for the Indian School, Shawanaga Reserve, also under separate cover are Mr. Elias' testimonials, &c., which he estimates highly, and wishes them to be returned to him.\n\nI think it would be a wise and beneficial thing to place Mr. Elias in charge of the Shawanaga School for a year; his residence among the Indians there during the time the C.P.R. Co. are operating in the gravel pits, would be a moral benefit as well to the grown up people as a teacher to the children.\n\nThe extra one hundred dollars in salary would be money well spent.\n\nI hope you will approve of his appointment.\n\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Supt. Macdonald, of Parry Sound, forwarded an application from Mr. W.A. Elias for the position at a salary of $400 a year. Mr. Macdonald said that he has known Elias personally for many years and found him to be a painstaking teacher and an exemplary man and has no doubt that, if he was stationed at Shawanaga, his influence would be much to the benefit of the band as an educational and spiritual adviser, and he would recommend his engagement in preference to many of the young female teachers that are looking for such a school.\n\nMr. Macdonald was asked what qualifications Elias had that would command such a salary. He has now forwarded a letter from Elias, in which he describes the work he has been engaged in for the last thirty years, together with a number of testimonials from the Methodist Conference and others, the latest one being dated the 21st August from Mr. George E. Smith, Collector of Customs at Southampton, who certified that he has been acquainted with Elias for the last thirty years and\nand has always found him an honourable man, sober, industrious and quite reliable for any position he may be given. Mr. Elias although an Indian is an educated man and an ordained minister of the Methodist Church and has had previous experience in Indian school work.\n\nIf this were all the Department knew about Elias I would have no hesitation in recommending his engagement, but upon looking up his antecedents as an Indian I find that the Department refused to transfer him from the Chippewa band of Walpole Island to the Saugeron band on March 26, last, in view of the explanatory letter of Mr. Agent Scoffield referring to the resolution asking for Elias's transfer. Several of the councillors in speaking against his adoption made very damaging statements against Elias. Whether they were actuated by jealousy or not I cannot say, but the Department took the view that he was not a desirable man to adopt.\n\nIt is desirable that the school should be opened at once and it is for the Department to say whether it will engage Elias or not. It would be a difficult matter now to secure a qualified teacher and Elias in his letter to Mr. Macdonald is willing to take the place temporarily and be retained on his merits or dismissed on his demerits.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The method he uses as made known to our common sense is high school method which method he has used and that we know can not be applied to Public Schools in order to assure success. We know that the children are not making satisfactory progress and have not made any during the past term.\n\n2nd. Not teaching the full time each day, we have known him to dismiss the children at 15 and sometimes before 4 o'clock then goes over to the station.\n\n3rd. Leaving the school for week or more without our knowledge and thereby being absent when the\nPublic School Inspector was here therefore we have no knowledge of his progress made towards the school.\n\nWe laid these complaints before our Agent Mr. McDonald through correspondence and when he was up here on pay-day July 14th he frankly told us that he would not forward them to the Indian Dept and this what leads us to write direct to the Indians Dept as we mean what we are about and we believe to be for our interest even more for our children and we desire the Dept of Indian affairs to look into this as we do and harken to our complaints to our welfare.\n\nMr. McDonald also told us we could not secure the service of another Indian teacher who would be as well suited as Mr. Elias. Allow us to say we can find one who will teach the proper method and thereby assure success it leads us to believe that he wants to keep Mr. Elias as teacher in spite of the above mentioned complaint.\n\nHoping sincerely to hear from the\nDept at an early date.\n\nWashburn\n\nYours Truly\n\nChief Joe Pauwis\n\nCouncil Joe Pauwagawon\n\nMichael Blacksky\n\nIndian Affairs.

Elias.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department cannot comply with your request at the present time. Should future reports show that Mr. Elias is, as you allege, incompetent and that the school is making no progress, the question of a change will receive consideration, but a further time must elapse before the Department would feel justified in passing judgment upon his work in the school.\n\nThe returns received show that the school has been kept open very regularly, but enquiries will be made with reference to closing before the hour appointed.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.B. McLean\n\nChief Joe Pawis,\nShawanaga,\nOnt.\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, July 29, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nComplaint has been made to the Department that Mr. Elias, teacher of the Shawanaga school, has in the past absented himself from the school for a week or more and that he has dismissed the school on occasions before the appointed time in the afternoon.\n\nIf these complaints are well founded, Mr. Elias should be asked to adhere closely to the prescribed hours and not to leave the school in the charge of a substitute unless under exceptional circumstances. Where it is necessary for him to be absent or obtain a substitute, he should first, if possible, obtain permission in the regular way, thus not laying himself open to criticism by the Indians.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nD. F. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of July 29, 1909\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter re Mr. Elias, teacher of the Shawanaga School. I may say that Mr. Elias came to me last spring and asked me, if he could get away at Easter, to visit his old home at Southampton, Ont., and he would get Wesley Jacob, a worthy young man and a member of the Shawanage Band, would help the school for him until he returns. Mr. Elias had business matters to attend at Southampton when his family visited, until they came after him at Shawanaga. I granted him the permission from the representations he made me.\n\nI have never heard of him closing the school before the regular hour.\n\nI may say that Mr. Elias has been very diligent in looking after the conduct of the young Indians who do not go to school. I am sorry to say that owing to a religious faction among them people, some of them do not take kindly to his advice. The Roman Catholic wing think that he is exceeding his duties as a school teacher, he being an ex Methodist missionary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nI am too jealous enough to reprimand them for intemperance, and other acts of misconduct. I may say that Ex-Chief Joseph Davis is a member of the Methodist Church, and Mr. Elias has expressed himself strongly to the Chief on his intemperance. Councillors Joseph Paymahpaywong and Michel Blacksky are Roman Catholics and resent anything said to them. And they have a young Indian from Cape Croker, working on the reserve, who they would like to retain in the present teacher's position.\n\nHence the cause of the fault finding. I do not know if this Cape Croker aspirant is qualified to teach or not. But from what I have heard his moral reputation is not just what would be required of a school teacher.\n\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of the fact that there are a number of Roman Catholic Indians in this band and that Mr. Elias is a Protestant, considerable discretion must be exercised by him in his dealings with the Indians. The work of the school should receive attention primarily, and while the Department is pleased to know that he takes a general interest in the welfare of the Indians, he must not make himself obnoxious, thereby annulling the good results that might otherwise be attained.

However when a feeling such as is indicated by this petition has once developed in a school district, there is but one effective cure; that is a change of teacher. The fair and just course to both parties is to notify him, that his engagement will terminate at some definite time in the near future; say at the end of this year, or Easter, or any other time that you may think best.

Also, there is boarding facilities at either of these schools.\n\nMr. Moore thinks that qualified teachers are very likely to be got at $450 or $500 for the first quarter, and if they prove their efficiency to raise their salary to $500 for the teaching year.

In reply I beg to say that the Department does not consider it advisable to continue the services of Mr. Elias as teacher of the Shawanaga School. With reference to applications for this position the Department considers that under the existing circumstances in the Province of Ontario, it might not be well at the present time to insist upon a fully qualified teacher. I may say that of late where the Department has placed advertisements for teachers it has been successful in securing applicants. It must be remembered that peculiar qualifications are required in the case of Indian teachers. Many of our most successful teachers have only limited professional qualifications, nevertheless they are able to do consistently good work.\n\nIn a previous letter of July 18th. you were informed that the Department would pay for a qualified teacher from $400.00 to $500.00, according to qualifications and experience. If you consider it advisable to again advertise, you may run a limited number of insertions, say six, in the Toronto Daily Globe, and offer from $400. to $500. according to qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

As she holds a 3rd Class Provincial grade, she thought she would suit. I wrote Mrs. Martin about the middle of November, and have received no answer up to date.

I commenced teaching at the age of eighteen here in the county of Oxford, and taught seven years; then went to the University of Toronto where I took the degree of B.A. in 1855 and two years of M.A. in '56. I afterwards taught in the high school at Mitchell, Ont.

Underposition forced me to learn English and return to my own country three years ago; there I recovered my normal health. Last year I accepted a position as teacher at the St. Peter's Academy in Manitoba, which I have resigned as the clergyman, Rev. Louis Lefebvre, with whom I lived, left the district and landed just for a suitable place to board. I was very acceptable to the pupils and parents and I fairly believe that I was doing good there but they have not a suitable house in connection with the school. It was getting & 60 annually there.\n\nNow I am not compelled to take a position but if I can turn a short of another to appreciate the advantages which British-Indian settlement afford.\nI was doing such work as I was expected of him subject to rent.\n\nOf course it expects its actual residence is furnished so as to be habitable by the teacher, and that my salary would be paid monthly.\n\nI am fifty-three years of age, weigh over two hundred pounds\u2014my constitution but extremely build.

The last one, Miss Creasor, enjoyed the little walk once a day. The trouble was, the water was bad in summer time so I had the Department allow $25.00 to get a well dug near the school and as soon as the snow goes we intend to dig a new well as near the school as we can get good water. Some teachers do not seem to want to do anything to help themselves in any way.

I then taught very successfully for four and a half years after that I attended the Port Arthur Summer Model and received a District Certificate of Qualification. I have also a Business College training and took a course in Natural History and Taxidermy and have first class Diploma in those sciences. I taught taxidermy and had a regular museum in my school and it won great applause from the inspectors.\n\nI am an agricultural enthusiast and have taught agriculture and school gardening for three years at S.S.M.S. Tait. I had the best school garden in the province. I was appointed Agricultural Delegate to represent the Rainy River District at the Rural Teachers' Conference held at Guelph in the year 1914 and was the only Delegate called upon to make a speech on agricultural teaching at that Conference.\n\nI can produce testimonials and give the best references as to my character and ability to teach.\nShould I be honored with the appointment I shall take charge with both the determination and confidence that my services will prove satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nThanking you for your anticipated kindness and awaiting an early reply.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPete J.

It is hoped that she will meet with every success in her work.\n\nI have also to acknowledge the receipt of an application forwarded by you from Peter J. Troy.

Wilson, who was appointed teacher of the Shawanaga Indian Day School, at a salary of $700.00 per annum and bonus, beginning duty on the 16th of February last, has sent in her resignation to take effect on the 30th instant. Her reason for resigning is that the place is too lonely.\n\nA teacher will be required after the summer holidays at Ryerson, Parry Island, and Mr. Superintendent Logan suggests that Mrs. Wilson be transferred there and, if so, he requests to be informed as to what salary the Department would be prepared to pay her. At the present time she is in receipt of $700.00, which is entirely paid from band funds. The teacher at the Ryerson School only receives $600.00, $300.00 of which is paid from band funds and $300.00 from vote.\n\nI would beg to recommend that Mrs. Wilson be offered the position at the Ryerson School at the same salary as is paid her at Shawanaga and that the extra amount required be provided from the school vote. She has a limited third class certificate, is a widow with two children, and the Inspector states that the pupils have made splendid progress since she took charge. He also states that he found a decided improvement in the general management of the school (Shawanaga) and that he considers Mrs. Wilson a very capable teacher, the attendance having increased considerably since his visit last fall. I think we should endeavour to retain Mrs. Wilson's services and that she be offered the Ryerson School at $700.00 and the bonus.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is sorry to lose her services and approves of the suggestion made by you that she be offered the position as teacher in the Ryerson School, Parry Island. If she accepts the Department will allow her the same salary as was paid her at Shawanaga, namely, $700.00 per annum, and the bonus during the present fiscal year at the rate of $150.00 per annum. You will be good enough to consult Mrs. Wilson and ascertain from her whether she would be prepared to accept the Ryerson School and inform the Department as to her decision.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain a teacher for the Shawanaga School, to begin duties after the summer holidays, and you should make inquiry with a view to obtaining the services of a teacher. The name, age, qualifications and experience of any applicants received by you should be submitted to the Department for consideration.

Mrs. Elizabeth English of Rama Road Post Office has no qualification as a teacher her highest was a third class years ago which does not count at the present time. She has had the name of being a good teacher and she has acted substitute at the Rama Indian Day School and gave good service. Present circumstances in her case would make her anxious to hold unto her job, being away from home here, would also add to sleep in line and to sleep in place. It seems of the opinion that Mrs. English would make a good teacher for Rama Day School.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

She formerly acted as substitute teacher for the Department at the Rama Indian Day School and Mr. Agent Myers recommends her as a teacher for an Indian school and states that she gave good satisfaction while teaching at Rama.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Mrs. English of her appointment and she should arrange to be at Shawanaga in time to begin duties as soon as possible after the first of September, next. The Department will allow her a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 during the period which it is continued to the teachers in Indian day schools. You should communicate with Mrs. English at once and ascertain from her whether she will accept the position and, if so, whether she will be ready to begin work on or about the first of September, next, and you should inform the Department accordingly.\n\nI may add that, should the Inspector's reports be favourable as to her services, method of teaching, etc., the Department would be disposed to consider the granting of an increase in the above salary, but this will depend, however, upon the results which she achieves in the work and the reports received.\n\nKindly communicate with Mrs. English at once, so that she can arrange to be at Shawanaga at the time required.\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst.

Scott, making a statement about the Six Nations, which was in line with their resolution. So that the Department will understand the mind of the Band, I have to state they have had quite a few meetings re this matter, and clearly showed to me that they thought that as there was no income coming into their band funds there should, they thought, be as little as possible taken out of the fund.\n\nJohn M.

Please inform those interested that the Government has decided on free education for all Indians in Canada. In the past, a few Bands in the East have contributed from their funds towards the cost of maintaining day schools on their reserves.

It is hoped that you will be able to resume duties when the school reopens after the summer holidays, on September 3rd, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. E. English,\nShawanaga,\nOnt.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR McGOOKIN,\ndated April 29, 1931.\n\nShawanaga School - Mrs. English, teacher, well up in years, has 46 pupils on roll. Thirty-seven Indians and nine whites. There is no white school close and Carling Township pays a whiteman $3.00 a day to drive the white pupils over to the Indian school. The classroom work is altogether too heavy for the teacher and the white pupils should not be allowed to attend this school. The thirty-seven Indian pupils are quite enough to handle. Mrs. English would be very pleased if the white pupils were not allowed to attend.\nOttawa, April 29, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department Inspector reports that there are 9 white children attending the Shawanaga Indian Day School. I find that there is no authority for such attendance, and, as you have an average of about 30 Indian children per day, the Department considers that it has no option but to have you inform those not our wards that they must discontinue coming to your school. You will therefore please notify the white children that, as from May 4th, they will not be allowed to attend the Indian School. The Indian office at Parry Sound is receiving a copy of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. E. English,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nShawanaga,\nOnt.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to state that Inspector J.L. Moore of Parry Sound has reported to the Department that nine white children who have been attending the Shawanaga Indian Day School have been notified that they will not be allowed to attend the school after May 4th. The notification was sent to the teacher Mrs. E. English under date of April 29th, 1931 by Mr. A.F. MacKenzie of your Department.\n\nMay I state that there has been a verbal agreement between the Inspector and Mr. Daly, the Indian Agent at Parry Sound, that these children would be allowed to attend the Shawanaga School because of the fact that some eighteen Indian children are attending the Depot Harbour Public School. You will note, therefore, that the combined arrangement is in favour of rather than against the interests of the Indian children in this area.\n\nWe feel that it is unfortunate to have these children excluded at this particular time in the school term and I beg to suggest, therefore, that your Department arrange to permit the white children to remain in the Shawanaga School until June 30th, 1931.\n\nI shall be pleased to receive your decision in this matter at your early convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nChief Inspector.\nOttawa, May 19th, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Greer,\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant with reference to a recent order by this Department that white children should no longer attend the Shawanaga Indian Day School. I may say that there is no information on our files concerning the understanding between the Provincial Inspector and Mr. Daly, Indian Agent at Parry Sound, and, as Mr. Daly is now very ill, it has been decided to accede to your request. I am writing direct to the teacher at Shawanaga, asking her to re-admit the white children for the balance of the current academic year.\n\nAs from September 1st, next, some other arrangements will have to be made in their case as our wards will require all the accommodation at our school.\n\nWith reference to those Indian children who are attending the Depot Harbour Public School, as from September 1st, next, this Department will be prepared to make a grant to the school section.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nV. K. Greer, Esq., M. A.,\nChief Inspector,\nDepartment of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, May 19th, 1931.\n\nMadam,\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the white children that were attending the Shawanaga Indian Day School. The Department has decided to allow them to finish this academic year at your school and I should be grateful if you would so inform the parents. As from September 1st, next, however, white children will not be allowed to attend the Shawanaga Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nMrs. E. English,\nTeacher,\nIndian Day School,\nShawanaga, Ont.\nDear Mr. Ferrier;\n\nI had conversation with Mr. Moore, Public School Inspector for this district today, re the attendance of the whites at the Shawanaga Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Dumont, one of the residents in close proximity to Shawanaga Reserve, and who is married to a member of the Shawanaga Band, was one of the members of the community in that section to interview me today for the children of their section, numbering six, to be allowed to attend the Shawanaga School starting September term.\n\nThe reason he called, he stated, was because a Mr. Wilson of the Provincial Department, for the Mother's Allowance Board, informed him that the Department had made arrangements for the white children of their district to attend the Shawanaga School. I thought it strange that if this was so, I had been told nothing about it. Mr. Wilson, who is a visitor at my place in Parry Sound when he is in town, was a guest at my house the other night with his wife and daughter, and in the course of his conversation he mentioned the same thing to me that he had told Dumont.\n\nThis Mr. Dumont had called on Mr. Moore and Mr. Moore did not know anything about it, and he thought it strange that Mr. Wilson should know of this arrangement made. In conversation with Mr. Moore Inspector, I told him that I was going to write you about the matter and he said that he did not know why these children could not go to the Shawanaga School, because it would be quite a few miles farther to the next school, and they could not go there in the winter time.\nMr. Moore is of the opinion that there will always be room for these white children in the Shawanaga School. Mr. Moore mentioned the fact of the reciprocity arrangement between himself and the Department, re the white children attending Indian Schools and Indian children attending the white schools, and incidentally he mentioned that at Depot Harbour there are fifteen Indian children attending the Public School. Some time ago, I got a list from the Rev. Felstead, who is secretary of the School Board at Depot Harbour, stating that there were fifteen children attending at that time. I told Mr. Felstead that the matter had been arranged between Mr. Moore and myself, and concurred in by his department, that so long as it did not interfere with the space in the School for the white children, his Department was willing to have the Indian children attend. I just don't remember when this was.\n\nMr. Moore would appreciate it very much and so would the Department of Education in Toronto if we could continue to carry on the way we have been doing in the matter of the reciprocity plan. We benefit to the extent that there are nine more Indian children at Depot Harbour than there are whites at Shawanaga.\n\nMr. Ferrier, I am merely stating the case, and I presume you will understand that I am not trying to dictate. The arrangement that has been working here has been found to be very satisfactory and the mixing of the whites with the Indians in Shawanaga school has been to the benefit of the children. Would you be good enough to let me know if the Department has been in communication with the Mothers Allowance Board in Toronto, in connection with this case. Both Mr. Moore and I think it strange that any arrangements would be made without us being notified. We think that Mr. Wilson has misunderstood the arrangements that were made to allow the white children to go to Shawanaga School until the end of the June term.\nIf I could sit down at your desk and explain the situation to you, I am sure you would understand Mr. Moore's thought in this matter and how, I, as Agent here am looked upon as being a tyrant by these people who are living on the borders of Shawanaga Reserve, whose children are so near to the school and who there is room for (Mr. Moore says so) but they are not allowed to attend.\n\nWhen I came out of the Hospital and heard of the arrangements made, the first opportunity I had to take the matter up with Mrs. English I asked her if she was satisfied to teach in this school. She said she was. I asked her if she had found fault with the white children being there or complained to Mr. MacGookin. She said she did not. It would make things go along very smoothly here if the white children near Shawanaga were allowed to go to the school. There would be no hardship in them doing so, either to the children or to the teacher. Mr. Moore would like you to give this your serious consideration.\n\nI told him that I was writing a private letter to you and he thought that that was good business. Then if it is necessary to write the Department a letter, we could both consider the matter before replying to a reply from you re this.\n\nYour consideration re this matter at your very earliest will be very much appreciated.\n\nKind regards to yourself, your family and the staff.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/BK.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6163, file 428-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, August 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the attendance of white children at the Shawanaga Indian Day School. Pursuant to Mr. Inspector McGeekin's report, it was considered that the enrolment and average attendance of Indian pupils was all that should be expected of one teacher. Accordingly, during your illness, the Department wrote direct to Mrs. English, the teacher, asking her to notify the white children that, as from May 4th, they would not be allowed to attend the Indian school. A copy of this letter was sent to your office.\n\nOn May 15th, the Chief Inspector for the Ontario Department of Education wrote in part as follows: \"May I state that there has been a verbal agreement between the Inspector and Mr. Daly... that these children would be allowed to attend the Shawanaga School because of the fact that some 18 Indian children are attending the Depot Harbour Public School.\" He asked that the white children be allowed to remain in the Shawanaga School until June 30, 1931. I replied to Chief Inspector Greer, in part, as follows: \"I may say that there is no information on our files concerning the understanding between the Provincial Inspector and Mr. Daly, Indian Agent at Parry Sound, and, as Mr. Daly is now very ill, it has been decided to accede to your request... As from September first, next, some other arrangements will have to be made in their case, as our wards will require all the accommodation at our school. With reference to those Indian children who\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nare attending the Depot Harbour Public School, as from September first, next, this Department will be prepared to make a grant to the school section.\" Mrs. English was informed to allow the white children to attend until the end of June, last.\n\nYour recommendation, that the policy in the past be not changed, would be concurred in by the Department quite readily, were it not for the large enrolment (35) and average attendance (28) of Indian children at the Shawanaga School during the past academic year. I am doubtful if the teacher can give satisfactory attention to any more. Our Inspector reported that it was 9 white children that wanted to attend there. Your letter states 6. Will you give this further consideration and let the Department have another report and recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nParry Sound, Ont.\nAugust 28, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nYours of August 26th, 22-5-1, received, re the attendance of white children at the Shawanaga Indian Day School, asking that further consideration be given by me of this situation and to let the Department have another report and recommendation.\n\nIn reply I have to state that\n\nI have discussed this matter with Mr. Moore, the District Inspector here and he suggests that I give you a resume of the average attendance of the schools in this section. In Foley School the average attendance is 35 to 40, and in Utter School the average attendance is from 45 to 50. Mr. Moore figures the average attendance of the Shawanaga School is 28. On the 6th of May when he was present the average attendance was 33, which included the nine white children who were attending.\n\nThere are six white children who live outside of the Reserve and one at the station at Shawanaga which would make seven white children who would be going to school this year. Mr. Moore agrees with me in the opinion that for this district the attendance at the Shawanaga School is not as large as in the other schools, and he decidedly thinks that Mrs. English is not overburdened by any means, in her duties as teacher. He is talking with more than general interest in this case, as his wife, who is a daughter of the late Indian Agent, Dr. Walton, used to teach in this school.\n\nMr. Moore thinks that Mrs. English was talking out of place when she made any complaint to Inspector\nMcGookin as it was not fair to Inspector McGookin, to make the statements she did regarding the attendance. Under the circumstances, and owing to Mr. Moore's knowledge of the district of Parry Sound and his recommendation, I would strongly urge that the Department would give their permission for these white children to attend the Shawanaga Indian Day School, as both Mr. Moore and myself think that occasionally there might be more than 30 average attendance, we think that it will be a very rare occasion when it is so.\n\nShould the Department decide that we carry on with this reciprocity arrangement between Depot Harbour and Shawanaga, Mr. Moore and his Department would appreciate it very much, and Mr. Moore suggests that you might wire me and notify Mrs. English that the white children can attend the school.\n\nI would strongly recommend that this be done.\n\nTrusting this is the information required.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/EK.\nOttawa, September 1, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Greer:\n\nI wish to refer further to your letter of May 15th, last, and my reply of the 19th idem, concerning white children attending the Shawanaga Indian Day School. Recently, the Department has had considerable correspondence in this connection with Mr. Indian Agent Daly, of Parry Sound, who has been in communication with Provincial School Inspector Moore. In view of their strong recommendation, it has been decided to allow seven white children who are near the Shawanaga Indian Day School to attend there, and it is understood that the Depot Harbour Public School will allow the Indian children to attend, also without fee. In view of the expressions in your letter of May 15th, I presume that this arrangement will be satisfactory to your Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

A.,\nChief Inspector,\nDepartment of Education,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nOttawa, September 1, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nI wish to refer to earlier correspondence, with reference to white children attending the Shawanaga Indian Day School. In view of recent recommendations from Mr. Indian Agent Daly and Mr. Inspector Moore, the Department has decided to continue the former arrangement, and you may allow seven white children to attend the Shawanaga Indian Day School without fee.

Sutherland, Esq.\nActing Supt. Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland,\n\nMr. J. L. Moore Inspector of Schools in this district, has made inquiry re Departmental letter of Sept 1st, 1931, 22-5-1, following telegram sent on Sept 1st. re white children attending the Shawanaga Indian Day School.\n\nIt appears that some of the local men in the Shawanaga District have been behind in paying up their taxes and there is a question as to the authority of the white children attending the Shawanaga Indian Day School. Mr. Moore would appreciate it very much if you would renew this authority in such a way that it would continue until further orders from the Department. You will note by looking up correspondence that this arrangement has been going on for some considerable time and that we have Indian children attending the Depot Harbour School about equivalent to the white children attending the Shawanaga School.\n\nMr. Moore is very desirous of having this thing settled satisfactorily by Departmental authority. You will note that your Department has been in communication with the Department of Education in Toronto about this matter and I would suggest that the Department of Education in Toronto be notified to the effect that this arrangement will be continued until further orders.\nYour earnest consideration will be very much appreciated by Mr. Moore and myself. Please reply officially by return mail if possible.\n\nI take this opportunity of thanking you for your co-operation and help in my receiving the cheque to pay the men who were painting the schools at Moose Point and Magnetawan Reserves.\n\nWhen I arrived home, on going through my correspondence, I looked for the cheque for the Indians who were painting the School at Gibson Reserve, but there was no cheque here. I intended going today to Gibson to pay these men, but as the cheque had not come, I could not go. I would appreciate it very much if the cheque for this work could be sent forward at your earliest.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nAgent.\n\nP.S. I wired yesterday asking for the Cheque it was Indians who did the work, but it has not been sent forward since I wired please rush\nOttawa, September 12, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the attendance of white children at the Shawanaga Indian Day School.\n\nAs you were informed by official letter of September first, 1931, the Department approves of the attendance of the white children, on the understanding that the Indian children can attend the Depot Harbour Public School, without fee. The Chief Inspector, Department of Education, Toronto, agreed to this arrangement and it is not considered necessary to have his further confirmation. The arrangement which was made for the attendance of the white children at Shawanaga is to be continued until further notice. You may so inform both the Public School Inspector and the teacher of the Shawanaga Indian Day School.\n\nCheques, in favour of the Indians who performed the labour in connection with the painting of the Gibson Indian Day School, went forward on the 9th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

As the letter from the chief was very indefinite as to the actual quantity of material required I requested the school teacher to write me stating what the material was required for and what quantity. The letter which is herewith enclosed states that the lumber is required to put a wainscoting around the school. The quantity required for this purpose will be about 1000 ft. It will cost delivered at Shawanaga about $10.00. The nails will cost 50 cents or the two bands of lime, which are to be used for whitewashing the interior exterior of the school, will cost $3.00 so that the total expenditure will be $13.50.

If the Indian Department approves to build anew Teacher's house.\n\nThe old Teacher's house is not good enough to occupy in, and being repaired every year costs big money for nothing in repairing the old house.

Dept. of Indian Affairs,  \nOttawa, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWe believe that you are building a new school in Parry Sound Dist. and no doubt you will be requiring slate blackboard and school furniture, and trust when you come to this point that you will write us for prices, as we feel we can save you considerable money.\n\nIn the past year we have supplied to the Toronto Schools over 20,000 square feet of our natural slate blackboard. Should you require something cheap we would recommend Kraoplate, this composition board has stood the test and the Toronto Board of Education are using it for their portable schools throughout the City.\n\nIf you are interested in school furniture, kindly write us for our special catalogue on these lines.\n\nTrusting that we may have the pleasure of hearing from you, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nGD/ED.  \nTORONTO SCHOOL SUPPLY CO. LTD.\nINSTRUCTIONS To Set SLATE BLACK-\nBOARDS In SCHOOL ROOM\n\nObserve carefully the marks upon the crates so as to get\nthe right boards for the spaces and room intended.\n\nCarefully remove the side strips from the crates.\n\nThe crates should be kept nearly upright slightly leaning\nto prevent boards from falling out when end strips are\nloosened.\n\nObserve the marks on the back of each board and as they\nare taken from the crates convey them at once to the space\nintended.\n\nWhen the boards are thus arranged see that the bottom\nstrip which is to support the blackboards, has been firmly\nset and perfectly square; if this strip is not square it must be\nmade so otherwise boards will require blocking on the bot-\ntom.\n\nBegin by setting end board (either right or left one), being\ncareful to set the part of the board marked on the right\nplace; this will bring the jointed end to meet the jointed end\nof the next board.\n\nFasten the top moulding at the beginning end of the board\nslightly above the next board marked, to meet the jointed\nend of board already fixed to within about one-fourth of an\ninch\u2014not close up against. Observe how thick block should\nbe at the middle part of each board to bring them even; care-\nfully place those blocks firmly, using a wire nail if neces-\nsary.\n\nPlace the second board in position but do not bring it ad-\njacent the first by at least one-eighth of an inch; fasten firm-\nly by placing moulding of first board and then carefully\npush the second board against the first by using a small\nblock of soft wood at the bottom corner of the second board.\nSee illustration.\n\nILLUSTRATION\n\n| Top Moulding | Top | Top | Top |\n|--------------|-----|-----|-----|\n| SPACE        | 3rd Board | 2nd Board | 1st Board |\n\nBottom Strip Wainscoting\n\nProceed in this manner to set each board until the space is\ncompleted.\n\nIf the surface of two boards are not perfectly flush at joints\non account of one board being slightly heavier, or blocks not\nexact, they can be evened by a drawing knife or hone stone.\n\nIf for any reason it becomes necessary to cut off an end of\na board to make it fit properly, make a small cut, cut\ngross about one eighth of an inch from the mark until board\nis cut; the edge can then be rejoined by using a coarse and\nfine file in succession.\n\nIt is sometimes found that the bottom strip upon which the\nboards rest is not square and level, and the joints of the\nboards are thus thrown considerably out of plumb; this can\nbe remedied by placing a small block under the end of the\nboard to raise it enough to bring the two jointed ends in line\nagain.\n\nESTABLISHED 1885.\n\nSOLID SLATE\nBLACKBOARDS\n\nManufactured for\n\nToronto School Supply\nCompany, Ltd.\n\n210 VICTORIA ST.\nTORONTO, ONT., CAN.\n\nFROM \"MASTERS' EXCELSIOR\"\n\nBIG BED SLATE\nLAST FOREVER\n\nDEALERS IN ALL\nSCHOOL SUPPLIES\nWe assert without fear of successful contradiction, that SOLID SLATE BLACKBOARDS manufactured from our BIG BED SLATE, and Hand Shaved as we finish them, are more satisfactory to use in the School Room or elsewhere, last longer, are cheaper by one-half in the long run than any Composition, or any other Blackboard material out on the market.\n\nTHE QUARRYING AND FINISHING\n\nof SLATE BLACKBOARDS is a most interesting process to those who have never seen slate worked.\n\nSlate Rock for Blackboards is first cut out of the Quarry in large blocks, hoisted out by Steam Hoists, placed on cars, and conveyed to the Factory, where the block is transferred to one of the large Steam Saws, and cut as large a size as will permit, we will say 4x6 feet. It is then turned over to the \"Splitter\", who, with hammer and chisel, splits the block up into Slabs of the required thickness for Blackboards, (a full 3/8 of an inch). The splitting of blocks of this dimension must be very true, and indeed in our rock it is always so.\n\nThe pieces after being split are placed on the Rubbing Bed, and rubbed until the surface is perfectly smooth, and after which they are placed on the Shaving Table, and the entire surface is carefully and thoroughly shaved with a knife, by hand, until it has a surface smooth as a mirror.\n\nThe Board is then jointed at such ends as are to be joined to other boards, so as to make a perfect joint, after which they are properly crated and ready for shipment.\n\nORDERS\n\nShould state the width required, and the exact length of space where boards are required. Where the space is longer than we can make a single board, we make two or more with perfectly true joints. The widths carried in stock are 3 feet, 3 feet 6 inches and 4 feet, although we will make other width boards when ordered. It is always understood that boards are to be finished on one side only, unless specially specified that both sides are to be finished, for which double faced boards we make extra charges.\n\nTERMS\n\nTo responsible parties, or those having a satisfactory rating with the commercial agencies, or who can furnish acceptable references, we will extend credit for 30 days; otherwise we require at least one-half the amount of invoice paid when order is placed, or before shipment is forwarded, and balance on arrival at destination.\n\nSHIPMENTS ARE MADE\n\nDirect from our quarry, the blackboards being carefully packed in crates, each piece being marked so that its proper place on the wall is readily ascertained.\n\nWe will guarantee all our boards to arrive at purchaser's freight station in good order, and will replace F. O. B. Quarry Station, any blackboard broken in transit, providing a written certificate of such breakage is furnished us, signed by the freight agent at receiving point, and setting forth size of board or boards broken. No breakage claim can receive consideration without such certificate which may consist of memoranda of size or sizes of boards broken written across face of freight bill and signed by the freight agent. This written evidence we must have as a basis of claim against Transportation Company. We seldom find it necessary to do this as our boards stand ordinary handling with smaller danger of breakage. When requested we will furnish in addition to prices at Quarry Station, the cost of transportation to destination.\n\nBy carefully following the instructions on the next page anyone not accustomed to working and handling slate may set the blackboards in a building and make a neat job, as well as prevent chipping the jointed edges, which is possible if boards are moved in and out of spaces when joints are tight against each other. If it becomes necessary to take a board out after it is in place see that it is not touching the next board at joint.\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nSec. Dom. Gov't, Dept.\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn July 28th, we wrote you regarding blackboards, now we are anxious to keep our following up system up-to-date, and would be pleased to know if we have been successful in securing your order. If you have not yet decided we will be pleased to have you consider that we guarantee all of our supplies.\n\nWe are also dealers in school furniture and would be pleased to quote you on request.\n\nIn the past year we have contracted to supply the Toronto Board of Education with over fifty thousand dollars worth of supplies for their schools, and you can readily see that we are growing very rapidly, and this is due to our up-to-date method of transacting business.\n\nTrusting that we may have the pleasure of hearing from you at an early date, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nTORONTO SCHOOL SUPPLY CO.

I have taken the matter up with Mr. Logan, and he says the Department got the material all right, but at the time, he gave the orders, he was so busy that he does not remember whether he had the Departmental orders to get same or not.\n\nMerchants, with whom the Department have been doing business with, since I came here, have thanked me for the quick payment of their bills.

Beatty Company, General Merchants, of Parry Sound, for goods supplied at different periods since the 15th May, 1920, for use at the Shawanaga School and also at the teacher's residence, and in reply I may say it is a matter of regret that the account has been outstanding for such a length of time. It is observed you have informed the above mentioned firm that it is the Department's custom to make prompt payment upon receipt of accounts properly rendered, which accounts should be presented as soon as possible after the goods charged for have been supplied.\n\nIn view of your explanations in this matter, the above mentioned account is being paid, and I may say you will be relied upon to see in future that there is no delay in the presentation of accounts. You should inform the above mentioned firm that they are not to furnish goods chargeable to the Department unless they have authority from you to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to state that after a careful survey, and consultation with the teacher, chief and councilmen of the Shawanaga band, I find that the present school is too small.\n\nIn my forecast of the requirements of this school in April 14th, I was hopeful that by placing three more desks in the building, we might get along for another year. I find that even now the school is crowded when all the children attend.\n\nThe expectations are that when school takes up in September that II new pupils will be on the roll. To meet the requirements I would recommend that an addition be built to the rear of the building 14 by 16, as the ceiling of the present school is too low. I would recommend that it be raised and instead of being \u2014\u2014 I would have it \u2014\u2014 giving more air space at very little cost.\n\nThis building is an old one, but with the improvement and addition, I propose doing with the Department's consent, it would serve to good purpose for the next 20 years.\n\nI have made a rough estimate of the cost of addition and improvements at $1800.00. All labour can be found on the Reserve.\n\nThere is an Indian, Adam Pawie, who, I am told, can do the work.\n\nThere is a little plastering to be done to the teacher's house, and it should be painted outside to preserve it, and inside to make it look clean and attractive.\n\nThis matter should be taken up right away, if the work is to be started when school closes at the end of the term June 30th.\n\nThe teacher's house should be fixed inside before she goes on her holidays.\n\nPlease give this your earnest consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D.

If, however, the band in council will consent to the providing of the amount necessary, from the funds to the credit of their capital held by the Department, we would then be prepared to approve of having the enlargement made to the building. It is noted that you estimate the cost of the addition and improvements to be approximately $1800. You should lay this matter before the council at their next meeting, and impress upon them the importance of providing proper accommodation for school purposes. The council should pass a resolution setting aside the funds necessary for making the addition.\n\nThe repairs to the teacher's house, such as the plastering and painting, can be held over until such time as the work in enlarging the school is carried out, and can be included in the same contract.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Daly\nAgent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary, Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th instant, I beg to say the Department approves of the resolution recently passed by the Parry Island Council to the effect that the roof of the Council House be repaired and the building painted outside, it being understood that the Indians will do the work and that you will see that the expenditure in connection therewith is kept as low as possible.\n\nI am also saying that the outside of the school house may be painted. This work, as well as the work above mentioned, should be done under your careful supervision. You should keep time sheets so as to show the number of hours each man is employed on the work on each building. These time sheets should be made out on labour return forms in duplicate, a supply of which is being sent you under separate cover. You should arrange for the purchase of paint and brushes and submit accounts to the Department. Competitive prices should be obtained before purchases are made.\n\nIn so far as is possible you should be particular to keep the accounts and time sheets for the work on the school and Council House separate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn McDaly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nAnswering yours of May 25th, 22-5-5, I beg to report that the following resolution was passed by the Shawanaga Band:\n\nThat the Department be asked to make a grant for the purpose of an addition to the Shawanaga Indian Day School, and repairs on Teacher's house and that said grant be taken out of the Band funds.\n\nTrusting that this will meet with your approval.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6163, file 428-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 8, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, informing the Department of the resolution passed by the Shewanage Band, that the funds necessary to erect an addition to the school building and repair the teacher's house in connection with the Shawanaga Indian Day School be taken from the funds held by the Department, at the credit of capital account of the Band.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it will be necessary, before authorizing the building of an addition, to obtain further information as to what is proposed to be done. In your letter of May 11th you recommend an addition 14 ft. x 16 ft. to the rear and raising the ceiling of the present building. It is understood that the present school building is 30 ft. x 30 ft. The former agent recommended, in a letter dated June 13, 1922, that an addition 12 ft. x 20 ft. be built and the ceiling raised 2'6\" - the extension to have a cement foundation the same as that of the present building, and he estimated the cost at that time to be about $700. We note that you estimate the cost of the addition and improvements at $1800. If an addition is made, it is considered that it should be extended about 12 or 14 ft. and be the entire width of the building.\n\nI have to request that you will forward a sketch showing the dimensions of the present building and of the addition which you recommend having made. This information is required before we can give the instructions to have the work done. You should state how you would propose heating the building, if enlarged. Also state how you would recommend that the work of erecting the addition be done - whether by contract or by day labour under the supervision of a competent foreman, if necessary. A copy of the resolution passed by the Band, stating the amount authorized by them - which should be sufficient to cover the cost of the extension and repairs - should be forwarded, as it will be necessary to have this resolution to obtain an order in council required to apply the funds of the Band for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJohn M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6163, file 428-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nAcknowledging receipt of yours of June 5th, I have to report that I have been to Shawanaga and measured the school building, the size of which is 26 ft. by 20 ft., and the height is 10 ft.\n\nThe addition could be built cheaper by putting it on the front of the building. The addition is 14 ft. by 20 ft.\n\nIt will be necessary to have a new floor put into the old section as well as the new.\n\nThe present building is on a cement foundation, and of course the extension would have to be carried on a cement foundation 2 ft. 6 in. in height.\n\nThere are no cleak-rooms in the present building, and I am allowing for cleak-rooms in the addition.\n\nThere will have to be a new platform and perhaps built in the improvements, and there must also be a new wood shed, as the one in use is rotten, what there is of it.\n\nBoth outside toilets are in the same condition as the wood shed.\n\nIt will be necessary to fill in all around the school, as in Spring and Fall, the school is surrounded with water, on one side for 20 ft.\n\nThe heating can be done by box stove, same as at present.\n\nThe Band asked that the work be done by their own men, day labour. I have talked the matter over with Adam Pawis, and he seems to me to be quite capable of looking after the rest of the workmen.\n\nI have made arrangements with the Chief, Wesley Jacobs, to keep the time. The wages asked for are 45 cents per hour. The band govern the wages by what is paid in Parry Sound, and Depot Harbour. The men on freight, at Depot, get 46 cents per hour.\n\nI followed the late agent's estimate in the fixing of the school at Lower French, and found him away out in his estimate, and in his idea of what was required to make the building suitable for a school.\n\nWhen I said $1800.00, that was a rough estimate of what was required for the school improvements; and I had in mind, single desks, which are surely required. The desks at present are double desks, and are not conducive to the health of the children. I am told that they are about five years old, and I would strongly recommend that single desks be installed.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6163, file 428-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs near as I can get at it, I think the addition, with painting to school, as well as plastering and painting of school teacher's house that is both buildings outside and inside, as well as wood shed and two toilets, can be done for about $1400.00, as arranged now. I will endeavour to make it less if possible.\n\nThe Department can arrange about the desks as recommended by me. The Band wish to have single desks installed for opening of school in September.\n\nThe resolution passed by the band was as follows:\n\nMoved---- Jenas Kewaykede\n\nSec'd---- Selemen Pawis\n\nThat the Department be asked to furnish, out of the Band funds, sufficient money to pay for addition to school, and fixing of teacher's house.\n\nThere was no stated sum, that being left to the Department, to grant what they thought sufficient.\n\nEnclosed is a rough sketch of building as it is, and as it would appear after the addition. The dotted line shows elevation of ceiling.\n\nTrusting that this is the information which you require.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D.

Requests have been made from time to time to enlarge the building by the erection of an addition. The Band in Council have passed a resolution that sufficient money to pay for the erection of the addition, raising the ceiling of the old building, and for the erection of toilets and a woodshed, be taken from the capital at the credit of the Band in Trust Fund Account #34. The present building is 26' x 20', on a cement foundation, and it is proposed to build an addition 14' x 20' on the front, put new flooring in the old building and raise the ceiling. This enlargement will provide ample accommodation for the children, there being 40 children of school age. The present enrolment is 52, which overcrowds the building.\n\nIt is proposed to do the work of erecting the addition, etc., by Indian day labour, under the foremanship of Adam Pawis, an Indian who is a competent carpenter, and proper time sheets will be kept for the labour employed. Mr. Agent Daly will supervise the work and see that it is performed satisfactorily. The cost of the addition, repairs to present building and the erection of toilets and a woodshed the Agent estimates to be about $1400, and he will endeavour to make it slightly less, if possible.\n\nIf you approve of this work being carried out during the coming summer, it will be necessary to obtain an Order in Council setting aside sufficient funds for the purpose. The amount of capital at the credit of the Band is $8,890.04. I would recommend, in the interests of the Band and as the work would be in the nature of a permanent improvement, that it be carried out during the coming summer.\nOttawa, June 22, 1923.\n\nHis Excellency\nThe Governor General in Council,\n\nThe undersigned begs to report that the Indians of the Shawanaga band have requested that a sufficient expenditure be made from their band funds to add to and repair the school house on their reserve, in the district of Parry Sound, in the province of Ontario.\n\nIt is proposed to carry out the work by the employment of Indians on day labour under the foremanship of a member of the band who is a competent carpenter, and under the supervision of the Indian Agent. It is estimated by the Indian Agent that the cost of the work will amount to $1400.00.\n\nThe undersigned would therefore recommend that authority be given, under Section 89 of the Indian Act, for making the necessary repairs and adding to the Shawanaga school house, at a cost of $1400.00, chargeable to the capital at the credit of the said band, which amounts to $58,890.04.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nThe Board recommend that authority be given under Section 89 of the Indian Act, for the expenditure of the sum of $1400 from the capital at the credit of the Shawangun Band of Indians, which amounts to $58,890.04 the expenditure in question to be used for making the necessary repairs and adding to the School House on their Reserve.\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs reports that it is proposed to carry out the work by the employment of Indians on day labour under the foremanship of a member of the band who is a competent carpenter, and under the supervision of the Indian Agent.\n\nAsst. Clerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, July 24th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo, regarding the building of an addition and the alterations required to the old school building at the Shawanaga Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that an Order in Council has been obtained, which authorizes the expenditure of the sum of $1400, from the capital at the credit of the Shawanaga Band, for the purpose of carrying out this work. You may, therefore, arrange to have the following work proceeded with and completed at as early a date as possible, viz: The building of an addition, 14'x20', on a cement foundation, of sufficient height, to the present building, the laying of a new floor in the old section of the building, the providing of cloakrooms in the addition, the building of a new platform porch, and the painting of the new addition and the old building, as well as any plastering and painting required in the teacher's house. A new sodhouse should be erected, and both outside toilets should be repaired and put in good condition or new ones should be erected. The ground around the school should be filled in and levelled off, in order to prevent water from lying around the building in the spring and fall.\n\nAll the labour required in the building of the addition and in making the above repairs should be carried out by day labour, under the charge of a competent foreman. If you consider that Adam Paris would be competent to oversee the work, he may be engaged as foreman. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept for the labour employed. Wages will be paid at the local prevailing rates. A supply of Return of Labour Forms is enclosed herewith for the keeping of the men's time. The work should be carried out under your supervision and completed to your satisfaction.\n\nYou should purchase the material required and have it delivered at the school. Competitive prices should be obtained, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting you the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost of the material.\n\nThe Department will leave the construction of the addition and the other work in your hands, to make the best arrangements you can, and at the lowest possible cost. The addition to the present building should be completed in accordance with the sketch forwarded by you. All lighting should be on the left of the building, with front lights for cloakrooms. The total expenditure should, if possible, be kept within your estimate of $1400, which is the amount we have been authorized to take from the funds at the credit of the Band. You\n\nJohn M.

(RG 10, Volume 6163, file 428-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nwill be good enough to proceed with the work\nas soon as you can conveniently arrange to do so.\n\nShould you require an advance for the payment\nof labour, you should requisition for the same,\nstating the amount required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nThe members of the Shawanaga Band have made enquiries at this office as to when the extension to the Shawanaga school would start.\n\nWould the Department please inform me what their wish is in the matter of extension to the school.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReplying to yours of July 24-22-5-5\nI have ordered the cement and it will be shipped tomorrow. The other supplies will be shipped by end of next week.\n\nTo facilitate the work, it would be advisable for the Department to forward about $400.00, so that I could pay the men at the end of each week. I think by doing so, I will be enabled to have the job finished in time, and I believe will be able to keep well within the estimate.\n\nTrusting that this will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

This was approved by Order in Council of the 16th of July, 1923, (P.C. 95-1308) and Mr. Agent Daly was authorized to undertake the work by day labour - Indians being employed in the work, under the charge of a competent carpenter. The total expenditure was $1463.11. The Agent purchased all the lumber and other materials required, forwarding accounts in the usual manner, also time sheets for the labour employed. There is nothing on our files to show that any material was left over, and, if so, what disposition was made of same. If you consider it advisable, we could take this matter up with Mr. Agent Daly and obtain a report.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The frames for these would cost about $12.00. The biggest part of this job is getting them put in. The place where they will have to be put is at the part where the old log building joins the new. This will cost from $35.00 to $40.00 for labour in putting these windows in, the cost altogether would be anywhere from $50.00 to $60.00.\n\nI would recommend the purchasing of a new stove next winter, in the meantime we will be able to get along with the loan of the stove from Mr. Kauffman.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, February 27, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding the arrangements made by you for the loan of a stove for the use of the Shawanaga Indian Day School, and also your report regarding the providing of extra lighting facilities for the classroom. It is noted that the stove obtained by you will be satisfactory for the balance of the present winter's use. You should, early next Autumn, bring this matter to the attention of the Department, giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nRelative to the installing of two windows of the size mentioned by you, I beg to say that, if you consider these windows would improve the lighting of the school, the Department will approve of the expenditure required in having them installed. We note that you estimate the cost to be between $50 and $60. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangements you can and at the lowest possible cost. This work should be performed when considered timely by you. After it has been finished to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would therefore recommend that sufficient lumber, nails, spikes, strap hinges, and hasps to make two doors for the toilets and lumber to repair the platform and belfry be purchased. The material and two days work by one man, would be sufficient to cover these repairs. I do not think it would exceed $15.00.\n\nI would recommend that this work be done right away because of the danger of the belfry and platform.\n\nThe consideration of the Department by return mail will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/REK.\nOttawa, October 24, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the condition of the belfry and the platform at the school and also concerning the lack of doors on the toilets at the Shawanaga Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your arranging to have the repairs as mentioned carried out.

This is the amount requested in the estimates submitted by you last fall.\n\nPlease inform the Department how you would advise having this work carried out. Would it be satisfactory for you to purchase materials and have the work done by Indian labour? Would it be necessary to engage the services of a competent foreman-painter to oversee the work?\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nJune 16, 1936,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nSir;\n\nReplying to yours of June 5th, 22-3-2\n22-5-5 and 22-6-5, re painting of schools,- The\nDepartment asks how I would advise that this work\nshould be done.\n\nFrom experience I find that I cannot get a\njob that would be tradesmanlike done by the Indians,\nso I have got in touch with a painter who has been\ndoing work for myself here, and got him to go out\nand look at the Shawanaga School. He will do the\nShawanaga School for the price quoted, $230.00, two\ncoat job and would employ an Indian of the Band while\ndoing the work.\n\nThis is the most satisfactory way to have this\nwork done. He will take on the job of doing the other\ntwo schools, Parry Island and Lower French and employ\nthe Indians to help him while he is doing it. He is\nready to go to work on Monday the 22nd, on Shawanaga\nSchool.\n\nI would strongly recommend that the Department\napprove of this method of doing the painting.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, June 19, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, please let me know the name and address of the painter who has offered to paint the Shawanaga School for $230.00.\n\nWhen you reply, the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nParry Sound Ont.\nJune 20, 1936,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nSir;\n\nReplying to yours of June 19th, 22-5-5 re the party with whom I have arranged to paint the Shawanaga School, I have to state that the person who will have the contract will be Mrs. Wm. Fritsche widow of William Fritsche who died about a month ago and who did a lot of painting for me. The man she is employing is F. Nurnberg.\n\nHe will be finished painting my house on Monday June 22nd, and he has made such a good job that I am anxious for him to do the work on the schools. One of the chief reasons for that is because the Widow of Wm. Fritsche requires the money. Mr. Fritsche was favourable known here in Parry Sound as a painter and artist and I have had him do all my painting when he was alive.\n\nThe merchant from whom Mrs. Fritsche will get the paint is McKinley Hardware Company, and so far as the patronage is concerned both the hardware merchant Mrs. Fritsche and Nurnberg should be on the list.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if the Department would wire me if it is alright to go ahead as I am anxious to get all these schools done while the weather is good and so that I can arrange to have some holidays this year.\n\nI would specially ask that the Department wire me because I am kept busy trying to get the Indians working on the road, and am anxious to get these men started. He would employ one Indian to help him do the painting.\nThe Widow Mrs. William Fritsche is the one who will have the contract.\n\nPlease wire me if it is all right to go ahead as I would like to get him started on Tuesday morning.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nAgent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nThe sum of $230.00 is provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year to paint the exterior of the Shawanaga Indian Day School building and teacher's residence. This school is located on the Shawanaga Reserve, No. 17, Parry Sound Indian Agency (Electoral District of Parry Sound), Ont.\n\nThe local Indian Agent was requested to state if it would be satisfactory for him to purchase materials, from a firm on the approved list, and have the work done by Indian labour. He recommends that the contract be given to Mrs. William Fritsche and states that the man in her employ - F. Nurnberg - will do the work, with one Indian to assist him. He recommends, further, that the paint, oils, etc., be obtained from the McKinley Hardware Company, Parry Sound.\n\nThe Agent is anxious to have this work started as soon as possible, and I should be pleased to be informed if it will be satisfactory to have the painting carried out by Mrs. Fritsche, employing her man, F. Nurnberg, and to purchase the paint, etc., from the McKinley Hardware Company.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nThe sum of $230.00 is provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year to paint the exterior of the Shawanaga Indian Day School building and teacher's residence.

You should arrange for the purchase of the material, paints, oils, etc., from McKinley Hardware Company, Parry Sound. The work can be performed by F. Nurnberg, in the employ of Mrs. Wm. Fritsche. It is understood that one Indian will assist him with the painting. The total cost should be kept within the amount available - viz.: $230. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed.\n\nAfter the work has been finished to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the paint, etc., and returns, in triplicate, for the labour. The number of days or hours employed and the rate paid should be definitely stated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. B. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nThe Secretary  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs,  \nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nSir;\n\nI have to report that in an interview with A. G. Slaght, K.C., M.P. for Parry Sound District, he talked to me about the painting of the Shawanaga Indian Day School and in the course of conversation I explained to him that there are two other schools to paint, one Parry Island and the other Lower French.\n\nWe talked of Widow Wm. Fritsche who has a man by the name of Nurnberg employed to do the painting and I explained to Mr. Slaght that Nurnberg had painted my house and made a good job of it and I was sure that he would make a first class job of the school at the price quoted. Mr. Slaght asked me if it was satisfactory for me to have Mrs. Fritsche get the contract with Nurnberg to do the work for her, and I told him that I was satisfied that we would get a better job done on the schools than has ever been done before. He advised me to go ahead and get the work done as the weather is suitable.\n\nI might explain to the Department that this is the first time I have ever been interviewed by the member for the District in connection with work, and I would appreciate it very much if the Department will advise me that Mrs. Wm. Fritsche can have the contracts for the Schools as follows:\n\nParry Island $200.00  \nLower French $230.00  \nShawanaga $230.00\nI am perfectly satisfied that I can get a good job done for this money. I should state that these schools have been long overdue for painting and I am anxious to see that the best possible job will be done on a two coat job.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if the Department would say if I can go ahead and get the painting done.\n\nThere is a lot of painting being done in this section of the country at the present time and as one of these schools is out of the way I would like to have them all done by the end of August, if possible.\n\nThe consideration of the Department in this matter by return mail if possible, will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, July 15, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, regarding the painting of three Indian Day Schools in the Parry Sound agency, viz.: Shawanaga, Lower French River and Ryerson (Parry Island).\n\nYou were written yesterday, regarding the painting of the exterior of the Shawanaga Indian Day School and teacher's residence.\n\nThe Department will approve of you making the same arrangements for the purchase of materials and for the carrying out of the work at the Lower French and Parry Island Schools as in the case at Shawanega. You should arrange for the purchase of the materials, paints, oils, etc., from the McKinley Hardware Company, Parry Sound, or other firms on the approved list, and the work can be performed by F. Nurnberg, in the employ of Mrs. Wm. Fritsche. It is understood that Indian labour will be utilized to assist Mr. F. Nurnberg in carrying out the work.\n\nI may say that the funds provided for the painting at each of these schools are as follows:\n\n| School            | Amount |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Shawanega         | $230.00|\n| Lower French      | $230.00|\n| Ryerson (Parry Island) | $200.00|\n\nThe total cost of material and labour at each school should not exceed the amount provided. After all work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the paint, etc., and returns, in triplicate, for the labour. The number of days or hours employed and the rate paid should be definitely stated.\n\nIt is noted that the Federal member for the constituency approves of the work being carried out as stated above. The matter of colours of paint and the work to be done for the funds provided will be left in your hands.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nSir;\n\nReplying to yours of July 15th, 22-5-5m re the painting of the Shawanage Indian Day School, teacher's cottage, woodshed, and two toilets, also painting of the Lower French Indian Day School, teachers house, woodshed and two toilets, this work has been completed and the painter is now engaged in painting the Parry Island School.\n\nThis contract was given to Mrs. Wm. Fritsche, but owing to a misunderstanding with Mr. F. Nurnberg, she had to get a painter, Mr. Stewart, to do the work. I am well pleased with the work done and have found Mr. Stewart very satisfactory in this way, that owing to the schools being so long neglected it should have really been a three coat job, and where the work was not quite satisfactory with a two coat job, Mr. Stewart gave it another coat. Mr. Stewart has worked very hard and has certainly tried to do the work satisfactorily and for a two coat job I am satisfied that it will last for a year or two.\n\nThe cheque should be made out to Mrs. Fritsche as all the bills are charged to her. The paint, oils, etc., were purchased from McKinley Hardware Company. There was Indian labour employed at both schools and there will be Indian labour employed at the Parry Island School.\n\nI am enclosing a bill sent by Mr. Stewart as to the time. Mrs. Fritsche is depending on me to make the division of the cheque so that each one will be paid according to the work done. In the case of the Lower French school as this job cost more money, Mr. Stewart advised me that it would not pay him to take the job unless he took an experienced helper with him. I knew this, so I agreed that he should do so. There were three men working at the Lower French School.\nPlease note that I have stated that Mrs. Fritsche is charged with this, and as she has the contract, I would respectfully request that the Department make out a cheque to Mrs. Fritsche and I have promised to help her make the division of it.\n\nI am satisfied with the job done, and would strongly advise that these schools do not be left so long without paint in the future.\n\nAs all parties are in need of the money, I would appreciate it if the two cheques would be sent forward at the earliest opportunity.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/EK.\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, August 27, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to painting of the Shawanaga, Lower French River and Ryerson Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn official letter of July 15th it was specially mentioned that the painting should be performed by F. Nurnberg, whom you stated to be in the employ of Mrs. Wm. Fritsche. As soon as you knew he had not been engaged you should have reported to the Department and awaited further instructions. I am rather surprised at your statement that the painting should last, at least, for a year or two. It is considered that if the work has been properly done it should last a much longer time.\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the voucher which you submitted in favour of Mrs. Fritsche. In view of present regulations, regarding which you have been previously informed, it is difficult to understand why you submitted the voucher in the manner you did. The accounts attached to the voucher are not receipted and, as you must be aware from instructions received, payment cannot be made to Mrs. Fritsche.\n\nThe best way to handle this matter is for you to obtain a detailed tender from Mrs. Fritsche showing the work that she was prepared to do at the Lower French River School for the amount of $230. This tender should be obtained, in triplicate, and attached to the voucher and forwarded for our consideration. If satisfactory, cheque will be issued to her and she can then make payment of the other accounts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\n\nA. F.

I thought that Dr. McGill or Mr. McGoogin when they were here, might mention this when they talked about the repairs to the closets.\n\nAs the school season will soon be over if the Department intends to have this school painted on the inside will they kindly state so, and I could have the work done when we are having the teacher's residence reshingled.\n\nThe consideration of the Department by return mail will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/EK.\nIndian Agent.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, June 17, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the Shawanaga Indian Day School.\n\nNo special appropriation was provided for this school and, before we can decide regarding the painting of the interior, we desire to know the approximate cost of the repairs mentioned in official letter of the 20th ultimo. When replying to that letter, you might also state the cost of painting the interior of the school and teacher's residence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. M.

Clairmont as I am sure we cannot get anything near as cheap as this.\n\nA reply at the earliest convenience of the Department will be very much appreciated as I would like to have this shingling and painting done immediately the school closes. I might draw the attention of the Department to the fact that I have had a very strenuous winter, spring, and summer so far, and I am looking forward to some holidays. If this school work is not done up right away, it will mean that I will not get my holidays until on in the fall as I like to have the work in good shape before I leave the Agency on holidays.\n\nWill the Department please keep this in mind when considering this matter, and that is the reason why I ask that this be considered with as little delay as possible. If I were in your office I could get you to understand the situation in five minutes. This is my only way of explaining. Will the Department be good enough to please understand the situation from this side, as well as the Department's side?\nThe consideration of the Department at their earliest will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, June 23, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, the Department approves the re-shingling of the schoolhouse and lean-to at Shawanaga, at a cost not exceeding $96.75, which amount includes both material and labour.\n\nI regret that, owing to lack of funds, it is not possible to authorize the painting this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Some of these estimates may appear high but the fact is that various repairs which were put off during the war years have accumulated.\n\nThe largest amount is for the Gibson Day School, the bulk of which is for fencing the school grounds and the erection of two new toilets. Authority was granted last year for these toilets to the amount of $112.00. I was unable to proceed with the work last year due to both the shortage of material and labour. I propose, if possible, to have it done this summer but a review of the situation shows the costs to be considerably increased due to prices of both material and labour.\n\nI would be glad to have these costs for the various schools passed if at all possible but should it not be possible to pass on the amounts requested because of non-inclusion in the estimates, you might indicate what amounts would be available for expenditure on the various schools and I will have as much as possible completed this year and the balance next year.
