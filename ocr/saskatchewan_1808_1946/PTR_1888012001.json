The proposed subdivision gives Assiniboin thirteen, Alberta eight, and Saskatchewan only four members, making a total of twenty-five members to be elected to the Local Assembly. The Council also asked for responsible Government. Apparently no division has been made, unless they had decided that Saskatchewan should not be represented at all. We are glad to inform our readers that the member for Lorne stood up against the distribution of seats, and pressed the claims of this district to increased representation, but he stood alone in a Council of twenty and was voted down.\n\nThe people of the Canadian prairies want something more than earth, and the wonder is that they allowed us anything. We do not know what other basis the division was made, certainly not that of population. According to the census returns of 1885, which was the last taken, the total population of the Territories was 48,562, of which Assiniboin had 12,083, Alberta 14,533, and Saskatchewan 14,746, making 41,360 for the number of members to be elected, which would give 1,854 people to each, which would entitle Assiniboin to ten, Alberta nine, and this district six members, which would be a much fairer division. But Saskatchewan had at the time the census was taken a much larger population than that given above; there was no enumeration made of people living in northern and eastern portions of the district\u2014and those numbers probably 3,000\u2014which would entitle us to another representative. If the Government had followed the division suggested by the Council, Assiniboin will have a majority in the house, and will thus be able to set at defiance the wants and wishes of the people of the other two districts. No one district can have more representa-\n\nClearing Sale\n\nBox Stoves\n\nAcme Skates\n\nT. J.

Each section is divided into the possession of one of the prominent local millers, the cars being numbered separately, each other in the destinations, but prove a signal aid to advancement to the city, the miller and the public.\n\nThe Philanthropy train, which leads the procession, goes to St. John's, N.B., where it will be used for an exhibition. The contents of the Philanthropy & Co. section are consigned to London, Eng., by Mr. J. H. Smith, the agent. The wheat, in sacks, is packed in sacks. The Wheat Milling Co., and the Warehouse, Crozier & Co., have been engaged. The train leaves by Sibley Firewood Co., and goes to Philadelphia. As each car was loaded, the wheat was weighed, and the contents named. The first section left the Soo yards at 10 o'clock until the closing of a crowd of people. The cars were loaded at intervals of half an hour.\n\nThe first flour mill in Minneapolis was erected in 1869, and was operated by the milling of the first, which proved so successful that they soon began to grow in the vicinity. The Great Western railway, the Chicago & North Western, and the Chicago & Milwaukee, account for all they manufacture.\n\nThere is something of a contract between the first \"Fourteens\" which left Minneapolis in 1869 and the magnificent train that pulled out from the same yard. In 1872, the Fort Garry was made the headquarters of Winnipeg new stand. The native power, consisting of horses and oxen, was used in the construction of the bridge, and the contractors were French half breeds. The average speed was 20 miles per day, and as the distance was 1,000 miles, the trip took nine days. The half breeds used to come down the river, and then back up the river, which was found to be more convenient than going back to the town. In 1873, a transformer was taken place which was used in the construction of the bridge, and the contractors were Aladdin and his wonderful lamp. That is what makes the departure of the first \"Fourteens\" in 1869 and the last one in 1889 so interesting.\n\nThe Brandon Times of the 5th inst. contains the following:\n\nMany of the citizens of Brandon who got nothing but the young man Mr. John McPherson, who was for years well known as the \"Baker,\" will be glad to learn that at the recent examination held in Brandon, he placed fourth, second, third, and fourth, which his class was examined. This is not the first time that Mr. McPherson has distinguished himself in the school affairs, as a few years ago he carried off the \"Baker's\" prize in the most difficult part of the practical work of making bread.\n\nWhen John McPherson carried off the highest honour at the Provincial competition in 1869, he was a pupil of the Portage la Prairie school, and was taken away by Mr. Smith, Principal of the Public school here. This was the second time that one of Mr. Smith's pupils had been awarded the \"Baker's\" head of all competitors for the \"Baker's\" prize. In 1869, Marion Setzer, one of his pupils, also won the prize. In 1870, he competed that year, outstripped all other competitors and received first prize. In 1880, he again won the prize, and this time he was awarded the honour of getting first, Christabel Setzer second, and Marion Setzer third, and stood fifth. The gold and silver medals of the Winnipeg schools stood only third and fourth. Some twenty or more pupils have been awarded prizes since 1869. This speaks well for the ability of Mr. Smith as an instructor, and the good work done by the children under him. Mr. McPherson is now telling in his higher education. We believe Mr. Smith will be the next to receive the honour of winning the first position in the Manitoba Provincial competition examination, which will take place prior to the Winnipeg Public schools.\n\nThe telegraph line at Goderich was successfully opened on Wednesday evening last, January 1st, and was attended by about twenty-five ladies and gentlemen. After the opening of the line, an announcement, the party adjourned to the house of Com. McPhail, where they partook of the refreshment provided, which was heartily enjoyed.\n\nTHE WOOD BUFFALO.\n\nThe Call says that Ottawa correspondents wired them on Thursday as follows:\n\nThe Government recently received post, telegraph, and telegraph reports from the North-West, and the following statement of the facts regarding the buffalo hunt will be adopted:\n\nM. M. Bell, who visited the district on Friday afternoon, said he had heard for a long time that wood buffalo existed in the Peace River district. He said that inquiries from the Hudson's Bay Co.'s factors had been made here, and a report made by Mr. Campbell, Mr. Macdonald that probably between two and three hundred still existed in that district, and that he believed there were still more. He said that reports had reported that that number existed, and very few of the animals were killed. The government has taken advantage of these factors to secure a good specimen, the hide skeleton and skull of which will be placed in the Manitoba Historical Society. These buffaloes exist in small detached bands. They were once numerous, and extended from the Peace River to the Rockies. About 1869 Alexander Henry, a partner in the Hudson's Bay Company, and now deceased, was told by Indians that there was buffalo in the Athabasca district, and that they inhabited the wooded districts north from that point to the McKenzie, and says that they were different from those found on the plains, and that they were distinct in some of their characteristics from the ordinary plains buffalo.\n\nWHAT PROF. MACDONALD SAYS.\n\nIn his work on Manitoba and the great plains, Prof. Macdonald says:\n\n\"It is doubtful whether the great herds passed constantly from the Peace River to the Peace River, but that at any rate is certain, their homes on those northern prairies, and their range was near the foot hills of the Rocky Mountains. It is also certain that the last buffalo were killed north of the Peace River in 1872, about 1874, and that they were killed between Athabasca and Peace rivers, north of Little Slave Lake. These are also called wood buffalo, and differ only in size from those of the plains.\"\n\nA MILITARY ORDER.\n\nInstructions have been received from the Militia department at Ottawa to hold a meeting of the officers and men of the war medals and clasps, and present them to their respective regiments for the campaign of 1885, and also in return to Ottawa forthwith the certificates of the medals distributed. In future volunteers who took part in the suppression of the rebellion will be entitled to the medal, and those who did not take part in the suppression of the medal, etc., will have to make application to the department at Ottawa. It is really unfortunate that many of the medals and clasps remain on the hands of the commanding officers. The Winnipeg field battery, however, has been very active and enthusiastic. Some of the men who went through that rebellion are in South America, others are in the United States, and others are scattered throughout Europe. The present dimension is not peculiar to the W.F.F., but is common to every regiment which took part in an active service.\n\nWe learn on reliable authority that an American immigrant, named Mr. Smith, was arrested at Moose Lake, by police. It seems that last summer he carried a young Indian woman and in company with her, went north to hunt and trap. Things went well until a short time ago when the young woman returned, saying she had been ill. She said she had been ill for two weeks. They gave her a quantity of styracine and she died. She was buried in her husband's food, completely for the purpose of deceiving the world, and would be murdered put in too large a quantity of the drug and he lasted for several days. He then gave the food to a dog, which died in all the agonies of poison by styracine.\n\nMr. T. S.
