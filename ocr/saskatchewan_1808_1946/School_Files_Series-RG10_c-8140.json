It is noted that Mr. Buck prefers the Precision Housing Company type of prefabricated building and that a competitive tender will result in the obtaining of authority. While we are pleased to know that some progress is being made, it would appear that in making this request several points have been overlooked, namely:\n\n(1) Precision Housing Company's buildings are not prefabricated - they are precut and without a reasonably close estimate of erection costs in each case a comparison of tenders would be of no value.\n\n(2) The time element, if erection is to be carried out this Fall, is of the utmost importance. It is reasonable to suppose that it would take much longer to erect a precut building than a prefabricated building to a point where work could be carried on inside during the winter months. I doubt very much if Superintendent Anfield could arrange for the erection of a precut building to the point where the roof is on at the time available having in mind that he has available a minimum of skilled labour. His proposal is based on the erection of a prefabricated building and if we are to consider a precut building it will be necessary for him to revise his entire proposal.\n(3) Prefabricated Structures quote $9,765.00 f.o.b. factory on a two-room school with attached teacherage including insulation for walls and ceiling, less concrete brickwork, plumbing, wiring, heating equipment and paint. Precision Housing Company previously quoted $24,480.00 f.o.b. Vancouver on a two-room school with teacherage, which price included plumbing, heating and wiring, or if without these facilities deducting $1,800.00, reference my letter of May 18th last and enclosures.\n\n(4) Prefabricated Structures are in a position to make delivery within three weeks of receipt of an order whereas previous experience with Precision Housing Company, reference our negotiations with them for a precut building for office and medical use at Williams Lake, indicates that considerable time is required for the production of working drawings necessary as a preliminary to the setting of material. I doubt whether Precision Housing Co. could give us delivery in three weeks.\n\n(5) You will recall that we received two tenders on the proposed two-room school at Fort Babine, one from National All-Steel Buildings and the other from Precision Housing Co., the latter in the amount of $67,000.00, which should be a fair indication of what it will cost to erect a precut building at any one of the three points in the Skeena River Agency, whereas Mr. Anfield estimates that a prefabricated building can be erected complete for $35,000.00.\n\nIn conclusion may I suggest in view of the number of prefabricated school buildings which have been constructed in B.C., most of which have now been inspected by Mr. Drey and other officials, some cognizance should be taken of the views which they have expressed with regard to the suitability of such buildings. I would recommend that this and previous submissions be used as the basis for recommending purchase of prefabricated two-room schools with teacherages at the earliest possible date and feel that any further delay will necessitate the postponement of our entire school construction program in the Skeena River Agency until next year.\n\nW.S.

It is to be hoped that you will provide an accountable advance to clear up wages incurred to date on preparing these sites. This money will not be lost in any case, as whatever the Department do with regard to type of structure, the work proceeded with will be of value.\n\nWith regard to copy of your letter of October 24th, file 12-11-3-168 to the Department. I agree that unless we can get these buildings up and roofed, work cannot go beyond the concrete stage this year, as the structures will be filled with snow. It is still considered that if the Department will authorize this work to go ahead, roofs, can be put on the buildings at Hartley Bay and Greenville by Year's end. At Kincolith we should be satisfied to get the site excavated and concrete put in. It is considered that the Precision Cut Buildings are out as far as we are concerned. I have had no experience with this type of building and would hesitate to accept responsibility for any construction on a day labour basis. I am satisfied that the Pre-fab Structures are ideal for these three school, and should be used.\n\nF.

Apart from this, it can be stated that the Precision Housing Company do not produce prefabricated buildings; their activities are limited to the pre-cutting of materials for use in more or less standard construction. None of these pre-cut pieces are assembled at the factory and actually all that is saved is the necessity of cutting material at the site and a certain amount of waste. This method of construction could hardly be considered prefabrication. In the case of Prefabricated Structures buildings the walls are assembled in 4', 8' and 12' sections. The roof sections are built up in trusses, windows and doors are already hung in their frames and it is only a matter of fitting the sections together. This method of construction is, in my opinion, prefabrication.\n\nI am prepared to contact Mr. Van Norman on his return to Vancouver if you so desire, but having in mind that ten days will elapse, followed by a further indefinite period before plans and production drawings can be prepared, etc., I think negotiations with Precision Housing Company would be futile at this time, unless we are to postpone school construction in the Skeena River Agency until next year.\n\nPrefabricated Structures have confirmed their quotation of April 12th\n...at and I would ask that I be advised by Army Signals as soon as the necessary Order in Council covering the purchase of three buildings from them, is secured, so that production may be put under way at once. The Company have assured us of delivery within three weeks from receipt of the order or possibly sooner.\n\nW.S.

Anfield who shared our concern at the apparent lack of progress being made. Mr. Anfield, reference his letter of September 2nd attached, feels that the solution to our problem of school construction at these three points is the erection of prefabricated two-room schools similar in construction to the building which has just been erected at Metlakatla. This is the opinion which we have had for some time and as a matter of fact the only reason we have not advanced the opinion previously is that we wished to first determine what response would be received to our advertisement for tenders on the construction of standard school buildings.\n\nYou will note Mr. Anfield's comments regarding the Metlakatla school building and the approval expressed by the Provincial School Inspector. I think it is quite apparent that the prefabricated buildings are suitable structures for school use and obviously erection costs are less. A plan of Prefabricated Structures' two-classroom building with teacherage is attached and I should like to be advised by Army Signals, if possible, if in view of what we consider to be an unsatisfactory response to advertisements for standard school construction, consideration can be given to the erection of\nAIR MAIL\n\nNovember 9th, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S.

I presume that this cement mixer will be used for welfare purposes after it has served its purpose in the building of these schools.\n\nThe draft Submission to Council for the purchase of these three schools from Prefabricated Structures Limited, has been sent to the Minister's office, and we will send an army message immediately the necessary authority is obtained.\nNo doubt you have been in touch with the company and advised them that we expect to order these three buildings in due course.\n\nBFH:ST\n\nBernard F.

These projects are being carried out in accordance with plans and specifications as prepared by Mr. Hargreaves after his visit last year.\n\nI feel that we should ask the Lands and Development Services Branch to have Mr. Hargreaves do another inspection trip and would appreciate hearing from you as to whether he should visit Kuper Island and also as to what other schools require his services.\n\nI think that in this way we can get all our schools thoroughly overhauled insofar as plumbing and heating is concerned.\n\nMr. Kosner will of course do similar work for the electrical repairs required.\n\nBernard F.

I feel that the Welfare Vote could bear more of the cost than indicated by Mr. Arneil but possibly Colonel Jones might wish to be consulted in this regard.\n\nThe main thing is to decide whether this equipment is essential and if so to order it at once.

Anfield, reference his letter of October 3rd and enclosures attached, made a submission for the supply of power equipment for transferring materials from the beaches to the school sites, for excavating, levelling, etc., and although at that time in view of the comparatively large expenditure involved I was somewhat hesitant at recommending his proposal I have since had an opportunity of discussing the matter with him and have carefully investigated the use of the type of equipment requested for the purpose he has in mind and feel that the expenditure is warranted.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Anfield asked for a gasoline driven concrete mixer which we have already supplied and a Model \"MC\" tractor and a Horn-draulic loader with bulldozer blade. We have secured competitive quotations on similar equipment from Pacific Tractor and Equipment Ltd., and A.B. Wing Ltd., both of whom quote on Oliver Model HG.\nThis microfilm is a true copy of original documentation in the Public Archives of Canada. It is provided for research purposes only.

These projects are being carried out in accordance with plans and specifications as prepared by Mr. Hargreaves after his visit last year.\n\nI feel that we should ask the Lands and Development Services Branch to have Mr. Hargreaves do another inspection trip and would appreciate hearing from you as to whether he should visit Kuper Island and also as to what other schools require his services.\n\nI think that in this way we can get all our schools thoroughly overhauled insofar as plumbing and heating is concerned.\n\nMr. Kosner will of course do similar work for the electrical repairs required.\n\nBernard F. Murray,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nPrefabricated Schools - Skeena River Agency.\n\nPlease find hereunder self-explanatory correspondence from Mr. Arneil and from Mr. Anfield concerning the purchase of a tractor with hydraulic loader and bulldozer blade for the erection of the three prefabricated schools in the Skeena Agency.\n\nYou are well acquainted with this region and realize the necessity of having some motive power on the beach if we are to move the supplies up to the school site. I feel that the Welfare Vote could bear more of the cost than indicated by Mr. Arneil but possibly Colonel Jones might wish to be consulted in this regard.\n\nThe main thing is to decide whether this equipment is essential and if so to order it at once. Otherwise we will have to make other arrangements for moving the heavy materials provided up to the school sites.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: School Construction - Skeena River Agency\n\nSince receipt of Mr. Neary's Army Signals message of November 18th advising us of the approval by Order-in-Council of the purchase of three prefabricated schools for erection in the Skeena River Agency we have arranged for the supply of cement, gravel, form lumber, etc., and are assured by Prefabricated Structures Ltd., that the first building will be ready for shipment November 30th.\n\nDuring the course of our correspondence with you in connection with these three construction projects Supt. Anfield, reference his letter of October 3rd and enclosures attached, made a submission for the supply of power equipment for transferring materials from the beaches to the school sites, for excavating, levelling, etc., and although at that time in view of the comparatively large expenditure involved I was somewhat hesitant at recommending his proposal I have since had an opportunity of discussing the matter with him and have carefully investigated the use of the type of equipment requested for the purpose he has in mind and feel that the expenditure is warranted.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Anfield asked for a gasoline driven concrete mixer which we have already supplied and a Model \"MCP\" tractor and a Horn-draulic loader with bulldozer blade. We have secured competitive quotations on similar equipment from Pacific Tractor and Equipment Ltd., and A.B. Wing Ltd., both of whom quote on Oliver Model H6.\ntractors. Actually there is very little difference in the cost of this machine and the John Deere, Model \"N\" but it is felt that the latter is more suitable for our requirements, particularly if we purchase the Model \"N\" tractor with bulldozer blade and belt pulley and the Hydraulic Large Standard Loader with Horn dirt bucket. It is felt that with this equipment all excavating, back-filling and levelling for the three schools can be carried out in addition to which the tractor could move gravel, cement, form lumber, building sections, etc., from a scow at the beach to the school site. The total expenditure involved amounts to something less than $4,000. It is felt that if we divide part of this cost proportionately amongst the three schools to be erected immediately and keep in mind the future use of the equipment in not only the Skeens River but the Babine Agency the expenditure is warranted and as a matter of fact failing this I think it is quite obvious we will have to provide some form of motive power to transport materials from the beaches to the respective school sites. I would suggest and recommend that the cost of the equipment be divided as follows:\n\nLakslap school - $1,000\nKincolith \" - $1,000\nHartley Bay \" - $1,000\nWelfare Vote 515-13 - $969.13\n\nI think the value of such equipment in connection with our housing program for clearing building sites, excavating, etc., is quite apparent and we can reasonably charge the amount above-mentioned to the Housing division of the Welfare Vote.\n\nAs mentioned above the first building will be ready for shipment November 30th and it is considered essential that if the supply of this equipment is approved the order be placed prior to that date for immediate delivery.\n\nWe have prepared a new requisition based on the quotation from Finning Tractor and Equipment Co. Ltd., to whose price we have added Sales Tax which presumably the Department is obliged to pay in this case.\n\n-W.S.

Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAttached please find requisition forms 37A covering equipment as follows:\n\n1 only gas driven concrete mixer at least size 3\u00bd\n1 only model MB tractor with starter, lights, P.T.O. and depth control.\n1 only Hydraulic Large Standard Loader with Horn Bulldozer blade\n\nAttached please find bids on the last two items and a work sheet on the concrete mixer on which we have no prices.\n\nThis equipment is needed urgently in connection with the construction of 3 day schools this winter. With this equipment I believe, we can do a first class job and get these buildings up this winter. In all three villages we are going to have to bring all equipment including gravel and sand by boat. The tractor and loader could be used for handling gravel and sand efficiently and with a stone boat, equipment could be moved to the site. The loader could be used also for excavating and the bulldozer for leveling grounds. It is my frank opinion that we will save the price of this equipment as against hand labour for this type of work, at Greenville, we have to move all equipment from the flota about 600 yards. At Kincolith it is about the same distance whilst at Hartley Bay, it will be about 500 yards up a fairly steep grade. At Hartley Bay there is no motive equipment of any kind. At Kincolith there is an old truck which may last and may not, in any case we plan to use it on a lot of this work. At Greenville there is only an old panel truck.\n\nIf we can get this equipment immediately, we can do the job and I would recommend its purchase with the most urgency. I have competent operators available to run this machinery and believe the obvious saving of labour especially Indian labour fully justifies the expenses involved.\n\nAll this equipment including the cement mixer, will have continual use in this Agency for years. We have, as you know, a huge housing program, and I can keep this equipment busy for a long long time.\n\n/yjm\nF. Earl Anfield, Supt.\nOTTAWA, December 1, 1949\n\nW. S.

Anfield has secured bids on the installation of heating systems in the three prefabricated schools being erected at his Agency but there is such a range in the bids submitted that we feel it would be advisable to have a heating system designed for this particular prefabricated two-room school. These three schools are identical to that erected at Pemberton last year in which the installation was made by Mitchell Brothers Ltd., Vancouver, and as Supt. Gillett has reported most favourably upon it I think it would be advisable for us to secure details and specifications from Mitchell Brothers. This suggestion has been discussed with Mr. Robinson of the engineering staff and he is much in favour of it.\n\nThe cost of designing a system, preparing specifications, working drawings, etc., will amount to approximately $50.00 and we feel that the money would be well spent as we will then be in a position to call for competitive tenders with the knowledge that contractors are all tendering on the same installation. Will you please advise if this suggestion meets with your approval.\n\nW. S.

We had in mind the erection of a number of schools located one and two room schools at various points, but because of certain changes which we have suggested to Prefabricated Structures to the one-room school with teachersage it will not be possible to put this model into production for two or three weeks.\n\nWe have, however, arranged for certain improvements in the way of cupboards, etc., in the two-room model with teachersage and if orders are placed immediately we can take delivery at the plant of three of these buildings before March 31st. The three points at which erection of these two-room prefabricated schools is recommended are Fort Babine, and Moricetown in the Babine Agency, and Chehalis in the New Westminster Agency. In addition to these buildings, we could if you so desire, purchase a prefabricated building for use as a teachersage at Kispiox. The prefabricated building erected for use as a teachersage at Skidegate has been found to be very satisfactory and purchase of an identical model for Kispiox is recommended.\n\nRequisitions for these various buildings are attached hereto in triplicate, together with a quotation from Prefabricated Structures on the classroom buildings.\nand a price list which indicates the cost of the D-1 model recommended for Kispiox.\n\nThe Company, in their quotation on classrooms, mentions that new plans are being prepared and will be forwarded. It should be noted that these are substantially the same as the plan of the building purchased and erected at Pemberton and the changes consist only of the addition of cupboards, bookshelves, etc.\n\nW.

For example, at Ucluelet on the west coast of Vancouver Island, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room school and attached teacher's residence and the lowest tender for standard construction was $42,612. The same school has been built by the Department in Saskatchewan for $29,000. We finally erected a Quonset school at Ucluelet.\n\nTherefore, due to the scarcity of contractors bidding on our projects and the high prices tendered by them, our officials in British Columbia came to the decision that prefabricated schools should be erected on the reserves listed above. Their decision in this regard has been due to the satisfaction obtained from the company which erected a two-room school and teacherage at Pemberton Meadows in the New Westminster Agency and a one-room school at\nNetlakatl in the Skeena River Agency. This company is Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, British Columbia, and I attach photographs of the Pemberton Meadows school taken by Inspector Davy.\n\nWe are now erecting three such prefabricated schools in the Skeena River Agency and our officials in British Columbia have now recommended the purchase of two more such schools and one teacherage. You will be interested in the following comments concerning our prefabricated school at Netlakatl, submitted by Mr. Indian Superintendent Anfield, under whose supervision the present three schools are being erected:\n\n\"I am satisfied that it will wear well, operate economically and that the type of construction is suitable and most adaptable for the type of country in the Skeena Agency. The school has been viewed with considerable approval by the Provincial School Inspector, Mr. J. Shell, at Prince Rupert. It is recommended that two-classroom schools of this type, with teacherages attached, be constructed at Hartley Bay, Greenville and Lincolith, with the least possible delay.\"\n\nMr. Arnall, the Indian Commissioner, feels that these buildings are quite satisfactory and points out that they can be erected at a cost considerably less than we could get through standard construction. He also points out that the erection of these schools will provide employment for the Indians as much of the work involved is ordinary labour.\n\nThe only other company in British Columbia producing schools of this type is Precision Housing Company, which produces pre-cut schools. These are much more difficult to erect with the type of semi-skilled Indian labour we will have available and are, therefore, not recommended by our field officials. We already have in mind a foreman carpenter who would supervise the erection of these prefabricated schools during the coming summer.\n\nTherefore\nTherefore, I would recommend to you the following action:\n\n(a) Approval of the Submission to Council attached hereto covering the purchase of two prefabricated two-room schools with attached teachersages,\n\n(b) Approval from the Minister for the purchase of a teachersage for the Kispiox Reserve at a cost of \u00a32,765. (I attach a requisition for signature by the Minister and passing to the Departmental Purchasing Agent for this latter building).\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa March 17, 1950.\n\nCol. N.,\n\nThe Director has asked me to suggest to you that the following changes be made in the memorandum to the Deputy and the Submission to Council hereunder:\n\nMemo to Deputy - add the third item, namely Klapiox teacherage, to the heading.\n\nSubmission to Council\n\n- The Vote (Indian Education) does not appear to be mentioned and Council will not pass on it unless the number or name of the Vote is mentioned. In this instance the vote will have to be named.\n\nWould it not be preferable to change the wording 'on the basis of' to 'Prefabricated Structures Ltd., Vancouver, B.C. has offered to supply two prefabricated two-room schools with attached teachers' residences for the sum of $10,475.00 each, f.o.b. Vancouver, plus additional charges for freight, erection supervisor's wages, fare and expenses, estimated at approximately ............\n\nNote: Mr. Cory's advice to me has been that a limit has to be set on the amount that will be expended for unknown amounts. He has told me that a Submission without this information will not be passed.\n\nThe last paragraph of the Submission should ask for authority to expend a sum not exceeding ............ in the purchase of two prefabricated buildings at a cost of $10,475.00 each plus freight, erection supervisor's wages, fare and expenses.\n\nAnd as the Submission has to be retyped it might be as well to change the words 'a pressing emergency' to 'of pressing emergency'.\n\nM.

Davey, Inspector of Education at the Indian Commissioner's Office in Vancouver.\n\nMr. Davey and I have discussed the possibility of my professional services being retained by your Department in the construction of small schools for Indians students, particularly at Labine Lake. We have made the suggestion that transportable units be used and have shown the Inspector sketch drawings based on this proposal. It would appear that Mr. Davey considers that the idea has some merit but before discussing the matter at greater length he wished to have it referred to you for your approval and views.\n\nIn view of the difficulty of obtaining skilled labour in the far North and the short duration of the building season, it seems logical to consider the possibility of pre-fabricating a good percentage of the buildings. This type of building would be flexible and could be added to reduced in capacity according to the population demands of the particular locality. There would also be the added advantage of being able to write-off the cost of the construction within 10 to 15 years at little cost should the policy of your Department change with respect to your Indian charges.\n\nAs regards my personal history, I would say that I am a returned man with seven and one half years service overseas in the Royal Canadian Engineers - one year of which was spent on attachment to the Department of External Affairs (Immigration) at Sackville Street, London working with Mr. Cottsworthy. I am fully qualified as an Architect and hold an American Town Planning qualification. I am at present engaged on work for the British Columbia Electric Railway Co., the City of New Westminster and the Burnaby School Board. For the latter Client, I am building a Primary School and two Junior High Schools.\nI would add that I am known to the Department of Public Works at Ottawa and was recently named in an Order in Council for the Customs and Immigration Building at Douglas, B.C.\n\nI trust that this suggestion will receive favourable consideration and that you will sanction my proceeding further with this important development.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Kenneth J. Sandbrook)\nMINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n\nOTTAWA, March 17th, 1950.\n\nTO: The Director of Indian Affairs\n\nFOR:\n\nPreparation of reply for signature of...\n\nDiscussion with...\n\nPerusal and necessary action...\n\nReport...\n\nIt will be in order to give the Willow Agencies, 1614 West Broadway, Vancouver, B.C., an opportunity to tender for school supplies and equipment for Indian schools in British Columbia.\n\nMajor McKay:\n\nFor necessary action.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\n\n20-3-50\n\nfor Private Secretary\nMarch 21, 1950.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSchool Supplies\n\nWe have received a memorandum from the Minister's office indicating that it will be in order to give Willow Agencies, ISA West Broadway, Vancouver, B.C., an opportunity to tender for school supplies and equipment for your Indian schools.\n\nBernard Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nDEPT. OF CITIZENSHIP & IMMIGRATION\nOTTAWA\nONT.\n\nREFERENCE MY SIGNAL AND LETTER DATED FEBRUARY 24th RE\n1950-51 SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM CAN YOU ADVISE IF\nPURCHASE OF FOUR PREFABRICATED BUILDINGS APPROVED.\n\nW.S. ARNEIL\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER FOR B.C.\n\ncc: Department\n\n1-1-5BC\nPemberton Meadows\nIndian School\n(Prefabricated)\nThis same school recommended for\nHartley Bay\nKamloops\nLakeview\nAlso\nChilcotin\nMountains\nOttawa, 15 March, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nMorissetown Indian Day School\nChehalis Indian Day School\nKisplox Teacherage\n\nIncluded in our Main Estimates for 1950-51 are the following three projects in the Province of British Columbia:\n\nMorissetown - Babine Agency - two-room school/residence - $35,000.\nChehalis - New Westminster Agency - two-room school/residence - $35,000.\nKisplox - Babine Agency - teacherage - $10,000.\n\nWhereas in other provinces we have met with considerable success in our day school building programs, such has not been the case in British Columbia. For example, at Ucluelet on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room school and attached teachers' residence and the lowest tender for standard construction was $42,612. The same school has been built by the Department in Saskatchewan for $29,000. We finally erected a quonset school at Ucluelet.\n\nTherefore, due to the scarcity of contractors bidding on our projects and the high prices tendered by them, our officials in British Columbia came to the conclusion that prefabricated schools should be erected on the reserves listed above. Their decision in this regard has been due to the satisfaction obtained from the company which erected a two-room school and teacherage at Pemberton Meadows in the New Westminster Agency and a one-room school at\nMetlakatla in the Skeena River Agency. This company is Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, British Columbia, and I attach photographs of the Pemberton Meadows school taken by Inspector Davy.\n\nWe are now erecting three such prefabricated schools in the Skeena River Agency and our officials in British Columbia have now recommended the purchase of two more such schools and one teachersage. You will be interested in the following comments concerning our prefabricated school at Metlakatla, submitted by Mr. Indian Superintendent Anfield, under whose supervision the present three schools are being erected:\n\n\"I am satisfied that it will wear well, operate economically and that the type of construction is suitable and most adaptable for the type of country in the Skeena Agency. The school has been viewed with considerable approval by the Provincial School Inspector, Mr. J. Shell, at Prince Rupert. It is recommended that two-classroom schools of this type, with teachersages attached, be constructed at Hartley Bay, Greenville and Kincolith, with the least possible delay.\"\n\nMr. Arnell, the Indian Commissioner, feels that these buildings are quite satisfactory and points out that they can be erected at a cost considerably less than we could get through standard construction. He also points out that the erection of these schools will provide employment for the Indians as much of the work involved is ordinary labour.\n\nThe only other company in British Columbia producing schools of this type is Precision Housing Company, which produces pre-cut schools. These are much more difficult to erect with the type of semi-skilled Indian labour we will have available and are, therefore, not recommended by our field officials. We already have in mind a foreman carpenter who would supervise the erection of these prefabricated schools during the coming summer.\n\n- Therefore\nTherefore, I would recommend to you the following action:\n\n(a) Approval of the Submission to Council attached hereto covering the purchase of two prefabricated two-room schools with attached teachersages,\n\n(b) Approval from the Minister for the purchase of a teachersage for the Kispiox Reserve at a cost of $2,764. (I attach a requisition for signature by the Minister and passing to the Departmental Purchasing Agent for this latter building).\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: School Furniture\n\nIn accordance with my recent telephone conversation with Mr. Neary, orders have been placed for school furniture in the following amounts to be supplied to the schools indicated:\n\nSkeena River Agency--\n\nKitselas Day School 95.60\nGitlakdamix \" 378.20\nKincolith \" 462.40\nGwinaha \" 95.60\nKitkatla \" 462.40\nHartley Bay 40.00\n$1534.20 1534.20\n\nKamloops Agency--\n\nKamloops Residential School 386.64\n199.26\n477.90\n$1063.80 1063.80\n\nKwawkewlth Agency--\n\nAlert Bay Day School 450.00\n450.00\n351.50\n351.50\n370.00\n298.00\nMamalilikulla (Village Island) $2266.00 2266.00\n$4854.00\nDelivery of all the orders listed will be made before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nIt will be noted that the total value of these purchases is just under $5000.00.\n\nW.S.

Hon. C.D. Howe, Minister of Trade and Commerce, announced today. Priority ratings will cease to have any effect after March 31.\n\nTo facilitate the procurement of equipment, materials and supplied by Canadian industries, and for the effective prosecution of World War II, the Priorities Branch was established in the Department of Munitions and Supply early in 1940. During the war, and for the reconversion period which followed, the Branch cooperated closely with the War Production Board and the Civilian Production Administration of the United States Government.\n\nIn 1946, a formal system of priority ratings was established to channel building materials required for the construction of housing and other projects essential to the national economy. These included military hospitals, military health and occupational centres, and other military establishments.\n\nPrimarily designed to meet the needs of veterans, the policy was broadened in March, 1949 to include civilian homes not exceeding a cost of $10,000. Ratings were assigned to individuals or their contractors where it was established that the house would be legally owned and occupied by the applicant. Included in the authorizations were the units built under the Veterans' Land Act and programs sponsored by Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, such as Veterans' Rental Housing, Integrated Housing, N.H.A. Control Sales Price dwellings and the Inter-Service Married Quarters program for the Department of National Defence.\n\nDuring operations from 1946 to date, priority ratings were granted for the construction of 105,691 homes.\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nDEPT.

O R R,\n\nMETTAGAMI: - To assist in the erection of school building with rooms attached for living accommodation of teacher -\n\nThere are 25 children of school age. In the erection of a building, the Indians have agreed to do a great deal of the work, themselves, voluntarily, and they propose that a log building be erected, but lumber for flooring, windows, doors and certain other material will have to be supplied. This school is in the Chapleau Agency, and Mr. Agent Godfrey would, no doubt, be able to arrange for a suitable site. He would also arrange with the Indians to do the greater part of the labour. It might be necessary to use the services of a white foreman.\n\nThe Anglican Missionary for the district reports that the Indians, themselves, state a log building for school purposes would be satisfactory and that, as they will do a great part of the labour, voluntarily, the amount above stated would be sufficient to carry out the work.\n\nThis reserve is situated 17 miles north of the village of Gogama, on the C. N. R.\n\nFunds for the purpose, to the above amount, are included in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1935-36.\nFebruary 6, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ORR,-\n\nCornwall Island East New school building with teacher's living quarters - $4,500.\n\nThe above amount is provided in the Estimates, 1935-36, for the erection of a new school building, with teacher's living quarters, on the east end of Cornwall Island. The building will require to accommodate 40 children. There should be small cloak-rooms for boys and girls. It would also be necessary to include outside toilets - one for boys and one for girls. The school building will require living accommodation for the teacher.\n\nRegarding a site, at a meeting of the Council, on December 3, 1934, in a resolution requesting the establishment of the school, it was stated that the property for a site would be donated by Peter Day or Jake Francis. It would require approximately one acre - minimum amount 3/4 acre, and it should be level, with good drainage; and, as it will also be necessary to have a well for water purposes, same should be obtained at a reasonable depth.\n\nIf you require any further information, I would be pleased to either furnish or obtain same. I understood, from our conversation yesterday, that you would make arrangements for a suitable site.\nFebruary 6, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ORR,-\n\nWikwemikong: Addition to new school building, to provide increased living accommodation for teachers - $1,000.\n\nThe teacher and pupils moved into the new school building on December first, last. There are two teachers, and the accommodation provided for living quarters is inadequate. At the rear of the building, a very narrow part is partitioned off for living quarters, which gives insufficient accommodation. It will be necessary to alter the building. It will be possible to obtain certain material from the old school building, which is to be demolished. I would request you to make the necessary arrangements for the building of the addition. Funds for the purpose are provided in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1935-36.\n\nP. S. - It is intended to demolish the old school building which was built for residential school purposes, but, for the last number of years, only part of it was occupied for two classrooms and living quarters for the teachers of the day school. There is, no doubt, a quantity of material which would be of use, some of which might be utilized in the building of the addition to the new school and teacher's living quarters and the balance, sold or disposed of to the Indians. I would request that you arrange, also, for the taking down of this old building, the levelling of the site and the disposal of the materials.\nFebruary 7, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ORR,-\n\nRabbit Island - To erect school building with teacher's living quarters - $4,000.\n\nThe above amount is provided in the Estimates, 1935-36, for the erection of a new school building, with teacher's living quarters, at the Rabbit Island Settlement, 4 miles from the village of Wikwemikong, on the Manitoulin Island Unceded Reserve. The building will require to accommodate 34 children. There should be small cloak-rooms for boys and girls. It will be necessary, also, to provide outside toilets, one for boys and one for girls.\n\nRegarding a site, Mr. Agent Lewis has been requested to give the matter consideration and choose a site that will be central to meet the requirements of the Indian children who will attend. He was also instructed to see that the site chosen is level, dry, permits of good drainage and that it be approximately one acre in extent.\nFebruary 7, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. ORR,-\n\nSagamook - To erect a school building with teacher's living quarters - $4,000.\n\nThe above amount is provided in the Estimates, 1935-36, for the erection of a new school building, on a site central to meet the requirements of the Indian children. It will be necessary to provide classroom accommodation for 30 children and also to provide living accommodation for the teacher. Outside toilets will also have to be provided - one for boys and one for girls.\n\nThe old school building is to be torn down, and there would be a quantity of lumber which would be useful in the erection of the new building. No doubt, the Indians would do part of the labour, voluntarily. I understand the Agent and the local Missionary have selected a suitable location for the new school building, and it may be necessary to obtain title to same.\nFebruary 7, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ORR,\n\nCHRISTIAN ISLAND R. C. - To erect new school building with teacher's living quarters for R. C. Indian children - $6,000.\n\nThe above amount is provided in the Estimates, 1935-36, for the erection of a new school building for the Catholic Indian children on the Christian Island reserve. The building will require classroom accommodation for 30 children, and further, living quarters should be provided for the teacher. Outside toilets would also be required - one for boys and one for girls.\n\nNo doubt, Indian labour could be utilized to a large extent in the work of erecting the building.\n\nNo arrangements for a suitable site have yet been made. The Indian Agent could, no doubt, obtain the consent of the Band to provide a site, of approximately one acre, that would be level and with good drainage.\nFebruary 8, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. ORR,-\n\nWhite Bears (Moose Mountain Agency)\n\nTo erect two-roomed school building with living quarters for two teachers - $8,000.\n\nThe above amount is provided in the Estimates, 1935-36, to erect a two-roomed day school building to provide classroom accommodation for 75 children and living quarters for two teachers. Each classroom should provide seating accommodation for approximately 36 children.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain a site, centrally located, making it possible to have approximately 80% of the children reside within one mile and very few at a greater distance. The site selected should be dry, level and with water supply available. It would require approximately 1/2 to 2 acres for buildings and playground.\n\nBesides the school building, it would be necessary to erect toilets and a woodshed. Mr. Agent Ostronder would arrange for the obtaining of the site.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Living quarters for teacher will not be required. Further particulars as to type and size of building will be found on file hereunder.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain a suitable site. In this connection see letter dated September 5, 1933, from Assistant Indian Commissioner Perry, on this file.\n\nThe Department is anxious that this building be completed and ready for school purposes at the beginning of the academic year, September first, 1935.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Agent Moore states there are 28 children of school age, who have never attended any school. The Indians have agreed to get out logs and put up the building, if the Department would assist with supplying materials for roof, windows, doors and flooring. The Agent states that the sum of $200 would be the maximum required. If Agent Moore was authorized to incur the above expenditure in the purchase of the building materials, he would, no doubt, be able to arrange with the Indians for the erection of the building.\nFebruary 13, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. O R R;-\n\nFort Grahame: - To complete building for summer day school purposes $100.00\n\nFort Grahame is located in the northern part of the Stuart Lake agency. Agent Moore reports there are 47 children of school age at this point, the majority of whom have never attended school. A request has been made by the Roman Catholic missionary and the Agent, that a summer school be conducted. There is a church building at this point, which, the Agent states, could be improved at much lower cost than erecting a new building. He estimates that, for the sum of $100 building material could be supplied to fit up the church building which would provide suitable accommodation for school purposes for a number of years.\n\nI would suggest that, when funds are available, the Agent be authorized to purchase building material, at a cost not exceeding the above amount, forwarding detailed accounts, in triplicate. It is understood that the labour will be performed by the Indians, without cost to the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoor Copy\nMud Lake, Ont. - To erect two-roomed day school building on the Mud Lake Reserve, No. 35 (Federal District of Peterboro West), each classroom to accommodate 36 children.

I have already reported on the situation at Montreal Lake and further reports regarding the Day Schools in that Diocese which I visited on this trip will be forwarded in due course. There are some matters of general interest which the Bishop brought to my attention and I beg to advise you of.\n\nPrevious to the present economic depression provision was made for a simple mid-day meal for the Indian children attending day schools. This is a question which I have already brought to the attention of the Department many times. I quite agree with his Lordship with regard to the good effect on the general health of the children as well as on the attendance at the school which this meal has had. I informed his Lordship that in the first instance it was not the intention of the Department to provide a regular meal at mid-day, but provision was made whereby the ingredients for a bowl of nourishing soup was provided. This privilege in some instances was abused with the result that a full meal was provided. I find that in many instances the teachers with the assistance of the Indians have been continuing to provide a warm bowl of soup. I am quite sure that the cost of this special nourishment would not in the aggregate amount to a great deal if properly controlled and would be of great benefit to our Indian children.\n\nThe Bishop also brought to my attention that he had received complaints from teachers that the Department no longer provides soap or towelling for the day schools. Where a teacher takes an interest in the cleanliness of the pupils, I understand he has provided this equipment himself. I do not feel that our teachers should be called upon to do this, as their salaries are not large, yet cleanliness should be observed in our classrooms.\n\nThere is another matter which I did not feel I had any interest in, but the Bishop suggested that our department might co-operate in bringing about and this is the question of superannuation for teachers. The Department of Education for the Province of Saskatchewan is making provision for a non-contributory scheme of superannuation for its teachers, but no provision is made in the Act for teachers in day schools of the Indian Department. These teachers are not recognized as permanent Civil Servants.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nmanent Civil Servants and so no provision is made for pensions for their old age. A teacher moving from a white school to an Indian school in the Province of Saskatchewan forfeits the benefits of his superannuation for the period of service in the Indian school and during that period he is not permitted to contribute to the Teachers Superannuation Fund. It appears to me that, as our schools are now being regularly inspected by Provincial School Inspectors and our teachers capabilities are to a large extent judged by the Inspector and the fact that they hold certificates from the Province, it would not be unreasonable to permit them to contribute to the superannuation provided by the Province. Personally, I feel that the Bishop's attitude in this question is very fair and I promised him that I would bring this question to your attention/my report.\n\nHis Lordship also suggested that, if the method of appointing teachers in vogue in the public schools were adopted by the Department when engaging teachers in our Indian day schools, it would not only be an incentive for the teacher to put forth his best efforts to make the work a success, but it would make it an easy matter to release the teacher if his work were found not to be satisfactory. The trustees of our public schools engage a teacher for a certain term. If at the end of the term, the teacher's services are not considered satisfactory he is not re-engaged, and he understands that his continuance depends altogether on the success of his work and the satisfactory report of his Inspector. I feel that the Bishop's suggestion might be worthy of consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan\nOttawa, March 9, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 300-11 of the 27th ultimo, reporting a conversation you had with His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, concerning matters affecting the Indian day schools in his diocese.\n\nWith reference to the providing of midday meals to the children attending the day schools, an adequate quantity of biscuits is granted each school and, in addition, other supplies are furnished upon application, in so far as funds available for the purpose permit. As explained by you to His Lordship, it is not the intention of the Department to provide a regular meal at midday. If the teachers will forward a requisition, through their local agents, for the supplies required to serve soup, as favourable consideration as possible will be given to authorizing the necessary expenditure for the purchase of the supplies. The Department is well aware of the value of serving a hot lunch, consisting of soup, to the pupils at midday, but we must be guided by the funds at our disposal in deciding on the provisions that can be supplied.\n\nRegarding the supplying of soap and towelling for the day schools, I have to say that a reasonable quantity of these articles is allowed, upon requisitions received through the local Indian agents. The difficulty to overcome is in connection with the washing and care of the towels and the danger of infection by the pupils using each other's towels. However, a reasonable quantity of towelling will be supplied upon request.\n\nRelative to the superannuation of teachers, I would state that teachers at Indian residential schools are not employees of the Department. They are engaged by the Rev. Principal or the church authorities who are directly responsible for the management of the particular institution.\n\nTeachers of Indian day schools are classed as temporary civil servants and, as such, do not come under the Superannuation Act for permanent employees of the Federal Government. From the information available, while some teachers give many years' service at Indian day schools, the average length of employment does not exceed four years.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nexceed four years. After the present Act respecting Superannuation of teachers in the province of Saskatchewan, assented to April 10, 1930, this Department communicated with the Provincial Department of Education, regarding an amendment to their Act, to include teachers in Indian schools. No satisfactory arrangement resulted.\n\nRegarding the appointment of teachers and dispensing with their services when unsatisfactory, I would say that the Department has authority to approve or disapprove the nomination of a teacher by the church authorities and also to dispense with their services when unsatisfactory. It is thought that teachers in our Indian day schools, even if nominated by the church authorities, would understand that the continuance of their services would depend altogether on the success of their work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Commissioner at the following rates:\u2014\n\nQu'Appelle $115.00\nRegina 120.00\nBattleford 140.00\nHigh River 130.00\n\nFor this consideration the management shall agree to conform to the rules of

may at any time inspect and report upon the Institutions.\n\nPayment to be made only for children authorised by the Commissioner to be admitted, and in accordance with the scale now governing payments to Schools under the per capita system, which may be altered from time to time to suit circumstances, and no children, white or Indian, are to be admitted save under authority of the Commissioner.\n\nThe Minister deems it desirable to put this system into operation after a reasonable time is given to the Church Authorities, and he recommends that the 1st of July, 1893, be fixed as the date upon which the per capita allowance shall commence to payable.\n\nThe Committee submit the above for Your Excellency's approval.\n\nSgd.\nJohn J. McGee\nClerk Privy Council.\nOrder in Council 22nd October, 1892.\n\nIndian Affairs:\n\nOn a Report dated 17th of October, 1892, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs stating that it is advisable to make a change in the manner of carrying on those Industrial Schools in the North West that are wholly supported by the Government. The cost of these Institutions is larger, it is thought, than that for which they might be conducted, and with a view to more economical management, it is deemed advisable and necessary, to adopt some method which would relieve the pressure of present expenditure, and at the same time keep the schools to an equal standard of efficiency and usefulness.\n\nThe Minister considers that when the whole cost of an Institution is directly borne by the Government, the same economy by those in charge is not used as would be employed under other conditions; demands under the present system are frequently made for articles and supplies, whereas if the amount to be expended were to take the form more of an annual per capita grant, more effort in the way of economizing would be made.\n\nThe Minister states that the actual cost to the Government, as shown under the head of Industrial Schools, does not meet the total expenditure which the present system entails, as there is a small expense in the purchasing and inspection of goods to be added.\n\nThe accounts for the past year (1890-91) show that the per capita cost of each child at the Industrial Schools under Qu'Appelle was:\n\nQu'Appelle ------------ $134.67\nBattleford ------------ 175.45\nHigh River ------------ 185.55\n\nIt is thought, is higher than it would be if a revised system of economy were exercised, and that the best way to effect the desired decrease would be to place the schools under a per capita grant system similar to that now in operation at Kichener and St. Paul's under Church of England authorities, St. Boniface and Kootenay under the Roman Catholic Church authorities. The per capita system under which these schools are operated by the religious bodies has been found to work satisfactorily.\n\nThe Minister therefore recommends that the following be applied to the Industrial Schools in operation in the North West Territories.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. A.B. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General\n\nRecently my attention was called to the attached Order in Council dated October 22nd, 1892, respecting the Government's policy in connection with expenditures relating to Indian Residential Schools.\n\nWhile this Order in Council was passed a number of years ago, it is understood that no amending Orders have been issued since; therefore it is still in force.\n\nIt is realized of course that at the time this Order in Council was passed most, if not all, of the Residential Schools belonged to the different Churches or Church organizations, and that since then most of the schools have been taken over by the Government. Only a few in the North, I understand, still belong to the Churches.\n\nThe financial assistance rendered the Church-owned schools in recent years has included repairs to buildings (material and labour), purchase of laundry, lighting and farming equipment, also grants or contributions towards the salaries of night watchmen.\n\nAs this Order in Council has not been observed for many years and the fact that it has not been observed may some day be questioned, it would appear to be desirable to anticipate any possible criticism in the future by obtaining an Order in Council to meet present day conditions and dealing with the essentials, leaving the application to the discretion of The Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury\n\nNCA/AEB\nMemorandum\n\nFebruary 27, 1936.\n\nDr. McGill,\nDeputy Supt.

The new schools are modern in every respect and are equipped to provide an educational program designed to meet the needs of the children in the areas to which they are established.\n\nProgressive attempts have been made to bring the educational policy into closer conformity with the actual needs of the children, with special emphasis on manual training and vocational instruction. Residential schools are now equipped to provide worthwhile instruction in such subjects as carpentry, boat-building, tailoring, dressmaking, cooking, handloom weaving and physical culture.\nEstimated Cost of Indian Day Schools - Vote 168 - $56,000.00\n\nI.

You will remember that an amount of $56,000.00 was transferred to your Branch for this purpose.\n\nPlease let me have, as soon as possible, a statement showing the cost of each school already constructed, also the estimated cost of each school still under construction.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 19, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIn the event of funds being provided for a special building programme during the summer of 1939 the following new buildings required in connection with the Training Service of this Branch might receive consideration:\n\n1. Sandy Bay Indian residential school (Province of Manitoba) -- Alterations and Repairs .......$ 15,000.00\n   (This building was erected many years ago and alterations and repairs are urgently required.)\n\n2. Alberni Indian residential school (Province of British Columbia) -- New building ..........$ 150,000.00\n   (This building was destroyed by fire on February 21, 1937. The authorities of the United Church of Canada have repeatedly urged since that time that it be rebuilt. In the event of a new building being erected at Alberni it would be possible to close the present Indian residential school located at Ahousaht, B.C.)\n\n3. Caughnawaga teachers' residence .........$ 25,000.00\n   (When the Sisters of St. Anne were first placed in charge of the Caughnawaga R.C. school in 1917 a residence was purchased. From time to time it has been necessary to make additions to this building as the staff increased. At the present time there are 16 Sisters engaged at this school and residing in the residence. In addition they have 3 or 4 Sisters employed to look after the necessary\nwork at the residence. The present building is totally inadequate for the number now living in it and a new residence should be provided.\n\n4.

It was not found possible to include any of the above in our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 20, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nAs a result of a conference held in Mr. Jackson's office on the afternoon of February 17, I submit amended statement showing the amounts required for the construction of Indian day schools in the event of a special building programme being provided:\n\n1. Sucker Creek, Ontario ............... $6,500.00\n2. Bloodvein (R.C.), Manitoba .......... 4,000.00\n3. Little Grand Rapids, Manitoba ...... 5,000.00\n4.

Massett, British Columbia .......... 4,000.00\n9. Aiyansh, British Columbia .......... 6,000.00\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, March 8, 1939.\n\nDear Dr. Fletcher:\n\nMr. Jackson has asked me to secure, if I can, certain figures relating to the cost of constructing public schools.\n\nWe have made provision in the estimates of this year for the construction of 20 Indian day schools and at least one residential school. It is the policy of the Department to construct schools with full basement accommodation and with equipment necessary for a worthwhile vocational or manual training programme. At most of our day schools provision is made for teacher's residence, but in the case of our schools the residence usually forms part of the main building. We have not at any time built separate teachers' cottages since I entered the Department. I am anxious to know if you could let me have figures indicating the cost in Manitoba of erecting one, two, three and four room schools with full basement accommodation in each case.\n\nIf I remember correctly, the Department prepared plans and placed these at the disposal of local trustees from time to time. Would it be possible to secure plans for one and two room schools with full basement accommodation? This Branch will be glad to pay the usual charge for such plans.\n\nI am aware, of course, that schools in Manitoba are usually built by local trustees and that\n\nyou may -\n\nRobert Fletcher, Esq., LL.D.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Education,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nyou may experience some difficulty in securing the figures I am seeking and I do not want you to go to too much trouble. You might however secure from the Inspectors figures indicating the cost of schools in the eastern section of the province.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 17, 1939.\n\nChief Treasury Officer,\n\nAt a meeting held yesterday authority was given for the inclusion of the following items in the Ordinary and Special Supplementary Estimates.

A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe are today mailing you a copy of a four-room plan with full basement, half of which can be used as an auditorium or as two classrooms. At Deloraine where this plan was used they fixed the basement up as an auditorium. Later their school was burned and they transformed the auditorium into two classrooms simply by putting a partition and cloakrooms in. The ventilating and lighting were provided for at the time the building was erected.\n\nThere will be no charge in connection with these plans. We are very glad to be of assistance to you in this way.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister of Education.\n\nCKR/RM.\nOttawa, April 8, 1929.\n\nDear Dr. Fletcher:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo and also the plan for a four-room school, which reached me in due course.\n\nI appreciate very much indeed the kindness that prompted you to send forward this plan.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. R. Fletcher,\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nLIGHTING RECOMMENDATION FOR STANDARD SCHOOL CLASSROOM\n\nThe standard school classroom has approximately the following dimensions:\n\nLength 30'-32'   Width 23'-24'   Ceiling Height 12'-12'6\"\n\nThe seating area in this classroom will have approximately these dimensions:\n\nLength 20'-22'   Width 17'\n\nThe important blackboard area will be at the front of the room and will be approximately 18' long.\n\nThe lighting of this classroom should be divided into two separate sections under the following headings:\n\n(1) General Lighting:\n\n4 Holophane No. C-5540 ceiling type Correctalite units. Using 300 watt Medium Base 6\" Light Centre clear Mazda lamps. Calculated initial illumination at desk level -- 25 to 25 foot candles average. Outlets to be located as shown in Figure 1.\n\n(2) Blackboard Lighting:\n\n5 Holophane No. H-790-2 Blackboard lighting units. Using two 150 watt clear Mazda lamps per unit. Calculated initial illumination 35 - 45 foot candles average. Units to be installed as shown in Figure 1. For installation details on other ceiling heights see Figure 3 and Figure 4.\n\nThe preceding recommendations are the result of a careful investigation of the problem of classroom lighting. By locating the general lighting units with reference to the seating area rather than the whole room area the wattage per square foot is actually increased in spite of the fact that, to light the whole room area, six units of equal wattage would be required instead of four. It is necessary to point out that this result cannot be obtained unless a lighting unit of suitable distribution such as Holophane No. C-5540 is used.\n\nNOTE - 250 watt 6\" L.C. and 200 watt clear Mazda lamps may be used in No. C-5540 without accessories.\nThe position of the outlets is very important. The four fixtures are placed over and located in relation to the seating area. Being mounted close to the ceiling, they are removed almost entirely from the line of vision of all the pupils. Especially important is the fact that there are no hanging fixtures at the front of the room. (See Fig. 2). When fixtures are located at the front of the classroom they are constantly in the line of vision of the majority of the pupils. Holophane Semi-Direct lighting units are the most efficient type of lighting equipment available for this use. They will produce:\n\n(a) A maximum of useful illumination on the work from the current consumed.\n\n(b) They do not depend on wall and ceiling conditions for results, thus reducing decorating costs to a minimum.\n\n(c) Temporary depreciation due to an accumulation of dust in the fixture is very low and there can be no permanent depreciation to any Holophane glassware.\n\nIt is a safe rule that no general lighting fixtures should be hung within twelve feet of the front blackboard; in the case of indirect and semi-indirect fixtures because the light flux from the front ceiling and upper wall over the board interfere with blackboard vision; and in the case of diffusing, direct and semi-direct fixtures because the primary light sources themselves are within the undesirable angles of vision.\n\nIt has been definitely proven that proper blackboard lighting is as important as good general lighting in classrooms. Tests conducted with adults, whose eyes have matured, have shown conclusively that the time required to copy unfamiliar material from the board can be cut in half when proper lighting equipment is used.\n\nThe Holophane No. H-790-2 Blackboard lighting unit has been scientifically designed to produce uniform high intensity illumination on the blackboard. This high intensity light is obtained from a unit on the ceiling out of the line of vision of teacher and pupils so that no discomfort can be caused by brightness. The Holophane blackboard unit is the only unit for this purpose which has effectively overcome the daylight glare which sometimes makes it impossible for pupils looking toward the windows to see the board.\n\nA comparison of the various types of classroom lighting which can be proposed is given on sheet #2 attached. A study of this chart indicates the following savings in dollars with lighting improvements through the use of the Holophane system:\n\n1. Lower decorating costs\n2. Higher illumination between painting and decorating periods\n3. Lower cleaning costs\n4. Higher illumination between fixture cleaning periods\n5. Lower operating costs for current and lamps\n6. Higher illumination at reduced wattage\n7. Three to five times as much vertical illumination on the blackboard.\n\nDimensions on Figures 1 and 2 are for Room 25' x 32' and a ceiling height of 12'6\" only. For other room sizes use data in Figures 3 and 4.\n### MOUNTING DETAILS FOR HOLOPHANE UNITS\n\n**NO.H-790-2 and NO.H-790-2P**\n\n**NOTE** -- Always mount unit with wiring trough toward blackboard.\n\n| TYPE OF LIGHTING SYSTEM | NO.

Moore,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe recall the interest you showed in lighting at the time of your visit to this Lighting Institute. (Our Visitors Book gives the date of that occasion as April 4th, 1938.)\n\nDr. D. L. Maclean is of the opinion that your interest in lighting is still very much alive and that you would like to receive any new lighting data we may have.\n\nThe Lighting Recommendation for School Classrooms attached strikes a new note of economy combined with high footcandles. In these days when almost all lighting Engineers recommend six 500 watt lamps, or higher, per classroom, to obtain adequate seeing ability for the students, a suggestion that four 200 watt lamps is enough, if well founded, deserves attention; don't you think so?\n\nCertainly the taxpayer looks with favour on the maintenance costs for 800 watts as compared to 3000 watts!\n\nWe hope that you will give the attached data careful reading.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nTHE HOLOPHANE COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nP.S. We have two new books \"Ein-Bilt Lighting\", and \"Street Lighting\".\nMr. Hoey,\n\nIf this is of any interest or use to you, you may keep it.\n\nThis company is recognized to be a foremost authority on non-plant scientific lighting.\n\nP.S.M.\nApril 27, 1939.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT the estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40, Vote No. 168, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources, provide an amount of $24,575.00 for the purchase and maintenance of equipment, repairs and improvements for the following church-owned Indian Residential Schools:\n\n(a) ONTARIO\n   Fort George Roman Catholic Residential School\n   Fort George Church of England Residential School\n\n(b) ONTARIO\n   Fort William Roman Catholic Residential School\n   Moose Fort Church of England Residential School\n   Spanish Roman Catholic Residential School\n\n(c) MANITOBA\n   Cross Lake Roman Catholic Residential School\n\n(d) SASKATCHEWAN\n   Thunderchild Roman Catholic Residential School\n\n(e) ALBERTA\n   Ermineskin Roman Catholic Residential School\n   Grouard Roman Catholic Residential School\n   Holy Angels Roman Catholic Residential School\n   Jeussard Roman Catholic Residential School\n   Sturgeon Lake Roman Catholic Residential School\n   Vermillion Roman Catholic Residential School\n   Wabasca Roman Catholic Residential School\n   Wabasca Church of England Residential School\n   Whitefish Lake Church of England Residential School\n   Youville (St. Albert) Roman Catholic Residential School\n\n(f) NORTHERN TERRITORIES\n   Akivik Roman Catholic Residential School\n   Akivik Church of England Residential School\n   Fort Resolution Roman Catholic Residential School\n   Providence Mission Roman Catholic Residential School\n\nBritish Columbia -\n(s) BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nAhousaht United Church Residential School\nCariboo Roman Catholic Residential School\nChristie Roman Catholic Residential School\nKitamaat United Church Residential School\nPort Simpson United Church Residential School\nSquamish Roman Catholic Residential School\nSt. Mary's Mission Roman Catholic Residential School\n\n(h) YUKON\n\nSt. Paul's Hostel Church of England Indian Residential School.\n\nTHAT, as these buildings are church-owned, the purchase and maintenance of equipment, repairs and improvements constitute a grant and, therefore, the approval of Your Excellency in Council is desirable.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that approval be given for the expenditure at the above-mentioned Indian Residential Schools of the sum of thirty-four thousand five hundred and seventy-five dollars ($34,575.00), same to be chargeable to Vote Number 162, 1938-45, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nApril 27, 1939.\n\nPRECIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL\n\nApproval for the expenditure of the sum of $34,575.00 for the purchase and maintenance of equipment, chairs and improvements for the following church-owned Indian Residential Schools: Fort George R.C. and Fort George C.E.

A similar Order-in-Council was secured last year - see P.C. 881, April 25, 1938.\n\nDirector.\nMay 25, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe - Funds for construction of Indian Schools.\n\nAt the present time, plans and specifications are completed and we are ready to call for tenders on seven Indian Schools to be constructed by contract. In addition, we have done considerable work on the plans for five or six other schools but final action cannot be taken on these, pending further information that your Branch wishes to obtain regarding them.\n\nWe cannot, however, issue tender calls until funds are made available for the construction of these schools, and I would greatly appreciate anything you can do to facilitate making the necessary funds available to us.\n\nDirector.\nMay 22, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe - Travelling expenses on Indian Affairs Branch work, etc.\n\nConfirming our telephone conversation of the 16th instant, I am outlining herewith a suggested procedure in connection with engineering inspections and handling of work, etc., for your Branch so that our respective officers will have a similar understanding in handling work and expenditure.\n\nIt is understood that your Branch will be shortly transferring to us, for travelling expenses, the following amounts:-\n\n$1,500 from Agency Votes,\n$1,000 from School Votes.\n\nIt is our understanding that the above funds will be utilized by this Branch as follows:-\n\n(a) To cover actual travelling expenses of our engineering staff when engaged on work for which funds have been transferred from your Branch for the undertaking of specific projects.\n\n(b) To cover actual travelling expenses of our engineering staff who might be giving engineering advice to your officers or agents in connection with work they are performing and which is not being undertaken by this Branch.\nTo cover actual travelling expenses of our engineering staff in making engineering inspections or investigations for your Branch in connection with projects which do not involve immediate work expenditure.\n\nIn cases where engineering advice or information is required from this Branch but where the Indian Agent is actually undertaking the work, we will give such information and advice as is required but the Indian Agent will be responsible for the handling of the expenditure, including paylists, payments of accounts, etc.\n\nIn cases where the size of the project justifies a transfer of funds to this Branch our Engineer will of course be responsible for the handling of funds and the accounting therefor, including preparation of paylists and the payments of wages and accounts for materials.\n\nOccasionally, border-line cases might arise where the expenditure involved is not large enough to warrant a Treasury Board transfer but where, owing to the nature of the work, you would prefer it to be directly handled by our Engineer rather than by your Indian Agent. In such cases we would be glad if you would forward the advance cheque to his office for transmission, with appropriate instructions, to the Engineer concerned. The latter will then account for the expenditure in the usual way.\n\nIt is understood that in this fiscal year certain Schools may be constructed under the direction of your Indian Agent. In such case, we will be glad to supply plans as required and have our engineering or architectural staff make such inspections as you may desire. Our officers on such work would not certify, however, to any of the accounts covering expenditure made.\n\nWould you kindly give the above suggestions your consideration and let me know if you think they will meet your requirements and will be satisfactory to you.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMay 30, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nPlease arrange to transfer to the Surveys & Engineering Branch from Vote 162 (76) the following amounts:\n\n1.

We have numerous requests for repairs and improvements at other Indian schools and any amount not required for new buildings can be used for this purpose. There is still sufficient time before the winter sets in to have these repairs done, and it is for this reason that this Branch is requesting you to cooperate with us by returning the money which will not be needed for the new day schools shown above.\n\nDirector.\nSeptember 12, 1939.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT it is found necessary to make certain amendments in P. C. 40/1628 of June 24, 1939, and that the following transfers of funds be authorized:\n\n1. That an amount of $1,150.00 be transferred from the sum provided for the Wabasca Roman Catholic Residential School to the Vermilion Roman Catholic Residential School;\n\n2. That the amount of $900.00 be transferred from the unallotted sum of $5,000.00 to the Ermineskin Roman Catholic Residential School;\n\n3. That the amount of $300.00 be transferred from the sum provided for the Aklavik Church of England Residential School to the Thunderchild Roman Catholic Residential School.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, September 13, 1939.\n\nPRECIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL:\n\nApproval for the transfer of funds included in P.C. 40/1898 of June 24, 1939, for the purchase and maintenance of equipment, repairs and improvements at church-owned Indian Residential Schools - $1,150.00 from the Wabasso Roman Catholic School to the Vermillion Roman Catholic School; $800.00 from the unallotted sum to the Ermineskin Roman Catholic School and $500.00 from the Akwatin Church of England School to the Thunderchild Roman Catholic School.\nOttawa, September 13, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nThere are five Indian residential schools in the diocese of Grouard, Alberta, and for these the following amounts were provided in the current year's appropriations:\n\n- Grouard: $2,200.00\n- Joussard: $2,000.00\n- Sturgeon Lake: $1,500.00\n- Vermilion: $500.00\n- Wabasca R. C.: $3,000.00\n\nAs there was a very serious shortage of water at the Grouard, Joussard, Sturgeon Lake and Vermilion Residential Schools, the Surveys and Engineering Branch were requested to report on what was required and their recommendations were subsequently approved by the Honourable the Minister. The estimated expenditure for the new water supply at Vermilion is $1,650.00, but only $500.00 was actually provided. However, at the Wabasca R. C. School $5,000.00 was provided and so far only $1,149.75 has been expended. It is, therefore, our desire to transfer from the amount provided for the Wabasca Roman Catholic School sufficient funds to make up the balance required at the Vermilion School. This explains the first item in the attached memorandum to Council.\n\nThe second item in the memorandum is to provide additional funds from the unallotted portion of our appropriation in order to pay an account of $900.00 as a grant towards a new plumbing system installed in the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. In connection with this -\nthis expenditure, I would refer you to my memorandum of May 31, 1939, which was approved by the Honourable the Minister.\n\nP.C. 40/1628 of June 24, 1939, mentions $800.00 as the amount available for expenditure at the Thunderchild School and $500.00 as the amount at the Aklavik Church of England School. Actually, in the preparation of our appropriation for the current fiscal year, $1,100 was provided at Thunderchild and $200.00 at Aklavik. The third item, therefore, of the attached memorandum to Council covers the transfer of $300.00 from the Aklavik Church of England School to the Thunderchild Roman Catholic School.\n\nDirector.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPP\n\nA.

THAT an amount of $700.00 be transferred from the sum provided for the Wabasee Roman Catholic Residential School to the Jousseard Residential School;\n\n2. THAT an amount of $356.00 be transferred from the sum provided for the Grouard Roman Catholic Residential School to the Jousseard Residential School.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nActing Minister of Mines and Resources.\nNovember 8, 1939.\n\nPRECEIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL:\n\nApproval for the transfer of funds included in P.C. 40/1939 of June 24, 1939, for the purchase and maintenance of equipment, repairs and improvements at Church-owned Indian Residential Schools -- $700.00 from the Neahasca Roman Catholic School to the Joussard Roman Catholic School; $935.00 from the Grouard Roman Catholic School to the Joussard Roman Catholic School.\nOttawa,\nNovember 8, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nThere are five Indian residential schools in the Diocese of Grouard, Alberta, and for these the following amounts were provided in the current year's appropriation:\n\n- Grouard: $3200.00\n- Joussard: $2000.00\n- Sturgeon Lake: $1500.00\n- Vermilion: $500.00\n- Wabasca R.C.: $3000.00\n\nAs there was a very serious shortage of water at the Grouard, Joussard, Sturgeon Lake and Vermilion residential schools the Surveys & Engineering Branch were requested to report on what was required and their recommendations were subsequently approved by the Minister.\n\nItem No. 1 in P.C. 45/3029 approved transfer of funds in connection with the water supply at the Vermilion Indian residential school. In this connection I would refer you to my memorandum of September 13, 1939.\n\nA report just received from the Surveys & Engineering Branch states that an amount of $2700.00 is required to complete the water system at the Joussard Indian residential school. As there is only $1064.00 still available from the amount provided specifically for this school it will be necessary to transfer from\nthe Wabasca and Grouard schools sufficient funds to provide for the expenditure that is necessary.\n\nIn view of the above the attached Memorandum to Council is enclosed.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nOttawa, November 21, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIt is my understanding that representations will be made to the Minister by the church authorities at an early date for the construction of Indian residential schools at the following points:\n\n1. Albany (R.C.) James Bay agency, Ontario,\n2. Carcross (C.E.) Yukon Territory,\n3. Wabasso (C.E.) Lesser Slave Lake agency, Alberta,\n4. Whitefish Lake (C.E.) \" \" \" \" ,\n5. Fort Chipewyan, (R.C.) Athabasca agency, \"\n6. Sturgeon Lake (R.C.) Lesser Slave Lake agency, Alberta.\n\nThe Albany school, with a pupil enrolment of 80, was totally destroyed by fire on August 22, 1939. This was the only residential school on the west coast of James Bay and drew pupils from an area in which there are approximately 800 Roman Catholic Indians.\n\nThe church authorities propose that this school be rebuilt and that the new building, which they estimate will cost $100,000, be of fireproof construction throughout. They suggest that payment be made to them in a period of two years or, if this is impossible, that the payments be divided over a three year period. The new school, if constructed, would have accommodation for 100 pupils.\n\nThe Carcross (C.E.) school, with an enrolment of 40 pupils, was destroyed by fire on April 17, 1939. This was the only residential school in the Yukon Territory and served -\nand served an Indian population of 1356, all of whom, with the exception of 15, are Anglicans.\n\nIt is proposed by the representatives of the Anglican church that the school at Carcross be rebuilt and that log construction with asbestos lining in the interior be used throughout. If provision is made for the construction of separate and distinct buildings for the regular classrooms and the dormitories, the estimated cost is $80,000. The pupils enrolled at the Carcross school at the time of the fire are now receiving instruction in a number of dilapidated shacks that have been repaired and made fit for temporary use, in the hope that a new building would be provided next year.\n\nThere are at present at Babascan and Whitefish Lake two comparatively small residential schools, operated by the Anglican Church. The total enrolment of these schools at this date is 65. It is my understanding that these schools were originally built by the Anglican Church without cost to the Government.\n\nI have been assured by Dr. Westgate on a number of occasions that these schools are wholly unfit for educational purposes, as both are in an insanitary condition and constitute a great fire hazard and should not be utilized as residential schools.\n\nThere is at the present time at Fort Chipewyan a residential school with an enrolment of 40, operated by the Catholic Church in the diocese of Bishop Breymat. During the last six years His Lordship has constantly brought to the attention of the Department the claims of this district for a new school. In this connection I refer to my memorandum to you dated October 30, 1929. It is estimated by the officials of the Survey and Engineering Branch that the construction of a fireproof school at this point, capable of accommodating 100 pupils, would cost approximately $150,000.\n\nAt Sturgeon -\nAt Sturgeon Lake there is a church-owned residential school with an enrolment of 90 pupils. There are 353 Indians, all of whom belong to the Roman Catholic Church, in the Sturgeon Lake area. Bishop Langlois has intimated to us that this building is urgently in need of replacement. However, I have not secured figures with respect to the exact cost of a fire-proof school at Sturgeon Lake.\n\nIt is important in my judgment that these requests from the church authorities for residential schools be carefully reviewed at an early date and a decision reached in respect to the extent of our building program for the fiscal year 1940-41, while the estimates of this Branch are still under consideration.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\nMINES AND RESOURCES:\n\nThe Board recommend that Order in Council of June 24th, 1939, P.C. 40/1628, be amended as follows:\n\n1. That an amount of $700.00 be transferred from the sum provided for the Wabasca Roman Catholic Residential School to the Joussard Residential School.\n\n2. That an amount of $936.00 be transferred from the sum provided for the Grouard Roman Catholic Residential School to the Joussard Residential School.\n\nAsst.

A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMarch 4, 1940.\n\nPRECIS:\n\nApproval for the transfer of funds included in P.C. 40/1828 of June 24, 1939; and P.C. 26/3854 of November 28, 1939, for the purchase and maintenance of equipment, repairs and improvements at Church-owned Indian Residential Schools as follows: $1,219.51 from the Joussard School to the Grouard School; $8.40 from the Joussard School to the Sturgeon Lake School; $728.85 from the Joussard School to the Vermilion School; $1,946.75 to the Wabasso Roman Catholic School from the unallotted amount of $5,000.00.\nOttawa,\nMarch 1, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nThe attached Memorandum to Council covers necessary transfer of funds in connection with the digging of wells and providing equipment for same at Grouard, Joussard, Sturgeon Lake and Vermillion Indian Residential Schools in the Diocese of Grouard, Alberta.\n\nThis work was carried out by the school management under the direction of an engineer from the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nDue to conditions that occurred during the digging of the wells it was necessary to expend more at one or two of the schools than originally intended and at some of them the expenditure was less than the first estimate. In this connection I might refer you to my memoranda of September 13, 1939, and November 8, 1939.\n\nA memorandum dated February 27, 1940, from the Director of the Surveys & Engineering Branch indicates that the work has been satisfactorily completed at Grouard, Joussard and Vermillion and that the work at Sturgeon Lake will be completed by the end of March.\n\nIn order to pay the accounts it is necessary to transfer funds as mentioned in the first three paragraphs of the attached Memorandum to Council. With regard to the recommended transfer of $1,946.72\nfrom the unallotted amount included in P.C. 40/1628 of June 24, 1939, to the Wabasea Roman Catholic Residential School I may say that this covers the cost of the erection of a carpenter and blacksmith shop to be used for vocational training purposes. Memoranda from the Purchasing Agent dated February 2 and February 17, 1939, dealt with the method to be followed in purchasing the materials required.\n\nFunds for the above purpose were included in the appropriation for the current fiscal year but some months ago when it was found that more money was required to meet the cost of the new wells funds were transferred from Wabasea to the other schools.\n\nAs there are funds available in the unallotted amount included in P.C. 40/1628 of June 24, 1939, it is considered advisable to transfer sufficient funds to pay the cost of the new carpenter and blacksmith shop which will give an opportunity for vocational training for the boys attending this school.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nFebruary 29, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nMr. C.H. Buck, our Senior Architect, is leaving on the 2nd instant to make inspections of various building projects in the West and which will include the following Schools constructed or under construction for your Branch:\n\nSandy Bay Residential School, Manitoba.\nCross Lake Residential School, Manitoba.\nAlberni Residential School, British Columbia.\nIndian Residential School proposed to be converted into hospital at Coqualeetza, British Columbia.\nDay School at Bella Bella, British Columbia.\n\nWhile the School inspections, together with other inspections Mr. Buck has to make, will fully occupy him for the time available, I would be very glad to know if there is any other important project connected with your Branch that you consider he should look into at the same time.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of February 28 in which you advise that the senior architect, Mr. C. H. Buck, left on March 2 to make inspection of the various building projects in the West.\n\nIf at all possible it would be appreciated if you would arrange to have Mr. Buck visit the Round Lake Indian Residential School. This school is situated near Stockholm, Sask., and is a very old building. Recent reports indicate that the plumbing and electrical systems require rather extensive repairing. Under these circumstances we would like to have a report from Mr. Buck regarding the building stating whether or not he considers it advisable to expend any large amount of money in repairing it.\n\nIn the event of Mr. Buck's finding it possible to visit Round Lake he should proceed to Broadview, Sask., where our Agent, Mr. E.A.M. McKenzie, resides. It would be advisable for him to notify Mr. McKenzie two or three days before he reaches Broadview and Mr. McKenzie will arrange to meet him and drive him to the Round Lake School.\n\nDirector.\nMarch 6, 1940.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE ADMINISTRATOR IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT it is found necessary to make certain amendments to P.C. 40/1939 of June 24, 1939, and that the following transfers be authorized:\n\n1. THAT an amount of $356.00 be transferred from the sum provided for the Fort Resolution Roman Catholic Indian Residential School to the Aklavik Roman Catholic Indian Residential School;\n\n2. THAT an amount of $30.00 be transferred from the sum provided for the Fort Resolution Roman Catholic Indian Residential School to the Providence Mission Roman Catholic Indian Residential School.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nActing Minister of Mines and Resources.\nMarch 6, 1940.\n\nPRECIS:\n\nApproval for the transfer of funds included in P.C. 40/1939 of June 24, 1939, for the purchase and maintenance of equipment, repairs and improvements at Church-owned Indian Residential Schools -- $384.00 from the Fort Resolution School to the Aklavit School; $30.00 from the Fort Resolution School to the Providence Mission School.\nOttawa,\nMarch 6, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nP.C. 40/1628 of June 24, 1939, approved payment of the under-mentioned amounts which have been provided in the current year's appropriation for the schools mentioned:\n\nAklavik R.C. Residential School ... $700.00\nFort Resolution \" \" \" \" \" \" 700.00\nProvidence Mission \" \" \" \" \" \" 2500.00\nTotal ... $4000.00\n\nAll of the above-mentioned schools are in the Diocese of Most Reverend G. Breymat, O.S.B., Archbishop of Edmonton, and his Bursar has submitted for payment an account of $1024.00 covering the cost of a Kelvinator unit purchased by the Archdiocese from the Somerville Company, Edmonton, Alberta, for use at the Aklavik R.C. Residential School. In submitting this account the Bursar writes in part as follows:\n\n\"We know that the amounts appropriated for the Providence Mission will be all required for the payment of the electrical installation at the school there.\n\n\"We have no special equipment or repairs at the Fort Resolution Indian School that would justify spending the amounts voted for that school.\n\n\"On the other hand, we feel confident that your Department will give favourable consideration to the amount spent at the Indian School of Aklavik for a...\"\nkelvinator unit bought on August 22nd last at the price of $1,024, as per receipted invoices enclosed herewith.\n\n\"We are aware that the purchase of this material should have been done through your purchasing branch. Nevertheless, as you will realize from the enclosed letter of the Somerville Co., we felt that there was no other means for our school to have this equipment before freeze-up than to buy it according to the quotations given by the Somerville Company.\n\n\"Your branch knows how far distant from the railway Aklavik is located. Consequently, we could not take the risk of having this necessary equipment delayed for another year owing to the time required for correspondence between your purchasing department and our office and the number of weeks required for transportation.\n\n\"We hope that with the $700 voted for Aklavik and the $324 taken out of the Fort Resolution appropriation, you will have no difficulty in refunding us for the expenses incurred at Aklavik this year.\n\n\"Kindly have the cheque in settlement of this account addressed to the R.C. Episcopal Corporation of MacKenzie, c/o Banque Canadienne Nationale, Edmonton, Alberta.\"\n\nI recommend that favourable consideration be given to payment of this account and in order to do so I enclose Memorandum to Council authorizing transfer of $324.00 from the amount provided for the Fort Resolution Residential School to the Aklavik R.C. Residential School, also an amount of $30.00 to the Providence Mission Residential School. The reason for the transfer of the latter amount is explained in another memorandum of concurrent date.\n\nPP\n\nDirector.\nCERTIFIED TO BE A TRUE COPY OF A MINUTE OF A MEETING OF THE TREASURY BOARD, APPROVED BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE ADMINISTRATOR IN COUNCIL, ON THE 19TH MARCH, 1940.\n\nPRIVY COUNCIL CANADA.\n\nMINES AND RESOURCES:\n\nThe Board had under consideration a memorandum from the Honourable the Acting Minister of Mines and Resources reporting:\n\n\"That it is found necessary to make certain amendments to P.C. 40/1828 of June 24, 1939 and P.C. 26/3854 of November 28, 1939, and that the following transfers of funds be authorized:\n\n1.

A similar Order-in-Council was secured last year; see P.C. 40/1939, June 24, 1939.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, June 1, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIn response to your request, I am sending forward herewith a memorandum, relating to the operation of Indian residential schools, prepared by the Superintendent of Welfare and Training.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\nOttawa, May 31, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL\n\nIn view of the national crisis in which we find ourselves and the desire on our part to conserve to the utmost extent possible the appropriations available for Indian education, I am of the opinion that a careful review should be undertaken of the number and condition of our residential schools and the best ways and means whereby the cost of their operation can be kept within reasonable bounds without unduly impairing the Government's investment in these institutions - an investment at this date of approximately ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00).\n\nI should state that there has not been at our disposal at any time since I entered the Department the funds necessary to undertake the repairs required at a majority of our residential schools. The decision, therefore, to pay our per capita grants this year on the basis of 85% of the maximum pupilage allowed at each school, coupled with a reduction of the amount available for repairs, purchase of equipment, etc., may not be the best policy to pursue even in a critical period such as the present. I am suggesting, therefore, that it might be more desirable to consider the advisability of closing a number of government-owned and church-owned schools, that are at this date in a somewhat dilapidated condition and which have become acute fire hazards. Before submitting a list of these schools, however, may I refer to the condition of our residential schools, generally. I have no hesitation in stating that the faulty construction of a great many of these schools has imposed upon those responsible for their repair and operation burdens that should never have been imposed, had the original construction conformed to the usual standards of construction recognized as the minimum standards in the construction of public buildings, particularly institutions for the education of children, the hospitalization of the sick, etc. A few examples will illustrate and emphasize the thought I have in mind:\n\nSHUBENACADIE, (R. C.) Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia.\n\nThis school, which was completed in 1929, at a cost of $153,000.00, has an enrolment at this date of 160 pupils. Dr. Robertson, in his report on the Maritime Provinces, states:\n\n\"Shubenacadie Boarding School -\n\n\"This school is beautifully located and is of brick construction, just across the river from Shubenacadie. On the inside of all the walls of\nthis school there is evidence of a leaking condition, due to the heavy rain and wind storms coming from the south and east. This condition is most noticeable on the east and south walls; on these walls the plaster is badly stained and constantly falling off in many places. This condition, it should be noted, has existed ever since the construction of the building and is believed by the Principal to be due to the brick being porous.\n\nA somewhat similar condition exists at the ALERT BAY (C. E.) Residential School, Kwakwakwaht agency, British Columbia. This school was built in the year 1931 at a cost of $148,000.00.\n\nMr. J. C. McLean, of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, in a report on this building dated September 21, 1936, states:\n\n\"The brick work in this building, I must say, is very porous and unevenly laid, and worst of all, the mortar was mixed with very coarse sand and little cement, which makes the joints of the brick very porous and undoubtedly allows the moisture to penetrate. The work recently done on these walls has been of some benefit, although I consider the clear waterproofing used has not been heavy enough and would therefore recommend waterproofing paint of not less than three coats, on the south and east walls in particular, coupled with careful inspection of all pit-holes and open joints in brick, which should be pointed before painting, and that this be done as early as possible next year, weather permitting. In so doing I consider you may save the metal laths and plaster on the interior of these two walls. The brick throughout the whole building is very unevenly laid and forms small ledges that hold the water which when the wind is blowing will eventually seep through the walls.\"\n\nThe repairing of these walls - the work is only partially completed at this date - has cost us over $3,000.\n\nBIRTLE (Presbyterian) Birtle, Manitoba\n\nThis school was built in the year 1931 at a cost of $120,000.00.\n\nAlthough this is a comparatively new building, heavy expenditures have been necessary in recent years. For example we spent $1,800 on the repainting of the water line in the fiscal year 1933-40. The foundations of this school, which is said to be of fireproof construction, have sunk badly within the last two or three years, with the result that large cracks have appeared in the\nin the classrooms and in the dormitories. It is exceedingly difficult to know just what action should be taken in an attempt to repair these cracks, which, I understand, have become very wide. Inspector Hamilton has suggested that the cracks be filled with a pitch mixture and that the floors themselves be covered with Battleship linoleum. However, we have never had the money at our disposal to supply this linoleum or to undertake these repairs.\n\nCECILIA JEFFREY (Presbyterian) Kenora, Ont.\n\nThis school was built in the year 1923 at a cost of $80,045.00. The present enrolment is 145 pupils.\n\nIt has been necessary to undertake costly repairs at this school within the last year or two. The sewage disposal plant has been reconstructed, but we have not been able to undertake other repairs that appear necessary to the main building. The Secretary of the Women's Missionary Society informs me that a committee, representing their Society, visited the building recently and that the north wall appears to be buckling. She attributes this to faulty eaves troughing and to the fact that the rain has been permitted to run down the walls.\n\nST. GEORGE'S (Church of England) Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nThis school, with an enrolment of 160 pupils, was built in 1928, at a cost of $130,000.\n\nWhen I visited British Columbia in the spring of 1938, I was informed by the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia that the roof of this school had shown a tendency to leak. He expressed surprise that a flat roof of concrete construction should show this weakness so soon after the erection of the building. He expressed the hope that the necessary repairs could be undertaken without cost to the Department. A new roof, he intimated, would prove very costly.\n\nIn the construction of this building, the baths and toilet facilities were so placed that the pupils could not make use of them without endangering their health\u2014at least, so it was alleged by the Commissioner. The work of reconstructing these facilities was undertaken and completed at a cost of $4,330.00 in the year 1938. No action has been taken, however, in respect to the roof repairs.\n\nIn striking contrast to these schools and a number of others that might be mentioned, we have the case of the KUPER ISLAND (Roman Catholic) School, Cordova agency, British Columbia, built in 1915 at a cost of $60,000.00. The enrolment at this date is 100 pupils. I visited this school in June, 1928, and made a thorough inspection\u2014\ninspection of the buildings, grounds, etc. The Kuper Island school is, in my judgment, one of the best constructed public buildings I ever visited. The construction appeared almost perfect throughout and the repairs at this school since it was built have been almost negligible.\n\nIn addition to the repairs necessary at the above noted schools and a number of others, there has been an acute water shortage at a large number of our schools since I entered the Department. An attempt has been made during the last three years to install adequate water supply systems at the following schools:\n\nShingwauk, at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario;\nGordon's, Punnichy, Touchwood agency, Sask.;\nSt. Philips, near Kamsack, Pelly agency, Sask.;\nGrouard, Lesser Slave Lake agency, Alberta;\nJoussard,\nVernilion,\nSturgeon Lake,\nWabasca,\nCariboo, Williams Lake agency, British Columbia.\n\nDespite this fact, however, there is still a large number of schools where the water supply is wholly inadequate and there is what one might term a critical shortage of water at the Chapleau residential school, Ontario, and at the Brandon and Sandy Bay residential schools in Manitoba. At Sandy Bay the water is hauled by truck from the lake, while at Brandon the water actually used by the pupils is hauled from the Brandon City water main.\n\nSince I entered the Department in December, 1936, the following schools have been destroyed by fire:\n\nAlberni, British Columbia;\nAhousaht,\nAlbany, James Bay agency, Ontario;\nCarcross, Yukon Territory;\nAlert Bay (boys' building), British Columbia;\nKenora (staff residence and dormitories, Ontario.\n\nIn view of these fire losses, I am personally of the opinion that no residential school should be built in the future - either new or designed for replacement - other than those of fireproof construction throughout.\n\nIn this memorandum I should perhaps refer also to the location of a number of our schools. I have in mind such schools as Portage la Prairie, Elkhorn and Edmonton.\n\nThe ELKHORN residential school, Manitoba, was closed for a number of years during the last war and it is difficult to understand at this date why it was ever re-opened. The repair costs for this school at the time of\ntime of the re-opening in 1923-24 amounted to $100,026. The pupils enrolled at this school come in the main from northern Manitoba and the cost of transportation is quite substantial.\n\nA more striking illustration though of poor location is supplied in the case of the EDMONTON residential school, Alberta (United Church). I have never been able to secure a rational explanation from anyone with respect to the establishment of this school on its present site. The Principal in charge - Mr. J. F. Woodsworth - is one of our best principals. He has never at any time in recent years succeeded in securing his full quota of pupils, despite the fact that he has been permitted for a number of years to recruit on Indian reserves along the western coast of British Columbia. This school cost more to erect than any other school in our entire system. It is my personal opinion - and the representatives of the Church agree with me - that it is going to be increasingly difficult to recruit the number of pupils necessary for the operation of this school during the years that lie immediately ahead of us.\n\nI feel you will agree with me when I state that regardless of what our opinion may be with respect to the efficiency of the residential school as an educational unit, it will be necessary for great many years to maintain a large number of these schools throughout the Dominion. This will be necessary to provide institutional care for a large number of Indian orphan children and children neglected by their parents and indeed children from homes where conditions are such that a child, unless removed to a residential school, has little chance of surviving. In my judgment it will be necessary also to maintain these schools in an attempt to salvage our investment. Very few of these schools appear to be suitable for any purpose other than the purpose for which they are now used.\n\nThe proposal I am submitting, therefore, if carried out, would mean the closing down of a number of residential schools and the substitution therefor of up-to-date consolidated schools on the reserves at which transportation might be provided in the sense that we are providing transportation at the newly constructed consolidated school in the Cowichan agency, British Columbia. A certain proportion of the saving effected should be used to defray the cost necessary to repair and reconstruct our remaining schools and thus maintain them in a high state of efficiency.\n\nA list of the schools to the closing of which we might give consideration is attached hereto.\n\nBefore -\nBefore such action is even seriously considered, however, a conference should be arranged between representatives of the Department and representatives of the Churches now engaged in the operation of the schools. I feel confident that the churches would be glad to co-operate with us in any attempts we might make to work out a more efficient system of Indian education.\n\nI desire to refer briefly to the schools in the enclosed list.\n\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE (United Church) Manitoba.\n\nThis school, with an enrolment of 35, is situated close to the city of Portage la Prairie and is at this date urgently in need of a new sewage disposal plant. The sewage, until now, has been released into the comparatively small lake, south of Portage la Prairie. The civic authorities are vigorously opposed to the release of this sewage and I am convinced that it is only a matter of time until we shall be compelled to establish our own sewage disposal plant at the institution. The cost of this work has been estimated at $2,000.\n\nThe pupils at this school are drawn in the main from Long Plains, Swan Lake and Roseau River reserves. There is a good Indian day school on the Swan Lake reserve, with a comparatively small enrolment. A two-room day school on the Long Plain reserve would be sufficient to provide the educational facilities for the children now enrolled at the Portage residential school. The comparatively few pupils that come from Roseau River might be provided for at Brandon or a small day school might be established on the Roseau River reserve.\n\nPINE CREEK (Roman Catholic) Manitoba.\n\nThis school, which has an enrolment of 120 pupils, displayed signs of collapsing last year. Steel girders were installed in an attempt to keep the school in operation until more extensive repairs could be undertaken. It is an old building.\n\nA thorough survey would have to be undertaken of the district, however, by a fully qualified investigator, to determine the best and the least costly ways and means of providing educational facilities for the pupils of the district.\n\nROUND LAKE (United Church) Saskatchewan.\n\nThis is an old, dilapidated building, originally constructed, I understand, by the Church, on the Ochapowace reserve, Crooked Lake agency, in the province -\nprovince of Saskatchewan. This school has an enrolment of 75 pupils and is undoubtedly one of the most dilapidated and insanitary schools we have at present in operation. Conditions at this school became so insanitary that the provincial authorities felt prompted to send in a sanitary inspector, whose report is one of the most scathing documents of its kind that I have ever read. Not only is the building insanitary but the wiring is faulty and has become an acute fire hazard.\n\nA two-room Indian day school should be established immediately on the Ochapowace reserve and the residential school should be closed at the end of the present academic year.\n\nTHUNDERCHILD (Roman Catholic) Saskatchewan.\n\nThis is an old school, in poor state of repair, on the Thunderchild reserve in the Battleford agency, Saskatchewan. The entire population of the reserve is 227, 83 of whom are listed as Catholic.\n\nA two-room Indian day school, with basement accommodation for vocational instruction, should be established to take the place of the present residential school.\n\nWARASCA (Church of England) Alberta. Enrolment 35.\n\nWHITEFISH LAKE (C. E.) \" Enrolment 30\n\nSTURGEON LAKE (R. C.) \" Enrolment 90.\n\nThese are all old buildings, church-owned and in a poor state of repair. These schools are costly to maintain and operate from year to year.\n\nA thorough survey of this district should be undertaken with the object of providing Indian day schools for the pupils of these districts to the utmost extent possible that Indian day schools can meet the needs of these Indians.\n\nSACRED HEART (R. C.) Alberta Enrolment 50.\n\nST. CYPRIAN (C. E.) \" Enrolment 50.\n\nThese schools are established on the Peigan reserve, Alberta. This reserve has an Indian population of 438, of whom 304 are Anglicans and 135 Roman Catholics.\n\nThese buildings are not old, in the sense that we usually speak of old buildings. Both were constructed about the year 1927-28. However, the design of both buildings is most unusual. They are of frame construction, comparatively narrow and each has three storeys in addition -\naddition to a full basement. I have been told by men who have visited these schools that in one of the wind storms that arise from time to time in southern Alberta it is impossible to keep water in a basin on the third storey, owing to the swaying and rocking of the buildings. The utmost difficulty has been experienced in securing water at the Sacred Heart school. The experiments have proved costly and are not satisfactory at this date. A capable contractor might undertake an investigation of both these schools with the object of having them transformed into Indian day schools - the top storey removed, etc., on the understanding that transportation would be provided for the pupils. These buildings, although comparatively new, are also acute fire hazards.\n\n**KITAMAAT**, Bella Coola agency, B. C. Enrolment 30.\n\n**PORT SIMPSON**, Skeena agency, B. C. Enrolment 25.\n\nBoth these schools are owned by the United Church. We have at Port Simpson an up-to-date three-room Indian day school with ample accommodation for vocational instruction, and the Port Simpson residential school should be closed.\n\nIn the estimates of this year, provision is made for the establishment of a two-room Indian day school at Kitamaat. The Kitamaat residential school should also be closed.\n\n**SQUAMISH** (Roman Catholic) Vancouver agency, B. C.\n\nThis is a church-owned school, operated by the Sisters of the Child Jesus. It has an enrolment of 60 at this date. This school is operated on the Squamish reserve, North Vancouver. The reserve has a population of 447 Indians, 357 of whom are Catholic.\n\nI visited this school in 1928, and while it is an old, ramshackle building, it is kept spotlessly clean and in a very sanitary condition by the Sisters in charge. It is an acute fire hazard, however, and is operated in conjunction with the Indian day school, the day school being close to the main building. The land on this reserve is becoming increasingly valuable and should in the immediate future become an ideal site for better-class suburban homes.\n\nAn additional room should be added to the day school on this reserve and the residential school closed at the end of the present academic year.\n\n**ST. PAUL'S HOSTEL**, (C. E.) Yukon. Enrolment 30.\n\nThis is not an Indian residential school in any sense; there is not at this date a single Indian pupil in attendance. The majority of the pupils, I understand, are half-breed orphan children. The amount of $7,500 paid in per capita grants to this school is not a legitimate charge against the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nThe official charged with the responsibility of administering the Yukon territory should be\nasked to investigate this institution and to report on the necessity of maintaining the institution in the sense that it has been maintained in recent years. If it is necessary for the care of half-breed children, the per capita grant should be paid by the Yukon administration and not by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIt will be noted that 15 schools are involved in this suggested retrenchment program, with a total enrolment of 732 pupils and an annual per capita grant allowance of $141,755.30. In my judgment it would take at least 95 classrooms to accommodate the pupils now in attendance at these residential schools. It is difficult to submit an accurate estimate, but I should think that classroom accommodation could be provided for approximately $6,000.00 per room or a total cost of $150,000.00. In addition to this, of course provision would have to be made for the salaries of at least 25 Indian day school teachers and the funds necessary for other incidental expenses such as fuel wood, caretaking, etc.\n\nI must express regret for having to discuss this matter at such length. I have felt very keenly, however, owing to the condition of our residential schools since I entered the Department, and my inability to keep these schools in a proper state of repair and efficiency. You will notice that my main recommendations are:\n\n(a) That a number of our dilapidated schools that are costly to repair and operate be closed and Indian day schools substituted therefor.\n\n(b) That part of the money saved be used to repair and bring to the highest possible state of efficiency our remaining residential schools.\n\nThe following are the amounts included in the main estimates for Indian education for the fiscal years 1930-31 to 1940-41, inclusive:\n\n| Year    | Amount     |\n|---------|------------|\n| 1930-31 | $2,754,500.00 |\n| 1931-32 | $2,005,000.00 |\n| 1932-33 | $1,750,861.00 |\n| 1933-34 | $1,524,860.00 |\n| 1934-35 | $1,356,000.00 |\n| 1935-36 | $1,246,000.00 |\n| 1936-37 | $1,201,200.00 |\n| 1937-38 | $1,165,050.00 |\n| 1938-39 | $1,125,452.00 |\n| 1939-40 | $938,761.00 |\n| 1940-41 | $1,988,500.00 |\n\nR.

In my judgment it would take at least 25 classrooms to accommodate the pupils now in attendance at these residential schools. It is difficult to submit an accurate estimate, but I should think that classroom accommodation could be provided for approximately $8,000.00 per room, or a total cost of $150,000.00.

reference to the above, I wish to confirm our understanding of the proposed arrangements to be followed, at least in the immediate future.\n\nDue to the present method whereby sites are selected by Indian Agents, without engineering advice, the Department might easily be committed to the erection of structures on sites which could not be properly drained or graded, and where ensuing trouble in the buildings would be costly to repair, and that even in instances where there will be no opportunity to choose between alternative sites, an engineer's report existing site conditions previous to the preparation of drainage and specifications here, would greatly assist us in making provision for site difficulties, before they were encountered.\n\nIt was tentatively agreed, subject to the approval of the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, that, before sites were selected for schools, and you were committed to their purchase, you would request that an engineer from this Branch visit the proposed site, in company with the Indian Agent concerned, and report on all matters regarding its suitability for drainage, grading requirements, etc.\n\nIt was also agreed that, based on our engineer's report, an amount sufficient to cover grading requirements should be included in the estimated cost of the school.\n\nArchitect.\n\nP.N.L.

At the same time, when estimates of cost are being prepared, an amount will be included to cover grading of the grounds so that both the building and its surroundings will have a more finished appearance.\n\nThe suggestions are quite acceptable insofar as this Branch is concerned and I would be very glad to have your views.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nOctober 4, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith reference to estimates for the Welfare and Training Section I submit the following comparative statement:\n\nVoted 1940-41\n\nVote 180 -- Indian Education -- $531,565.00\nVote 181 -- Residential School Grants ............. 1,410,094.00\nVote 196 -- Special Indian Education .............. 146,210.00\n\nTotal $2,087,869.00\n\nEstimates 1941-42\n\nIndian Education -- $500,616.00\nGrants Residential Schools .................. 1,398,944.00\nSpecial Indian Education .................... 1,899,560.00\n\nTotal $1,899,560.00\n\nDecrease $188,309.00\n\nPP Director.\nOttawa, August 31, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your memorandum of June 28, 1940, and also memorandum relating to the above noted subject, received by you from your Chief Engineer, Mr. Mills.\n\nI regret that circumstances have prevented me from acknowledging receipt of this memorandum until now.\n\nIt seems to me highly desirable that sites recommended for the erection of Indian day schools should be carefully surveyed from time to time by an engineer representing your Branch. This engineer should be requested to report upon the general suitability of the site, drainage, etc., and particularly upon the availability of an adequate water supply. As you know, we have had many failures experienced the utmost difficulty in securing an adequate water supply at a number of our schools, particularly in the Prairie Provinces. There may be recommendations from time to time for the erection of schools in the outlying districts of the Dominion where it might be considered unwise to send an engineer, owing to the inaccessibility of such districts and the amount of time required to undertake the work. In the majority of cases, however, a report from the engineer would be desirable.\n\nYour -\nThe inclusion of an amount in the estimates to cover the grading of school grounds and the erection of a school fence, etc., as suggested in your memorandum is in my opinion highly desirable.\n\nDirector.\nMarch 17, 1941.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT the estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41, Vote No. 161, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources, provide an amount of $1,000.00 for maintenance of equipment at Church-owned Indian residential schools;\n\nTHAT part of the above amount is required for maintenance of equipment and part for repairs and improvements as follows:\n\n1. Whitefish Lake Church of England Residential School, maintenance of equipment $28.95\n2. Wabasca Church of England Residential School, maintenance of equipment 18.40\n3.

With regard to items 3, 4 and 5 I may say that the amounts specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for these three schools are insufficient to meet the expenditure that it was necessary to incur there. Consequently, authority is being requested to use an amount of $218.76 for repairs and improvements instead of for maintenance of equipment.\n\nThis is the last Order in Council that will be required for the fiscal year 1940-41 in connection with adjustment of funds in Vote 161, and the amount of $886.11 is the total that will be expended from the item of $1,000.00.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Treasury Board, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the 31st March, 1941.\n\nThe Board had under consideration a memorandum from the Honourable the Minister of Mines and Resources reporting:\n\n\"THAT the estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41, Vote No. 181, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources, provide an amount of $1,000.00 for maintenance of equipment at Church-owned Indian residential schools;\n\nTHAT part of the above amount is required for maintenance of equipment and part for repairs and improvements as follows:\n\n1.

HOST\n\nI attach detailed statement showing the amounts provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at Indian residential schools.\n\nYou will note two statements -- (a) Government-owned Indian residential schools and (b) Church-owned Indian residential schools. I also attach a summarized statement showing the amounts provided for the different religious groups under whose auspices the schools are operated.\n\nIn providing the amounts shown in the appropriation every possible effort was made to consider the most urgent requests. In deciding on the amount to be provided for each school we were guided by reports received from Indian Agents, Principals and Church officials and our own knowledge of the needs of each school.\n\nMay I direct your attention to the following figures:\n\n(a) Government-Owned Schools\n\nAmount provided for purchase of new equipment, repairs and improvements in 1940-41 appropriation ........... $62,225.00\n\nAmount provided in appropriation for 1941-42 ......................... $60,100.00\n\nDecrease $2,125.00\n\n(b) Church-Owned Schools\n\nAmount provided for purchase of new equipment, repairs and improvements in 1940-41 appropriation ........... $38,200.00\n\nAmount provided in appropriation for 1941-42 ......................... $31,050.00\n\nDecrease $11,150.00\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, May 7, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. JACKSON,\n\nIn response to your telephone request of yesterday, I am attaching hereto a statement of the amount provided in the 1941-42 estimates for the purchase of equipment and for repairs at government and church-owned Indian residential schools.\n\nI may explain that when I entered the Department almost 5 years ago, no provision was made by Order in Council for the expenditures necessary to purchase equipment and repair church-owned schools. The Director of the Branch, however, felt at that time that inasmuch as it was unusual for a government to spend money on the repair of buildings other than government-owned buildings, the authority of the Governor in Council should be sought for all such expenditures.\n\nIn recent years, therefore, provision has been made for these expenditures by Order in Council. This year's Order in Council makes provision for an expenditure of $21,050 as against an expenditure of $32,200 last year and $34,575 for the fiscal year 1939-40. This year's appropriation, I am disposed to think, is the lowest appropriation asked for in several years. The Orders in Council in which provision is made for these expenditures are frequently amended to meet emergencies that arise from time to time. In addition to the Order in Council, the sanction of the Minister is secured for all expenditures exceeding $500, and I should think that about 95% of these expenditures exceed this amount. At the time the approval of the Minister is sought, a memorandum is sent forward giving full particulars in respect to the repairs that are about to be undertaken or the equipment that is about to be purchased.\n\nMay I explain, if I can, in a sentence or two, how our estimates have been prepared since I entered the Department. The Welfare Division is responsible for sending out each year regular mimeographed estimate forms. In these forms provision is made for educational, welfare, medical and administrative expenditures, and the forms are sent to all Indian agents throughout the Dominion. I am attaching three of these forms for your information. When these forms, covering the expenditures already mentioned, are completed by the agents, they are sent\nforward to the Inspectors, in the Prairie Provinces, and in the case of the Province of Ontario, to the Inspector for Ontario, and are scrutinized by these officials. They are returned to the Welfare Division by the Inspectors, with accompanying letters containing their comments and particularly their comments on large expenditures or expenditures that may appear to be unusual. They are then distributed by the Welfare Division to the Heads of the other Divisions.\n\nIt has been the practice to have these estimates received from our agents and inspectors carefully checked by Mr. Phelan and myself. In the case of our educational estimates, however, it should be pointed out that other requests for expenditures at schools reach us from representatives of the churches who visit the Department. The fact that such requests come in means that a careful study of all files has to be made before a decision is reached in the case of each school. I estimated that while our educational estimates were under review last year we handled over 300 files in a period of 2 or 3 weeks.\n\nWhen a file covering the condition of a school and the regular estimates submitted by the agent come up for review, the question of the denomination under the auspices of which the school is operated seldom arises. The urgency of the case, coupled with the amount of money at our disposal, is the governing factor. The greatest care, therefore, should be exercised when consideration is being given to the amounts allotted to certain schools. For example, one of the most costly items at an Indian residential school is the purchase of electric batteries, which provide light, and the Diesel or gasoline engines necessary for the operation of the electrical plant. It so happens that practically all of the non-Catholic schools are established outside Indian reserves and can take advantage of the supply of electrical energy available in the district. Catholic schools, on the other hand, with one or two exceptions, have been established on Indian reserves, where no such supply of electrical energy is available. This one item must amount to thousands of dollars annually.\n\nGovernment-owned schools built within the last 10 or 15 years cost anywhere from $100,000 to $250,000. These buildings are modern structures, fire-proof throughout, with steel or cement stairways, and require few repairs and little equipment for a great many years, although there are exceptions to this rule, as in the case of Sault Ste. Marie (Anglican Church) built a few years ago but without a barn. The barn was built 2 years ago at a cost of $5,000, and since that date a new water connection has been established between the school and the city of Sault Ste. Marie, at a cost of $4,200. Then there is the case of the two non-Catholic residential schools to each of which\nthe New England Company contributes $5,000 a year. This sum has been set apart for repairs and equipment at these schools but in the case of the Mohawk Institute has never been sufficient to keep the school equipped and in good condition. If other residential schools throughout the Dominion were allowed a similar amount, our estimates for equipment and repairs at residential schools would reach approximately $400,000 per annum. The cost of repairs at residential schools is kept low for the simple reason that the amount we allow from year to year ranges from one third to two thirds of the amount actually requested. Never since I entered the Department have we had the amount available to keep our residential schools in a proper state of repair.\n\nI have referred to the modern schools established by the Government in recent years. Church-owned schools, on the other hand, on an overwhelming majority of them, were built years ago in the remote and outlying districts of the Dominion, where freight and labour costs are a great deal higher than similar costs are in the populated centres. There are one or two exceptions that might be noted. I have seen photos of the Anglican School built two or three years ago at Moose Factory. The school appeared to be a well-constructed frame building that would need few, if any, repairs for a number of years. In the case of a number of schools in northern Alberta and the Round Lake (United Church) School in Saskatchewan, it can be said without any attempt at exaggeration that several of these buildings have reached the last stages of dilapidation and are and have been for several years acute fire hazards. Since I entered the Department, the insanitary condition and the fire risks at the Round Lake School have been brought to the attention of the Branch by the Saskatchewan Government. In my memorandum to the Director dated May 31, 1940, a copy of which I understand was sent forward to your office, I recommended that a number of these dilapidated schools be closed. In the absence of a decision, however, to close these institutions, the officials of the Training Division have no alternative other than to provide the money necessary to keep them open and in operation. In the memorandum referred to, I expressed the opinion that we should aim at keeping our well built schools in a state of repair from year to year. If we follow the policy we are now following, in a few years practically all our schools, with the exception of the best built ones, will be in a condition of semi-dilapidation.\n\nIn speaking of church-owned schools, I may state that church-owned schools such as Port Simpson and Kitamaat (United Church) are not residential schools in the ordinary sense at all. We have recently constructed Indian day schools at these points and the United Church have a couple of hostels, in charge of matrons, who provide sleeping accommodation, food and clothing for a number of pupils in attendance at the day schools, who come in from the outlying districts. The Kitamaat school will close at the end of the present academic year. The decision to close this school, however, had not been reached when our estimates were\nprepared. It is altogether likely that the small amount provided will not be needed for the purpose we had in mind.\n\nThe whole question of church-owned schools is one that might be reviewed by the Government. As the Director has pointed out on a number of occasions, it is somewhat unusual for the Government to provide equipment and repairs for institutions that are not government property. On the other hand, if we take into consideration interest on capital outlay, as in the case of Edmonton, the interest charges without depreciation would amount to approximately $10,000 annually\u2014a sum far exceeding the average amount spent on repairs at a church-owned school in any given year. I have been told that it was the policy of the Government in the early twenties to gradually displace these church-owned schools by the erection of fully equipped fireproof buildings, and that the policy was abandoned in the early years of the depression. It has often occurred to me that if the policy of educating Indian children at residential schools is a sound one, then the Government, and not the Churches, should provide these schools. If, on the other hand, the Government is of the opinion that a number of these schools should be displaced by up-to-date Indian day schools and provision made for the transportation of the pupils to such centres, greater consideration should be given to this change of policy in the immediate future than has been given to it at any time in the past.\n\nI have noted from the attached memorandum prepared by Mr. Phelan that we propose to spend at each of our government-owned schools an average of $888 this year for repairs and equipment and at church-owned schools, an average of $760 for repairs and equipment.\n\nI am attaching hereto, for your information, copies of correspondence relating to the condition of the Sturgeon Lake Residential School. I pass this on as a striking illustration of the condition of a number of schools we are operating in the outlying districts.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa,\nNovember 7th, 1940.\n\nHon. R. A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA\n\nRe: Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI had a number of interviews this fall with Rev. H. Fournier, O.M.I., the Principal of the above school, and with Dr. E. L. Little of Grande Prairie, the medical doctor at that point for the Indian Department, in connection with the Residential School.\n\nI feel very strongly that there should be a new school building at Sturgeon Lake. The present building is 25 or 30 years old, being partially log, boarded over, and has been built in sections. In the original part, some rather poor, local lumber was used. It is a three-story building and is heated by numerous stoves. The roof leaks and pans have to be set out to catch the rain. It is really in a most deplorable condition and a very dangerous fire-trap. You will appreciate that it is impossible to heat such a building as this with stoves, unless terrific fires are kept on. Unquestionably, the building should be condemned, and I feel that the Department is taking a very grave risk in continuing to use it.\n\nA residential school is urgently required at this point and the need will tend to increase rather than diminish. A day school would not serve the situation and would be quite inadequate. This residential school is doing exceptionally good work and should be continued.\n\nI appreciate the need for economy at the present time, but I have no hesitation in urging that the construction of a new residential school at Sturgeon Lake should be proceeded with at once. I feel indeed that I would be negligent in my duty if I did not, in the interest of the health and safety of these Indian children, do my utmost to impress upon the Department the urgency of this situation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) J. H. Sissons,\nM. P. for Peace River.\nOttawa, November 15, 1940.\n\nRe: Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Sissons:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 7th, in which you submit, for my consideration, the claims of a group of Indians for the rebuilding of a residential school at Sturgeon Lake.\n\nThe Sturgeon Lake School is a church-owned institution and is operated and administered by the Oblate Order. The Department pays an annual per capita grant at the rate of $180 and the enrolment at this date consists of 90 pupils.\n\nOur school building program and the repairs most urgently needed at Indian day and residential schools are carefully reviewed from year to year by the officials of the Department, in co-operation with representatives of the Churches. The claims of the Sturgeon Lake Indians for a new residential school have been carefully reviewed from time to time. I regret to state, however, that it was not possible to include in the estimates of this year the sum necessary for the construction of a new building at that point.\n\nI have just learned that last year a water system was installed by the Department at the Sturgeon Lake School, at a cost of $1,500. This year a carload of cement and the lumber necessary for the construction of a basement at the boys' wing of the building has been supplied.\n\nIt would appear that the construction of a school at Sturgeon Lake is inseparably bound up with the construction of schools at Wabasca, Whitefish Lake and Holy Angels. In view of this fact and the existing war conditions, it is not at all likely that the money necessary for the construction of these schools will be available at any time in the immediate future. An attempt will be made by the Department to keep these buildings in the best possible state of repair.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.) T. A.

Residential School has been expended. In the case of the Grouard, Joussard and Vernilion Residential Schools an amount of $65.90 has been expended leaving an unexpended balance of $3,614.10 and the attached Memorandum to Council covers the transfer of this sum to the Sturgeon Lake Residential School.\n\nHis Excellency Magr. U. Langlois, O.M.I., Bishop of Grouard, visited the Indian Affairs Branch today and pointed out that the present condition of the Sturgeon Lake Residential School constitutes a definite fire hazard and, as a result, immediate repairs should be made. He is willing to forego repairs at the other schools in his Diocese this year provided the unexpended amounts at these schools be transferred to the Sturgeon Lake School. Of the amount provided at Sturgeon Lake, $1,798.00 is unexpended and with the amount transferred from\nGrouard, Joussard and Vermilion there will be a total of $5,406.10 available. From my interview with Bishop Langlois I feel that it is very necessary to make immediate improvements to the Sturgeon Lake School and I, therefore, recommend that the amounts mentioned in the attached Memorandum to Council be made available.\n\nThe Sturgeon Lake Residential School is located approximately sixty-five miles from a railway station and it is difficult to bring in supplies except during the winter. In view of this condition Bishop Langlois requested authority to purchase material and arrange to have it sent at the earliest possible date in order that advantage may be taken of the winter roads from the railway line to the school. As it is important that all material purchased should reach the school within the next few weeks, I should appreciate receiving the approval of the Minister permitting Bishop Langlois to make the purchases.\n\nActing Director.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Treasury Board, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the 20th January, 1942.\n\nThe Board recommend that Order in Council of June 25, 1941, P.C. 21/4600 be amended by transfer of funds as follows:\n\n1. $1,890.80 from amount provided for the Grouard Residential School to Sturgeon Lake Residential School;\n2. $1,332.90 from amount provided for the Joussard Residential School to Sturgeon Lake Residential School;\n3. $490.40 from amount provided for the Vermilion Residential School to Sturgeon Lake Residential School.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Minister of Mines and Resources\nESTIMATES: 1942-1943.\n\nSTURGEON LAKE SCHOOL.\n\n1) Equipment:\n\n   1) Kitchen Stove: $900.00\n\n2) Repairs:\n\n   a) General repairs: $500.00\n\n   b) Repairs to Convent: $2,000.00\n\nTotal: $3,400.00\n\nHandwritten notes:\n- $250\n- $4180\n- $150\n- $900\n- $2050\nESTIMATES: 1942-1943.\n\nWABASCA SCHOOL.\n\nI) Repairs:\n\na) Repairs to root cellar: $750.00\n\nb) General Repairs: 500.00\n\n$1,250.00\n\n1/200\nESTIMATES L($#L$) L(8/).\n1942-1943.\n\nFORT VERMILION SCHOOL.\n\nI) REPAIRS:\n\n1) Repairs to large wood granary: $350.00\n2) Rebuilding chimneys: (Pep) $750.00\n3) General repairs: $500.00\n\n2) Transportation of children: $100.00\n\n$1,700.00\nESTIMATES 1942-1943.\n\nJOUSSARD SCHOOL.\n\n1) Equipment:\n   Batteries for lighting plant: $800.00\n\n2) General repairs: 500.00\n\n$1,300.00\nESTIMATES: 1942-1943\n\nGROUARD SCHOOL.\n\n1) Equipment:\n   Batteries for lighting plant: $800.00\n\n2) General repairs: $500.00\n\n3) Transportation of children: $100.00\n\nTotal: $1,400.00\n\nHandwritten calculations:\n\n$1900\n$1200\n$500\n$1200\n$1800\n$6700\n\n$1300\n$1300\n$1600\n$1250\n$3400\n$8850\n\n$2600\n$850\n$1200\n$2050\n$6700\nThe Secretary  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa  \n\nDear Sir:  \n\nAttention Mr. R.A.

As you know these are all under the jurisdiction of His Excellency Bishop Langlois, and are all Church-owned.\n\nThe amounts asked are not very large and I hope that you will be able to insert them all as presented.\n\nMay I add here a word in favour of the Church-owned schools? Not being the only Church organization owning schools, my plea is not one which applies only to Catholic schools, it is more general and includes the other Church organization who have schools of their own. Isn't it only just and equitable that these schools should receive a preferred treatment. In the case of Catholic schools at least, a part of the capital investment is still a burden to be carried in the form of interest and repayment of the capital itself. Furthermore the amounts allowed for repairs and improvements have not always been sufficient to meet all such expenses.\n\nI would therefore ask your very sympathetic consideration of the enclosed demands.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nExcerpt from Stony Indian Agency Estimates dated September 15, 1941 - submitted by J.N.R.

The subject matter of this memorandum, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nI may state that we met at 10 o'clock and discussed the desirability of turning over certain Indian residential schools for the care of physically incapacitated Japanese, very fully and in detail. The representatives of the Churches were unanimously of the opinion that schools established on Indian reserves should not under any circumstances, in their judgment, be selected for this purpose. They appeared to be convinced that the effect on the Indian population and repercussions in general would be very prejudicial to the interests of the Indian population. They were less vigorously opposed to the use of Indian residential schools established on property other than Indian reserves. Dr. Cochrane read a telegram from Dr. Dorey, who is at present attending a United Church conference at Edmonton, in which Dr. Dorey expressed the hope that the use of Indian residential schools for the care of Japanese would not be found necessary. If, however, the Government decided to use these buildings, the United Church would ask for the establishment of Indian day schools on the reserves from which the pupils now receiving instruction at Edmonton are recruited. They\nwould insist also on the taking over by the Government of the Youville School. All the representatives expressed a desire to have an opportunity of discussing the matter with their Bishops and their respective Missionary Societies.\n\nIn the judgment of the officials here it would be scarcely fair to take over Edmonton, which with its farm appears to be peculiarly suitable for the purpose we have in mind, without at the same time taking over the Youville School. These institutions are only a few miles apart. The representatives of the United Church are of the opinion that if the Youville School were allowed to remain open and in operation, certain pupils belonging to the United Church would inevitably tend to seek admission to this institution.\n\nThe delegates expressed a desire to have a decision from the Government at the earliest possible date.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\n1. In the name of the Churches we represent we would record our very genuine concern for the Indians and for the educational work developed among them over a long period of years. Nevertheless, the Churches heartily desire to cooperate with the Government in finding the solution to the present problem.\n\n2. In considering the proposal that the Indian Residential Schools be taken over for the Japanese, we are apprehensive lest this action would create other and more serious problems than it would solve, such as:\n\n(a) Provision for Indian children now in the schools, coming as they do from widely separated districts, especially orphans and adolescent girls;\n\n(b) The erection of day schools to provide for these children will cost more than buildings to house the Japanese;\n\n(c) Possible adverse reaction on the part of the Indian community;\n\n(d) Possible adverse reaction on the part of sections of the white community.\n\n3. We would suggest:\n\nThat the Government explore every other possible solution without having to take over the Indian Schools -- having the above problems in mind -- such a solution as taking over other institutional buildings.\n\n4. While the Government is thus exploring other possible solutions we shall consult our respective constituencies. Should another solution not be found we should be prepared to meet again in conference.\n\nSigned: L.A. Dixon\nT.B.R. Westgate\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nR.B. Gehrman\n\nOttawa\nMay 26, 1942\n1.

McGill\n\nReferring to our telephone conversation, I am enclosing letter received by the Minister from the Hon. Humphrey Mitchell, Minister of Labour, dated May 22nd, referring to the proposal for the closing of a number of government-owned residential schools for the purpose of providing accommodation to house Japanese women and children who are not fit for road camps and other similar work.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, May 26, 1942.\nOttawa, May 22, 1942\n\nMy dear Colleague:\n\nThe emergent situation which has developed in connection with the evacuation of the Japanese from the British Columbia Coastal Area is such that I feel warranted in recommending to you an action which in peace times might be considered drastic but which, in view of the seriousness of the matter and the war conditions, I feel is sound and absolutely justifiable.\n\nThe proposal briefly is that the British Columbia Security Commission be given, as a war measure, the use of at least three of the larger Indian Schools to house Japanese women and children and some of the older men who are not fit for road camps and other work we can offer them.\n\nAs a war emergency, the Japanese situation has already compelled us to take possession of the Exhibition Grounds at Vancouver. The National Defence Department is taking possession of the Exhibition Grounds at Toronto. The provinces have turned over for war purposes many institutions which has involved an interruption of services and has necessitated changes in arrangements.\n\nI think, therefore, it cannot be considered unreasonable that a number of the Indian Schools be used to assist us in meeting the evacuation problem.\n\nAny plan which would involve the construction of entirely new buildings would not only necessitate very heavy expense but would also be unwise because such a programme would use up material and labour needed for war activity.\n\nHonourable T.A.

There were present at this conference:\n\nReverend T.B.R. Westgate, D.D., and\nRev. Canon L. A. Dixon, M.A., representing the Anglican Church;\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., representing the Oblate Order;\nRev. R. B. Cochrane, D.D., representing the United Church of Canada.\n\nAfter a full discussion of the matter and after the representatives of the Churches had met in separate session, a memorandum was submitted by them to me, in which they embodied their recommendations. A copy of this memorandum is attached hereto.\n\nOn the morning of May 29 Mr. Jackson and Mr. Hoey met Father Plourde and two Reverend Sisters representing the Sisters of Charity and discussed with them the best ways and means of utilizing their residential school at Youville, Alberta, for the care of a group of Japanese. The Sisters expressed their willingness either to sell or lend to operate the school, and left the conference with the understanding that they would have a representative of the Order visit Youville\nand submit their proposals in order of preference, in\nthe course of a few days.\n\nIn view of the urgency of the matter, a second\ninvitation was extended to the representatives of the\nChurches to meet at your office on Wednesday June 3 at\n10 A.M. There were present at this conference:\n\nReverend George Dorsey, D.D., and Rev. R. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nrepresenting the United Church of Canada;\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., Reverend J. Scannell, O.M.I.,\nand Reverend P. O'Grady, O.M.I., representing the Roman\nCatholic Church;\n\nand the Reverend N. F. Burke, Rector of St. John's Church,\nElgin Street, representing the Anglican Church.\n\nThere were also present at this conference, which was\npresided over by yourself,\n\nDr. H. W. McGill, Director of Indian Affairs, Mr. Arthur\nMacNamara, Mr. Ford Pratt, Mr. R. A. Hoey and Mr.\nPhilip Phelan.\n\nThe use of residential schools for the care of\nJapanese, the number of schools that might be available\nwithout seriously disturbing the Indian educational structure\nthe auspices under which these schools might be operated if\nused for the care of the Japanese, and the provision that\nmight be made for the education of the Indian pupils now\nenrolled at these schools by the creation of day schools\nwere all thoroughly discussed at considerable length and in\ndetail. The representatives of the churches appeared\nwilling to place at the disposal of the Department of Labour\nthe following schools, with their lands and equipment and\nwith the members of the staffs necessary to operate them,\nif it were considered desirable after further negotiations\nto have the staffs now in charge left in control:\n\nEdmonton, Youville, Elkhorn, and either\nKootenay or Cariboo.\n\nFather Plourde intimated during the course of the discussion\nthat the Sisters of Charity would be prepared to operate the\nYouville School for the Government as a T.B. sanitarium.\nThe representatives of the United Church, however, were\n\nopposed -\nopposed to the care of the Japanese suffering from tuberculosis by a religious Order or Body other than the religious Body or Denomination to which the Japanese belong. It would appear that a large number of the Japanese are either members or adherents of the United Church of Canada. The United Church representatives expressed the view, however, that they would have no objection whatever to the care of the Japanese in an institution operated by the Government with a lay staff in charge.\n\nThe meeting adjourned on the understanding that representatives of the churches would later meet with representatives of the Department of Labour, with the hope of discussing the practical steps in respect to the actual date when the schools will be taken over, the purpose for which each school appears to be best equipped, the question of staff, management, etc., and the utilization of farm machinery, live stock, equipment, etc. It was agreed that it might be advisable to invite to Ottawa one or two members of the British Columbia Security Commission for the purpose of meeting the representatives of the churches and reviewing the whole problem with them.\n\nI am sending forward a copy of this memorandum to Mr. MacNamara.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, June 4, 1942.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nA cursory survey of the Indian reserves that are likely to be affected by the transfer of four of our Indian residential schools to the Department of Labour, for the care of a group of Japanese, would indicate that it will be necessary to provide 10 Indian day schools. These schools, in our judgment, should be built, if at all possible, during the present fiscal year. We have in mind two 2-room schools and eight 1-room schools - provision for living quarters for the teachers to be made at all the buildings erected. The Architect of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, with whom this matter has been briefly discussed, is of the opinion that the erection of these schools will cost approximately $75,000. I am sending forward this estimate in order that you may have the information at your disposal, should it be requested by the Department of Labour.\n\nDirector.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nGENERAL SECRETARY\nREV.

The schools that have been decided to place at the disposal of the Commission for this purpose are Edmonton (U.C.), Youville (R.C.), Elkhorn (C.E.), and either Cariboo or Kootenay (R.C.). The information at our disposal would lead us to believe that there are approximately 250 of this group of Japanese suffering from tuberculosis. The Government, for reasons that it is not necessary to discuss, consider it undesirable to use either Edmonton or Youville as a T.B. sanatorium. They have under consideration at the moment, however, the desirability of using the Elkhorn Residential School for this purpose.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be possible for you to undertake an inspection of this building and submit a report on the advisability of using the institution as a sanatorium. In making this inspection you should of course keep in mind the fact that there are few, if any, buildings available for the care of these people and that it certainly is not possible, for the time being at least, to provide them with an up-to-date sanatorium. It has been suggested also that the seminary owned by the Oblate Fathers at Qu'Appelle, near the Lebret residential school, might be used as a sanatorium. Would it be convenient for you to make an inspection of this -\n\nA. B. Simes, Esq., M.D.,\nMedical Superintendent,\nQu'Appelle Indian Hospital,\nFort Qu'Appelle, Sask.\n\nJune 5/42\nthis building also. In view of the urgency of the matter, it would be deeply appreciated if you could undertake this task at the earliest convenient date and send forward your report in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nYour letter of the 30th ultimo informing me of the meeting to be held in the office of the Deputy Minister at 10 o'clock a.m. on the 3rd inst., to further consider the question of using some of the Indian Residential Schools for accommodation for Japanese being evacuated from B.C., was delivered here on the 1st inst., only a few hours after I myself returned to Winnipeg from the meeting held in your office on May 26th. As I visited our Shingwauk and Chapleau Schools on the way back from Ottawa I could not conveniently arrive at an earlier date, and could not immediately leave again for Ottawa without giving our Commission an account of the matters considered at that meeting.\n\nI wired to that effect to our General Secretary (Canon Dixon) on the assumption that he might be able to attend the meeting, but have since learned that previous engagements prevented him from doing so.\n\nI sincerely regret that neither he nor I were able to be present, but I think you will see from what I have written, that circumstances made it impossible for us to do so.\n\nI note that he has requested you to advise him of any decisions reached, and I will, no doubt, in due course, learn of these from him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, June 4, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Doucet:\n\nIt was decided at a conference held yesterday at the office of the Deputy Minister, and attended by representatives of the churches responsible for the operation of Indian residential schools, that four of our schools should be placed immediately at the disposal of the Department of Labour for the care of a group of Japanese citizens suffering from certain physical disabilities.\n\nThe schools that will be used for the purpose are:\n\nEdmonton (U. C.)\nYouville (R. C.)\nElkhorn (C. E.) and either\nCariboo (R. C.) or\nKootenay (R. C.)\n\nIt was decided also at this conference that we should undertake immediately the construction of Indian day schools on the reserves affected and thus make educational facilities available for the pupils now enrolled at the four afore-mentioned residential schools.\n\nI am sending forward a copy of the 1939-census. It would be appreciated if you could visit the Edmonton, Hobbema and Saddle Lake Agencies prior to your return to Ottawa. You should discuss with the agents in charge of these agencies the best locations that might be selected for school sites, the type of building that might be erected, etc. It is of the utmost importance that the building program should be undertaken immediately. Funds will be available from the special war appropriation. You might also discuss the matter with the Reverend J. F. Woodsworth, Principal of the Edmonton School. Mr. Phelan and I at the moment have in mind the construction of one one-room day school with teacher's residence for the Samson's Band, Hobbema Agency; one two-room school with teacher's quarters for the Saddle Lake Band, Saddle Lake Agency; a one-room school with teacher's residence for the James Seenum's Band and one one-room day school with teacher's quarters for the Wabamun Band. In the Edmonton Agency we had in mind the construction of three one-room day schools with teacher's quarters on the following Reserves: Alexander's, Alexis and Michel's. These schools will of course be operated under Roman Catholic auspices.\n\nWe are hoping that it will not be necessary for you to spend much time at the Peigan Reserve and -\nand that you will be able to proceed north at an early date and let us have the results of your survey just as soon as you can conveniently do so.\n\nI am sending this letter air mail, in the hope that it will reach you at Regina. Should you seek additional information, you might communicate with us by air mail letter. I might add that the type of Indian day school we have in mind is somewhat similar to the one-room day school we built on the Oneida reserve, Caradoc Agency, a year or two ago. This school, with living quarters, appears to be giving entire satisfaction. You may remember visiting it a few months ago.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.

Pugh, \" \" Saddle Lake,\nOttawa,\nJune 4, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Doucet:\n\nWith reference to the letter which Mr. Hoey wrote to you this morning, in regard to the transfer of the Edmonton and Youville Schools to the Labour Department, I thought it advisable to write to you further.\n\nIn the event of our opening day schools, as suggested in Mr. Hoey's letter, considerable equipment will be required such as desks, blackboards etc. We have already supplied these to both the Youville and Edmonton Schools and, as this equipment will not be required when the schools are being used for the Japs, I cannot see any reason why we could not use the equipment. Consequently you should confer with the Principals of both the Youville and Edmonton Schools and ascertain the number of desks and blackboards available. With regard to the latter, it is quite possible that there are slate blackboards at Edmonton, if not at Youville also. It might be rather difficult to move these but you should survey the possibilities of doing so.\n\nThere is also the question of the classroom books which have been supplied to both schools. These could be used in the proposed new day schools. Either make a list yourself, or have the Principal make a list, and forward it to us at the earliest possible date.\n\nThere may be other classroom equipment which we have supplied to both of these schools which would be of no use to them while the Japs are occupying the buildings but that could be used in our day schools. You should list these in order that we may transfer them if required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet,\nc/o C.P.

When you have completed this work, I want you to report at the Edmonton U.C. School. I may explain that when the Indian pupils are discharged from the school - as they will be in the course of a few days - the responsibility for any alterations necessary, the steps required to have the buildings occupied by a group of Japanese and the arrangements that it may be necessary to make with the church for the care of these Japanese citizens are all matters for which the British Columbia Security Commission will have to assume full responsibility. As a department, our responsibility practically ends in an official sense at least with the discharge of the pupils. The per capita grant will be allowed up until the end of the present academic year, June 30.\n\nWe are anxious, however, to do everything humanly possible to assist the British Columbia Security Commission and the Department of Labour in the task of making provision for the transfer and care of this group of Japanese. It has occurred to me, therefore, that you might act for two or three weeks and perhaps longer as liaison officer between this Department and the Department of Labour and the British Columbia Security Commission, representatives of which commission you will, no doubt, meet at the school.\n\nIn addition to certain alterations in the main building itself and in the outer buildings, the members of the Commission have in mind the erection of a large number of cottages. These cottages will be built to provide homes for groups of Japanese women and children who may not require institutional care and who are not suffering from physical disabilities. Your knowledge of building construction should prove very helpful to those responsible for the construction of these houses. Your\n\nMr. A. J. Doucet,\nc/o Rev. J. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nknowledge also of departmental policy in respect to\nthe operation of residential schools, the repair and\nupkeep of these buildings and the payment of per capita\ngrants should be valuable. If there is any matter\nin respect to which you need additional information,\nyou should communicate with us by air mail from time\nto time. I am anxious to see that you should not\nleave Edmonton until you have communicated with us.\nThe transfer of these Japanese citizens from British\nColumbia to certain Indian residential schools in the\nPrairie Provinces is a matter of extreme urgency and\nit is just possible that in working out the practical\ndetails you can be of greater service to the Department\nthan you could be by returning to take up your duties\nat Ottawa.\n\nIn view of your absence from Ottawa for a\nnumber of weeks, I regret that we find it necessary to\nask you to remain for some weeks longer in the West.\nHowever, this matter has been given a great deal of\nserious consideration, and I can think of no one\navailable that could represent the Department during\nthis period of transition at a number of our residen-\ntial schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nHobbema:\nSavannah (more members)\nSalada Lake:\nSalada Lake - more members\nJos.

You will note that his statement was couched in terms we discussed during the conference in Dr. Connell's office.\n\nAlong the lines of our discussions, I thought the next move would be to have a representative of the British Columbia Security Commission proceed to Edmonton and discuss the situation with Mr. Woodsworth.\n\nAs the property belongs to the Government there will be no formalities in connection with turning it over but the British Columbia Security Commission should discuss with Mr. Woodsworth as to the best use of the buildings, the arrangements they would make with Mr. Woodsworth personally and for his staff.\n\nIf you would be good enough to communicate with Mr. Woodsworth and outline the situation to him, it would be appreciated.\n\nWhile I have not gone into the terms of the arrangement which might be made with the Home Mission Board, my thought, for your information, is that the care of the Japanese could be undertaken by your Board if you desire on somewhat the same basis as you have with the Department of Indian Affairs, less the cost of teaching which certainly will not be necessary in the same degree.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(agg.)

Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI received a letter today from Mr. MacNamara, copy of which I enclose. I spoke to him over the telephone, and, with the explanation, I think it represents pretty much what we had in mind; but I do hope that it will be possible to have all the details, both of the transfer and everything else, ironed out before any actual change is made. That is to say, I do not think that any buildings should be occupied by the Security Commission, or anything done, until we have the details settled. I could very well imagine that circumstances would arise in which we as a Church would feel that we should take a pretty strong position, and I do not think that we should get in a corner where we would be faced with an accomplished fact, either on the part of one of the Government Departments or one of the Churches, and be told that there was nothing we could do about it. Perhaps, in conversation with Mr. MacNamara, you could tell him some of the delicate situations that arise in dealing with such bodies as Churches, which have positions to maintain and interests to conserve and constituencies to placate!\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MLT\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, June 10, 1942.\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 8, in which you express regret at your inability to attend the conference at the office of the Deputy Minister on Wednesday, June 3.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that it was unanimously agreed at this meeting that the following schools should be placed at the disposal of the Labour Department for the care of a group of men, women and children of Japanese origin: Edmonton (C.C.), Youville (R.C.), Elkhorn (C.E.) and either Kootenay or Cariboo (R.C.).\n\nA notice, instructing the principals to discharge the pupils, will go out in the course of a few days. When the pupils are discharged, the responsibility of this Department in an official sense comes to an end. It is scarcely necessary, however, to add that we shall do everything possible to cooperate with the Department of Labour and with the British Columbia Security Commission in working out the details of the transfer.\n\nI am sending forward a copy of this letter to Dr. Westgate, for his information. It is altogether likely that you or Dr. Westgate will receive a communication from the Security Commission in respect to the operation of the schools under the new arrangement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nReverend Canon L.

Security Commission for the care of a group of Japanese.\n\nYou will realize, of course, that in an official sense the responsibility of the Department of Mines and Resources ends when the children are discharged - as they will be discharged - from the schools in the course of a few days. It is our intention, however, to do everything humanly possible to assist the Security Commission in working out the best possible plan for the administration of these institutions. It is still my hope that you will find it convenient to visit Ottawa and discuss the whole matter with Mr. MacNamara before a final decision is reached in respect to the administrative set-up. It is my experience that matters such as this, which are always somewhat delicate, can be handled most effectively by personal contacts and by personal interviews.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

The Edmonton Indian Residential School at Edmonton in the Province of Alberta, a government owned institution operated by The United Church of Canada.\n\n2. The Elkhorn Indian Residential School at Elkhorn in the Province of Manitoba, a government owned institution operated by The Church of England.\n\n3. The Kootenay Indian Residential School at Cranbrook in the Province of British Columbia, a government owned institution operated by the Oblate of Mary Immaculate Order of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n4. The Youville Indian Residential School at St. Albert in the Province of Alberta, owned and operated by The Sisters of Charity an Order of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nTHAT it is deemed expedient that the government owned institutions at Edmonton in the Province of Alberta, at Elkhorn in the Province of Manitoba, and at Cranbrook in the Province of British Columbia, be turned over to the Department of Labour by the Department of Mines and Resources, in consideration of which there shall be paid to the said Department of Mines and Resources from the War Measures Appropriation the sum of $\nsuch sum to be used to provide day school accommodation to the Indian pupils in lieu of services formerly provided by the said institutions.\n\nTHAT it is deemed expedient that the properties of the Sisters of Charity at St. Albert in the Province of Alberta and\n\nbe purchased from monies provided in the War Measures Appropriation for like purposes at a price to be determined, the total cost not to exceed $50,000, all of which said properties to be used for the purpose of providing facilities and accommodation to such persons of Japanese origin as may be assigned to each such institution.\n\nTHAT tentative arrangements have been made (or are to be made) with the United Church of Canada, The Church of England, The Sisters of Charity, The Oblate Order, and , respectively, to provide for the operation of the said institutions and for the accommodation and care of persons of Japanese origin along lines similar and as far as applicable to the arrangement presently subsisting between each of them and the Department of Mines and Resources in relation to the care and education of Indians.\n\nIT IS THEREFORE JOINTLY RECOMMENDED:\n\n1. THAT the Minister of Labour be empowered and authorized to enter into an agreement with the Minister of Mines and Resources, in consideration of payment of the sum of $50,000 from War Measures Appropriation to be used for the erection and equipment of day schools for Indian children, to take over possession of the Indian Residential Schools at Edmonton in the Province of Alberta, at Elkhorn in the Province of Manitoba, and at Cranbrook in the Province of British Columbia, for the purpose of providing therein accommodation for such persons of Japanese origin as may be assigned thereto, and for such other purposes related to the war as may hereafter arise.\n\n2. THAT the Minister of Labour be empowered and authorized to purchase from the Sisters of Charity the Youville Indian Residential School at St. Albert in the Province of Alberta, and\n\nat a price to be determined but not to exceed in total the sum of $50,000 Dollars ($50,000) and that the purchase price be provided from monies voted in War Measures Appropriation.\n\n3. THAT the British Columbia Security Commission be empowered and authorized to enter into agreement with the United Church of Canada, The Church of England, The Sisters of Charity, The Oblate Order, and any of them to provide necessary services and accommodation to such persons of Japanese origin as may be assigned to each such\ninstitution, the cost of which services and accommodation\nto be provided from monies voted in the War Measures Approp-\nriation.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources\n\nMinister of Labour.\nOttawa, June 9, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nI am sending forward herewith draft copy of Memorandum to Council in which provision is made for the transfer of certain Indian residential schools to the Department of Labour for the care of persons of Japanese origin.\n\nI may state that this rough draft has been prepared by Mr. Allan. You will note that the memorandum is incomplete, for the reason that Mr. Allan had not at his disposal information in respect to the legal description of the Youville property or the price that is likely to be paid for the Youville school.\n\nI am sending forward this draft in order that it may be referred to the Departmental Solicitor for his attention.\n\nActing Director.\n\nEncl.\n\nRAH\n\nJune 9/42\nDear Mr. Philson,\n\nI received your letter re the construction of day school. I had left for the Region's on the morning of the 25th. There was a deluge of rain all the time & was there.\n\nI am leaving for Edmonton in a few hours and will stay at the Coronet. The work is somewhat strenuous but is very interesting. I have been unable to complete any report so far, and guess they will have to wait till I return.\n\nGive my best regards to the staff.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDear Mr. Doucet:\n\nReferring to official letters of June 4 and 6, in connection with the erection of Indian day schools, I am enclosing \"Proposed Building Data\" forms which are required by the Surveys & Engineering Branch. The reserves on which we suggested that Indian day schools might be erected are as follows:\n\n**Hobbema**\n- Samson - 1 room school & residence\n\n**Saddle Lake**\n- Saddle Lake - 2 room school & residence\n- Jas. Seenum's - 1 \" \" \" \"\n\n**Edmonton**\n- Alexander - 1 room school & residence\n- Alexis - 1 \" \" \" \"\n- Michel - 1 \" \" \" \"\n- Wabamum - 1 \" \" \" \"\n\nWhen you visit the above reserves it is possible that in some cases you may consider it advisable to erect a school and at the same time there may be other reserves where such a building could be used. Of course, you should fill in the information required by the data forms when you visit the reserve. It is very important that you forward these data forms as soon as you have them completed. Do not wait to visit all the reserves before forwarding the forms. We are endeavouring to rush the Surveys & Engineering Branch and they are rather slow to move unless\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet,\nCorona Hotel,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nwe have all the information that they think they require.\n\nIn connection with the completion of the data forms, you will note the attached samples on which we have noted certain information regarding the proposed buildings. These particular items have been settled and, unless you consider it advisable to make a radical change, it will not be necessary for you to enter anything under these particular headings.\n\nIf you have not done so before receipt of this letter, you should let me know the best address to which to forward subsequent communications.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAttention of Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 9th, the Reserves on which day schools will be necessary to accommodate pupils of the Edmonton School, as far as the United Church is concerned, are as follows:\n\n1. Wabamum.\n2. Goodfish Lake. (I think you call this James Seemun's)\n3. Saddle Lake. On this Reserve we ought to have an improved day school - possibly to accommodate two classes; but it ought to be able to accommodate more than the Goodfish Lake School.\n4. Hobema. I am not sure on what Reserve this school should be built - probably on Samson Reserve.\n\nI think Mr. Woodsworth could give information as to the best location for these schools on each Reserve. At any rate, that is the programme that we had in mind. I do not see how any one of these schools can be omitted. It might be possible to make some provision for the use of the church at Goodfish Lake, temporarily; and, even on the other Reserves, some temporary provision might be found, but I am not sure of this.\n\nI think this is the information which you need.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJune 10th,\n1942.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Accommodation for Elkhorn Pupils in Reserve Schools.\n\nI note by your letter 1-1-1, dated June 4th, 1942, that Elkhorn School may be used for purposes other than the education of Indian pupils and that provision must be made elsewhere for the children attending.\n\nI understand that of the 140 in residence, thirty or thirty-five will be sixteen years old by June 30th and ready for discharge. Dr. Westgate claims he can look after the others as follows:\n\n- 24 at Sioux Lookout,\n- 25 \" Chapleau,\n- 50 \" Shingwauk.\n\nHowever, if funds are not available for the transfer and if the parents refuse to allow their children to go so far from home, then I fear further classroom accommodation will be needed on certain reserves.\n\nI will now deal with the list as presented with your letter.\n\nOak River - At present we use a small room in the Mission house for a classroom and this will only accommodate the fifteen or eighteen pupils enrolled. If the thirty-three return then a new school will be required.\n\nLake St. Martin - The present classroom is of log construction and almost unfit for use. I understand the present enrolment is around thirty pupils. A new school is needed now and will be more urgently needed if ten more children are to be admitted.\n\nPaguis - We have three schools on this reserve. A fourth has been required for years and would no doubt become a necessity if twenty-seven more pupils are to be accommodated. A new school, not an addition is required due to distance many children are now obliged to go.\n\nJames Smith - In Saskatchewan. Should easily accommodate two extra pupils.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nO T A W A.\nSplit Lake - Has a classroom with Mrs. Monias in charge. It is hardly likely the present building could accommodate twenty-one additional pupils.\n\nMoose Lake - The two extra pupils should make no difference.\n\nFairford - Present schools should accommodate ten extra.\n\nThe Pas - The two schools now in operation no doubt could care for the extra fifteen pupils.\n\nLittle Saskatchewan - Present school adequate.\n\nLoose River - No information on this point.\n\nScantebury - Present building adequate.\n\nOak Lake - No school on this reserve. Pupils attend Elkhorn, Brandon and LeBrett.\n\nBrokenhead - and Scantebury the same place. Present building suitable.\n\nSintaluta - Saskatchewan - Has a good day school. Two pupils should make little difference.\n\nYork Factory - No information available re conditions at this point.\n\nIf Dr. Westgate is permitted to make the transfers he suggests no new buildings would be required. However, if the pupils remain on their own reserves I fear the following schools would be required:\n\nNew school at Oak River, Griswold Agency.\n\" \" Peguis, Fisher River\n\" \" Lake St. Martin, Portage Agency.\n\" \" Split Lake, The Pas Agency.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

EAST\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN. June 9, 1942.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nYesterday I received a letter from Mr. Macnamara, Associate Deputy Minister of Labour, in which he expressed the hope that I might be able to meet a representative of the B.C. Security Commission and discuss with him all arrangements which might be made for the transfer of the Indian children from our Elkhorn School in order that the school building might be made available for the Japanese being evacuated from B.C. In my reply I informed Mr. Macnamara that I would gladly endeavor to meet the Security Commission's representative at Elkhorn at any time mutually convenient to us both.\n\nIt has occurred to me that an official representative of your Department should also be present at the meeting, and I am writing for the specific purpose of suggesting that you authorize and instruct Inspector Hamilton of Winnipeg to undertake this duty for you.\n\nWith regard to the approximately 140 children now in residence at Elkhorn, I found on my way back from the meeting at Ottawa on May 25th, that 50 of these could be accommodated at our Shingwauk School at S. S. Marie, and 25 at our Chapleau School. I wired to the Principal of our Sioux Lookout School, and he informed me that his school could accommodate at least 24. The transfer of the pupils to these schools would eliminate the necessity of building or enlarging any Indian Day Schools, and I would earnestly request that sympathetic consideration be given to this arrangement.\nDr. Harold W. McGill - 2.\n\nJune 9, 1942.\n\nI have already suggested this arrangement to the General Secretary of our Society in a telegram to him on the 1st inst., and it is quite likely that he himself will write to you further in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBW:A.\nOttawa, June 13, 1942.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 9, in which you discuss the proposed transfer of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School to the British Columbia Security Commission for the care of certain individuals of Japanese origin.\n\nI note with interest the suggestion contained in the second paragraph of your communication, that Inspector Hamilton should be present at Elkhorn at the time of the visit of a representative from the Security Commission.\n\nI wish to point out that when the pupils at these residential schools are discharged, in the course of a few days, the responsibility of this Department in an official sense will cease. We shall be glad to do everything humanly possible, of course, to expedite the transfer and to supply the Department of Labour and the Commission with any information at our disposal. I am disposed to think, however, that the details of the transfer, the suitability of the buildings and the particular group of Japanese that should be provided with care in each building are all matters that should be discussed with either the Department of Labour or the representative of the Security Commission. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you could find it convenient to send forward your suggestions and recommendations first to Mr. MacNamara. As I have already intimated, we shall be glad to cooperate with him in every possible way. At this date, however, we have no request from the Department of Labour that we\n\nReverend T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n154 Alexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nshould have a representative present when the buildings are first under inspection.\n\nIt is not possible at this date for the officials to state definitely what disposal should be made of the pupils now enrolled at Elkhorn. This matter will be very carefully reviewed in the immediate future. Just as soon as a definite decision is reached, I shall be glad to communicate with you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nDear Percy:\n\nI was talking to Dr. Ferguson this morning, following his arrival home from the East last evening. During his time in Ottawa no mention was made to him by any of the Indian Department Officials regarding transferring Tuberculosis Japanese from B.C. to the Prairie Provinces. I judged from our conversation that some attempt had been made to place them in Saskatchewan some time previously. This I think has been definitely squashed by the Provincial Department of Public Health.\n\nRecently I received a letter from Dr. McGill to inspect and report on the suitability of Elk Horn Residential School for this purpose. This is a Manitoba, not a Saskatchewan problem if they should take over that school. As you possibly are more interested in Manitoba than Saskatchewan, it was thought advisable to drop a line and let you know what was in the offing. It is felt by the men doing Tuberculosis work in Saskatchewan, that Dr. Macleod in Vancouver is trying to pull a fast one in shipping these Japs out of the Province. If they are sick, what harm can they do as fifth columnists. No doubt they will be difficult to manage and there is a great possibility of them getting scattered throughout the Provinces, causing a great increase in Tuberculosis. In our opinion it is up to B.C. to care for them themselves.\n\nIn our opinion it was felt that the B.C. Government was dealing with the Federal Government, when it considered taking over Indian Residential Schools, and all arrangements might be made before the Provincial Government of Manitoba was aware of what was going on. This was my main reason for writing you regarding this matter, and in our opinion the Manitoba boys would certainly appreciate any action you might take to prevent these Tuberculosis Japs being moved East of the Rockies.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nM.D.\nMedical Superintendent.\nQu'Appelle Indian Health Unit.\n\nDr. P.

I met the B.C. Security Commissioner yesterday afternoon. Their opinion about the schools has remained the same as I expressed in Mr. Story's letter. They were leaving for the East last night. Colonel Gibson also left last night, but by plane. He is to arrange a meeting for them with the minister of Labor. This I imagine will not be before the latter part of next week. In the mean time I could proceed with the survey, but I do not think it wise, for I must say that the Indians are strongly for day schools, and to let them understand they were to get them and then not come through would be unwise, to say the least.\nI am therefore awaiting instructions before making any move. I hope that some plan of action can be sent to me by return mail.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. P. Philan,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nJune 15, 1948.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMy dear Doucet:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant and regret that you are held up in Edmonton. However, there does not appear to be anything that can be done about the matter until we hear further from the British Columbia Security Commission. We endeavoured to obtain some information this morning but Colonel Gibson has not yet arrived back in Ottawa. As soon as we have definite word we will advise you.\n\nMr. Hoey and I agree that you are following the proper procedure in not visiting the reserves until it is definitely settled that the Security Commission is taking over the residential schools.\n\nI suggest that you engage the hotel stenographer and prepare a report on your trip so far. It will be quite in order to charge this in your expense account and it would mean that you would have the work done when you return home. As you know, by the time you get back the holiday period will have started and it will be difficult to obtain stenographic assistance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet,\nThe Corona Hotel,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa,\nJune 19, 1942.\n\nMy dear Doucet:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence, Mr. Hoey now advises me that it is doubtful whether or not the British Columbia Security Commission will decide to take any of our schools.\n\nHowever, in view of the fact that you are in Edmonton, Mr. Hoey believes it advisable for you to proceed with the survey of the reserves mentioned in my letter of June 10. For your information I repeat these:\n\n**Saddle Lake**\n\n| Location       | Description                  |\n|----------------|------------------------------|\n| Saddle Lake    | 2 room school & residence    |\n| Jas. Seenum's  | 1 \"                           |\n\n**Edmonton**\n\n| Location       | Description                  |\n|----------------|------------------------------|\n| Alexander      | 1 room school & residence    |\n| Alexis        | 1 \"                           |\n| Michel         | 1 \"                           |\n| Wabamum        | 1 \"                           |\n\nIn visiting these reserves and selecting possible sites for day schools, you should point out very definitely to the Indian Agent and the Indians who may inquire from you that, although you are selecting possible sites for day schools, the Department is making no promise, either expressed or implied, that day schools will be erected. You are simply doing this work due to the fact that you happen to be in the vicinity and it was thought by the Department that the information you have been requested to get would be useful to have on file for future consideration.\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet,\nCorona Hotel,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nI understand from your letter of June 7 that you have completed your survey of the Peigan Reserve. If, however, you have not done so, you should finish the Peigan Reserve as soon as you have finished the Saddle Lake and Edmonton Agencies. Following this you should then return to Ottawa. Incidentally I may add that Mr. Buck of the Surveys & Engineering Branch phoned me yesterday and stated that in choosing locations you should keep in mind whether coal or wood will be available and, whichever it is, I would like your recommendation regarding the necessity of erecting a separate woodshed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nBoard of Home Missions\nThe United Church of Canada\n299 Queen St. West\nToronto 2, Ontario\n\nJune 17th, 1945\n\nMr. H. A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have not heard from you or from Mr. McNamara about the transfer of the Edmonton School and am wondering whether there is any hold up. In the meantime, our Executive meets next week and I have engagements from Saturday to Wednesday next inclusive. I am therefore writing to say that I expect to be in Ottawa on Friday of this week, i.e., June 19th, and would be glad to know if Mr. McNamara and yourself could see me and more or less get this School business in shape so that we can report to our Executive next week.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD/HL\nDear Mr. Story:\n\nI have just received yours of the 6th instant and I have taken careful note of its contents.\n\nI have completed the survey of the Saraman's Band, Stobbs' agency, and the survey of the Alexis reserve. The Indians are very enthusiastic about day schools. I have, however, stopped the survey for the present. For one reason I have been obliged to stay in Edmonton to be available to the Security Commission and secondly, there appears to be complications setting in. The Security Commission will, as has, no doubt communicated with the Labor Dept., the B.C. Security Commission in connection with Colonel Gibson do not seem inclined to accept the Youville proposition. It appears to them to be too expensive. The U.C. through its representative Rev. J. F. Woodworth feels that their\nproposition is not binding as it\nhinged on the understanding that\nthe Yowill School would also be\ndiscontinued as an Indian School.\nI feel that I must await the clari-\nfication of this situation before proceeding.\nIt would have bad consequences, I\nbelieve, to let the Indians understand\nthey were to have day schools and\nthen disappoint them. I will\ntherefore, await more definite\ninstructions before proceeding.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. R.G. Story\nDept. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nIn your letter of the 10th inst. (No.160-1) addressed to Canon Dixon, General Secretary of our Society, you stated that \"a notice instructing the Principals to discharge the pupils\" (from the schools being placed at the disposal of the Labour Department for the care of a group of men, women and children of Japanese origin) \"will go out in the course of a few days\".\n\nAs our Elkhorn School is included in the list of schools mentioned, I beg to state that I requested the Principal of the school (Rev. G.N.Middleton.B.A.) to furnish me with the names, ages and Treaty numbers of orphan and other children for whom no homes were available, and who should be sent to one or more of our other schools. I have this morning received from him the enclosed list and comments, and would suggest that authority be given to our Commission, in collaboration with your Inspector Hamilton of Winnipeg, to have all of these, or as many as cannot otherwise be satisfactorily placed with friends or relatives, transferred to our Sioux Lookout School.\n\nShould you authorize the transfer suggested, it is my understanding that such authority would carry with it (a) continuance of payment of the p.o. grant, and (b) responsibility for meeting all the transfer costs.

The latest reports we have received from the Department of Labour indicate that it is just possible, as the result of an acute labour shortage in the East, particularly in the province of Ontario, that a very large group, if not all, of the individuals of Japanese origin may be placed in work camps and that the Japanese so placed will be prepared to look after the old and physically incapacitated relatives. If such is the case, our residential schools will not be required for the care of Japanese and it will not be necessary to disturb in any way the present enrolment at these institutions. In view of all the circumstances, I am disposed to think that you should inform the Principal of the Elkhorn School that no steps should be taken in the meantime to transfer these pupils to the reserves or to the Sioux Lookout School; in other words, that the school should be operated in the same sense that it would have been operated if the proposal for the care of the Japanese had not been submitted to us for consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend T.B.R.

No doubt you are keeping this in mind.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, June 20, 1942.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, June 24, 1942.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nMr. MacNamara, who phoned me a few minutes ago, is anxious to know if it would be possible to secure the use of the Edmonton School - or perhaps I should say the farm attached to it - for the accommodation of approximately one hundred Japanese families.\n\nMr. MacNamara has in mind the placement of these families ultimately in districts throughout the Dominion where employment is likely to be available. His idea is that they might be transferred for the time being to Edmonton and provided with tents supplied by the Government and provided with the major portion of their food supply from the school and the school farm under the direction of Mr. Woodsworth.\n\nI can readily appreciate how difficult it will be for you to reach a decision on this matter, in view of the fact that your Board meeting is now over. I cannot myself see much objection to the proposal, if Mr. Woodsworth would be willing to try it. It may be necessary for you to communicate with him in respect to the matter, but Mr. MacNamara would like to have a reply by phone or telegram tomorrow, if at all possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

We are naturally greatly interested in the decision which has been reached regarding the use of certain of the Indian Schools for Japanese.\n\nRegarding the School at Elkhorn I am to say that my Society acquiesces in the decision which has been made. Dr. Westgate has already been in touch with the Department of Labour and the representatives of your own Department regarding the details of the transfer as they relate both to the Indian children who have been in the school and to the Japanese who are to take their place.\n\nWhile we, for our part, are glad and anxious to cooperate fully with the Government in meeting the present emergency, we should welcome an assurance from your Department that when the building at Elkhorn is no longer required for the Japanese it will be restored to us and reopened as an Indian Residential School. If it should be decided that the Elkhorn premises are no longer suitable for this purpose we should wish to have the assurance that another school building, with equal accommodation, will be provided for our School at another convenient centre - possibly on the Hudson Bay Railway. As you will doubtless recall, we were not given a new school building to replace the Mackay School at The Pas which was destroyed by fire in 1933.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLAD K.\n\nCopy for information to Dr. T.B.R.

I have already communicated with Dr. Westgate and intimated to him that the Elkhorn School, for the time being at least, should be administered in the same manner as if the original proposal from the Department of Labour, with respect to its use, had not reached us. Should there be a change of government policy in this regard, I should be glad to communicate with you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nReverend Canon L. A.

Security Commission, were at Elkhorn, and made a somewhat hurried inspection of our school buildings with a view, I fancy, of reporting to the Department of Labour at Ottawa as to their suitability for housing some Japanese from the B.C. area. I had been expecting to be notified by them of the time of their visit so that I might meet them there, but as they failed to give me any notice, I will be obliged if you will let me have any information they gave you regarding the number of Japanese they thought the School could take, the time they expected or desired to have them admitted, the engagement of the school staff to look after them, etc.\n\nIf they gave you or your staff no information on these or other relevant points, a brief reply to that effect will be sufficient. While the Indian Affairs Branch of Government may notify us to discharge or transfer the pupils, our Commission will be expected to make any arrangement possible for the staff, and this matter is giving us much concern.

MacNamara,\nAssociate Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Labour,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. MacNamara:\n\nI have yours of July 4th enclosing copies of letters from Mr. Hoey and Mr. Graham. I note what Mr. Graham says about Brandon and have a letter from Mr. Chapin to say that he is ready to co-operate. I have also written him about this. I have written to Mr. Strapp at Muncey but have not yet had time to get any word back from him.\n\nThe point raised in Mr. Hoey's letter is one with which we are not at all able to deal. That is a matter for the Department itself. All that we are concerned with as a Church is whether Mr. Strapp, the Principal, can help out. The relation of the School to the Reserve is one which can only be dealt with by Mr. Hoey's Department. I am writing him today. As soon as I hear from Mr. Strapp, I shall let you know further.\n\nAs far as Brandon is concerned, Mr. Chapin (the Principal) indicated in his letter that Mr. Graham rather thought that some building at Lac du Bonnet would be more suitable. At any rate he mentioned that.\n\nI expect to be in the neighborhood of Muncey this week end but if you thought that I should make a trip before that, I shall be very glad to do so.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Geo. Dorey\nJuly 8th, 1942.\n\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have just had a phone message from Mr. MacNamara about Edmonton. As nearly as I can gather from the conversation, Mr. Woodsworth has sent an estimate of what it would cost to handle the Japanese. He has put in his full salary and that of his staff. That was scarcely my understanding of what was contemplated, which was more in the line of charging up to the British Columbia Security Commission the difference between what it would cost Woodsworth to run his school if he had no Japanese and what it would cost if he had them. I am a little concerned because from what Mr. MacNamara said over the phone, it looks as if we were profiteering and whilst the Church does not want to lose any money, it does not want to make any extra profit out of it either. I think, of course, that if the suggestion that was made when we were in Ottawa, namely, that we would get together and sit round a table and discuss these matters could have been followed out, it would have obviated some of these difficulties. In any case, Mr. MacNamara has promised to send me the figures which Woodsworth has given him. I expect them tomorrow morning. What I should like you to do on receipt of this letter is to call up Mr. MacNamara and decide whether there would be any value in my going down and talking things over. I could go tomorrow afternoon and spend Friday but I don't want to go unless I have to. I shall be glad if you will wire me before noon on Thursday.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD/HL\nOttawa, July 9, 1942.\n\nReverend George Dorey  \nUnited Church Board of Home Missions  \n299 Queen Street West  \nTORONTO Ontario\n\nMR MacNAMARA CONSIDERS IT UNNECESSARY FOR YOU TO COME TO OTTAWA -stop- REPRESENTATIVE OF BRITISH COLUMBIA SECURITY COMMISSION NOW IN EDMONTON AND WILL MAKE HIS OWN ARRANGEMENTS WITH MR WOODSWORTH\n\nChg.

It was his intention at the time that a number of the Japs might be accommodated at these buildings until arrangements were completed for their distribution throughout the country. He was definite in his statement that the buildings would be required only for the vacation period. This Branch is disposed to think that the matter is one that might be left to the discretion of the British Columbia Security Commission, the Department of Labour, and the churches concerned.

This would prove the extra expense involved. I wrote him that so far as I was concerned we were glad to co-operate providing that it did not interfere with the children's work. He anticipated that the Japanese families would be placed before the opening of School. We could accommodate these families at the present time, but unless they were cleared out before the opening of School it would interfere with the children's return.\n\nI reported this matter to Inspector Hamilton. I do not know if the Commission has taken this up with the Indian Department, but I presume they have. However I would like instructions from you before anything finally definite is done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.T. Chapin\nOttawa,\nAugust 1, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Chapin:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, in which you discuss temporary accommodation that might be provided at your school for certain Japanese families.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter sent forward by me to Inspector Hamilton. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIn view of the acute labour shortage that has developed in the Province of Manitoba, it is not at all likely that the accommodation available at the school will be required for more than a period of a month or so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R.T. Chapin,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nTo Recruit Indians For Harvest\n\nIndians will probably help harvest Saskatchewan's 1942 wheat crop.\n\nAt a meeting of the central committee for organization of farm labor help, held Tuesday afternoon at the legislative buildings, committee members were told by M. Christiansen, general superintendent of Indian affairs for the federal government, that there were 13,000 Indians in the province, many of whom could be made available to help with harvesting.\n\nDiscuss Indians\n\nMr. Christiansen was unable to say exactly how many of these Indians would be available; some of them would be busy on their own farms, he said. Others, he said, could be utilized in the districts adjacent to Indian reserves and in the frontier sections, and for their families could be arranged, still others would be able to assist in harvesting across the province.\n\nThe committee members also discussed the possibilities of bringing Japanese laborers into the province during harvesting time, but no definite decision was reached in this matter.\n\nCommanding officer's representative to the war service, Lt.-Col. A. S. Redford, explained to the committee the effect the August call up of trained men would number 119 per day would have on the available farm labor situation allowing consideration of the possibility of securing postponement and release for those trainees and for men still in the depots. To secure postponement it is necessary for the men to make an application within eight days after he has received notice to report for military training.\n\nTo the Minster\n\nThe conference Tuesday agreed to write Hon. Humphrey Mitchell, minister of agriculture, asking what financial help from the federal government the province could get for accommodating and transporting harvest laborers.\n\nAt the meeting a committee was appointed to make a reconnaissance of the lake in each of the 10 zones. Hon. R. J. M. Parker, minister of mines, who is also minister of agriculture, will be chairman of the committee, consisting of Hon. R. J. McGurrin, W. E. Hodge, L. J. O'Brien, C. A. Scott, R. L. Christopher, F. B. McMurtry, and W. V. Dawson.\n\nMembers of this committee intend to visit the census and provincial offices where reserve committees will be formed, and it was agreed that the mayor of each town, including Prince Albert, Swift Current, North Battleford, Weyburn, Yorkton, and Regina, will be asked to convene the meetings in their districts.\n\nName Sub-Committees\n\nMeanwhile, sub-committees are being formed in the smaller divisions of the province, through rural municipalities, school districts, and local councils. The meetings will be held between now and next Monday, at which time they will be considered by the central committee, meeting of July 27th at 10 a.m., at the legislative buildings.\n\nBesides the zone organization, a committee to study the matter was appointed from the central body. The committee will consist of Mr. Redford, chairman, and F. W. Townley-Smith and D. S. McMurtry as publicists. It will be handled by D. B. Rogers and J. W. Fairley.\n\nSub-committees will be assisted in taking surveys of suitable land in each small area, by a statistical committee consisting of Dr. F. H. Oliver, D. B. Rogers and George Oliver.\n\nIrrigation Is Giving Impetus To Farming On B.C. Indian Reserve\n\nOnce Arid Area in East Kootenay Now Producing Splendid Crops\n\n(From Our Own Correspondent)\n\nCRANBROOK, B.C., July 22\u2014Twenty-five farming properties, operated by Indians on the St. Mary's Indian Reserve, on the east side of the St. Mary's river, reflect the impetus given agriculture on that section of the province. The projects built at a cost of ten to twenty thousand dollars.\n\nFrank Bond of Cranbrook, supervised construction of the five-mile main ditch while a dozen Indians did the rest of the work. From this ditch there are nearly fifteen miles of lateral ditches which serve the twenty-five properties. The irrigation system is available for twice this number of properties and additional at operations are anticipated for the service in the course of time.\n\nNow productive\n\nFormerly the drainage of this section in an average year was such that a large number of acres of hay was destroyed and was not to be expected from the land. With the extra water during the past three years marked improvement has been made in the standard of living and the farming methods which are producing fine crops of good vegetables in quantity and grain crops. Production of beef cattle is becoming the chief agricultural pursuit of the area, now is possible with the aid of the new grasses.\n\nHeadgate of the system is about a mile downstream from the mission, and the main ditch serves from there to the intersection of the St. Mary's and the Kootenay at Fox Creek. The project was planned originally nine decades ago by R. L. Galbraith of Fort Steele, and more recently by Mr. Bond on main ditch. In 1923 it was re-turned and in 1928 work was begun, and in 1929 operation for three years.\n\nAn estimated hundred and fifty acres of land are now under irrigated, and the success of their work indicates that others will start similar projects when there is sufficient water available to serve five or more such properties.\n\nTwo Indians Die When Boat Upsets\n\nMan and Woman Lost and Third Man Rescued by Fireman\n\nBelleville, July 23\u2014An Indian man and woman were drowned early today when their boat upset, capsizing in the Bay of Quinte.\n\nThe dead: Mrs. Gordon Maracle, 5, of Belleville, Ont., eight miles from Belleville; and Gordon Maracle, no relation, also of Shawville. Twenty-year-old Albert Maracle, whose name was not related to the other two, was rescued by Fireman Frank Post as he clung to the overturned boat.\n\nIndians Threaten To Quit Hopfields\n\nVANCOUVER (CP) August 27\u2014Khakhalahtah, spokesman for the Klahoose Indians of British Columbia, said here today 500 tribesmen are ready to \"lie down\" on the hop fields if the government does not increase the rate of cents per pound for picked hops is raised and better living quarters are provided for the workers.\n\nChief Khakhalahtah said Indian hop pickers are offered 4 cents a pound by United States firms, and unless improvements are made the Indians will force the hop fields of British Columbia for those of the United States.\n\n\"They'll go down into the States and pick. Hundreds of them go away. There aren't any barriers at the border to stop their Indians,\" said the spokesman. But, he said, they would rather stay in Canada and pick if they are given an even worse bread for they do not wish to take advantage of a situation caused by a shortage of help.\nMinutes of a Special Session of\nthe Northwest Territories Council\nconducted over the telephone by\nthe Deputy Commissioner on Saturday the 2nd May, 1942.\n\nMembers consulted -\nDr. Charles Camsell (Chairman) - Commissioner,\nMr. A. L. Cumming - Member of Council,\nMr. K. R. Daly - \" \"\nDr. H. W. McGill - \" \"\nCommissioner S. T. Wood - \" \"\n\nNot consulted -\nDr. H. L. Keenleyside - \" \" \" (out of the Capital)\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner explained that Dr. Livingstone strongly recommended Mr. Nels Leland of Aklavik for the management of the restaurant and hotel formerly owned and operated by the late H. E. Peffer. He said the Canadian Credit Men's Trust Association in Edmonton, one of the executors of the Peffer estate, assured the Administration that if a renewal licence is issued the restaurant and hotel will be run in a thoroughly satisfactory manner.\n\nCommissioner Wood remarked that favourable reports as to Mr. Leland's character had been received but the Aklavik Detachment, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, is not disposed to recommend Mr. Leland or any other inexperienced local person for such a responsible position.\n\nMr. Daly expressed the opinion that if Stanley Peffer were allowed to retain any interest in the operation of the restaurant or hotel, there will be criticism and dissatisfaction always.\n\nMoved by Mr. Gibson and seconded by Mr. Cumming that in view of Dr. Livingstone's recommendation and the assurance of the Canadian Credit Men's Trust Association a licence be granted to the Canadian Credit Men's Trust Association for the restaurant subject to immediate cancellation if not operated to the satisfaction of the Administration; and further consideration of the application for a renewal of the hotel licence be deferred until the name of a suitable manager is recommended and approved.

McKeand,\nSecretary.\n\nCharles Camsell,\nCommissioner.\nWord Awaited On Transfer Indian School\n\nOfficials Had Planned Use Building Shelter Japanese\n\nEVACUATION PLAN\n\nOfficials at the Indian Residential School, near St. Albert, said Friday no official word had reached them regarding the proposed taking over of the school for the housing of Japanese from vital coastal defence areas.\n\nOfficials in charge of the removal of Japanese from the coast recently stated that the evacuees would be removed by the end of the month. The Indian school near St. Albert was mentioned as being considered as summer holidays to provide temporary shelter for the evacuees.\n\nSchool officials said they have not yet had word that it was planned to take over the buildings.\n\nWon't House Japs At Indian School\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, principal of the Indian Residential School near St. Albert, said there would be no Japanese arriving to be housed at the school.\n\nNo satisfactory arrangements could be reached between the school management and the British Columbia security commission, in charge of the evacuation of Japanese from the west coast.\n\nIt is \"definite,\" he said, that no Japanese will be housed at the school. Word from Ottawa recently indicated several Indian schools in Alberta would be considered for the purpose of housing the Japanese. It was not known whether other Indian schools still will be used.\n\nAbandon Plan To Use School For Jap Evacuation\n\nEdmonton Journal\n\nFRIDAY, JULY 17, 1942\n\nAbandon Plan To Use School For Jap Evacuation\n\nEdmonton Journal\n\n18-7-42\nrepeated and that no similar further matrimonial offences will occur. If there is a breach of this condition, then the offence which has been condoned is revived. For example, if the husband has been guilty of cruelty and the wife has forgiven him, the wife may bring action for judicial separation on this ground. If, at a later date, however, the husband again commits cruelty, then the wife may bring an action for judicial separation, not only on the ground of the cruelty last committed, but also the cruelty which she forgave.\n\nAdultery condoned may be revived by adultery or by cruelty or by desertion. In other words if adultery has been condoned the subsequent cruelty will revive it. Cruelty condoned may be revived by cruelty or by adultery, but not by desertion. Desertion condoned may be revived by adultery.\n\nIf there has been collusion between the parties, the plaintiff is not entitled to a decree. The term \"collusion\" implies impropriety; arrangement or concerted effort to improperly secure that to which neither of the colluding parties are fully entitled.\n\nIf the plaintiff has himself or herself committed some matrimonial offence the Court has a discretion to refuse to give relief notwithstanding that the defendant has committed an offence of a class for which a decree of judicial separation would normally be granted.\n\nIn an action for judicial separation the Court may make an order as to costs, alimony and custody of children.\n\nThe Court may, upon application grant either interim alimony, permanent alimony or both. Interim alimony is an allowance made to the wife for the purpose of assuring that she will be properly maintained during the course of the action. Permanent alimony is an allowance made upon the conclusion of the proceedings when the wife has been adjudged entitled to the continued support of her husband. The terms \"maintenance\" and \"permanent alimony\" mean the same thing. In addition the Court may award interim disbursements to the wife so that she will have means to carry on the proceedings. In many cases the wife may have no money and the Court can therefore order the husband to make payments to the wife so that she may be able to defend an action or take the action herself. Following the same reasoning the Court may award costs to the wife whether she is plaintiff or defendant and whether successful or not.\n\nIt must be borne in mind however, that interim alimony, permanent alimony or interim disbursements are awarded only where the wife is living separate and apart from her husband and is in some actual need of being supported and maintained. It is also necessary that a valid and subsisting marriage must be established, because if there has been no marriage the wife can have no claim for support or maintenance as a wife.\n\nIn preliminary proceedings, that is in applications for interim alimony or permanent disbursements, it is necessary only to establish a prima facie marriage. A strict proof at this stage of the proceedings is not necessary as long as a prima facie case is made out. However, before permanent alimony can be awarded strict proof of the marriage is essential.\n\nIn making an order as to custody of children the Court invariably treats the interests of the children as paramount. The Court should make such an order as is in the best interest of the children. The guilty party in an action for judicial separation is not necessarily disqualified to custody although cruelty and adultery are common grounds for denying custody. The question the Court must ask is which parent is better qualified to look after the children' physical and moral welfare. The Court may decide that neither parent is a fit and proper person and in such case, the children could be made wards of the Court, and a guardian.\nBUILD SCHOOLS FOR INDIANS\n\nJaps to Take Over Present Structures on Edmonton Reserves\n\nEDMONTON, June 8\u2014Federal government officials were reported today as making plans for the erection of day schools on Indian reserves in this area, in view of the possibility that last winter's take over the Indian industrial school a few miles northwest of Edmonton and the Young Men's Club at St. Albert for housing accommodation for Japanese women and children to be moved from the war defense area.\n\nPoints in the Edmonton Indian agency where day schools are expected to be located include Stony Plain reserve, Wabamun, Calahoo, and Lac Ste. Anne. The schools are to be completed by the beginning of the term next fall. Building operations are expected to begin immediately.\n\nAt the Indian industrial school, where Mr. Woodsworth is principal, an inventory of classroom equipment already is under way. The Japanese students are expected to leave for the reserves as soon as possible after June 15. There are 319 at the industrial school and 180 at the St. Albert school.\n\nMr. Woodsworth is likely to remain in charge of the industrial school in a supervisory capacity, his duties to cover management of the farm and business operations during the period the Japanese are there. Some members of the staff of 11 also are to remain on hand to be called for auxiliary work.\n\nThe reserve comprises 535 acres, of which 500 are under cultivation.\n\nOfficials here had no definite information regarding whether the Japanese will be moved here, but it is understood that workmen will start shortly on major structural alterations to the main buildings.\nNegotiations Pending For Indian Schools\n\nNegotiations are still underway for the taking over of the Winterburn St. Albert Indian residential by the Dominion government, it was learned Thursday.\n\nWhile a certain amount of confusion seems to be the excuse for which the schools are to be used by the government, reliable sources stated that negotiations have been made.\n\nAn announcement was made by Vancouver Monday by the B.C. Secretary, Johnstone, that the plan of evacuation of west coast Japanese, that the scheme for placing the Japs in Indian schools was dropped in British Columbia and abandoned.\n\nOn the other hand, officials at both the St. Albert and Winterburn Indian schools near Edmonton, said that definite word on completed arrangements for the school takeover by the government was expected within the next week. Neither school knew for what purpose it was likely to be used.\n\nNOT CORRECT\n\nThe Rev. F. J. Woodsworth, head of the Indian school, stated that an announcement of the abandonment of the transfer plan was not entirely correct. \"It may be correct in regard to the general taking over of Indian schools, but negotiations for the Winterburn school are still pending. I have no idea when we will receive definite word, nor have I enough information to say more regarding the matter.\"\n\nMother Cass, provincial of the Sisters of Charity of the North West Territories, under whose supervision the St. Albert Indian School is operated, stated that arrangements are being completed by the religious order and Montreal government officials in Ottawa. She stated that she expected final word in the matter in about one week.\n\nJapanese now in the protected area\n\n\"In addition, it is the intention of the commission to enlarge housing facilities in areas adjacent to interior towns now occupied by Japanese in British Columbia.\n\nTENTS ADDED\n\nTo assist the evacuation, 1,000 tents have been acquired by the government where the Japanese can take shelter until they are placed in communities where they can be self-supporting.\n\n\"Many of the Japanese are co-operating now and where future co-operation will be forthcoming, it is anticipated that the commission will be able to assist them in reuniting with their families, including their dependent children.\"\n\nB.C. REPORT\n\nReport of the B.C. Secretary Commission, delivered in Vancouver on Monday was as follows: \"Dr. Lyal Hodgins and Commissioner Mead of the British Columbia Security Commission have just returned from a trip to Eastern Canada in connection with placing the members of the Japanese who have to be evacuated from the protected areas to other provinces.\n\n\"A report has been made to the chairman of the commission who states that satisfactory interviews were conducted with officials of the Alberta, Ontario and Federal Governments which will accelerate the movement of these people from the protected areas.\n\n\"The question of placing Japanese in Interior camps outside of the protected areas discussed and it was found that with one or two exceptions it is not practicable for various reasons.\n\nFARM WORK\n\n\"It is hoped, however, that the commission will be able to establish units in the various provinces for the duration of the war and an assurance was received from the various officials of the provinces of their co-operation.\n\nCANVASS MADE\n\n\"Regarding Ontario, a canvass is now being made by officials of the Department of Agriculture, with the view to locating farms where farm help is urgently required and this will prevent the necessity of breaking up families which has resulted in some opposition to the work of the commission from the...\"\nPrepare Discontinue Two Indian Schools\n\nIndian pupils at the Youville school, St. Albert, are to be moved out to make accommodation for adult women and children from the coast, Numuhsuak, and come from other Indian reserves in the Stony Plain, Wabamun, and neighboring districts. The industrial schools in the city has 130 pupils, who also will be moved for the same reasons; in both cases the preparations for the change are under way.\nExpecting Decision by Ottawa\nOn Future of Indian Schools\nDominion and Church Officials Now Are Negotiating\n\nTWO NEAR EDMONTON\n\nDefinite word from Ottawa concerning plans to take over two Indian schools in the Edmonton area for the housing of Japanese women and children from the British Columbia mainland area is expected during the next few days, it was learned Friday.\n\nMeanwhile negotiations concerning these schools are pending. The buildings involved are the Indian Industrial school 4\u00bd miles northeast of the city, which has 150 pupils enrolled, and the Youville school, operated at St. Albert by the Sisters of Charity, which has 160 Indians.\n\nSome days ago, the B.C. security commission announced that plans for placing the Japanese in certain schools had been abandoned.\n\nInquiries here showed that so far as the two schools in this area are concerned, negotiations still are under way.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodworth, principal of the Indian Industrial school, said that negotiations concerning that school were still going on, and final word was awaited.\n\nWord concerning the outcome of recommendations to take over the schools is expected here during the week-end.\nIndian Schools To Be Used As Japanese Home\n\nThe Edmonton Indian Residential School will be used as a clearing house while the children are away for the summer, and their families will be temporarily housed in the school until they are placed elsewhere.\n\nIt was learned that Ottawa Labor department officials decreed use of the school for this purpose would be on a temporary basis.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. F. Wilson, principal of the school, declared that while he had no immediate word on the Ottawa decision, negotiations for use of the school, commenced some time ago, were continuing.\n\nOfficials of the Columbia Security Commission said yesterday that if present plans materialize, 3,000 or more Japanese in the Pacific coast defense area will be en route to new homes near Hope and near Edmonton within the next fortnight.\n\nThe commission expects that by the end of August the last Japanese will have been evacuated from the Pacific strip. It is planned that 300 Japanese families in leased buildings and farms near Hope, and families in an Indian residential school near Edmonton.\nExpect Japanese From Coast At Indian School in 2 Weeks\n\nDominion Taking One School, Drops Plan to Take Second\n\nWORD IS AWAITED\n\nFirst batch of approximately 50 Japanese families being moved from the British Columbia defence area to the Indian Industrial school, 4\u00bd miles northeast of Edmonton, may arrive within the next two weeks, it was learned Tuesday.\n\nAt the same time it was reported that the Dominion government abandoned plans to make use of the Youville Indian school at St. Albert, Rev. J. F. Woodsworth, principal of the Indian Industrial school, said he has not received definite word as to when the first group will arrive but it was reported from Vancouver that officials of the B.C. security commission stated that the movement will be under way within the next two weeks.\n\nMr. Woodsworth said his information was that the school would be used as a distributing depot. The Japanese would be sent out to various farms where they could be assisted, under policy of keeping the families together.\n\nWhile it was first reported from Olathe that only women and children would be sent to Edmonton, it now appears that the heads of families also will go.\n\nMr. Woodsworth said that there was no thought of establishing Japanese colonies here but to make the people available for farm work and to keep the families together as units.\n\nThe aim will be to bring 50 families or more of Japanese residents to the depot and as these go out to farms others would be brought in until the movement was completed.\n\nThe latest report from the commission expects that by the third week of August, the last Japanese will have been moved off the Pacific strip. It is planned to house 500 Japanese families in leased buildings near Hope, B.C.\n\nAll told, 3,000 of the remaining 9,000 Japanese on the coast will be moved to Hope and to Edmonton, if present plans materialize, according to officials of the B.C. security commission.\nDay School Plan For Reserves Now Indicated\n\nWill Replace Industrial School System for Indians\n\nREADY IN AUTUMN\n\nFederal officials were reported Monday to be making plans for the erection of day schools on Indian reserves in this area in view of the plan announced last week to close over the Indian industrial school 4\u00bd miles northwest of the city and the Youville school at St. Albert for housing accommodation for Japanese women and children now moved from the B.C. protected area.\n\nPlans in the Edmonton Indian agency were day schools to be erected include Stony Plain reserve, Nakawka reserve, and the St. Anne. The schools are to be built in time for the opening of the term next fall. Building operations are expected to commence immediately.\n\nAt the Indian industrial school where J. F. Woodsworth is principal an inventory of class-room equipment already is under way.\n\nThe Indian pupils, it was reported unofficially, are expected to leave for their reserves as soon as possible after June 15. There are 25 at the Industrial school and 10 at the St. Albert school, the latter being operated by the Sisters of Charity.\n\nMr. Woodsworth is likely to remain in charge of the Industrial school in a supervisory capacity, his duties also covering management of the farm and other activities. During the period the Japanese are removed some members of the staff of 11 also will be employed at the school for supervisory work.\n\nThe school comprises 36 acres, of which 500 are under cultivation. In view of the fact that numerous Japanese families are expected to be placed there, the farm operations may be extended so that as much food as possible will be raised.\n\nCottages Likely\n\nCottages are likely to be built at Stony Plain, Nakawka, and also at St. Albert to provide accommodations for the Japanese families, it was reported.\n\nOfficials had no definite information as to whether Japanese will be moved here, but it is understood that workmen will start shortly in making necessary alterations to the main buildings.\nIndian Schools Secured for Japs; 6000 More to Be Moved at Once\n\nInterval remaining before Canada's war-menaced Pacific Coast sees the last of its Japanese population will be markedly reduced.\n\nAnnouncement in the House of Commons Thursday by Hon. Humble Mitchell, Minister of Labor, that 6000 Nipponese will be shifted to Indian residential schools of British Columbia, Alberta, and Manitoba, makes this fact plain.\n\nThere is an excellent chance, in view of the government declaration that the Hastings Park situation will be substantially cleared up by September. By November, the last Jap may be gone from the Vancouver area.\n\nOne of the chief problems involved is that there are 2000 babies to dispose of, children under the age of two. Mr. Mitchell indicated, however, that women and children are being especially considered in the Indian school plans.\n\nExtra accommodation found for them will cut down the total to be carried during the next few months at the Hastings Park clearing grounds.\n\nThe minister's outline of the day after the Japanese hit-and-run raid on Dutch Harbor signalled the first increase in precautionary measures in the British Columbia coastal area.\n\nTotal of resident Japanese moved so far amounts to more than 12,000.

It is necessary to emphasize, also, that during the last three years the following schools have been destroyed by fire:\n\n| School                          | Pupilage |\n|---------------------------------|----------|\n| Alberni Residential, B.C.       | 225      |\n| Carcross \" Yukon                | 40       |\n| Shuswap \" B.C.                  | 70       |\n| Alberni classroom building      |          |\n| File Hills classroom building, Sack. | 100     |\n| Coughswagwa Senior Day School   | 100      |\n| Back Settlement Day School, Nuncy | 20      |\n\nIn addition to this, the Kitsanat Residential School, with an enrolment of 30, was closed immediately following the establishment of an Indian day school at that point. With the single exception of Alberni, where a school was built to replace the one destroyed by fire, no residential schools have been constructed by the Government since I entered the Department five years ago. With the Squamish School now operating as a hospital, we have at this date three residential schools less in operation than have been in operation at any time in recent years.\n\nNo pupilage increases have been allowed at any of our residential schools since the decision to discontinue this practice was reached about 18 months ago. Prior to that decision it was the practice to allow supplementary grants at a number of residential schools for the care of orphan and neglected children. The fact that per capita grant payments are made on a 5% basis has in itself a tendency to restrict the enrolment at a number of our schools.\n\nWith the Indian school population increasing at the rate of approximately 300 pupils per annum, the question of school accommodation is one that cannot be indefinitely postponed.\n\nWe have made temporary provision for the care of the pupils at Carcross by renting a number of houses. The rent paid for this accommodation amounts to $1,140 per annum. At Alberni, temporary accommodation has been provided for the pupils in the basement playrooms of the main building; this accommodation, however, is in a semi-infected state. It means that throughout the winter season, when there is heavy rainfall in the district, pupils have no recreational rooms and no playground that can be utilized at least two or three months. It is difficult to know just what provision can be made for the pupils at File Hills. Mr. Huston, principal of the Round Lake School, who was in charge of the File Hills School for a month immediately following the destruction of the classroom...\nbuilding by fire, was definitely of the opinion that it would be impossible to conduct classes in the dormitory buildings. It would appear that there are no playrooms in the basement of the building and that the only possible space available is the dormitory space. Here, it would appear, the lighting is very poor and the beds, of course, will have to be moved night and morning. From a health standpoint, this condition should be remedied at the earliest possible date.\n\nAt Caughnawaga the pupils formerly enrolled in the Senior School are now accommodated in the basement of the Kateri School and in one room of the teacher's residence. I have before me at the present time a request from the Principal of the Caughnawaga School for an additional building, capable of accommodating a couple of classrooms, which, she informs me, is available and is located almost directly opposite the teacher's residence.\n\nIt is our intention to make provision for the pupils of the Back Settlement section of the Munsey Reserve in the basement of the Anglican Church which, I understand, can be rented for this purpose.\n\nIt is perhaps too early at this date to state in exact terms what accommodation will actually be needed on the Eskasoni and Shubenacadie Reserves, Nova Scotia, and on Lennox Island, P.E.I. Mr. Denot is at present engaged in an educational survey of these reserves and will supply us with more complete information in the course of a few weeks. It would appear, however, that regardless of any recommendations he may make, provision should be made in the 1943-44 estimates for the construction of additional school accommodation on these reserves.\n\nThe construction of Indian day or residential schools in a period as critical as the one in which we find ourselves is in my judgment a matter of government policy. I have not at my disposal the information necessary to make a definite recommendation. A great deal will depend, I should think, upon the supply of building material and the number of skilled labourers available for such work. I naturally hesitate to assume responsibility for a continuance of the policy now in force. I do feel the whole matter should be very carefully and very thoroughly reviewed at a conference called for this purpose.\n\nR. A.

A. Dixon, General Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nWhen the Carcross Residential School was destroyed by fire on April 17, 1939, an assurance was given to the Anglican Church authorities that the school would be rebuilt just as soon as the funds necessary for this purpose could be secured, and that in the interval funds would be provided to rent two or three houses that appeared available at that time for the conduct of classes and for dormitory accommodation. These houses have recently been condemned as insanitary by the Medical Health officer of the district, who issued an order that the building be closed. Later, however, the building was re-opened with an enrolment of 20 rather than 40 pupils.\n\nI am not at all sure that we are justified in spending at this particular time, or indeed at any time, the sum of $10,000 on the education of 20 pupils. This per capita grant does not include money paid for a night watchman or for incidental expenses such as repairs, the purchase of textbooks, etc. I am disposed to think, without knowing much about local conditions, that this money might be more profitably spent in the establishment of one or two day schools at certain centres and in the employment of a nurse, qualified to give instruction in dietetics, etc.\n\nMr. Phelan and I have spent the last week in carefully reviewing the requests received for the repair and general upkeep of our residential school buildings. The appropriation available in the 1943-44 estimates is sufficient to meet no more than 50% of the amounts requested. In addition to these requests, however, there are requests for new buildings, particularly from the Anglican Church, and requests from all the churches for the new buildings necessary for the promotion of vocational instruction. Therefore, unless the Government is in a position to provide the funds necessary to meet these requests, I am of the opinion that it would be sheer folly to build additional residential schools anywhere in the Dominion. The policy of the Government in respect to the construction of Indian day and residential schools has never been clearly defined at any time since I entered the Department. In this connection I should like to\nrefer to my memorandum to you on the operation of residential schools, dated May 31, 1940. In view of the fact that representatives of the churches have made arrangements to meet the Minister toward the end of December, with the object of discussing with him the desirability of a substantial increase in the present per capita grant allowances, it has occurred to me that the policy of the Government in respect to the building of residential schools and the operation of these schools might very well be reviewed prior to the Minister's interview with the representatives of the churches.\n\nIn respect to the request submitted by Canon Dixon, my recommendation is that a special grant be made to the Carcross school to enable this school to operate without loss during the present academic year and that this grant be made on the understanding that the school will cease to operate on the 30th of June, next. I recommend, also, that the Church be told definitely that it is not our intention to rebuild the residential school in the Yukon Territory at any time during the years immediately ahead of us.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nMISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN CANADA\n\nThe church House - 604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 5, Ont.,\nNovember 11, 1942.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wired to you from St. John, N. B., with reference to the critical situation which had arisen in the school at Carcross. I have since received a copy of Mr. Hoey's letter of October 21st to Dr. Westgate informing him that it had been decided to reduce the pupilage in the school from 40 to 20.\n\nIn connection with the decision which has thus been made I would draw your attention to the statement in my aforementioned telegram that to reduce the numbers of children in the school would seriously increase the operating costs.\n\nThe per capita rate for the Carcross school is $250.00. With the discharge of 20 pupils this means a corresponding annual loss in income of $5000.00. While there will be some savings on items like food and clothing, the major items of expense, namely staff and overhead, will remain unchanged. Thus, whereas with a pupilage of 40 the per capita grant was sufficient to run the school, with the pupilage reduced to 20, the same per capita rate must result in heavy loss.\n\nI write to ask, therefore, that under these special circumstances the Government will see its way to assume responsibility for this loss - or at least a considerable part of it.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd.) L. A. Dixon\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister\n\nYou will find attached a memorandum dated November 16 submitted to me by Mr. Hoey and dealing with the operation of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nThe facts set forth and the observation made by Mr. Hoey have a much wider application than to the question of the Carcross school itself. Mr. Hoey refers to his memorandum dealing with the general question of residential schools dated May 31, 1940. I have carefully re-read this memorandum and have discussed the matter with Mr. Hoey and Mr. Phelan.\n\nI am in full agreement with the views held by the officials in charge of Indian education that the time has come when a definite decision should be reached regarding our policy in respect to residential schools. I hold, and have long held the opinion that the educational requirements of the vast majority of Indians could be met by day schools to the decided benefit of the Indians and to the financial advantage of the taxpayer.\n\nAs it has been pointed out very plainly by Mr. Hoey many times, both verbally and in writing, our vote for several years past has not been sufficient to keep these buildings in a proper state of repair. A steady deterioration is taking place in our physical equipment and the question must be decided whether we are to go forward in developing a residential school system or to direct our efforts in another direction.\n\nLately I have been disagreeably impressed by a number of police reports concerning truancy from these schools.\n\nIn Mr. Hoey's memorandum of May 31, 1940, mentioned above, you will note his recommendation that a number of dilapidated residential schools that are costly to repair and operate be closed and Indian day schools be substituted therefore. On page 9, paragraph 2, of the same report you will note the figures he gives showing that the amount saved in one year in per capita grants through the closing of certain residential schools would almost meet the cost of building Indian day schools to take care of the pupils affected.\n\n(over)\nI am in full agreement with Mr. Hoey's recommendation that a number of these residential schools be closed, and day schools substituted therefore. I would suggest that as soon as war regulations regarding building materials permit, the building of day schools and the closing of certain residential schools be proceeded with, in accordance with the plans and recommendation made by Mr. Hoey and outlined above.\n\nSeveral days ago, a letter was received from Bishop Geddes of the Yukon, dealing with the Carcross school and carrying the suggestion that a system of day schools might be introduced into the Yukon.\n\n(Signed) Harold W. McGill\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nI am enclosing a report dated December 17 submitted by Doctor Moore, covering a tour of official visits made in Western Ontario.\n\nIt is to Doctor Moore's report on the Mount Elgin Institute that I would particularly draw your attention. These remarks should be considered together with the observations of Mr. Howey made upon the same subject and referred to in my memorandum to you of November 25, 1942.\n\n(Signed) H.W.

LTD., WESTON, ONT.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLYING PLASTIC ROCK NO. 225-100\n\nPlastic Rock should be applied to a depth not greater than 1/2\". If it is necessary to apply same to a greater depth, it would be advisable to put it down in two coats.\n\nThe room temperature where applied should not be under 45\u00b0Fahr. Be sure to keep contents of barrels from freezing.\n\nCLEANING SURFACE\n\n1. Clean all grease and loose dust from the floor before applying the bond.\n\n2. APPLYING BOND TO WOOD FLOORS. When applying bond to wood floors, first add about half a pint of water to the gallon can. Then trowel a light coat to the surface. Allow to dry until it loses its tackiness and can be walked upon without lifting, before applying Plastic Rock. A good plan is to apply the bond the night before the job is to be done.\n\n3. APPLYING BOND TO CONCRETE FLOORS. First moisten the floor with water. Add about one quart of water to the gallon of bond then apply with a broom or brush, allowing same to dry before applying Plastic Rock.\n\n4. MIXING THE PLASTIC ROCK. First dry mix the rock and setting powder together. Then thoroughly mix in 3 gallons of water. The balance of the water required for the mix, namely 5 gals., should be mixed into the 5 gals. of paste. In other words, the total mix will include 5 gals. of water to the 5 gals. of the paste supplied. Now thoroughly mix the paste into the aggregate until the colour is uniform throughout. If the trowelled floor shows dark spots, you can rest assured it requires more mixing. The mixing can be done very fast with a small portable concrete mixer.\n\nWe find 5/16\" iron depth strips best suited for laying the Plastic Rock for a \u00bd\" floor.\n\nIf you should find the mix a bit heavy to trowel, an extra pint or so of water may be added.\n\n5. ROLLING THE SURFACE\n\nA harder surface may be secured by rolling same with a water filled lawn roller while the floor is still partially set, usually in about 8 to 14 hours from the time it is laid.\nPLASTIC-ROCK FLOORING\n\n(FULLY PROTECTED BY U.S. AND CANADIAN PATENTS)\n\nCANADIAN LICENSEES\nTHE STORRAR MANUFACTURING CO.\nLIMITED\nWESTON, CANADA\n\nUNITED LABORATORIES, INC.\nCLEVELAND, OHIO\nProcess 290\nEffective April 1, 1938.\n\nGENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MIXING AND APPLYING\nPLASTIC ROCK UNITS\n\nNOTE: This sheet is furnished merely to illustrate the various steps necessary to follow when mixing and applying Plastic Rock Units of various sizes and grades. We also furnish specific directions for patching, waterproofing, etc. When requesting specific directions, please give all particulars such as type of base, wood, concrete, brick interior or exterior and whether used for pedestrian or heavy duty truck traffic.\n\n1. THE UNIT: Your Plastic Rock Units come to you complete. Each ingredient is exactly in proper proportion, in its own container, all packed in one Unit. All Units contain rock, setting powder, asphalt paste and bond. Open the Unit and remove the setting powder, asphalt paste and bond. The BOND is used first.\n\n2. BONDING: Sweep the floor clean and moisten it with water. Add a quart of water to each gallon of Bond and dump the mixture over the moistened floor. Each gallon of Bond, PLUS the quart of water, should cover 100 sq. ft. Scrub it into the surface, with a back and forth movement of the brush. Leave it rough and let it dry. Floor may be bonded the day before if desired.\n\nMIXING\n\n3. MIXING THE ROCK AND SETTING POWDER: The mixing should be done on a clean spot on a concrete floor or in a metal or watertight mortar box. Dump all of the rock in a pile. Sprinkle the setting powder over it. Mix the rock and powder thoroughly by turning it over at least three times while dry.\n\n4. ADDING THE WATER: Pull the rock and powder away from the center of the pile, forming a basin, as shown in Fig. 4. Depending upon the type and size of Unit, add water as shown below:\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: Measure the water carefully and use:\n\nFor Unit No. A-225-100 \u2014 \u00bd\" Heavy Duty, 5 gallons\nFor Unit No. A-225-20 \u2014 \u00bd\" Heavy Duty, 1 gallon\nFor Unit No. A-225-10 \u2014 \u00bd\" Heavy Duty, 2 quarts\nFor Unit No. A-221-100 \u2014 \u00bc\" Light Duty, 4 gallons\nFor Unit No. A-221-25 \u2014 \u00bc\" Light Duty, 1 gallon\nFor Unit No. A-229-200 \u2014 \u215b\" Light Duty, 4 gallons\nFor Unit No. A-229-50 \u2014 \u215b\" Light Duty, 1 gallon\n\n(Directions continued on reverse side)\n5. **WETTING THE ASPHALT PASTE:** After mixing flatten out the pile of wet rock and powder. Remove the asphalt paste from the package with trowel or shovel and smear it over the wet rock and powder as shown in Fig. 5.\n\nSplash water over the paste, using NOT MORE than amount specified below.\n\nFor Unit No. A-225-100\u20141/2 gallon. For Unit No. A-221-25 \u2014 1 pint.\nFor Unit No. A-225-20 \u2014 1 pint. For Unit No. A-223-200\u20141/2 gallon.\nFor Unit No. A-225-10 \u2014 1/2 pint. For Unit No. A-223-50 \u2014 1 pint.\nFor Unit No. A-221-100\u20141/2 gallon.\n\n6. **MIXING:** Now mix the wet asphalt paste and the wet rock and powder together by turning over the mass with shovels and cutting it through as shown in Fig. 6. MIXING MUST BE THOROUGH. No lumps of asphalt paste should appear in the complete mixture. It is usually necessary to turn over the entire mass about four times. Careless mixing will cause soft, sticky spots to appear in the finished floor, due to lumps of asphalt paste not being properly mixed with the aggregate.\n\n7. **SCREEDING AND FLOATING:** If coarse Plastic Rock (No. 225) is being used, depth strips should be 3/8\" thick. If fine Plastic Rock (No. 221) is being used, depth strips should be 3/16\" thick. The thickness of the depth strips is very important. It regulates the uniform distribution of the mix. Strips are usually laid from 6 to 8 feet apart. The Plastic Rock mix is dumped between them distributed with a garden rake, and then levelled with a levelling board. See Fig. 7 at left. (No depth strips are needed when Plastic Rock No. 221 is used.)\n\nThe levelling board is usually 2' x 6' about 8 to 10 feet long, having a straight, smooth edge. It rests on the depth strips and the mix is leveled by riding the board back and forth across the strips with a forward motion. Fill any low spots with the mix evenly distributed across until surface is level. The levelling mix is then compacted to correct any imperfections and to fill voids. Now let the floor alone until it takes its initial set which may take several hours.\n\n8. **FINISHING:** If a smooth finish is desired, the floor may be steel troweled, otherwise rolling traffic will roll it smooth. Cement finishers may begin troweling when their knees do not sink into the floor. FOR AN EXTRA SMOOTH FINISH, mix a small Unit of Plastic Rock No. 223 to the mortar consistency and apply as a very thin mololithic finish (about 1/4\" deep). Use the James Plastic Rock surfaces. This mortar mixture merely serves to fill any small voids or rough spots in the No. 225 surfacing. A Plastic Rock No. 225 floor may thus be made as smooth as glass by expert finishers.\n\n**PUTTING THE FLOOR INTO SERVICE**\n\nThe floor may be opened to traffic when dry or when sufficiently hard to withstand loads without marking.\n\n**CURING AND COMPRESSING.**\n\nA Plastic Rock floor never becomes brittle hard as compared to the hardness of concrete, brick or stone. During the first 30 days of its life, a perfect Plastic Rock floor may appear to be too soft to withstand heavy loads on steel wheels. This should cause no concern because the floor is in its \"curing\" stage. During this \"curing\" stage, the more traffic it receives the more quickly it will become thoroughly compacted. A Plastic Rock floor, under rolling traffic, automatically compacts to a density which is normal for the traffic conditions to which it is subjected.\n\n**WHEN USING A CONCRETE MIXER:**\n\nA standard \"one bag\" mixer will mix 100 sq. ft. of Plastic Rock No. 225 per batch. Pour Plastic Rock and settler powder into the mixer drum. The water is then added all at one time. Use same quantities of water as shown above and on reverse side. MIX THOROUGHLY before adding asphalt paste. Then mix 3 minutes or more after paste has been added. NEVER add asphalt paste to any DRY rock or powder.\n\n**SPLITTING BATCHES:**\n\nIf any Unit is to be mixed in two or more batches, instead of all at one time, remove ALL the Plastic Rock aggregate from the package and turn it over several times to thoroughly mix the fine and coarse rock which may become separated in transit. The fine particles usually settle to the bottom of the package.\n\n**SURFACES EXPOSED TO WEATHER:**\n\nWhen Plastic Rock is to be exposed to weather and at the same time used for steel wheel traffic, apply a coat of Certified Emulsion No. 322. Use 1 gallon per 100 sq. ft. Scatter dry, fine sand into the coating as it is spread. Let traffic embed it into place.\nOttawa,\nMay 10, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Storrar:\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you would send a copy of all information you have on Plastic-Rock Flooring to Rev. G. Forcade, Crouard Indian Residential School, Crouard, Alta. They have been complaining of a very dusty floor in their playroom and on several occasions have requested linoleum or something in order to obviate the dusty effect. I would also greatly appreciate it if you would send me the same, as the last you sent to me have been disposed of.\n\nAs mentioned to you at the time of your last visit to Ottawa, I desire to finish the basement floors of three rooms at the Restigouche School in Quebec. You mentioned that it would be possible to have a man supervise the laying of these three floors. They will be ready to lay these floors, I would imagine, toward the end of June or the beginning of July. I hope to be able to notify you several weeks in advance so that you may have ample time to see that this work is carried out satisfactorily. This test will mean a great deal for the future use of this material in our schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Manager,\nStorrar Manufacturing Co. Ltd.,\nWeston, Ont.\n\nR.A.

The total cost per pupil for the former, you will note, is $168.28. For this amount the Church, in operating the schools have supplied food, clothing, instruction. In the case of church-owned buildings, shelter is also provided by the churches. A large proportion of the cost involved in the transportation of pupils from Indian reserves to the residential schools is also borne by the church authorities.\n\nI should like to direct your attention particularly to the last two items of the summarized statement. You will note that the cost of new buildings and repairs at government-owned schools amounted to $8.36 per pupil and that repairs and new buildings at church-owned schools amounted to $5.18. This higher figure, I may state, is due almost wholly to the expenditures necessary for the construction of a new residential school at Sturgeon Lake. These particular expenditures for the year under review amounted to $5,391.30. Plans and specifications of this building were submitted a few weeks ago to the officials of this Branch, for approval. The new building, which when completed will be semi-fireproof, appears to be very satisfactory. We were assured by the Bursar of the Diocese, who submitted the plans, that wages alone in the construction of this school during the spring and summer months exceeded $1,000 per month.\n\nDirector.\n## Residential School Expenditure - Fiscal Year 1942-43\n\n| Category                                      | Total Expenditure | Authorised Pupilage | Cost per Pupil |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| All Residential Schools (Fiscal Year 1942-43) | $1,435,796.97     | 8520                | $168.28        |\n| Equipment & Repairs                           | 20,554.70         | 8520                | 2.41           |\n| New Buildings & Repairs                       | 32,975.55         | 8520                | 3.87           |\n| Equipment & Repairs R.C.

Mr. Hoey suggests the possibility of heating the residence by a pipeless furnace, but in our opinion better distribution is afforded by the use of leaders, ducts and registers, to the various rooms.\n\nIt will be recalled that a six-roomed house designed for use as an Indian Agent's residence at Lennox Island, Prince Edward Island, was considered satisfactory as a typical Indian Agent's residence. Indian Affairs have copies of these drawings, and it is suggested that consideration be given to using the same drawings as an alternative design for teachers' residences. The cost for the alternative, under the same circumstances would also approximate $8,000.\n\nThese estimated costs would be increased on buildings located on isolated sites.\n\nIf a building as shown on the attached prints, is considered satisfactory, one print should be initialed and returned to this Service for our records, and further use.\n\nEnc.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.M.

In the meantime, may I suggest that you get an appreciation of the two systems from the Fairbanks-Morse Company in Winnipeg.\n\nPersonally, I believe that the system without batteries has many advantages over the one with batteries. However, this is only personally and I am not an electrical engineer. Their opinions may be different. However, many of these plants are made in the States and if they were not giving satisfaction I can hardly see why they would be kept on the market.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J.

Wear and tear is heavy on the automatic type because of its many starts and stops often times only carrying a very small load, e.g., one lamp. Generating machinery should be loaded with a load at least equal to one-third (1/3) of its rated capacity and is still more efficient when operated at or near its full rated capacity.\n\nIn any case batteries are required as starting batteries. These generally become a nuisance unless they are the main storage batteries. When the engine is started often and generates for only a short time the starting batteries become run down and are useless until charged. Since the main storage battery is due and receives regular attention, nuisances such as this are eliminated as long as the plant is in operating condition.\n\nA high quality, long life battery of the iron clad type is most essential to successful operation of a storage battery type of plant, since it has greater efficiency throughout its life and provides greater economy.\n\nIf you have any special application we would be pleased to receive information in regard to it and to advise you thereon.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.

The correct address is:\n\nWar Assets Corporation,\nP. O. Box 6098, Montreal, Que.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2B, Ont.\nOttawa, December 7, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY,\n\nOn November 30 I gave you a draft of the Estimates for \"Indian Education\" for the fiscal year 1946-47. Under the heading \"Structures and Parts - New Construction\" there was included a request for certain day schools at a total estimated cost of $390,000.00.\n\nOn his return to the office this week from an inspection trip, Mr. Arnell brought to my attention the situation at Serpent River Reserve, located near Cutler, Ont. - Electoral District of Algoma East.\n\nSeveral years ago the school was destroyed by fire and since that time it has been using a former Indian house as a school. This building has now reached a stage where it is practically impossible to repair it. There are approximately 35 children of school age there. Mr. Arnell strongly recommends that provision be made in the Appropriation for the fiscal year 1946-47 for a combined school and teacher's residence on this reserve.\n\nThis would involve an additional amount of $8,000.00. I would appreciate having your authority to include this with the other proposed new schools.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enquire whether the Department has arrived at any conclusion as to the supplying of mid-day meals at the day schools in the future.\n\nThere does not seem to be a clear cut policy in this connection and while I am aware that the payment of family allowance money should act as an extra so far as the Indians are concerned I do not think that the Department should lose sight of the fact that many of our Indian day school teachers are spending too much time in the preparation of the mid-day meal for the children when some of this responsibility might be thrown back on the parents now in receipt of family allowance money.\n\nI think that it goes further than the actual supplying of a meal to the children going to school. I believe that if the school teacher supplied soup or a hot drink and biscuits and in addition kept a fairly close check on the contents of lunch boxes which the children are bringing to school it would give an indication to the teacher and the information could be passed on to the farming instructor and Indian Agent as to the kind of food that is being prepared in the Indian homes.\n\nIn nearly all Indian homes where children are attending school there are usually younger children not yet of age to attend. If the mother is required to prepare a reasonable lunch for the child or children going to school she must, of necessity, be doing a reasonable amount of cooking and baking which will be beneficial to the children at home.\n\nI do not wish to have my ideas conflict with the intentions with respect to payment of family allowances but I think that we should make use of the payment of family allowances wherever possible to improve the living conditions of the children in their homes as well as the children going to school.\n\nMany of the Indian women are quite able to prepare a good meal if they have the inclination to do so but many are quite willing to give their children almost any kind of a meal which will not give them too much trouble and let the mid-day meal at the school make up.......\nmid-day meal at the school make up the difference. I am sure it is the intention that the money received through family allowances should be considered an extra only to this extent.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nJanuary 31, 1946.\n\nThe Director,\n\nThe Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nFor some time I have been wondering whether it would be possible to arrange to have our building programme commence earlier in the year than has been done in the past. If construction could commence, say early in May, it would be possible to have the buildings completed by September or earlier, and this is particularly important in the case of schools which open on or about September 1.\n\nWould it be possible to make arrangements to invite tenders in March for buildings, the plans and specifications for which are complete, and award contracts immediately after April 1 when money is available in the new fiscal year's appropriation.\n\nYou have in your office copies of the Schedules (A) required by the Department of Reconstruction for our 1946-47 building programme. It was hoped that it would be possible to carry out this programme in its entirety, but we realise that certain conditions, such as the shortage of staff at Ottawa, scarcity of materials and labour, etc., may prevent the realisation of our wishes. However, as some of the plans and specifications are complete I should like to know whether tenders could be called in March for these buildings and in April or soon after for others for which the plans are perhaps not entirely completed. The buildings which are of primary importance are listed below:\n\nKahsami Indian Reserve, N.S.\nSchool, teachers' residence and water system.\nR.C.M.P. residence.\n\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nResidence for Indian Agent, combined office and warehouse,\nClerk's residence.\nTeachers' residence, Principal's residence.\nWater system.\n\nGardiner Agency, Ont.\nFour classroom Day School.\n\nSix Nations, Ont.\nR.C.M.P. Barracks.\nAt the Eskasoni Reserve, as you probably know, we are proceeding as rapidly as possible with the moving of the Indians to this reserve. The agency residence, office and warehouse, Principal's residence are built. When it is possible for these buildings to be occupied the Agent will be able to give adequate supervision and direction on the reserve. However, we have a number of children of school age on the reserve and no school for them. We will be criticised if the school is not erected and ready for operation by September 1, 1946. The school cannot be operated until the teachers' residence is provided, as there is no place in which the teachers can live.\n\nAt the Sinibouacan Reserve the Indians have moved as quickly as houses could be erected for them. The school is in operation, but it is being operated by lay teachers. The men cannot move to the reserve for teaching purposes until their residence is built and the Principal's residence is also needed. The agency staff cannot give the proper supervision to the Indian population or administer the affairs of the agency until quarters are provided.\n\nAt the Caradoc Agency, Ont., owing to the condition of the Mount Elgin Residential School it is felt that it would be impracticable to spend a large sum of money to repair this building. Consequently it has been agreed with the United Church of Canada to close this school at the end of June. We have promised that we will erect and operate a four-room day school in its place. For this building, for which plans may not have been commenced, it is suggested that the plan of the St. Catherine School be used. Possibly some slight changes to suit local conditions might be required, but in the main the plan is suitable.\n\nI realise that the time of your architectural staff has to be divided to meet the needs of all the branches of this department, and that only a certain amount of time can be spent on Indian Affairs work. It would be appreciated, however, if that time could be spent on the projects mentioned above in an effort to have them completed during 1946.\nI trust that I am not leaving with you the impression that I am not interested in buying the other buildings on our programme erected in 1946. There are many places where, at the moment, I cannot see just what can be arranged so that our staffs will be housed. There is a crying need for residence for the Clerk at the Fisher River Agency, Man., at the Saddle Lake Agency, Alta., there is no place for the Clerk to live - the buildings at the Lesser Slave Lake Agency are not suitable or tenable and a new site at High Prairie, Alta., has been acquired - we have no buildings or offices for our staff at Fort St. John, B.C., and at St. Regis, Que., the Agent has had to move into Cornwall as the agency residence has been condemned for residence purposes. These are just a few of our more urgent and immediate needs, not to mention the school programme all the projects on which are required.\n\nIf there is any way in which the officials of my staff can assist or co-operate with your officials in order to facilitate our work, I shall be glad to arrange this if you will inform me what information is required or what they can do to help. I know that for the last decade the building programme has been so curtailed that we are now in the unhappy position of requiring everything at once and that you have not the staff to handle such a volume of work. I will welcome any suggestions you care to make so that we may be helpful.\n\nI should appreciate knowing whether it is possible for your branch to take care of the projects at the locations mentioned early in the new fiscal year.\n\nIt is my understanding that a meeting will be held at the office of the Minister to discuss the subject matter of this memorandum at the earliest possible date.\n\nM.W.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\n|                | Original Estimate | Expenditure | Over   |\n|----------------|-------------------|-------------|--------|\n| Moose Fort     | 500.00            | 510.45      | 10.45  |\n| Spanish        | 1,000.00          | 1,077.59    | 77.59  |\n| Vermilion      | 650.00            | 695.39      | 45.39  |\n| Fort Resolution| 1,300.00          | 2,207.98    | 907.98 |\n|                |                   |             | 1,041.41|\n\nThe above amount was secured as follows:\n\n|                | Voted | Expended | Under |\n|----------------|-------|----------|-------|\n| Aklavik R.C.   | 700.00| 591.94   | 108.06|\n| Providence Mission | 800.00| 414.58   | 385.42|\n| Maintenance of Equipment | 1,000.00| 452.07   | 547.93|\n|                |       |          | 1,041.41|\nFebruary 7, 1946.\n\nPRICES FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL\n\nApproval for the expenditure of the sum of $22,250.00 for the purchase and maintenance of equipment, repairs and improvements for the following Church-owned Indian Residential Schools: Fort George R.C., and Fort George R.C.

I refer in this connection to the following:\n\n| Originally Presented | Total Expenditure |\n|----------------------|-------------------|\n| 1. Moose Fort, Ontario | $500.00           |\n| 2.

Providence Mission, N.W.T. | $800.00      |\n| 7. Maintenance of equipment at any or all Church-owned schools | $1,000.00 |\n\nThe only apparently heavy over-expenditure is case of the Fort Resolution School. This arose mostly the fact that materials to the value of $793.80, ordered fiscal year 1944-45, were not delivered until the fall of 1945-46 and, consequently, had to be paid from the\nfor the current fiscal year. The amount of $793.40 was available in the appropriation for 1944-45 but lapsed.\n\nA similar Order-in-Council was secured in the last fiscal year; see P.C. 100/7505 of September 27, 1944.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.\n\nPP\nFebruary 20th 1946.\n\nR.A.

HOEY\n\nEquipment for Residential Schools -\nHand Potato Peelers.\n\nI have today had a visit from Mr. Whittle of the Hobart Manufacturing Company, who specialize in the construction of kitchen machines.\n\nWe had a thorough discussion on the use of hand potato peelers, both in civilian establishments and their projected use in our residential schools. Mr. Whittle pointed out that the Hobart Company no longer manufactures a hand potato peeler, for the following reasons:\n\n(a) A mechanical peeler does the work of three hand peelers.\n\n(b) A hand peeler is made with cast iron gears and is without ball bearings. This makes it a very difficult machine to operate. In fact, it would be almost impossible for children of school age to turn the handle.\n\n(c) The Canadian Army discarded the use of such hand peelers after using them for about a year. They found that these machines did not stand up to the heavy usage which they were given and, in general, proved unsatisfactory. They adopted, eventually, the mechanical peeler.\n\nMr. Whittle has recently been discharged from the Canadian Army, in which he served as Chief Equipment Officer with the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps Catering Branch. Therefore, I feel that his recommendations can be taken as...\nnot only those of a commercial representative but of a man who has had considerable experience in the use and installation of kitchen equipment. The attached catalogue lists two small machines which would be of use in our schools:\n\n(a) Bench type peeler, approximate cost $200.00 -\n(flag 1 down)\n\n(b) Pedestal peeler, approximate cost $216.00 -\n(flag 2 down).\n\nBernard F.

Hand operated peelers have never been handled by us and from our experience we have found that they do not always prove very satisfactory.\n\nWe have a representative Mr. Whittle, 352 Laurier Ave. W., Ottawa, who has just returned to us after serving several years as a Major in the R.C.A.S.C. and we are today writing requesting that he get in touch with you and give you full information on machines that we handle.\n\nThanking you for your enquiry and assuring that you'll hear from Mr. Whittle within the next 2 or 3 days, we remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTHE HOBART MANUFACTURING COMPANY LIMITED\n\nJ.H.

Neary.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nPursuant to our conversation yesterday, regarding Potato Peelers for use in Welfare and Training Schools, you will recall that I expressed considerable doubt as to the practicality of Hand-operated machines for this purpose. In this respect I would like to summarize briefly the reasons that have convinced me that a peeler of this type would not be practical for your purpose:\n\n1. In my position as \"Officer in Charge - Kitchen Equipment\" during the war, attached to Canadian Army Headquarters, I had ample opportunity to observe the effectiveness of hand-operated peelers. I can state, without hesitation, that machines of this type are not satisfactory. They are not well made. This leads to frequent breakdowns and consequently excessive repair work and requests for parts.\n\n2. Hand machines can be operated only by strong, healthy men. Even then considerable objection is made to operating them because the physical exertion required is excessive.\n\n3. The hand-operated machine saves very little time.\n\nI feel sure, Mr. Neary, that the more you investigate this question the more convinced you will be, as I am, that hand-operated machines will do little to solve your problem. Hand-operated machines are practically obsolete where hydro-electric power is available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE HOBART MANUFACTURING CO., LTD.\n\nDistrict Sales Manager.\n\nMEMBER OF THE CANADIAN MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION\n\nLICENSE NO. 2339\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. P.

Have you a cut of the design? Are they considered satisfactory? Is the price in line with other similar equipment? Is it the Department's policy to encourage the penitentiary program of work in the future by placing orders for equipment or should we only consider the regular sources of supply?\n\nA. C.

The amounts mentioned for the schools are exactly the same as the estimate detailed originally presented to Treasury Board, with the exception of the Braine-skin Residential School in the Province of Alberta. The amount of $1,000.00 was specifically provided for this school, but owing to the necessity for paying accounts for supplies that had been ordered previous to March 31, 1946, it was found necessary to expend at this school the amount of $1,507.57. The over-expenditure of $507.57 has been taken from the amount of $1,000.00 provided for maintenance of equipment at any or all church-owned residential schools, leaving a balance in this particular item of $492.43, which from previous experience will be sufficient.\n\nA similar Order-in-Council was secured in the last fiscal year; see P C 41/692, dated March 1, 1946.\n\nEML.\n\nPP\nOttawa, September 24, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nAttention - Mr. Buck\n\nHerewith the Interim Report on Elementary Schools as prepared by the Committee on Planning, Construction and Equipment of Schools in Ontario.

E. Moore,\nMedical Services.\n\nInterim Report on Elementary Schools\n\nFurther to our conversation of recent date, concerning the construction of combined nursing stations and day schools, I would like to have you look over the attached report.\n\nThe Ontario Department of Education set up a committee on the planning, construction and equipment of schools with Dr. Arthur of the University of Toronto as its chairman. Their interim report is the one attached and is of great advantage to us in the planning of our schools.\n\nOn pages 7, 8 and 9 are illustrated the three classrooms that are more or less standard. The type which we prefer is Classroom C, as we do not favour the use of double rows of seats, as used in Classrooms A and B.\n\nI would be very interested in the reaction of your Architect to this report and would appreciate having an opportunity to discuss it with him at some future date.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. Gordon Hughes,\nChief, Hospital Design Div.\nJackson Bldg.\n\n1-1-5\n\nNov. 6/46\n\nAttached please find a memorandum from the Superintendent of Welfare & Training, and a booklet on School Design.

So far as we are concerned, we shall endeavour to bring before you in good time any matters in which we feel the need of assistance and shall instruct our principals to undertake no obligations of this kind until the authority of the Department has been obtained.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Alderwood\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa, February 4th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48 we are requesting funds for the erection of the undermentioned schools in the Province of British Columbia.\n\n1. Babine Agency - Hazelton Reserve\n   2 room school with teachers' residence attached $15,000.\n\n2. Bella Coola - Kelmutu Reserve\n   1 room school with teacher's residence attached $8,000.\n\n3. Kwawkewlth - Cape Mudge\n   1 room school with teacher's residence attached $8,000.\n\n4. Lytton - Seabird Island Reserve\n   1 room school with teacher's residence attached $8,000.\n\n5. New Westminster - Pemberton Reserve\n   Extension to present school $3,500.\n\nAs you will realize, when we prepare the estimates for the coming fiscal year, we are confronted by demands for new schools from all parts of the Dominion. Unfortunately, we cannot supply all of these in one fiscal year and from a study of the estimates submitted from the Agents in British Columbia, we felt that those mentioned above were most necessary. However, if you feel some other reserve should receive a preference, we would be glad to have your recommendation and give it every possible consideration.\n\nWe are under the impression that it may not be necessary to provide teachers' living quarters at Hazelton School. In that event, it is possible that the building would cost less than the estimated amount.\nto: Major D.M. MacKay  \nFebruary 4th, 1947.\n\nWe would like to have your opinion on the possibility of securing contractors to quote on the buildings mentioned. Possibly in some districts it may be necessary to erect the school by day labor. If so, you might let us have as much information as you have available.\n\nIt is hoped that you will find it possible to let us have your report by the end of the current month as we would like to have construction started as soon as possible after the beginning of the next fiscal year.\n\nBernard F. Neary  \nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. G.H. Ferguson,\nChief, Public Health & Engineering Div.\n621 Jackson Bldg.\n\nFeb. 1/47\n\nHerewith is an illustrated folder on pasteurization equipment which it is thought might be useful in some of the residential schools of the Indian Affairs Branch. Many of the residential schools at present have no facilities for pasteurization.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would give us your opinion on this equipment both as to its usefulness and price.\n\nW.L.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYour Purchase Order No. 6990\n\nThe above purchase order has been passed for payment. It is noted that you are able to obtain desks from the Associate Foundry Limited, 4030 Nanaimo St., Vancouver, B.C., at the rate of $10.00 and upwards a desk.\n\nCan you please advise how suitable this desk has been found to be. We are endeavouring to purchase desks in the East and are meeting with very little success. The Departmental Purchasing Agent has suggested that I write to you concerning these desks and their availability at the present time. It is our intention to use them in our schools in Saskatchewan and Alberta if your reply is favourable.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 7, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nProposed One-room Day School Plan\n\nThis branch approves the plan of the one-room Indian Day School as prepared by you in April, 1939, as the basic plan for the twenty-three new one-room day schools which we intend building during the 1947-48 fiscal year.\n\nWe would like the following minor alterations made:\n\n1. That the basement be at least 10' in height from floor to floor, allowing at least 7'4\" clear height at the lowest point.\n\n2. That the minimum window size be 3'7\" x 4'.\n\n3. That as many windows as possible be provided in the basement to give there as close to the ratio of lighting as provided in the classrooms.\n\n4. That book shelves be provided along the wall with the windows, and running at window level height.\n\n5. That an ample book supply cupboard be provided in one of the rear corners of the room so that the teacher can lock therein the supply of paper, pencils, etc.\n\nDirector\nOttawa, February 14, 1947.\n\nRe: Finish of Basement Floor Areas\nIndian Day and Residential Schools\n\nWith reference to your memoranda, forwarded to Mr. Buck under dates of January 15th and 29th, commenting on a product of the Truscon Laboratories Ltd. of Toronto, known as Truscon Flor-dye, our Chief Architect advises that while he knows that there is such a product, he is not familiar with the results that might be expected from its use.\n\nWe are however communicating with the manufacturers at the address you furnished, with a view to obtaining (a) literature regarding the product, and (b) the location of a few buildings where it has been used.\n\nComment in the extract from the Indian Education Bulletin issued by the United States Indian Service, indicates the usual methods of preparation for and application of liquid stain finishes. However Truscon is a Corporation which in the United States is looked upon as an authority on concrete construction of all types, and any product for which they are responsible should have considerable merit.\n\nWe will inform you of the results of our enquiries.\n\nT. S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n180 Sparks Street,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, February 21, 1947.\n\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nPlan for a Two Room Indian Day School\n\nAs you are aware, we have included in our next year's estimates appropriations for the construction of three two-room Indian day schools. In order to find out how the two-room day schools recently constructed have been standing up, one of our officials visited the Maria Indian Day School at Maria, P.Q.\n\nThis school was constructed in May, 1939 under your Plan No. 741.\n\nWe would like our schools planned for construction this year modified slightly as hereunder in view of our experience with the Maria school.\n\n1. The school should be raised to provide between 11' and 11'6\" from floor to ceiling in the basement.\n\n2. The basement windows should be at least twice their present height to provide better lighting for industrial art classes.\n\n3. In order to accommodate the larger classes we anticipate, the classrooms should be lengthened to provide for 40 pupils. To do this it is recommended that they be lengthened to between 30' and 33', inside length.\n\n4. A separate entrance should be provided to the teachers' residence, with a small 6' x 6' covered verandah. It is believed that this entrance should be situated to lead into the livingroom along the front wall.\n5. That consideration be given to excavating below the teachers' residence in order to extend the basement space. If this is done, this space should be insulated in order to provide a dry storage space for use as a dispensary and first aid room.\n\nThe present heating arrangements have apparently proved satisfactory. However, in view of the above recommendations, it is realized that you may have to make modifications.\n\nDirector\nFebruary 27, 1947.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour file 1-1-5 (W.T.1)\n\nI have your letter of February 4th, 1947, regarding the matter of the construction of additional school accommodation in this Province during the coming fiscal year, and note that an amount of $42,500 is being requested for this purpose.\n\nThe items will be dealt with herein in the sequence in which they are listed in your letter:\n\n1. Babine Agency Hazleton.\n\nA two (or three) class-room school with teacher's living quarters should be provided at this point. A memorandum on the subject from Inspector Coleman, is enclosed in which considerable information on the situation at Hazelton and vicinity will be found. Of the two sites referred to, by Inspector Coleman, I should say that the 5-acre area belonging to Arthur Mowatt, as the more suitable in-as-much as it provides for present and future playground space. However, this is a point that should be looked into on the ground by Mr. R. F. Davey, Inspector of schools.\n\nThe existing set-up suggests the advisibility of a non-sectarian school operated and controlled direct by the Department. Provision might be\nmade to include the children from the nearby Kispiox, Glen Vowell and Hagwilget reserves, in which case, arrangement for the transportation of the pupils of these Reserves to and from the school would be necessary. From the information I have before me however, I would be inclined to leave Kispiox out of the suggested amalgamation. I consider it most important, however, that Inspector Davey look into the situation on the ground, and report his findings and recommendations before we proceed with construction.\n\nThere are no Contractors at Hazelton, or in the vicinity who could undertake construction. I understand, however, that building is more or less at a stand still in Prince Rupert, and it might be possible to get a firm from that town to undertake the work. John Currie and Son, Contractors and Builders, Prince Rupert, who built our school at Bella Bella, might be interested.\n\nThe need of a new school at Hazelton, is urgent and construction should be proceeded with if at all possible this coming fiscal year.\n\n2. Bella Coola Agency\nKelmtu Reserve.\n\nA new school with teacher's quarters is needed here, but I should say that the need is more urgent at Alert Bay, where there is a large day school pupilage with very inadequate accommodation. It might be well to consider using the funds provided in items 2 and 3, to assist in providing the accommodation required at Alert Bay. This is a matter that will be discussed with Inspector Davey, on his return from the North, and you will be further advised in this connection in due course.\n\n3. Kwawkewlth Agency\nCape Mudge.\n\nIt is intended to use one of the buildings at the Port Hardy Military Camp, for the necessary\naccommodation at this point, and if this is done, most of the funds allotted for Cape Mudge, could be used for the proposed construction at Alert Bay. Mr. T. Johnson, Builder and Contractor at Alert Bay, would no doubt be interested in the work at Kelinitu, Cape Mudge and Alert Bay, but likely on a daily basis only.\n\n4. Lytton Agency.\nSeabird Island Reserve.\n\nA new school should be erected here this year. Mr. William Swan, Hatzic, B.C., would undertake the work on a daily basis. Mr. Swan is a well known and reliable contractor and builder and has done good work for us at both the Kamloops and St. Mary's Residential Schools.\n\n5. New Westminster Agency.\nPemberton Reserve.\n\nThe proposed addition to the existing school at this point should be proceeded with. Mr. W. Swan, Hatzic, B.C. would undertake this work in conjunction with the proposed building at Seabird Island.\n\nIt would be well to have the Surveys and Engineering Branch, undertake the supervision and responsibility for the construction authorized, as this office has not the staff to undertake such work. Certainly the projects under items 1, 4, and 5 should be handled in this way and also the proposed school at Alert Bay, if the Department decides to proceed with construction of a new unit there.\n\nA further report will be submitted following a discussion of the subject with Inspector Davey.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nenclos.\nOttawa, March 3, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nSchool Construction Program, 1944-48 -\nReference your O-11-3 of February 27 -\n\nWe will await further recommendations from you concerning Babine Agency, Bella Coola Agency and Kwakwewitlth Agency constructions.\n\nInsofar as the non-denominational consolidated school at Hazelton is concerned, attached please find a sample list of regulations with respect to the operation of such schools. We have just received approval from the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church for the operation of such a non-denominational school (2 rooms) at Hay River in the Northwest Territories. If you wish, we will write to the denominations concerned and suggest that the school at Hazelton be conducted along these lines. It is possible that with your knowledge of local conditions and personalities you may wish to do this yourself. However, we will await a reply from you in this regard.\n\nWe are today writing to the Surveys and Engineering Branch concerning the constructions required at Seabird Island and Pemberton and will advise you later about these two schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.\n\nDirector\nIn the instance of non-denominational day schools, religious teaching shall take place only as hereinafter provided.\n\n(a) Such religious teaching shall take place only during the last half hour of the teaching day and shall be conducted by any Christian clergyman whose charge includes any portion of the reserve or by any person duly authorized by such clergyman, or by a teacher when so authorized.\n\n(b) Where so specified in such band resolutions, religious teaching during the prescribed period may take place only on certain specified days of the week instead of on every teaching day.\n\n(c) In any Indian day school where the average attendance of Roman Catholic children is 25 or upwards, the Minister shall, if required by a petition of parents or guardians of such number of Roman Catholic children, employ at least one certified Roman Catholic teacher in such school. In any day school where the average attendance of Protestant children is 25 or upwards, the Minister shall if required by the petition of parents or guardians of such children, employ at least one duly certified Protestant teacher.\n\n(d) Where religious teaching is required to be carried on in any school in pursuance of the foregoing provisions and there are Roman Catholic and Protestant children attending the school and the school room accommodation does not permit of the pupils being placed in separate rooms for the purpose of religious teaching, provision shall be made by the regulations of the department whereby the time allotted for religious teaching shall be divided in such a way that the religious teaching of Roman Catholic children shall be carried on during the prescribed period of one-half of the teaching days in each month, and the religious teaching of the Protestant children shall be carried on during the prescribed period of one-half of the teaching days of each month.\n\n(e) No separation of pupils by religious denominations shall take place during the secular school work.\n(f) Where the school room accommodation permits, instead of allotting different days of the week to different denominations for the purpose of religious teaching the pupils may be separated when the hour for religious teaching arrives and placed in separate rooms.\n\n(g) No pupils shall be permitted to be present at any religious teaching unless the parents or guardians of such pupils desire it. If the parents or guardians do not desire the attendance of pupils during such religious teaching, then such pupils shall be dismissed before the religious teaching is begun, or shall remain in another room.\n1-1-5 (W.T. 8)\nOttawa, Ontario,\nMarch 3, 1947.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nThe suggestion has been made that our requirements for teachers' residences could be met more quickly by the use of pre-fabricated houses.\n\nInvestigation is proceeding locally with a view to experimenting with the erection of one such residence at a nearby point. If the experiment turns out satisfactorily we may follow the same methods elsewhere.\n\nAs freight rates, however, are a considerable factor it is requested that you furnish to this office the names of companies who manufacture pre-fabricated houses in the Province of Manitoba. Copies of their catalogues or descriptive literature are also requested.\n\nAt the same time would you please obtain from any such companies a firm decision as to whether they would accept orders from the Government for delivery at such points as Jack River, the Fairford Reserve and the Brokenhead Reserve. The method of delivery to the sites and the cost of delivery in each case should also be the subject of investigation and report.\n\nB. F.

They have indicated that while primarily handling veterans' housing, they are willing to undertake government orders.\n\nWe would naturally want to provide a full basement and brick chimney. Our standard teachorage has four rooms, so we have selected for your consideration:\n\n(a) The Windsor at $1,551.00 plus extras,\n(b) The Beaverbrook at $1,450.00 plus extras,\n(c) The Robin at $1,523.00 plus extras.\n\nWe would appreciate your comments on this proposal.\n\n.....

We have written recently to Indian Commissioner MacKay, Vancouver, B.C., concerning this new construction asking him about the local building situation. He has answered in part as follows:\n\n\"Mr. William Swan, Nelson, B.C., would undertake the work on a daily basis. Mr. Swan is a well known and reliable contractor and builder and has done good work for us at both the Kamloops and St. Mary's residential schools.\"\n\nHe has also requested that your branch undertake the supervision and responsibility for the construction of this building.\n\nTherefore it will be in order for you to advertise for tenders for the construction of a standard one-room school at this point.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, March 3, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nPemberton Indian Day School\n\nAs you are aware, a sum of $3,500.00 has been included in our 1947-48 estimates for the construction of an additional classroom at the Pemberton Indian Day School. This school is in the New Westminster Agency and is approximately 200 miles from the Seabird Island Indian Day School (reference our memorandum of similar date, file 165-5-5).\n\nWe have communicated with Major D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, in this regard and he has answered, advising that Mr. W. Swan, of Nelson, B.C., would undertake this work in connection with the proposed building at Seabird Island. Major MacKay also comments that Mr. Swan is a well known contractor and builder and that he has done good work for us at both the Kamloops and St. Mary's residential schools.\n\nTherefore, would you have one of your officials go to the Pemberton Indian Day School to survey the situation and prepare the plans necessary for the erection of a one-room addition to this school. It is suggested that your official should contact the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia and arrange to visit the school with Major R. F. Davey, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\n\nDirector.\nMr. E. F.

Further copies may be had on request.\n\nYou will notice in the letter that comes with the book that we are now only able to accept orders from Veterans.\n\nThis stipulation however may not be necessary in case the buildings you want are required for government purposes.\n\nWe shall be glad to have your further enquiries.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE HALLIDAY COMPANY LIMITED\n\nE.J.S:RE\n\nE. J. Sparling.\nOttawa, March 7th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR OF SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nAttached is a list of the buildings provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48.\n\nAll of these buildings are urgently required to meet educational needs and I hope that it will be possible to have them constructed during the coming year.\n\nYou will note that there are twelve one-room schools and three two-room schools. Your Branch has constructed both types of buildings for this Branch in the past and we presume that plans for this type of building are available.\n\nIn connection with this list I would draw your attention to certain notes appearing opposite some of the schools.\n\nNote 1 Eskasoni and Shubenacadie - An amount of $70,000 has been provided to complete these buildings. As we understand that construction of the buildings is well advanced at the present time, it is presumed that the amount provided will not all be required to complete them. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would let me know by May 15th, how much money will not be required. This will enable us to use the unexpended balance in erecting other schools which are needed.\n\nNote 2 Waswanipi - It will not be necessary to take any action in regard to this school. We are making arrangements with the Indian Agent to secure the materials this year and the actual construction of the school will have to be deferred until 1948.\nNote 3. Congo Bridge - In connection with this teacher's residence, please refer to my memorandum of February 28th.\n\nNote 4. Mississauga - Serpent River - With reference to these two schools, please refer to my memorandum of February 24th.\n\nNote 5. Little Grand Rapids, R.C. - We purchased the material for this building this year and the amount provided is for the labour. We will advise you later about this building.\n\nNote 6. Little Grand Rapids, U.C. - Two or three years ago a quantity of material was purchased and has been in storage. We are awaiting further particulars from the Indian Agent. No action may be taken at the present time.\n\nNote 7. Brokenhead - We feel that a pre-fabricated house would be suitable at this point.\n\nNote 8. Jack River - We feel that a pre-fabricated house would be suitable at this point.\n\nNote 9. Cape Mudge - We are in communication with Indian Commissioner MacKay regarding this building. It is possible that we will be able to obtain former Army buildings. Action on this building can be delayed until further advised.\n\nNote 10. Seabird Island - Please refer to my memorandum of March 3rd.\n\nNote 11. Pemberton - Please refer to my memorandum of March 3rd.\n\nNote 12. Teslin Lake - It will not be necessary to take any action on this building until you hear further from us. We expect to obtain former Army buildings.\n\nDirector\nOttawa, March 10th, 1947.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg., Winnipeg.\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48, we are requesting funds for the erection of the under-mentioned schools and residences in the Province of Manitoba.\n\n**Clandeboye Agency**\n\nNote (1) - Little Grand Rapids R.C.

Teacher's residence. $2,500.\n\nWith reference to the notes on the attached list.\n\nNote (1) - Little Grand Rapids R.C. We arranged through the church authorities to purchase the materials for this school out of the appropriation for the fiscal year 1946-47 and the amount mentioned above is for labour to complete the building.\n\nNote (2) - Little Grand Rapids U.C. Approximately two years ago we shipped some material for the new school at this point but construction did not proceed. We have recently written to Indian Agent Goodman requesting him to give us information regarding the material on hand.\n\nNote (3) - Brokenhead\nNote (4) - Jack River C.E.\nNote (5) - Fairford -\n\nIn connection with these three residences, please refer to official letter of March 3rd. We are anxious to receive a reply to that letter as we feel that the best chance of getting these buildings provided during the fiscal year 1947-48 is to use pre-fabricated houses.\n\nAs you will realize, when we prepare the estimates for the coming fiscal year, we are confronted by demands for new schools from all parts of the Dominion. Unfortunately, we cannot supply all of these in one fiscal year and from a study of the estimates submitted from the Agents in Manitoba, we felt that those mentioned above were most necessary. However, if you feel some other reserve should receive a preference, we would be glad to have your recommendation and give it every possible consideration.\n\nIn this connection we have your letter of February 27th, regarding the erection of a day school on the Oak\nRiver Reserve. Do you consider this school more necessary than any of those mentioned above?\n\nWe would like to have your opinion on the possibility of securing contractors to quote on the buildings mentioned. Possibly in some districts it may be necessary to erect the schools by day labour. If so, you might let me have as much information as you can secure.\n\nIt is hoped that you will find it possible to let us have your report by the end of the current month as we would like to have construction started as soon as possible after the beginning of the next fiscal year.\n\nBernard F.

This latter school is the day school planned on the Caughnawaga Reserve and has been the subject of considerable correspondence and discussion between the Surveys and Engineering Branch and this Branch, since we first requested its construction on December 12, 1946. Under file I A 1256-24, dated March 12, 1947, we received a minute memorandum from the Director of Surveys and Engineering in which it was stated as follows:\n\n\"We propose directing every effort toward completing our work on this project as soon as possible, but with our unreasonably small staff depleted by the recent resignations of Mr. Horwood and Mr. Barnes, we are no longer prepared to estimate dates within which phases of our work will be completed.\"\n\nIn January the Chief Architect was given the list of buildings which we intend to build next year. On March 7 we sent him a memorandum officially confirming our building requirements. A copy of this memorandum is attached for your information.\n\nOn February 24 another memorandum was sent to the Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch concerning\nthe erection of two day schools in Sault Ste. Marie Agency (as included in the above list). They were advised that our Educational Survey Officer was ready to proceed to the site of these schools with one of their officials when they were ready to survey the actual location of the buildings.\n\nAs you are doubtless aware, we have approximately 10,000 Indian children who are not receiving education of any kind. Both the Indians and the members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, as well as many Canadian citizens, are keenly aware of this fact and we must endeavour to provide classroom accommodation at once. A conservative estimate is that a minimum of 300 classrooms is required. It is imperative that this programme be undertaken as soon as possible and without any further delays. Both the Minister and Mr. Jackson have been very co-operative in permitting the inclusion of appropriations to cover the construction of 43 classrooms this year.\n\nHowever, it would appear that we will be able to construct only a small percentage of these schools, unless some immediate action is taken to remedy the situation as revealed by the Director of Surveys and Engineering in the memorandum of March 12, quoted above.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would give this matter your earnest consideration and, under the circumstances, authorize us to proceed with the construction of these schools through other channels than our own Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nDirector,\nARMY MESSAGE\n\nPLACE DATE\nOttawa, Ont.

You will note his remarks about the Teacher's Residence at Nelson House. It was my understanding when I saw this house in 1946 that it was to be repaired and siding applied. I think Mr. Lovell's suggestion should be followed.\n\nIf material is available for the Big Eddy Day School Mr. Lovell should be requested, if possible, to locate a suitable foreman. The improvements suggested by Mr. Lovell for the Big Eddy Day School I am sure will exceed the allowance of $5,000.00. Could any surplus, not required at Nelson House, be used for the Big Eddy School?\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nThe Pan, Man.,\n24/Mar/47\n\nA.G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th inst., file 205-11A.G., regarding the building program at Nelson House, Roman Catholic school and Residence, I wish to draw the Department's attention to the fact that it is impossible at the present time to move any material into Nelson House as the tractor swings are through hauling in that vicinity, and material for building purposes is very scarce.\n\nThe residence for the R.C. school teacher at Nelson House has only been erected approximately five or six years and could be put into first class shape for approximately $1000.00. I had authority from the Department in 1946 to buy siding for this house and to have same put on, but it was impossible to procure the time and still is. Owing to the lateness of the season it will be impossible to ship any material in this Spring but with the Department's permission I could have this house chinked up and considerable work done by local labour so that it will be in fairly good condition until we could get supplies in next winter. This would cost approximately $300.00 which could be done by local labour.\n\nMaterial for the new school could be bought during the summer months and stored ready to ship next winter, but erection of same will have to wait until the Spring of 1949.\n\nRegarding Big Eddy School, we would need a white foreman, and sufficient Indian day labour would be available. We would have to dig a basement and install a furnace, and if at all possible, dig a well in the vicinity of the school.\n\n(over)\nI think the appropriations for the Nelson House R.C. School are a little high as the attendance in this particular school is not great.\n\nI would suggest that $1000.00 be taken from the RC school estimate and transferred to the Big Eddy estimate.\n\nTrusting this gives you the information you require, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nS.

Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48, the following provision has been made for the erection of schools in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\n**Rattlerord Agency**\nRed Pheasant - School with Residence - $8,000.\nThunderchild - School with Residence - $8,000.\n\n**Carlton Agency**\nChitek Lake - School with Residence - $8,000.\n\n**Onion Lake Agency**\nCold Lake Reserve - School with Residence - $8,000.\n\n**Touchwood Agency**\nPoor Man's Reserve - School with Residence - $8,000.\n\nAs you will realize, when we prepare the estimates, we are confronted by demands for new schools from all parts of the Dominion. Unfortunately, we cannot supply all of these in one fiscal year, but from a study of the estimates that were submitted to us, we felt that those mentioned above were most necessary.\nHowever, if you feel some other reserve should receive a preference, we would be glad to have your recommendation and we will give it every possible consideration.\n\nWe would like to have your opinion on the possibility of securing contractors to quote on the buildings mentioned. Possibly in some districts it may be necessary to erect the school by day labour. If so, you might let us have as much information as you have available.\n\nI hope that your many other duties will permit you to forward an early reply to this letter.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa April 11th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR OF SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nYour architect, Mr. Buck, phoned Colonel Neary on April 11th with special reference to the schools that we propose to erect in the province of British Columbia during the current fiscal year.\n\nWe have already received one letter regarding the matter from Indian Commissioner MacKay but we are waiting for another letter from him in connection with some of the projects.\n\nAt the present time I would appreciate it if your officers would give immediate attention to Indian Commissioner MacKay's recommendations regarding the following:\n\n(1) Lytton Agency.\nSeabird Island Reserve - One room school with residence.\n\nA new school should be erected here this year. Mr. William Swan, Hatzic, B.C., would undertake the work on a daily basis. Mr. Swan is a well known and reliable contractor and builder and has done good work for us at both the Kamloops and St. Mary's Residential Schools.\n\n(2) New Westminster Agency.\nPemberton reserve - Extending present school.\n\nThe proposed addition to the existing school\nat this point should be proceeded with.\n\nMr. W. Swan, Hatzic, B.C. would undertake this work in conjunction with the proposed building at Seabird Island.\n\nNo doubt your officials in British Columbia will confer with Major MacKay regarding the above two projects which it appears could be started at an early date.\n\nWe will advise you further as soon as we have another communication from our Commissioner.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: School Building Program at The Pas\n\nI would refer you to my letter, 205-11A.G., dated March 27, 1947, and to the enclosure from Mr. Lovell.\n\nI wrote Mr. Lovell to see if a suitable foreman could be located and for your information I quote his reply:\n\n\"In answer to your letter of March 27, file number 205-11A.G. I beg to advise that I do not anticipate any trouble in securing a competent foreman to supervise on this work.\n\nAs in regard to materials, that is a question that at the present time is impossible to answer. The lumber company assures me that it is possible that the material will be available, but I shall do as much as I can go. I know that I will get priority after the return men in this connection.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G.

It is noted that the projects at Seabird Island and Pemberton have been referred to the Surveys and Engineering Branch for attention.\n\nI delayed replying to your enquiry regarding the proposed construction of a non-sectarian school at Hazelton as I understood the Right Rev. Bishop Gibson was to be in Vancouver and hoped to interview him on the matter during his stay. I find, however, that it is not known when Bishop Gibson will be here. Under the circumstances and in order to avoid further delay I feel that the matter might well be taken up by the Department direct with the Bishops concerned and I would so recommend. Construction at Hazelton, however, should not proceed until Inspector Davey has had an opportunity to visit Hazelton and report on the sites available to us for school purposes.\n\nWith reference to items 2 and 3 of my letter of February 27th, 1947, much depends on what we finally decide to do with the buildings at Port Hardy. You will recall that I recently recommended an examination of these buildings by the Surveys and Engineering Branch and their recommendation with respect to how the buildings should be moved and to what extent it would be economical to make use of them for school purposes, (see my letter dated April 11th, files 6-15-2 & 6-11-3). This division of the work should be held in abeyance pending investigation and report by the Branch referred to.\n\nI should like to discuss this program with you during my forthcoming stay in Ottawa and will bring the matter to your\nattention at the time.\n\nD.

The blue only is the new one. The green is a previous one but it will give you information.\n\nFirst: With the modified unit there is no emptying or recharging. A pail of water per bowl per day in an institution, or half a pail per day in a home services the unit. It is not necessary to have running water.\n\nWe are attaching a tentative estimate showing a set-up as per circular of a single unit, also a multiple unit, that is, a two-bowl tank figuring vented to a chimney of an institution, in place of through the roof. It is preferable to vent to the chimney wherever possible.\n\nThis estimate is tentative because we need to have further information and detailed data such as where would the tank be placed, if the funnel would be more than the standard 30 inch, what venting is necessary, distance from the top of the V - l section or upright elbow to the chimney or through the roof.\n\nWe send out a questionnaire sheet for schools and residences as per attached. When we have this information we can figure better what the installation would cost.\n\nYou will note on the estimate sheet that we have given a tentative installation price. This, of course, does not include any carpentering work, etc.\n\nWe are at your service.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCURRIE SCHOOL & SANITATION EQUIPMENT\n\nper (Signed K.

We understood from Mr. Hamilton that you wish to see this plan in order that you might consider giving us a quotation. We would be pleased to hear from you at your earliest convenience. Copy of this letter is being forwarded to Mr. Hamilton and he will, no doubt, interview you again.\n\nMr. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Saskatchewan, who is at present in Ottawa on business, will be in Winnipeg at the end of this week and will also call upon you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nNorth American Buildings Ltd.,\n711 Royal Bank Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nPP/MGD\nMay 5th, 1947.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nI thought you would like to have for your information, and for future reference, the attached memorandum, dated April 18th from Mr. Mills, giving general observations in connection with the maintenance and operation of mechanical equipment at the different Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIt is suggested that a copy of the enclosed report be forwarded to the Principals in charge of the Residential Schools for which your Branch is responsible.\n\nDirector.\nApril 18, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: General Observations in connection with Mechanical Services at Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIn the course of inspections carried out at various residential schools, and in consideration of field reports submitted by inspecting engineers, a number of points are repeatedly being brought to our attention. This memorandum is intended to comment on certain of the more important items with the view of placing before the Indian Affairs Branch, information which may prove to be of value in bringing the mechanical services in these buildings up to an economical and efficient level and maintaining that level.\n\nWhile some of the schools vary somewhat in design and personnel, the heating plants are required to perform a service along more or less uniform lines, and with this in mind, it is felt that certain facts pertaining to the welfare of the institutions, should be reviewed.\n\nOne of the outstanding points which is continually being brought to the fore, is a lack of domestic hot water. It should be borne in mind that a certain normal wastage of this commodity is unavoidable, but nevertheless, without exception, investigations and analyses of our field engineers reports have always shown that the supply has been short; and in addition, the methods of heating water as well as the originally estimated capacities, have been well under what is considered to be normal requirements of good design.\n\nThe majority of boiler plants in the schools thus far visited and reported on, have the necessary boiler capacity to heat the amount of water needed. This capacity has not been used in many cases, to the best advantage. Many of the schools have used jacket heaters which have rapidly burnt out and have been replaced with similar equipment. Other schools have used below-the-waterline type heaters, which represents a nearer approach to the solution of the problem if such heaters are properly sized, but which up to now have been more or less ineffective. Still other schools have attempted to press their high pressure laundry boilers into this service, imposing as a consequence, a load far in excess of their capabilities.\n\nEmbracing somewhat on the foregoing paragraph, and considering any of the schools which have two steam heating boilers, it is pointed out that either boiler can carry the load except under the most severe weather conditions. This leaves one unit idle for a large part of the season and there is no good reason why this excess capacity should not be used to heat, by means of an indirect heater of the proper type, the domestic hot water.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nThis would pay dividends in maintaining a reasonable standard of efficiency and would be much less costly than allowing a plant to approach collapse before action was taken, which always means a much greater expenditure and degree of discomfort and inconvenience, always evident when major operations are carried out. Proper cleaning implements should be provided and where necessary, memoranda outlining the purpose of the various items of boiler room equipment with advice on how to use same to the best advantage should be provided, and an attempt made to make the operating staff feel that their work is appreciated and that it forms not the least important part of the School's welfare.\n\nAdditional itemized comment could be offered but it is felt that the foregoing general remarks will bring to the attention of Indian Affairs, some of the principal points which are contributing in no small way to repeated failures and near failures in the heating, plumbing and domestic water services.\n\nChief Engineer.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Regina, April 21st, 1947\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 11th instant, File No. 1-1-5 (WT 1), in connection with Appropriation for schools for the new fiscal year, it should be remembered that a day school has been authorized for the Nut Lake Reserve, of the Touchwood Agency, and that arrangements have already been made to take out a quantity of lumber at the Nut Lake Reserve, part of which is to be used in the erection of this school.\n\nThere is also the matter of the teacher's residence at the Montreal Lake Day School, of the Carlton Agency, for which some lumber has already been purchased. I would suggest that the school at the Touchwood Agency, referred to in your letter as \"Poorman's\" Reserve, be changed to \"Nut Lake\" Reserve and that of the $6,000.00 shown in the Battleford Agency for Thunderchild School and residence, sufficient should be used to build the teacher's residence at the Montreal Lake Day School, and the remainder used for building the classroom for the Thunderchild Day School. There is a small teacher's residence at the Thunderchild Day School which will do for the time being.\n\nWith regard to the erection of these buildings I believe it will be necessary to hire a man to supervise the work and have it performed by day labour in most cases. I intend to visit Meadow Lake as soon as possible to contact Mr. Ole Lidfers, who built the Farming Instructor's residence for us on the Meadow Lake Reserve last year, and whose work was extremely satisfactory. I would like to interest Mr. Lidfers in supervising some of our building at other points this year, with Indians hired to perform most of the rough carpenter work. It will not be easy to get contractors interested in any of our work because the better contractors have far more work ahead of them than they are able to complete this year. Travel has been very difficult because of bad roads but I shall be able to spend considerably more time on the building program when the roads open and intend to do so early this spring.\n\nPlease advise me whether the Department now has a set plan for teacher's residence and class-room buildings. If there is such a plan please let me have several in order that I may send them to the Indian Agents to use in contacting local contractors to see if we can get any of them interested in our building program.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, May 30, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Laurie:\n\nI have for answer your letter of May 19. The short delay has been caused by my attendance at the meetings of the Indian Act Committee, which, as you know only too well, take up a great deal of my time.\n\nOur building plans for this year call for day schools at Michel and at Saddle Lake. We would like to have included a great many more schools, but unfortunately the demand all across the country has been very great. It is our intention to construct some additional day school classrooms this year throughout the various provinces and the Northwest Territories. Within the last two months we have opened five day schools. One of these, at Janvier Landing, is in Alberta. I wish you would discuss the points you have raised in your letter with Inspector Gooderham as he knows only too well what our plans are. This especially will give you an insight as to our negotiations at Pigeon Lake. You will find that Mr. Gooderham has authority to proceed to negotiate with the Board at a very reasonable figure.\n\nI am very interested in what you say about emergency classroom accommodation being available at the Louis Bull reserve. I wish you would discuss this also with Mr. Gooderham and we will ask him to make a further report upon this building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. John Laurie,\nSecretary,\nIndian Association of Alberta,\n539 - 16th Avenue N.W.,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nMay 19, 1947\n\nR.A. Hoey Esq.,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Hoey -\n\nThe Indian Association of Alberta wishes to enter a strong protest against the fact that day schools are not apparently being established at the following reserves of the Edmonton Agency, Paul's Band, Alexander, Alexis, Enoch's Band and the Saddle Lake Agency, the following reserves, Paddle Lake, Goodfish Lake, Beaver Lake.\n\nWe do very much appreciate the fact that a day school is under consideration at Michel's of Edmonton Agency and sincerely trust that nothing will be permitted to interfere with its completion.\n\nWe have furnished a census of the children of those reserves who would be accommodated in day schools. We have set forth our arguments at very great length but, when Mr. Doucet, (I believe) made his inspection, he seems to have disregarded our more intimate knowledge of these reserves, which I have mentioned. We are of the opinion that the members of our organization are very familiar with the conditions on those reserves. We have every respect for Mr. Doucet and his opinion but we do believe that a closer consultation with the Indians concerned would have been advisable. When matters of this sort are under consideration, there should be a Band Meeting, not merely a Council Meeting at the Agency and every Indian should be given his chance to say something.\n\nIn our meetings we have discussed this matter at great length. In a sense they - the Indians - have given the matter very serious consideration. I too as an educationist of some experience, have thought it over very carefully. I have discussed the matter with several Public School Inspectors who have made visits to Indian Residential Schools. They agree\nGenerally that in the cases mentioned day schools are now desirable.\n\nOne young man, for whom I have considerable respect, states it thus, \"I have no idea how to raise my own children because I am not given a chance. My children spoke only English when they went to school but now they speak Cree. I live on my reserve; I can make a living for them. The white schools will not take them in because they are afraid that all the Indian children will come there. I can teach them to milk cows at home. My wife can keep a good house (She can too because I like to stay there).\"\n\nSir, I know he is speaking the truth not only for himself but for many on his reserve.\n\nThe case for day schools on these reserves, especially Paul's Band, Enoch's Band, and Alexander is too strong to disregard further. We know that it may mean closing the Indian schools at St. Albert, and probably at Edmonton (Protestant). The Edmonton plant may very well be used as a superior school for advanced education, a matter which should be carefully considered. I mean by a superior school, one which will concentrate on advancing promising Indian children beyond Grade 6, and preparing them for something other than life at present lived on the reserves.\n\nThe school at St. Albert has many other functions already and extremely valuable functions they are.\n\nSince the Protestant children from the Saddle Lake Agency and from the Hobbsma Agency must go to the Edmonton School, there is a strong argument for day schools on the reserves of those Agencies. If the present schools could turn out men such as those educated in the old McDougall Orphanage School, or the Industrial schools at Dunbow, Calgary and Red Deer, there might be an argument against day schools. But the present schools have failed to turn out men like the Steinhauers, Heubens Bull, the Rabbitts, the Houses, MacLean and Hunters of Morley and many others. I have yet to see the young men turned out by the present schools, except St. Paul's at Cardston, who are of the calibre of those here mentioned.\n\nFrom those schools mentioned I should like to turn to the case of the Indians of the Louis Bull Reserve, Hobbsma Agency. These people have several times asked for a day school. There is not enough\nroom at the Ermineskin School at Hobbs. However, a number of these children are protestants and must go to Edmonton; there is a building which could be repaired and put into use on that reserve. But as all this is already set forth in our subject on Education in the Minutes and Proceedings, Nos.15 and 21, 1946, To repair and reopen this building as a day School would solve the question of room at the Ermineskin School, the hesitancy of the Protestant Indians to send their children all the way to Edmonton, and be an enormous saving in the long run to the Indian Affairs Branch. As you know there will soon be the question of a new building at the Ermineskin School.\n\nNow to those Indians living at Pigeon Lake or Ta-me-o Beach. The school which was put in there by the Province for the white children could have accommodated the Indians there as well. We understand that there was some quibbling over payment for tuition which would not have amounted to any appreciable sum in the long run, here is a set fee in this province for children attending schools other than their own. Instead of worrying over a matter of a few cents on a daily basis, this fee could have been paid for those children. BUT, the confidence of the Indians has been weakened in the Indian Affairs Branch by the failure of the Province and the Department to get together on the matter and their dissatisfaction has been increased. Their children are receiving an inferior education - the most serious matter of all.\n\nWe recognize that a change may for some time produce few tangible results. But there is reason to doubt the tangible results now being produced.\n\nIf the Branch will act on this matter, please let the I.A.A. have some representation in any investigation. They are no getting over the fact that Indians are still afraid of speaking out before a group of officials only.\n\nI ask your consideration of this matter and would appreciate hearing from you. We know that you can proceed without delaying the matter on account of the Committee.\n\nI feel certain that your personal interest is with the Indians in this and that you will expedite matters without delay.\n\nSincerely\u2014\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files (AC 10), Volume 6032, File 1-1-5B, part 3\nOttawa, May 30, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nTwo-room Day School Plan -\n\nOn February 21 we wrote you with regard to certain changes to be made in our two-room day school plan.

Working drawings were begun but due to the number of projects required by the Agencies Division of your Branch and draughting requirements contingent on suggested revisions to heating plants and domestic hot water distribution systems in Indian Residential schools across the Dominion, covered by a series of inspection reports by our Mr. Hargreaves, it became necessary to defer further operations on the two-roomed school until some of that work had been disposed of.\n\nHowever work on the drawings for the two-roomed school was resumed on May 30th and it is hoped that if no interruptions occur they will be available early in July.\n\nDirector.\nAir Mail\n\nOttawa, June 20th, 1947.\n\nMr. A.G.

The 20 x 24 basement, on a 9\" x 7\u00bd\" wall with a 30\" x 10\" footing and 4\" floor will take 30 cubic yards of concrete with 120 bags of cement in a 6 to 1 mix. The 27 x 25 basement put in as above will take 36 yards of concrete or 144 bags of cement.\n\nYou will note on the right-hand side of the plan, diagrams of the anchor bolt setting in the 2x6 sill. The bolts are placed approximately 6' apart 3\u00bd\" in from the outside edge of the basement wall. We supply the sill, anchor bolts and centre beam but nothing below the beam.\n\nIn our quotation on the houses, we gave you a credit of $25.00 in lieu of chimney material. This is our usual method in lengthy deliveries on account of the weight involved. However, we can supply an Insulated Metal Chimney with the house. A pamphlet on this chimney is also enclosed, and we might say that we have been using them for some years with very satisfactory results. The price of a full length chimney included with house plans No. 422 R is $78.75 and with house plan No. 756 LB it is $82.38.\n\nThe price of insulating the floors with Vapor Seal paper semi-thick rock wool batts, strapping and shiplap would be $135.00 for plan No. 422 R. and $190.00 for plan No. 756 LB.\n\nIn\nIn connection with your query re the $30.00 item on our quotation #1136, we advise that the price of the house includes Rock Wool Insulation in walls and ceiling; the $30.00 applies to delivery and labor in delivering to Redwood Docks, Winnipeg.\n\nTrusting this information is satisfactory to you, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNORTH AMERICAN BUILDINGS LIMITED,\n\n(Sgd) E.W.

In these days of inflated building costs, Halliday prices show a substantial saving over figures quoted for comparable buildings.\n\nFour of the designs, the EVANS, TEDHALL, MACFARLANE and JOHNSON meet the rigid requirements of the National Housing Act and may be financed through Central Mortgage & Housing Corporation. The other plans shown live up to material requirements of the Act but some of the room sizes do not conform. All the houses shown meet with the approval of the Department of Veteran's Affairs and can be financed through the Veteran's Land Act. We mention these facts to show you that regardless of cost we are producing homes that are equal to and in many cases superior to the majority of homes being built today. Then there is the added advantage of Prefabrication that makes for easy erection at a still further reduction of cost.\n\nSince June 1946 we have filled orders for Veterans only and must continue this policy. This enables us to benefit by Priority but even with the help of this, we still cannot obtain sufficient material to fill the demand for Veterans Houses.\n\nIf you qualify as a Veteran and are interested in obtaining one of our houses, we suggest that you return the Questionnaire enclosed. This will enable us to advise you of the possibility of filling an order for you.\n\nIf you do not have a record of service in the armed forces, we would like to record your name as being interested. The return of the small coupon will enable us to write you immediately any change in conditions occurs.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE HALLIDAY COMPANY LIMITED\n\nM. H.

However, before the last war, building materials were plentiful and we were also able to supply our customers with plans, a complete bill of material and such items as lumber, trim, frames, sash, doors, flooring, roofing, gyproc lath, hardware, eavestrough, etc., in fact, everything to complete the houses shown in our PANORAM HOME FOLDERS with the exception of masonry items and labor.\n\nThe materials were not prefabricated or precut. We assembled everything required and sent it out in one or two shipments or as needed on the job. Unfortunately, today we cannot secure sufficient supplies to do this but we do still have the plans and complete listings for these homes.\n\nOur PANORAM FOLDERS consist of three booklets showing these homes in color. Each folder contains eleven plans of about the same price range and we can supply the complete set showing 33 plans for only 25\u00a2.\n\nShould you decide to build one of the homes shown in our PANORAM FOLDERS, we can supply you with three sets of blueprints and a complete listing of materials required. The cost of these vary from $15.00 to $25.00 according to the size of the house chosen.\n\nWe know we cannot supply rough lumber or sheathing but on such materials as sash, frames, doors, roofing, hardware and possibly some other items, we can fill your order at money saving prices from our General Catalog.\n\nIf you are interested, write at once, enclosing 25\u00a2 for a set of our PANORAM FOLDERS.\n\nThe HALLIDAY COMPANY LIMITED\nBURLINGTON, ONTARIO\nThe attached price list shows the BASIC price for each home with all materials as described on pages 1 and 2 of our Catalog of Simplex Homes revised 1947. We also show variations in cost for alternative sidings and for Hot Air Heating Materials, galv. window screens for all windows, storm windows and combination doors. Mastic Tile in place of Hardwood Flooring in Kitchen and Bathroom and a reduction in price if Gyproc Lath is supplied in place of large Gyproc panels. If you do not wish us to supply Mastic Tile or Hardwood Flooring in Bathroom and Kitchen a further reduction is shown.\n\nBasic prices shown are for houses supplied with bevel siding applied on the panels in the factory. If preferred, bevel siding in long lengths will be sent to be applied by the customer at the site, at the same price. Price list also shows different costs if Asbestos Sidewall Shingles or Insul Brick is supplied, to be applied at the site. The two houses NORTHUP and PATTINSON are priced for finish in Asbestos Shingles. All others are priced for Wood Siding Finish.\n\nBecause of present difficulties in securing Plumbing Equipment for the large number of Simplex Homes already sold, quotations on such equipment for additional houses have been omitted. In many cases, customers can obtain the necessary supplies locally when a single installation only is required.\n\nUntil further notice, all Simplex Houses are reserved for Canadian Veterans and will be shipped freight free within a radius of 100 miles from Burlington. Extra freight costs are shown for delivery beyond the 100 mile limit and within the limits of our SOUTH ZONE as described in our General Catalog on Page 2. For prices delivered beyond this area, please write.\n\nShipments will be made by truck if this is possible and will be in two or three parts, the first load giving you all materials to completely enclose the house. Freight shipments must be in one delivery and will be prepaid to your Station only.\n\nFigures quoted are cash prices - any other arrangements must be subject to the approval of our Credit Department. All designs are acceptable to and may be financed under V. L. A. The EVANS, TEDHALL, JOHNSON and MAC FARLANE are approved by Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation and may be financed through C. M.

Hewett, Homes Dept. Manager\n\nCustomer's name & address\nHALLIDAY HOMES\n\n\u2022 HALLIDAYS \u2022\nCANADA'S BUILDING MATERIAL SPECIALISTS\nBURLINGTON, ONTARIO\nTRURO, NOVA SCOTIA\n\nPRICE 25 CENTS\nHALLIDAY SIMPLEX SYSTEM HOMES\nErected at Low Cost in Record Quick Time\n\nThere has always been a need for low cost homes suited to the requirements of the average family of modest means. Homes that can be erected easily and quickly at moderate cost, yet which provide modern accommodation, combined with individuality of design and plan arrangement. Hallidays have devoted a great deal of time and thought to the planning and designing of a group of attractive homes which can be built and financed by the man who must consider cost first,\u2014the man who must build at the lowest possible expense.\n\nWELL BUILT INSULATED HOMES\n\nFor several years, we have been supplying sectional homes and cottages that are erected quickly and easily at minimum cost. Many of our customers do all the work of erection without engaging paid help except to build the foundation and chimney or perhaps for the finish woodwork inside. But until we devised our Simplex System of interchangeable wall sections, such buildings were limited to one or two designs. Now, home builders may choose from many attractive designs and a wide variety of plan arrangements as shown in this booklet. Simplex homes are just the kind of homes many people want, low in cost yet well and strongly built with insulated walls, suitable for year round use.\n\nHIGH GRADE MATERIALS\n\nBecause of the care taken in the construction of the wall sections, owners find that these Simplex homes are warm and comfortable even in severe weather, requiring only a minimum amount of fuel. Approved methods and high grade materials are used throughout. Plans have been designed by experts assuring smart appearance and well arranged interiors.\n\nMAIN WALLS IN PREFABRICATED UNITS\n\nSimplex homes cost little to build because we ship the materials to you in the most convenient form for quick, easy assembly. Floor joists are ready-cut, main walls are sent in prefabricated sections. We make up these wall units in our own workshops. Skilled men, using production line methods, quickly frame up walls, nail on the thick damp proof sheathing and insulation, then add the finish siding. Windows and doors are carefully fitted and hung in place. Shop construction of wall sections ensures uniformly better workmanship throughout. Because we do this difficult, time-consuming part of the work in our shop, you save time and money in the erection of your home. Once the floor joists are set in place, the assembling of main walls and gables is completed in record time. Each unit fits the next accurately and easily and is quickly bolted in place.\n\nROOF RAFTERS READY-CUT\n\nRoof rafters are sent ready-cut, notched to fit, and can be erected just as fast as they can be nailed in place. Applying the roof sheathing boards requires only \"handy man\" ability to do a thoroughly practical job.\n\nPARTITION FRAMING READY-CUT\n\nAll studding for inside partitions and all ceiling joists are sent ready-cut also cellar stairs if included. Floor boards come in random lengths to be cut and nailed as required; inside doors are mortised to receive the locks and inside door and window trim is supplied in ready-cut form. In short, we send materials for your home in such a way that no man possessing ordinary ability to use a hammer, a wrench and a saw, need hesitate about undertaking the bulk of the work, with only the help of family or friends.\n\nERCTION TIME SAVED\n\nIf you prefer to engage paid help to erect your Simplex home, the method of supplying materials in prefabricated and ready-cut units reduces the labor cost to a minimum. Because of the short time required for erection and the fact that only inexpensive \"handy man\" labor is required, Simplex homes are made ready for occupation at surprisingly low cost. The scarcity of skilled workers need cause no worry to the builder of a Simplex home.\n\nPRICE 25\u00a2\nEverything\u2014COMPLETE AS PICTURED\n\nHere's our guarantee: You supply the foundation, which may be posts or a concrete or cement block wall; you also provide materials for the basement, and the steps at front, if made of cement or masonry material. With these few exceptions, our price includes all building material necessary for the complete construction of the home chosen.\n\nREAD HERE WHAT YOU GET\n\nBelow, we list, item by item, the various materials which we supply. Note how completely we cover every detail down to the last nail and the final coat of paint.\n\nNEW SPECIFICATIONS FOR SIMPLEX HOMES\u2014OUTSIDE CONSTRUCTION\n\n- ROOF SHEATHING\u2014Boards in random lengths.\n- ASPHALT SHINGLES\u201410 lb.

Simplex homes go up like magic.\n\nCHOICE OF SIDINGS\u2014The homes in this Catalog are shown with standard wall sections, supplied with the outer wood siding already nailed on, as described on the first page. The other sections show the same homes with the siding removed. Joist holes on the middle pages are pictured with special wall finishes which are applied after the walls are erected.

HOEY\n\nPort Hardy Military Camp\n\nI have recently had an opportunity of inspecting the army buildings which Colonel Hamile has had moved to the Six Nations Reserve. They are progressing very rapidly in having these set up as school buildings and they should prove satisfactory for a period of 5 years or more.\n\nThe attached letter and report concerns the removal of buildings from the Port Hardy Military Camp to be re-erected similarly as schools in the Kwawkewlth Agency at Alert Bay.\n\nI had an opportunity of discussing this situation with Major Mackay during his recent visit here. This project will do a great deal to alleviate the present shortage of educational facilities for the Indians in this area. In all it will provide the following buildings:\n\n(a) A four-room school at Alert Bay with two teachers' dwellings,\n\n(b) A teacher's residence at Campbell River,\n\n(c) A one-room school and teacher's residence at Tournour Island,\n\n(d) A one-room school and residence at Gilford Island,\n\n(e) A one-room school and residence at Cape Mudge,\n\n(f) A one-room school and residence at Village Island.\n\n....... when\nWhen Major Mackay's telegram arrived on Saturday, I did not hesitate to draft the telegram of approval for your signature. The reason for the immediate decision being necessary was the fact that men had to leave Vancouver on June 28 in order to begin this operation at once.\n\nThe immediate funds necessary are available under the item entitled \"Cape Mudge - one-room school and residence - $8,000.\" included in our Main Estimates. In order that we may fully avail ourselves of this excellent opportunity of securing important classroom accommodation, I would also recommend that we consider the transfer of $5,000.00 from the $10,000.00 which is available in our Vote for the assembling of materials for the residential school at Teslin, Y.T. Major Clark estimates that $5,000.00 will be sufficient to carry out most of this work at Teslin this summer.\n\nI would appreciate an opportunity of discussing this project with you and Miss Walton. You will note that one of the buildings will be used as a stores building for agency purposes.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJuly 2, 1947.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commission R.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Fort Hardy Military Camp Buildings.\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 27th and attached report addressed by Mr. C. E. Webb to Mr. T. S. Mills, outlining the uses to which these buildings could be put together with estimates of costs, you did not make any recommendations in regard to having some of these materials used for the erection of the stores building, presumably for agency purposes, at Alert Bay. Is it your wish and recommendation that we set aside $1,200.00, the estimate contained in Mr. Webb's report, for this building from the Indian Agency Vote, and can arrangements be made to handle this in the same way as the school programme is being arranged for.\n\nWe discussed at some length when you were in Ottawa the need of replacing the agency residence and office at Alert Bay, but as funds were not available this year it was decided to ask Mr. Todd to try to rent a residence if he was concerned as to the safety of his family owing to the condition of the residence. It has occurred to me that there might be materials available from this camp which could be set aside for the erection of an office building or possibly both office and residence. Will you kindly take the matter up with Mr. Webb and ascertain whether there is any likelihood of suitable materials, at least for an agency office, being available. If so please advise what sum should be set aside in the agency Vote for removal and re-erection and other costs.\n\nM.W.\n\nDirector.\nAIRMAL\n\nOttawa, July 10, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nFort Hardy Military Camp\n\nPlease find attached a copy of our memorandum which was submitted by our Director to the Deputy Minister concerning the utilization of certain buildings at the above camp, for educational purposes.\n\nWe have today received notification of the Deputy Minister's concurrence in our proposals.\n\nThis means that a total sum of $26,000.00 has been set aside for use on this project.\n\nIt is hoped that this sum will be sufficient and that we may be also able to consider putting an outer covering on the buildings of either asbestos shingle, insul-brick or cedar shingles. Colonel Ramsay has finished the army buildings at Brantford with both asbestos shingle and insul-brick. Of the two, he has found the insul-brick to be more satisfactory. However, in view of the lumber situation in British Columbia, you may prefer the use of cedar shingles or cedar siding.\n\nTo date we have not received from our Survey and Engineering Branch an official letter concerning this project.

We are sending you an extra copy of our blue prints and specifications so that they can study them carefully and make the modifications required for the prefabrication of a similar building.\n\nIt is realized that they cannot construct an identical building, but our minimum requirements are for the following:\n\n(a) A classroom as per the blue prints of our Surveys and Engineering Branch,\n\n(b) A teacherage attached to the classroom in such a way as to allow a common heating unit to provide warmth for both. This teacherage should consist of a kitchen, living room, and two bedrooms.\n\n(c) We would require a full basement as illustrated in the Surveys and Engineering plans.\n\nWe would appreciate your giving this matter priority as we are having great difficulty in interesting contractors in erecting our schools this year.\n\nBernard T.

Walton\n\nContracts on a Cost-Plus Basis\n\nWith reference to our conversation, this office is prepared to make progress payments to contractors in accordance with the work performed to date. Such applications for payments should be certified by the inspecting engineer or, in the absence of such, by an Indian agent representing the Branch, and duly approved by Headquarters.\n\nHowever, as pointed out, final payment will be subject to certification by the Treasury Cost Inspection and Audit Division, following an examination by them of the records of the contractor concerned. The final payment usually includes the contractors' profit on the over-all cost of labour and material involved in carrying out the work.\n\nThe Cost Inspection and Audit Division have offices located in all the provinces and is therefore prepared to handle, without undue delay, whatever audit work it may be necessary to perform on account of the various Government Departments.\n\nIt is suggested that just as soon as work is contemplated, cost-plus or otherwise, prior to entering into any negotiations, you first obtain an encumbrance Certificate from this office certifying that the necessary funds are available.\n\nW.

I understand Mr. Willim is also in charge of the factory where the prefabricated houses are built.\n\nThe plan submitted presented difficulties but Mr. Willim has promised within two or three weeks to submit a more streamlined type of plan which he claims lends itself more readily to prefabrication. He points out, however, that due to the pressure for houses he could not take on the making of schools until long after freeze-up or perhaps early in 1948. The city has been forced to provide some 56 houses for families now resident in the Immigration Hall and Mr. Willim stated he was forced to take on this extra work which has given him almost an impossible program of work.\n\nIf, later, the Department is satisfied with plans submitted by the North American Lumber Company, perhaps basements could be made ready this fall for the erection of schools early in 1948.\n\nA.

In 1948-49 we intend to build four new one-room day schools in your Inspectorate. So far the only one upon which we have definitely settled is a new school to replace the old one on the Sarcee Reserve. We have, no doubt, other reserves in mind upon which we should build day schools. Could we please have your recommendations on this point?\n\nWe can then notify Surveys and Engineering so that they can carry out a building site survey in September or October. We are anxious to have these surveys carried out this Fall so that we can start our building programs early in the Spring, and not have to delay it waiting for site reports from the engineers. They cannot carry out these surveys properly when the ground is frozen.\n\nBernard F.

Teslin, Yukon,\n2. A school in Northern Manitoba,\n3. A school in Northern Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have already written to you on May 31st concerning the proposed school at Teslin and have requested that your local engineer investigate our selected site.\n\nThe schools in Northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan will replace those burned down during the war.\n\nDay Schools\n\nWe hope to erect at least the following schools:\n\n1. 2 four-room day schools\n2. 4 two-room day schools\n3. 40 one-room day schools\n\nIn most instances the day schools will follow our standard plan. However, there is a possibility that certain\nof the schools will be for classrooms only and not combined teacher's residence.\n\nIn all, as you can see, we are doing everything possible to overcome the great deficit in the educational facilities now being provided for our Indian children. We are under increasing pressure from both the Indians, the Indian Committee and the public generally to provide classrooms for these children. A conservative estimate is that at least four hundred additional classrooms are required to accommodate children for whom there are at present no schools. Our plans for 1948-49 should help to reduce the required number of classrooms.\n\nHowever, we have not yet received the specifications for the Caughnawaga Day School. We requested the preparation of these plans in 1944.\n\nThe specifications for the two-room day school arrived on August 7th. We requested preparation of these plans on February 21, 1947.\n\nAccording to information you have given us, it would seem evident that you lack the staff necessary to prepare plans for these three residential schools and at the same time continue to do the necessary major repairs required constantly at our residential schools.\n\nWe must immediately face this problem as our building program for 1948-49 must be planned now. Therefore, we are bringing this situation to your attention so that we can have your considered opinion as to the feasibility of hiring private architects to carry out a part, at least, of our next year's program.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\nOttawa, August 11, 1947.\n\nMiss H.

This is particularly true of those schools in the more isolated parts of the country. Workmen were not willing to go to such places during the war years. Therefore, we face an accumulation of repairs.\n\nThis is the cause of the large sums required for the four schools situated in Northern Alberta.\n\n(a) Grouard - where $4,350. is required for repairs to the interior and exterior of the building, the pig pen and a new dough mixer.\n(b) Holy Angels - where $5,700. is required for repairs to the water system and a new battery for the lighting system.\n\n(c) Joussard - where $3,350. is required for repairs to the exterior and the root house, and a new dough mixer.\n\n(d) Vermilion - where $5,350. is required for repairs to the roof of the barn, interior of school, a new washer and a dough mixer.\n\nIn British Columbia we have two similar instances.\n\n(a) Cariboo - where $5,000. is required for repairs and replacements in the power house.\n\n(b) Christie - where $10,000. is required for building a 4 mile road to the school. For over 20 years all supplies and persons landing at this isolated spot on the stormy west coast of Vancouver Island have been carried ashore on human backs. Now the school management have erected a wharf in a sheltered cove and the road is required to give the school a proper supply route for the first time since it was constructed.\n\nAll large expenditures in the above list are forwarded for Ministerial approval as individual items are authorized.\n\nBFN/MGD\n\nDirector.\nOTTAWA\n\nJuly 3, 1947.\n\nMr. A.

A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner,\nNorthwest Territories,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEducational Facilities in the Northwest Territories\n\nI have received your letter of September 11 and attached report from Inspector McKinnon, summarizing the educational situation at each settlement in the Northwest Territories.\n\nThere are really three aspects to the problem of providing schools which Mr. McKinnon recommends:\n\n(a) As you are doubtless aware, the Indian Act requires that we operate a denominational school system. It is noted that Mr. McKinnon has recommended non-denominational day schools. It is felt that while church authorities are aware of the present clauses of the Indian Act dealing with this subject it will be extremely difficult to establish non-denominational schools until the Parliamentary Committee decides on the future educational clauses which it will recommend to Parliament for inclusion in our new Indian Act.\n\n(b) The problem of having these schools erected is one that will present many difficulties. We have had a most disappointing year insofar as the construction of new day schools in the Provinces is concerned. It will be just that much more difficult to interest contractors in the construction of schools in the Northwest Territories.\n\nWe have now practically decided to erect a certain number of prefabricated one-room day schools with\n\n..... attached\nattached teacherages next year. North American Buildings Limited, in Winnipeg, have prepared a blueprint of such a proposed school and it is now being studied by our Schools officials. We would appreciate receiving your comments as to the feasibility of erecting such a building in the Northwest Territories. Unfortunately we have only one set of the blueprints, received just two days ago, and therefore I cannot send to you a plan for study by your officials. However, Inspector McKinnon can see the plan in our Training Section if he so wishes.\n\n(c) The selection of satisfactory sites for our Indian day schools is usually done by our Surveys and Engineering Branch. We have already experienced considerable delays in the provinces in having these sites selected. This is due to the shortage of staff and also to the relative isolation of our Indian day schools. It will be just that much more difficult to locate these schools in the Territories. It is suggested that Inspector McKinnon and an official from the Surveys and Engineering Branch proceed north next spring and conduct these site surveys together, so that both the educational and the engineering features of the site will be sound. I feel that this matter is one which you and I could discuss together with Mr. Hardie at a future Directors' meeting.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, September 26, 1947.\n\nNorth American Buildings, Limited,\n711 Royal Bank Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nAttention: Mr. McKenzie.\n\nProposed One-room Indian day school\nwith teacher's residence\n\nWe have received from your Mr. Carpenter the\npreliminary plans of the above building. It has now been thoroughly\nstudied by our Officials here and we have but two suggested alter-\nations from the head office:\n\n(a) That the coat-room be entirely separated from the\nclassroom as follows:\n   (1) by placing doors at both ends of the present partition,\n   (2) by extending this partition to the ceiling,\n   (3) by placing a small window at the far end of the\n       cloak-room to provide ventilation.\n\nThe reason for these changes is to prevent the\nodor from drying clothes from reaching the classroom.\nPrevious experience has proved the necessity of having\nthe cloak-room cut off, as suggested above, from the\nclassroom.\n\n(b) That in preparing the basement plan provision be made for\nthe erection of a cement block, concrete or other fire-\nproof wall to isolate the furnace from the rest of\nthe basement.\n\n..... We have\nWe have requested Mr. Carpenter to send a copy of these blue prints to our Inspector of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, Mr. Ostrander. As soon as we have received Mr. Ostrander's comments we will write you again indicating the number of buildings of this type in which we will be interested. I would suggest that you make no changes in the preliminary plans until we have received the benefit of Mr. Ostrander's comments.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, September 26, 1947.\n\nMr. J.P.B. OSTERANDER,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAll Federal Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nPrefabricated One-room Indian Day School\n\nFrom previous correspondence and personal conversation, you will recall our interest in the construction of prefabricated one-room day schools and combined teachers' residences.\n\nThe Surveys and Engineering blue print of a standard one-room school and residence was submitted to North American Buildings, Limited, some time ago. As I informed you previously, they were unable to prefabricate the school as designed. However, they have now completed the preliminary plans for a one-room day school and residence which can be prefabricated by them. I have now such a plan before me and our officials have studied it at some length.\n\nUnfortunately, there is only one copy of this plan available here. However, I have asked Mr. Carpenter of the North American Buildings Limited to send you a copy of this plan directly from their head office in Winnipeg.\n\nIn view of your previous interest in such a project, I know that you will give this plan considerable study and we would appreciate your comments as to its suitability for use in your inspectorate. The company can begin the construction of such a building in January. The only two changes which we are recommending in the plans are as follows:\n\n(a) That the cloak-room be equipped with doors, thus entirely separating it from the classroom. We have also\n\n..... suggested\nsuggested that a window be put in this cloak-room at the opposite side of the school to the entrance.\n\n(b) That the furnace room be separated from the remainder of the basement by a cement block or other fireproof partition. This will prevent children using the basement as a play-room from interfering with the furnace.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, September 22nd, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nPlease give bearer six copies of the blue prints of the two room day school with teachers' residence attached.\n\nBernard F.

It has been the policy and practice of the department over a long period of years to contribute to the repairs necessary at these schools, and contributions have also been made for the purchase of a limited amount of operating equipment.\n\nThe desirability of continuing this policy has been carefully reviewed, following the increase in per capita grants for which provision is made in this year's Estimates. With the cost of living steadily increasing, however, it is difficult for me to see how we can escape this responsibility. I have in mind the cost of food, clothing, fuel, etc., higher salaries to teachers and to mechanics. I am attaching for your information a statement showing the annual outlay for repairs and for the purchase of equipment at government-owned schools and church-owned schools during the last four-year period. You will note that the amount spent on the repair of church-owned schools is substantially lower than the amount spent... on our own\non our own buildings. I can appreciate fully the hesitancy of the government to spend public funds for the repair of buildings other than buildings recognized as Crown property. In this connection, it has always seemed to me that a wise step would be for the government to set apart an annual appropriation enabling us to purchase one or two schools annually from the churches who now own them over, say, a ten-year period.

It was anticipated by the Engineers that this work would be completed and that all the accounts would be in by the end of the fiscal year. However, due to a shortage of materials this building was not completed in time to make final payment out of our last year's appropriation. Therefore we request that a part of the amount authorized for the Laxner Island 2-room school be used instead for this purpose. We have not been able to make any satisfactory arrangements with the contractor for the construction of this latter school.\n\n(b) An Order-in-Council has been obtained approving the granting of a contract for the construction of a 2 room school at Chetwynd. However, this school will cost considerably more than estimated, due to the fact that we have included running water and electricity plus a full basement to the original plans. As the Coughran plans and specifications are not even completed yet,\n\n.... the\nthe Surveys and Engineering Branch have assured us that we will only be able to use a small portion of the money for this school.\n\n(c) We were fortunate in obtaining from the Crown Assets Allocation Committee an entire army camp at Port Hardy, which is near Alert Bay. The Indian Commissioner for British Columbia had great difficulty in interesting contractors in the building of the schools which were listed in the Estimates. Therefore he recommended that the Surveys and Engineering Branch supervise the moving of some of these army huts for use as schools and teacherages at Alert Bay, Turnour Island, Gilford Island, Village Island and Campbell River.\n\nAt Kitimatla we have also obtained an army building which we can use as a school. We were unable to interest any contractor in the erection of the Upper Hay River School, due to its great isolation.\n\n(d) In Nova Scotia this transfer is necessitated by a transposition of amounts in the Estimates.\n### SCHEDULE \"A\"\n\nPage 3 (revised)\n\n#### ESTIMATED COST OF COMPLETE PROJECT:\n(Costs of Materials are F.O.B.

We would like to see the type of portable building that is being considered. It is a little late in the season for anyone to go in and select sites just now but I do think that the Superintendent of Forest Protection and Wildlife Management, Mr. Oldham, with the assistance of the Forest and Game Officers, could make the selection of the suitable sites because they are stationed permanently in the Territories and have facilities for getting around. It would be necessary for us to give a general idea of the type of location desired and the sort of layout that is contemplated. In fact, we should have a sufficient number of plans to convey a pretty accurate idea.\n\nAt some of these places it is going to be pretty difficult to put in a basement because of permafrost. We should know this as soon as possible.\n\nAs soon as the plan has been decided upon if you will give me a list of the places where the buildings are to be erected and copies of the plans, I will ask our officers to undertake the task of choosing the site. In view of the fact that these are to be designated as \"denomination\" schools, do you not think we should tell the mission authorities what is contemplated.\n\nR. A.

If I am well informed, this has been reduced to $40.00 per month, and is only payable during part of the year.\n\nThey claim first of all, that it is impossible to secure any kind of a watchman for $40.00 per month. Moreover, they have to provide board and lodging for them. In the case of married men, this becomes quite a problem.\n\nCannot something be done by the Department to increase the amount paid yearly for these services and put them on a yearly basis because the danger of fire is almost as great in May, June and September as it is during the balance of the year. All these buildings are getting older and the danger from fire is therefore increasing. Moreover, whilst there is no heating in the summer months, the cooking and operation of the laundries go on for 365 days. The danger of fire from these sources is no doubt quite apparent.\n\nTherefore, I hope that the Department will restore the ten months' grant and increase it in proportion to the increased cost of living.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, November 12, 1947.\n\nDear Father Plourde:-\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to the allowance made towards the salary of night watchmen at certain Indian residential schools.\n\nYour recommendation that an increased amount be allowed will receive careful consideration when we are preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard J. Henry\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nPP/MGD\nOctober 12th, 1946.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT under Votes 179 and 182 of the 1946-47 estimates of the Department of Mines and Resources, funds have been provided for the construction of certain new buildings at the Shubenacadie Indian Agency, in the Province of Nova Scotia, namely:-\n\n(a) School teachers' Residence.\n(b) School Principal's Residence.\n(c) Indian Agent's Residence.\n(d) Office-warehouse Building.\n\nTHAT tenders were invited on the basis of drawings and specifications prepared by the Department, through the medium of public advertisement inserted in Nova Scotia newspapers.\n\nTHAT bona-fide lump sum tenders for the buildings were received from the firms and for detailed and total amounts as follows:-\n\n| Name of Contractor                  | Teachers' Residence | Principal's Residence | Agent's Residence | Office Warehouse Building | Total Amount |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------|\n| Nova Scotia Construction Co., Ltd.  | $31,300            | $22,300               | $15,600           | $17,050                   | $86,250      |\n| Halifax, N.S.                       |                    |                       |                   |                           |              |\n| Kenney Construction Company Limited | $17,193            | $13,255               | $10,400           | $14,600                   | $55,448      |\n| Truro, Nova Scotia                  |                    |                       |                   |                           |              |\n\nTHAT additional tenders, not in accordance with instructions to tenderers were received as follows:-\n\n(a) By telegram from D.A. Macdonald, General Contractor, of Moncton, New Brunswick, not in detail, an offer to carry out the whole work for $72,000.\n\n(b) By letter from H.J. McMichael, of Antrim, Nova Scotia, an offer to carry out the whole work at cost plus ten per cent (10%).\nTHAT the bona-fide tenders were analyzed and found to be in accordance with the drawings, specifications and tendering documents prepared by the Department, and were accompanied by the required security deposit:\n\nTHAT subsequently to the receipt of tenders, it was decided to investigate whether the total cost of the buildings could be reduced by providing a simpler residence for the School Principal, using the identical architectural drawings prepared for the Indian Agent's residence and that for this purpose the lowest tenderer, Kenney Construction Company, Limited, of Truro, Nova Scotia, was contacted:\n\nTHAT the Kenney Construction Company, Limited, represented by J.N. Kenney, President of the firm who visited Ottawa, advised that they would be prepared, upon being awarded a contract, to erect a residence for the School Principal from the same design and at the same cost as the Indian Agent's residence, reducing the cost for the residence by Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifty-five Dollars ($2,855.00), and producing a reduced total cost for the whole work amounting to Fifty-two Thousand Five Hundred and Ninety-three Dollars ($52,593.00);\n\nTHAT with provision for contingencies and supervision a contract awarded on the basis of the revised total cost would involve an expenditure of approximately Fifty-eight Thousand Dollars ($58,000);\n\nThe work is considered to be of an urgent character and the undersigned, therefore, has the honour to recommend that he be authorized to accept the revised lowest tender furnished by the Kenney Construction Company, Limited, of Truro, Nova Scotia, and to enter into a contract with that firm for the erection of the four buildings hereinbefore named, in accordance with drawings and specifications prepared by the Department, and the contractors' revised estimate of Fifty-two Thousand Five Hundred and Ninety-three Dollars ($52,593.00), which with provision for contingencies and supervision, will entail a total expenditure of funds to the approximate amount of Fifty-eight Thousand Dollars ($58,000.00), the said expenditure to be met from the appropriate Votes of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nRe: Two Classroom Indian Day School With Teachers' Quarters.\n\nIn accordance with Mr. Neary's telephone request of today's date with our Chief Architect in connection with the above, we are forwarding, under separate cover, two sets of blueprints of our Drawings Index No. S49 Sheets 1 to 10 inclusive and H1 to H3 inclusive. You will observe that heating plan sheet No. H5 has a table of \"Schedule of Sizes\" for three conditions, namely: 0\u00b0 to 70\u00b0F, -15\u00b0 to 70\u00b0F and -30\u00b0 to 70\u00b0F.\n\nIf when a site is selected for any buildings being built from these drawings, we will be pleased to advise you which column should be used.\n\nT.

It was anticipated by the Engineer that this work would be completed and that all the accounts would be in by the end of the fiscal year. However, due to a shortage of materials this building was not completed in time to make final payment out of our last year's appropriation. Therefore we request that a part of the amount authorized for the Lennox Island 2-room school be used instead for this purpose. We have not been able to make any satisfactory arrangements with the contractor for the construction of this latter school.\n\n(b) An Order-in-Council has been obtained approving the granting of a contract for the construction of a 2 room school at Chenaill. However, this school will cost considerably more than estimated, due to the fact that we have included running water and electricity plus a full basement to the original plan. As the Caughnawaga plans and specifications are not even completed yet,\nthe Surveys and Engineering Branch have assured us that we will only be able to use a small portion of the money for this school.\n\n(c) We were fortunate in obtaining from the Crown Assets Allocation Committee an entire army camp at Port Hardy, which is near Alert Bay. The Indian Commissioner for British Columbia had great difficulty in interesting contractors in the building of the schools which were listed in the Estimates. Therefore he recommended that the Surveys and Engineering Branch supervise the moving of some of these army huts for use as schools and teacherages at Alert Bay, Turnour Island, Gilford Island, Village Island and Campbell River.\n\nAt Kitkatla we have also obtained an army building which we can use as a school. We were unable to interest any contractor in the erection of the Upper Hay River School, due to its great isolation.\n\n(d) In Nova Scotia this transfer is necessitated by a transposition of amounts in the Estimates.\nOttawa, November 26, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nStandardized two-room day school plan for use in Northwest Territories -\n\nAs agreed upon at the meetings of the Sub-committee on Education in the Northwest Territories, we have included in our estimates the sum of $40,000.00 each for two-room schools and residences at Arctic Red River, Fort Franklin, Fort Good Hope and Roche River.\n\nOur Superintendent of Education has discussed this matter with your Inspector of Schools and they are agreed that the present two-room Indian day school plan would not provide a suitable building for use in the Northwest Territories.\n\nTherefore, I would request that you have your architects prepare a new plan with the following modifications:\n\n(a) In view of the permafrost conditions there should be no basement to the school.\n\n(b) There should be a furnace-room on the same level as the school, with some storage room space provided.\n\n(c) Other modifications could be discussed with your architects, as it is understood that in preparing the plans for the Bay River School, they have departed considerably from the previous standard four-room school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nTRANSFER BETWEEN ALLOTMENTS\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE TO THE SECRETARY, TREASURY BOARD, FOR THE FOLLOWING TRANSFERS WITHIN:\n\nVOTE: 181 - 1947-48.\n\n| NAME OF PRIMARY | AUTHORIZED AMOUNT | PROPOSED DECREASE | PROPOSED INCREASE |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Construction of Buildings and Works | | | |\n| (A) British Columbia - | | | |\n| West Coast Agency: Completion of classroom block at Alberni Residential School | $16,000.00 | | |\n| Prince Edward Island - Lennox Island Agency - 2-room school and residence | $18,000.00 | $16,000.00 | |\n\nDEPARTMENTAL EXPLANATION\n\nWhen our 1947-48 Estimates were being prepared, our Surveys and Engineering Branch was supervising the construction of a 4-classroom block at the Alberni Residential School.

The Indian Commissioner for British Columbia had great difficulty in interesting contractors in the building of the schools which were listed in the Estimates. Therefore he recommended that the Surveys and Engineering Branch supervise the moving of some of these army huts for use as schools and teachersages at Alert Bay, Turnour Island, Gilford Island, Village Island and Campbell River.\n\nAt Kitkatla we have also obtained an army building which we can use as a school. We were unable to interest any contractor in the erection of the Upper Hay River School, due to its great isolation.\n\nIn Nova Scotia this transfer is necessitated by a transposition of amounts in the Estimates.\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAPPROVED\n\nAPPROVED\n\nBRANCH HEAD\n\nDEPUTY HEAD\n\nMINISTER\n\nNOTE: APPROVAL OF THE MINISTER IS REQUIRED ONLY WHERE A QUESTION OF POLICY IS INVOLVED.\n\nTREASURY COMMENTS\n\nACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNTING RECORDS, THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO THESE TRANSFERS BEING MADE AND THE APPLICATION IS THEREFORE SUBMITTED FOR THE APPROVAL OF TREASURY BOARD, AS REQUIRED UNDER SECTION 26 OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE AND AUDIT ACT.\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nFOR COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\n\nT.

DATED December 30, 1947\n\nAPPROVED BY THE TREASURY BOARD\n\nFOR SECRETARY\nRe: One-roomed Day Schools with Teachers' Living Accommodations\n\nThe copy of a letter from North American Builders Limited, which you forwarded to our Chief Architect, has been studied and in our opinion constitutes only a request to be permitted to revert to their own standards of construction rather than to follow the working drawings furnished to their Mr. Carpenter by this Division when he visited this office with you a few weeks ago.\n\nIt appears that no purpose will be served in entering into extended discussions with North American Builders Limited in attempting to have them follow structural details embodied in our drawings. However, suggestions advanced in the Company's letter of November 28th last are not indicative of sound structural practice nor were the drawings they had previously submitted structurally correct.\n\nNevertheless, if in the interest of the Indian Affairs' Training Programme, it is decided to build prefabricated one-roomed schools supplied by North American Builders Limited, where the services of recognized contractors can not be obtained in Western areas, the drawings from which such buildings will be erected should be amended in accordance with sketches prepared in this office, duplicate copies of which are forwarded herewith for your transmission to them.\n\nIn connection with Mr. Carpenter's comments relative to difficulties encountered in attempting to apply their prefabricated floor panels to our design, he advanced the suggestion that basement windows should be lowered in order that 6\" of concrete above such windows should serve as a lintel we may say that the suggestion is quite in line with practices followed by speculative builders, but that such lintels usually fracture as soon as the adjacent floor load is applied. The detail embodied in our drawings was worked out particularly to overcome that fault. If concrete rather than a wooden beam is preferable, then the detail drawn in crayon on the accompanying blue prints is a more acceptable alternative. It permits windows being left as they are, but necessitates raising the main floor level sufficiently to permit pouring a greater depth of lintel, and which of course, must be reinforced. The sill must be dowelled to the concrete by hooked bolts placed when concrete is poured. The increase in height will necessitate the addition of two steps at the outside entrance platform.\n\nA rigid inspection of a completed prefabricated school building should be made by a well qualified technical officer after the structure has been in use for two or three years.\n\nT.S.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\n502 Booth Building,\nSpence Street,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nI have gone over very carefully with our engineering department the plans for the Indian School given to us by Mr. Buck while in Ottawa, and there are a number of points they brought up which make it undesirable for us to prefabricate exactly as the print shows.\n\nThe prefabrication of floor sections for this type of dwelling necessitates a beam being inserted to act as a lintel over basement windows, and this is not practicable in our method of construction. I suggest that you lower the basement window height 8\" and pour 6\" of concrete on top of this and have the mudsill embedded in the concrete.\n\nThe specifications show gypsum board as an inside finish. This would necessitate crating each and every panel for shipping, and would add considerably to the shipping weight of the building. In addition we are unable to get a seamless plywood wall using gypsumboard.\n\nOne other feature is that in prefabrication we must avoid a large overhang in the eave and gable ends.\n\nAnother thing on the plan is that it necessitates our installing dwarf walls on the second storey bedroom, which would require to be braced to the roof and ceiling joists and would entail a large amount of field work, thus delaying the speedy erection of the building and adding considerably to extra cost.\n\nIn view of the difficulties we will encounter in trying to prefabricate exactly to the print as prepared by Mr. Buck I would ask that you have Mr. Buck send us the alternative plan which he had worked out using our blueprints as a basis. I feel that in this way we can give you what you wish and at the same time simplify our production and save considerable cost to you at the same time.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you at your earliest convenience in regard to the above.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNORTH AMERICAN BUILDINGS LIMITED.\n\nF.

There are a few points which have been revealed in constructing this school during the past year:\n\n(1) In the specifications and the bill of materials it is required that 3/8 inch thick gypsum board in sheets 4 ft. x 12 ft. be used for classroom walls and ceilings. We have received reports from Indian Agents that where this gypsum board has to be transported for long distances and especially where boat transportation is used, it is too heavy and too brittle to stand the rough handling involved. Mr. Indian Agent Goodman of Norway House, who was building a school by day labour at Cross Lake, reported a loss of 40% was sustained on a shipment of gypsum board. He has asked that we substitute one inch thick Ten-test in place of gypsum board in future.\n\n(2) In the specifications and bill of materials it is required that for the exterior wall finish either bevel or drop siding or asbestos-siding shingles be used. Here again we have had difficulty with the transporting of the Asbestos shingles. It would seem evident that manufacturers today are not producing Asbestos-shingles as carefully as they should. They arrive on the school site with the corners chipped and with many of the shingles cracked. As a result we have had requests from Agents that they be permitted to substitute Insul-brick siding as an alternative to Asbestos-shingles.\n\n---- The\nThe above points are passed along to you for comment.\n\nWe would also like to have prepared by your Architects and Engineers the following further blue-prints and specifications for this school.

In these schools, it is planned that the female teacher will reside with the nurses in the nursing station to be erected by the Indian Health Services. It is felt that in isolated communities, it will be to the advantage of all concerned if the teacher and the nurse can live together and thus reduce the sense of isolation which so often discourages our teachers.\n\nTherefore we would like to have prepared a set of standard plans for a one-room school. This plan could be either based upon the blue prints for the New Credit Indian Day School (erected in 1938) or the attached modern one-room school plan. It is also requested that this plan be prepared to indicate electrical connections and running water connections.\n\nEnc.\n\nDirector.\n\nRFN/EM\nJanuary 9, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Sinclair:\n\nAs discussed with you over the telephone yesterday, please find attached a list of the new school buildings which we have requested to be included in the 1948-49 Estimates. The one-room schools will be constructed mainly under the supervision of Indian Agents. In some instances the two-room schools will also be thus constructed. I have marked with an asterisk the buildings which we are particularly concerned with having supervised by your Architectural Section.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G. Sinclair,\nExecutive Assistant,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nNorlite Building,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nBIM/M\nJanuary 17, 1948.\n\nMr. W.B. Arneil, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver,\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Regional Supervisor of Indian\nAgencies, Calgary,\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina,\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg.\n\nStandard One-room Day School and\nAttached Teacher's Residence\n\n1. Construction by Contractors and/or Day Labour.\n\nWe have now a stock of the following documents\non hand:\n\n(a) Blueprint plans for standard one-room Indian day\nschool and attached teacher's residence;\n\n(b) Specifications for this school;\n\n(c) Bill of Materials for this school.\n\nAt the present time we have these standard schools\nunder construction in several provinces. Regional super-\nvisors and agents have co-operated most willingly in trying\nto carry out our 1947-48 building programme. In general,\nconstruction is being carried out under three methods:\n\n(a) Contract on a flat price;\n\n(b) Contract on a cost plus fixed fee basis (normally 10%);\n\n(c) Day labour basis, employing a foreman at a fixed hourly\nrate and using Indian labour.\n\nWe have found by experience this year that this\nstandard school can be built for a cost of between $10,000.00\nand $14,500.00 depending on location, availability of\nJanuary 17, 1948.\n\n- 2 -\n\nmaterials, etc. The Engineering and Construction Service of the Department would not recommend acceptance of tenders in excess of this latter amount.\n\n2. Prefabricated Schools.\n\nNorth American Buildings, Limited, Winnipeg, are now completing plans and specifications for a one-room school and teacher's residence very similar to our standard plan. This building will be prefabricated in Winnipeg and shipped by rail, truck or boat. We have purchased four teacherages from this company for erection this year, and with one exception were quite satisfied with their work. The cost of this school will depend on the number we order from them. This school is so made that it can be erected in one day. The Company sends out an experienced foreman and we have to provide the additional labour.\n\nWe are also responsible for sub-contracting the\n\n(a) Excavation of basement and pouring cement (company provides plan).\n\n(b) Installation of furnace.\n\n(c) Construction of brick chimney.\n\nDue to shipping costs it will normally be practical to ship this prefabricated school only as far west as Saskatchewan or east as far as Kenora, Ontario.\n\n3. Building Programmes of One-Room Schools for 1948-49.\n\nUnfortunately we are not yet in a position to definitely advise you as to the amounts which will be available next year for one-room school construction in your region. The 1948-49 Estimates are still the subject of discussion between our Department, the Department of Reconstruction and Supply and the Treasury Board.\n\nYou will be advised as soon as we receive definite information as to the amounts available for new buildings and construction in your province. In the meantime, we are preparing newspaper advertisements requesting tenders for\nJanuary 17, 1948.\n\n- 3 -\n\ncontracts for these one-room schools.\n\nThe Auditor-General has insisted that the clauses of the Public Works Act with regard to advertising for tenders, be adhered to in future. During the emergency war years, some variations from these regulations were permitted but we are now required to advertise for tenders on construction of public buildings in excess of $5,000.00.\n\nSamples of the advertisements mentioned above are attached hereto for your information. It is our intention to begin advertising in the instance of some schools in the near future. In cases of \"re-votes\" and urgent priority schools we will be soon writing directly to Indian Agents, with a copy to you. We will send them sample advertisements and request them to advise,\n\n(a) Names of newspapers in which we should advertise;\n\n(b) Post offices and other Government buildings in which we should display drawings, specifications, etc.\n\nYou will then be advised in due course as to the names of successful tenderers, if any. If no tenders are received you will also be advised so that other means can be considered whereby the construction of these schools can be carried out during the year.\n\nAs previously pointed out, these other means involve,\n\n(a) Direct approach to contractors when advertising has failed to produce tenders;\n\n(b) Construction on a day labour basis;\n\n(c) The erection of pre-fabricated schools.\n\nIt may be that you can advise the Department now as to the advisability of ordering pre-fabricated schools for certain reserves as the only means of having our 1948-49 building programme completed. In such instances it would be appreciated if you would let us know immediately so that we can place the necessary order with North American Buildings, Limited. This Company has large orders to fill from the Departments of Transport, Health and Welfare and National Defence and we will have to place orders by February, to\nJanuary 17, 1946.\n\n- 4 -\n\nensure delivery by Summer or Autumn.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n(1) We will shortly be advertising for tenders for the construction of certain one-room schools and will advertise for tenders on others when the 1948-49 Estimates are finalized.\n\n(2) Inspectors Hamilton and Ostrander should advise the Department as to their requirements of prefabricated one-room schools and attached teacherages as soon as possible. Commissioner Arnell may contact prefabricated building companies in British Columbia to ascertain their interest in a prefabricated school. We are negotiating now with a company in Ontario.\n\nBernard F.

School Inspector\n\nVancouver\nJanuary 7.\n\nThe following is a list of required additions and new buildings for Day Schools in this Province. These have been classified according to the type of construction required and arranged in order of a suggested priority. No buildings in the Nicola and Okanagan or Kootenay Agencies have been included as I am not familiar with conditions in that section of the Province. Needed construction at Residential schools has also been omitted. In addition to arranging in priority the needed work in each classification I have given my opinions as to the six most urgent projects. No reference is made to the buildings under construction or proposed in the Kawaweshk Agency which involve the use of the army huts from the camp at Port Hardy.\n\nA. One Room Schools Required\n\n1.

Klemtu - one room and teacherage\n3. Bella Bella - two room and teacherage for two teachers\n4. Seabird Island - one room with teacherage\n5. Pemberton - one room addition plus accommodation for additional teacher.\n6. Hazelton - three classrooms with teacherage.\n\nAll this work was authorized for 1947-48 year with the exception of the first and third items. In the case of Hazelton, only two rooms were authorized but this would provide only for the immediate need.\n\nR.F. Devey,\nDist. Inspector of schools.\nWith reference to your letter of September 15th, 1947 and my reply thereto of September 28th, I wish to forward herewith a copy of a memorandum to the undersigned from the District Inspector of Schools for British Columbia setting out in detail the required additions and new buildings for day schools in British Columbia. It is not expected that construction authorized at Hazelton, Seabird Island, Klemtu and Pemberton for which funds have been set aside will be started with this year and a high priority rating should therefore be given to these projects in the 1948-49 program.\n\nIt will be observed that a three classroom building with teacherage is required at Hazelton instead of two classrooms with teacherage as originally planned, and a two classroom addition at Bella Bella with accommodation for two teachers instead of one classroom with teacherage as previously recommended. The Inspector lists the preferred order of work for the first six projects as follows:\n\n1. Matlakatla - one room.\n2. Klemtu - one room and teacherage.\n3. Bella Bella - two rooms and teacherage for two teachers.\n4. Seabird Island - one room with teacherage.\n5. Pemberton - one room addition plus accommodation for additional teacher.\n6. Hazelton - three classrooms with teacherage.\nThese changes in the program originally submitted were brought about as the result of the provisions this year of the new school at Nikatin and additional information secured as a result of inspections made by Inspector Davy.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

Your above letter will assist the Department greatly in planning its construction projects for your Province during the next fiscal year. Unfortunately, our Estimates are now being considered by Treasury Board and it will not be possible to change the amounts or details. However, in view of Inspector Davey's and your own comments on the matter, we can make the necessary transfers when the Vote is finalized.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, January 17, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nOne-Room School Plans and Specifications -\n\nThe Education Division of this Branch is now preparing to proceed with the advertising for tenders for a large number of one-room Indian day schools and attached teachers' residences, which we have requested for inclusion in our 1948-49 Estimates. Please find attached a sample newspaper advertisement which has been worked out in conjunction with Mr. Buck of your Service.\n\nIn order to provide the necessary blue-prints and specifications for the Indian Agents and Post Offices, it would be appreciated if we could be provided with the following sets of plans and specifications:-\n\n(a) 120 Drawings of one-room Indian day school and attached teacher's residence.\n   120 Sets of specifications for above.\n\n(b) 20 Drawings of four-room Indian day school\n   20 Sets of specifications for above.\n\nWe will advise you later as to our requirements for two-room schools with attached teacherages.\n\nEnc.\n\nDirector\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Standard Combined One Classroom Indian Day School with Teachers Quarters.\n\nWith reference to the memorandum of the 2nd instant regarding the above, signed by the Acting Director of Indian Affairs and your marginal request thereon dated 5/1/48, we would comment as follows:\n\n(1) Gypsum wallboard 3/8 inch thick with filled and taped joints is specified for interior walls and ceilings as it has a smooth hard surface for painting approximately equal to that of a hardwall plaster surface. It may be that if gypsum board sheets not longer than eight feet were used, these would withstand the rough handling involved in transportation to distant points, without anything like the 40 per cent loss by damage reported by Indian Agent Goodman of Norway House where sheets up to 12 feet in length were used.\n\nAn objection to \"Ten-Test\" is that it is a soft material with edges and surface easily subject to damage not only in transportation but by the ordinary wear and tear of school usage. Also all joints have to be covered with wood strips or moulding to present a neat appearance which would involve a considerable amount of extra material and labour. For Ten-Test 1\" thick window frames should be deepened, so that the interior window trim can be correctly applied. The extra thickness of the Ten Test plus the deeper frames will of course add to the cost, and is not required.\n\nMore durable alternative materials than Ten-Test, would be 3/6\" Masonite board or ply-wood, both of which should be available.\n\n(2) Regarding exterior walls, this Division has felt that asbestos shingle siding provided an attractive appearing and fire resisting finish, but under conditions where care in transporting and applying is not possible, damage will certainly occur.\n\nNevertheless since insul-brick has fire resistance, and some insulating value, we will raise no objection to its use, although in our opinion the appearance of the building will not be as good.\n\nWith reference to the matter of plans and specifications for (a) electrical and (b) plumbing installations for standard one-room day schools, insofar as equipment inside the building is concerned layouts, and equipment can be shown on a separate sheet to be used as an appendix to the typical set of drawings.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nF.A.

Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nGypsum wall board - Northern Bay School Construction.\n\nWe passed your comments concerning the use of gypsum wall-board to our Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nWe have today received a letter from this Branch reading as follows:\n\n\"Gypsum wallboard 3/8 inch thick with filled and taped joints is specified for interior walls and ceilings as it has a smooth hard surface for painting approximately equal to that of a hardwood plaster surface. It may be that if gypsum board sheets not longer than eight feet were used, these would withstand the rough handling involved in transportation to distant points without anything like the 40 per cent loss by damage reported by Indian Agent Goodman of Norway House where sheets up to 12 feet in length were used.\n\n\"An objection to 'Ten-Test' is that it is a soft material with edges and surfaces easily subject to damage not only in transportation but by the ordinary wear and tear of school usage.

On December 1, 1947, we made application for the transfer of $16,000.00 of this sum to be made to the West Coast Agency in British Columbia for the completion of a class-room block at the Alberni Residential School.\n\nAt that time we had been unable to make any satisfactory arrangements with a contractor for the construction of the Lennox Island School. However, we have now been able to purchase from War Assets Corporation, buildings at the Mount Pleasant Airport, P.E.I., so have arranged for a foreman to supervise the demolition of these buildings which we will move across the ice to Lennox Island. Next spring, we can have our foreman supervise the construction of this school from this used lumber, employing Indian labour. The above sum is required for the purchase of these buildings and to pay for the labour in their demolition.\n\nRECOMMENDED APPROVED APPROVED\n\nBRANCH HEAD DEPUTY HEAD MINISTER\n\nNOTE: APPROVAL OF THE MINISTER IS REQUIRED ONLY WHERE A QUESTION OF POLICY IS INVOLVED.\n\nTREASURY COMMENTS\n\nAccording to the accounting records, there is no objection to these transfers being made and the application is therefore submitted for the approval of Treasury Board, as required under Section 25 of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act.\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER FOR COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\n\nT. B. DATED\n\nAPPROVED BY THE TREASURY BOARD\n\nFOR SECRETARY\nCopy for the information of Mr. Hoey\nAttention: Col. Neary\n\nOttawa, January 17, 1947.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\n\nRe - Aluminum Building Construction.\n\nSince my memorandum of the 19th of November, considerable information has been obtained as to the progress in Canada in the construction of aluminum buildings. This may be summarized as follows:\n\nThe Aluminum Company of Canada advise that the plans of standard departmental buildings submitted to them would not be suitable for conversion into prefabricated metal structures. They admit that certain components might be made of aluminum, but they are not in a position to undertake the design, fabrication or construction of such parts or buildings, nor is there any other company in Canada, except the Cresswell Roll Forming Company, able to do so.\n\nMr. M. F. Goudge of this Department recently inspected two prefabricated houses erected at Kingston; the first made by the Cresswell Company of Montreal is composed entirely of aluminum with the exception of foundations, floors and insulation. A dwelling 17' x 27' would cost \u00a3600 factory, about $2,500, but would require certain modifications, particularly as regards insulation, to suit our purpose which would add to the cost.\n\nThe second house is of English manufacture in which aluminum is used for sheathing only. The cost of this building 30' x 22' in England would be about \u00a34,500, but this cost includes plumbing, fittings, stove, etc. This structure in its present state would not be suitable for our climate.\nThe Directorate of Engineering Development, Department of National Defence, is now working on the design of an aluminium army hut having the roof, floor and wall panels interchangeable, and with the main structural parts so designed that they would be suitable for structures of variable dimensions. Insulation is receiving considerable attention and a sample building is to be erected at Churchill for tests during the winter of 1948-49. A certain amount of research is being carried out by the National Research Council and the information being assembled will be available to the army.\n\nIt is believed that further studies by the Department of National Defence, the Research Council and the Crosswell Roll Forming Company, who are the only fabricants equipped for construction of this nature at present, may eventually lead to the economic use of aluminium for building construction suitable for northern latitudes. However, no immediate relief is foreseen and probably the only type of aluminium building that can be produced at reasonable cost in the Northwest Territories for years is a simple one-story army hut structure.\n\nWe will keep in close touch with research now being carried on to ensure that any practical developments are brought to your attention.\n\nR.

Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\nB.F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Bldg.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Prefabrication\n\nIn accordance with your memorandum dated November 18, 1947, enquiries were sent to North American Builders, Limited, Winnipeg, and Prefabricated Builders Limited, Vancouver, regarding the feasibility and cost of constructing the following buildings by their methods of prefabrication:\n\n- Caretaker's Residence. (29) Sheets 1 and 2\n- Game Warden's Cabin. (N.P.5) \" 1 to 4.\n- Staff Residence. (N.L.41) \" 1, M1, E1.\n- Indian Agent's Residence. (782) \" 1 to 5 and D2 to 4.\n\nThe attached replies have been received; the blueprints from Vancouver did not arrive until this week.\n\nAlthough neither company quoted any prices, obviously the quickest and cheapest way in which their products can be used is to adopt their nearest equivalent to our requirements. Thus, both companies sent those of their standard designs which most closely resemble the drawings we sent.\n\nNorth American Buildings Limited.\n\nThe least attractive feature of their designs is the exterior elevation. Fenestration is poor both in scale and location. Entrances receive little or no architectural treatment and entrance doors are only 2' 6\" wide. Roof slopes are rather flat being 28-1/3\u00b0 against the generally accepted 33-1/3\u00b0 minimum for asphalt shingle roofs. The design of the chimneys could easily be improved.\n\nCubage runs very close to our figures. Our plans, of course, are exactly to our requirements, and their plans are reasonably equivalent.\n\n|                | Ours     | Theirs    |\n|----------------|----------|-----------|\n| Indian Agent's Residence | 19,110 cu.ft. | 19,459 cu.ft. |\n| Caretaker's Residence   | 14,894 cu.ft. | 13,621 cu.ft. |\n| Staff Residence         | 25,718 cu.ft. | 18,371 cu.ft. |\n| Game Warden's Cabin     | 18,238 cu.ft. | 19,119 cu.ft. |\n\nNOTES\n\nStaff Residence\n\nKitchen is small and poorly placed and opens into bedroom.\n\nCaretaker's Residence\n\nLiving room and second bedroom too small but bedroom opening off living room is avoided. Their elevation for this building is their best one.\n\nEnclos.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIndian Agent's Residence.\n\nElevation badly proportioned\u2014very high\u2014avoided in our design by the use of dormers, giving our design a better appearance and better ceiling heights. Their ceiling is 7' 6\" on second floor. Poor entrance. Generally, their plan is acceptable. No flue is provided for kitchen range.\n\nGame Warden's Cabin\n\nTheir plan inferior; bath opens off front hall remote from bedrooms. No vestibule. Their 2nd floor plan gives smaller bedrooms and closets.\n\nPrefabricated Buildings Limited\n\nThis company supplied blueprints of three cottages, their \"Borwood,\" \"Laurell\" and \"Redwood\" designs. The same general comments apply. Roof slopes, except the \"Redwood\" are dangerously flat for shingle covering. Chimney designs are better, but exterior elevations generally leave something to be desired. Also, vestibule entrances are not provided, and these are essential in most parts of Canada, except perhaps southwest British Columbia.\n\nThis company, however, provides construction details, including foundations. These are based on structural unit prefabrication, a system successfully used by Fearless Housing, Limited, and one which permits greater flexibility in design. This system is adaptable to custom design.\n\nTo use the products of these firms, it would evidently be most expedient to select one of their stock designs, and then to have made the minimum alterations required for efficient and safe construction. Cost and the amount of time involved would have to be the subject of further enquiry.\n\nIt should be noted that these firms provide only the frame and exterior covering for a building. Plumbing, heating, electrical services, insulation, some interior finish and the foundations would have to be supplied by this Department in the usual way.\n\n(Sgd) T.S.

You will be particularly interested in their comments regarding \"Prefabricated Buildings Limited\"\u2014\n\n\"This company supplied blueprints of three cottages, their 'Dogwood,' 'Laurel,' and 'Redwood' designs.

Noffke, Architect, 46 Elgin St., Ottawa.\n\nIn opening the meeting Mr. Gibson stated that Mr. Noffke had been requested to attend with a view to ascertaining if he was prepared to assist the Lands and Development Services by preparing plans and specifications for some of the buildings that the Department hopes to erect during the coming summer. Mr. Gibson referred particularly to the four proposed residential schools.\n\nAfter some discussion during which Mr. Buck outlined the plans he had already prepared and those that were required, Mr. Noffke stated that he was prepared to prepare plans, specifications, etc., within a reasonable time.\n\nIt had been pointed out to Mr. Noffke that funds would be available on April 1st and would have to be spent by the end of March, 1949 and consequently it was desirable to have plans and specifications ready at the earliest possible date.\n\nMr. Gibson directed Mr. Mills to prepare an order in council authorizing the employment of Mr. Noffke at the rates specified by the Ontario Architects' Association.\nIt was further arranged that Mr. Noffke would interview Mr. Buck on Friday, February 6th, at which time Mr. Buck would outline more specifically the work that is required at once.\n\nSubsequent to the meeting I accompanied Mr. Noffke to Mr. Buck's room where we discussed the plans required for ten or fifteen minutes. During this latter discussion Mr. Noffke pointed out the desirability of existing fire proof buildings. Mr. Buck and myself agreed that such action might be desirable but that owing to the very heavy increase in cost of lumber and the fact that lumber is available in many places and that fire proof materials would involve heavy expenditures to transport, we were not in a position to decide that funds would be available for construction of fire proof buildings at a much greater cost than frame buildings.\n\nMr. Noffke realized this point and following his interview with Mr. Buck on Friday, we will hear further from the latter.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Each component part is accurately pre-cut to shape and size, and numbered to correspond with a master layout. By this means, the use of semi-skilled labour can be increased, while time and transportation costs are reduced.\n\nThis Company does not undertake the erection of their pre-cut buildings and advise that employment of a reliable general contractor is the usual procedure.\n\nThe Company has developed a number of efficient carefully designed small houses, several hundred of which are currently being erected in the Ottawa area. It is possible that some of their standard designs might be used where we require similar accommodation for a game warden's cabin or an agent's residence. They will also prepare designs to suit customers' requirements, but due to heavy commitments, they are reluctant to do so at the present time.\n\nTheir representative stated that they prefer not to accept orders of less than ten (10) buildings of the same design at one time, and states that they hoped to provide more varied and rapid service when supply conditions become easier.\n\nOf the three companies investigated, this organization appears to have the most carefully studied and best designed houses, in addition to which, the cost includes concrete materials for the basement and footings, electric wiring, plumbing materials and fixtures, as well as all materials for the super-structure.\n\nCopies of this report will be forwarded to Messrs. Smart, Meikle, LeCapelain and Henry.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI have to refer to Department letter of the 17th instant, File No. 1-1-5 (W T), regarding the erection of day schools in the future.\n\nI have already received blue print of a standard one-room Indian day school with attached teacher's residence, and the work of constructing one on this plan has been commenced at the Nut Lake Reserve of the Touchwood Agency. Please advise me whether that is the plan which it is proposed to follow.\n\nIt will be recalled that an effort was made to have a similar school built at the Chitek Lake Reserve of the Carlton Agency in 1947 but I was able to secure only one quotation, and the Department decided that the quotation was too high. All construction is too costly at the present time and I believe that we, in the Province of Saskatchewan, are the most unfortunate in this respect. New labour laws and regulations in this province make it necessary for the contractor to add approximately 12% to the usual labour costs. This 12% is to cover holidays with pay, over-time, and lost time resulting from our strict labour laws. Of course this results in a construction job costing more in this province, and those in management who have the decisions to make in acceptance of a tender should not forget our difficulties in this regard. If we are going to continue to erect buildings while being subjected to labour laws which are not in force in other provinces, the additional cost must be accepted as a fact and I hope that I shall not be continually reminded that a certain type of building can be erected in other provinces at less than in Saskatchewan.\n\nWith this in mind I am inclined to favour the prefabricated building because of the fact that much of the labour in a prefabricated building has been performed in other provinces at a lower cost because of more lenient labour laws. Our experience with the North American Buildings, of Winnipeg, in connection with a prefabricated house for the Farming Instructor at the Keseseekoue Reserve, of the Pelly Agency, has not been at all encouraging, but the difficulties which we have faced could be avoided to some extent in the future by being guided by experience in this first house. I certainly think that if we are to construct an appreciable number of prefabricated buildings we should have a construction foreman with some experience in the factory in Winnipeg, to supervise each prefabricated building we erect. Both time and money would be saved by this being done. It is true that a company foreman to supervise construction is sent for each job. He has instructions to perform certain work in the commencement of the erection, but he is gone from the job before those left to complete it have learned much about the difficulties they will meet.\n\nI am also in favour of the employment of a full-time construction foreman for all building work, both new and repaired. A suitable man with full-time employment on a salary could have most of the work performed by Indians at fair wages, and be instructing them in order that they would, themselves, become more useful for the future. I have already communicated with the Department regarding the employment of Mr. Olaf Lidfors, of Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, who would be very satisfactory for such employment. However, Mr. Lidfors will not accept it unless he is promised an annual salary and apparently that cannot be done under the present set-up.\n\nThe day schools which should be erected this year are as shown in my letter No. 1440-300-11A, of February 20th, 1947. Please take note of the last paragraph of that letter...\nOttawa, January 29, 1948.\n\nRe: Prefabricated Buildings.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of the 26th instant, with attached copy of our memorandum to Mr. Gibbon of January 16th last dealing with prefabricated buildings, we are forwarding herewith a report on a discussion held with the Ottawa representative of the Peerless Housing Company of Canada Limited.\n\nT.S.

Under the re-organization it is expected that the Valley River Reserve, of the Pelly Agency, will be in the Birtle Agency, of the Manitoba Inspectorate. As perhaps those who will be responsible for the Valley River Reserve in the near future know nothing of the great need for a two-room day school there, the matter should not be overlooked in the 1945 building program.\n\nI should emphasize that because of our Saskatchewan Labour Laws we should concentrate on prefabricated buildings, if possible, and we should have a full-time foreman to supervise their construction if a number are being ordered.\n\nJ.F.B.

It is presumed that the furnace will be placed in such a position in the heating room, as to facilitate the feeding of the furnace from the fuel room.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, February 14, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nPrefabricated one-room day schools with attached teachers' residences - Saskatchewan.\n\nIn our 1947-48 Estimates we included appropriations for the construction of five one-room Indian day schools and attached teachers' residences for the province of Saskatchewan. In spite of every effort made by Inspector Ostrander and the Indian Agents concerned, we were only able to begin the construction of one of these schools.\n\nThe one school under construction is being built by Indian labour, under the supervision of the Indian Agent, and most of the lumber is coming from a mill being operated by the Indians and owned by this branch.\n\nSome tenders were received for the construction of these Saskatchewan schools. These and other tenders were submitted to the than Surveys and Engineering branch. Their reply read in part as follows:\n\n\"This service has no hesitation in stating that tenders for one room schools where the cost will approximate $16,000.00 are exorbitant and no contract should be awarded.\"\n\nIn view of the fact that these Saskatchewan tenders were all high and because we were having this identical building constructed elsewhere for prices ranging from $11,000 to $14,000, we would not further consider these bids.\n\nTherefore, when Inspector Ostrander was approached concerning his 1948-49 building program and asked whether he\nwould consider prefabrication as a means of having the badly needed day schools provided for the Indian children of his province, his answer was as follows:\n\n\"All construction is too costly at the present time and I believe that we, in the Province of Saskatchewan, are the most unfortunate in this respect. New labour laws and regulations in this province make it necessary for the contractor to add approximately 12\u00bd% to the usual labour costs. This 12\u00bd% is to cover holidays with pay, over-time, and lost time resulting from our strict labour laws. Of course this results in a construction job costing more in this province, and those in the Department who have the decisions to make in acceptance of a tender should not forget our difficulties in this regard.

This company has developed a prefabricated one-room day school with attached teacher's residence which should be quite satisfactory for our reserves on these reserves. It is based upon the standard one-room school drawings of Departmental Architects.\n\nThis company provided four prefabricated teachersages for Saskatchewan and Manitoba last year and we have found these buildings quite satisfactory. They have also done considerable work for Indian Health Services (nursing stations) and for Department of Transport (living quarters, etc.). They are now engaged on a contract for approximately one hundred housing units for the Department of National Defense.\n\nTherefore it is requested that you approve the submission to the Departmental Purchasing Agent of requisitions\ncovering the purchase of prefabricated one-room schools and attached teachers' residences from the North American Builders, Limited. These requisitions will cover seven schools in Saskatchewan and probably three for Manitoba. It is understood that the Departmental Purchasing Agent will soon be receiving an estimated cost on this school from the company concerned.\n\nDirector.\nRe: Plans and Specifications for Four Classroom Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to your notation dated January 20th appearing on Mr. Hey's memorandum to you of the 17th ultimo in connection with the above, you are advised that plans for this School were developed for a specific location and while the architectural plans can be used as a standard plan for construction at various locations, the heating, plumbing and electrical designs cannot be applied unless conditions are similar to those upon which the design was based.\n\nWe propose therefore, to forward only the architectural plans for this building now and if the Indian Affairs Branch will advise us of the areas, in which schools of the four classroom type are to be erected, we will examine the heating and electrical drawings we have on file, and amend them to suit the local conditions.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

In spite of every effort made by Inspector Ostrander and the Indian Agents concerned, we were only able to begin the construction of one of these schools.\n\nThe one school under construction is being built by Indian labour, under the supervision of the Indian Agent, and most of the lumber is coming from a mill being operated by the Indians and owned by this branch.\n\nSome tenders were received for the construction of these Saskatchewan schools. These and other tenders were submitted to the then Surveys and Engineering Branch. Their reply read in part as follows:\n\n\"This Service has no hesitation in stating that tenders for one room schools where the cost will approximate $16,000.00 are exorbitant and no contract should be awarded.\"\n\nIn view of the fact that these Saskatchewan tenders were all high and because we were having this identical building constructed elsewhere for prices ranging from $11,000 to $14,000, we would not further consider these bids.\n\nTherefore, when Inspector Ostrander was approached concerning his 1948-49 building program and asked whether he\nwould consider prefabrication as a means of having the sadly needed day schools provided for the Indian children of his province, his answer was as follows:\n\n\"All construction is too costly at the present time and I believe that we, in the Province of Saskatchewan, are the most unfortunate in this respect. New labour laws and regulations in this province make it necessary for the contractor to add approximately 12\u00bd% to the usual labour costs. This 12\u00bd% is to cover holidays with pay, over-time, and lost time resulting from our strict labour laws. Of course this results in a construction job costing more in this province, and those in the Department who have the decisions to make in acceptance of a tender should not forget our difficulties in this regard. If we are going to continue to erect buildings while being subjected to labour laws which are not in force in other provinces, the additional costs must be accepted as a fact. I hope we shall not be continually reminded that a certain type of building can be erected in other provinces at less than in Saskatchewan.\n\n\"I should emphasize that because of our Saskatchewan Labour Laws we should concentrate on prefabricated buildings, if possible, and we should have a full-time foreman to supervise their construction if a number are being ordered.\"\n\nThe officials of our Education Division have had several interviews with officials of the North American Builders, Limited, 712 Royal Bank building, Winnipeg, Manitoba. This company has developed a prefabricated one-room day school with attached teacher's residence which should be quite satisfactory for our requirements on these reserves. It is based upon the standard one-room school drawings of Departmental Architects.\n\nThis company provided four prefabricated teacherages for Saskatchewan and Manitoba last year and we have found these buildings quite satisfactory. They have also done considerable work for Indian Health Services (nursing stations) and for Department of Transport (living quarters, etc.). They are now engaged on a contract for approximately one hundred housing units for the Department of National Defence.\n\nTherefore it is requested that you approve the submission to the Departmental Purchasing Agent of requisitions\ncovering the purchase of prefabricated one-room schools and attached teachers' residences from the North American Builders, Limited. These requisitions will cover seven schools in Saskatchewan and probably three for Manitoba. It is understood that the Departmental Purchasing Agent will soon be receiving an estimated cost on this school from the company concerned.\n\nDirector\nFebruary 20, 1948.\n\n**TRANSFERS**\n\n| From                  | To                      | Amount   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------|\n| Grouard               | Sturgeon Lake           | $122.91  |\n| Fort William          | Squamish                | $335.83  |\n|                       | Fort George R.C.        | $72.50   |\n|                       | Ermineskin              | $50.00   |\n|                       |                         | $458.33  |\n| Maintenance of Equipment | Albany R.C.            | $654.91  |\n|                       | Youville                | $169.65  |\n|                       |                         | $824.56  |\n| Grouard               | Thunderchild            | $328.67  |\n| Whitefish Lake R.C.   | Aklavik C.E.            | $128.06  |\n| Vermilion R.C.        | Moose Fort C.E.         | $1,000.00|\n|                       | St. Mary's Mission R.C. | $388.65  |\nFebruary 21, 1948.\n\nPRECIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL\n\nApproval of the transfer of funds included in P.C. 65/4200 of October 16, 1947, for the purchase and maintenance of equipment, repairs and improvements at church-owned Residential Schools \u2014 $122.91 to Sturgeon Lake R.C.

Residential School to Sturgeon Lake R.C. Residential School.\n\n(2) An amount of $458.33 from Fort William R.C. Residential School. Of this amount $325.63 should be transferred to Squamish R.C.

Residential School.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, February 21, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI enclose memorandum to council in connection with transferring certain amounts in the appropriation for church-owned residential schools, as authorized in P.C. 65/4200, October 18, 1947. The following transfers are necessary,\n\n(1) $122.91 from Grouard Residential School to Sturgeon Lake Residential School. Both these schools are operated under R.C. auspices and it was found necessary to expend at the Sturgeon Lake School the amount mentioned, over and above the amount actually provided. There is an unexpended balance at the Grouard School.\n\n(2) $458.33 from the Fort William Residential School. Of this amount $335.83 is to be transferred to the Squamish Residential School; $72.50 to the Fort George Residential School; $50.00 to the Ermineskin Residential School. All of these schools are operated under R.C. auspices.\n\n(3) An amount of $824.56 from the item \"Maintenance of Equipment at any or all Church-Owned Residential School\". This amount will not be required during the present fiscal year for the purpose mentioned. This is to be distributed as follows: Albany R.C. Residential School - $654.91; Youville R.C. Residential School - $169.65. The comparatively large amount at Albany is due partly to the fact that equipment ordered in\nthe fiscal year 1946-47 was not delivered until after April 1st, 1947 and consequently had to be paid from the funds provided in the current year's appropriation.\n\n(4) $228.67 from Joussard Residential School to Thunderchild Residential School. Both these schools are conducted under R.C. auspices.\n\n(5) $388.65 from Vermillion Residential School to St. Mary's Mission Residential School. Both these schools are conducted under R.C. auspices. There is an unexpended balance in the case of the Vermillion School and the over-expenditure at St. Mary's Mission was due to the necessity for replacing the boiler tubes.\n\n(6) $1,128.06 from Whitefish Lake Residential School. Of this amount $128.06 is to be transferred to the Aklavik C.E. Residential School and $1,000.00 to the Moose Fort C.E. Residential School. All three of these schools are conducted under Church of England auspices, and the money provided at Whitefish Lake cannot be expended this year. The authorities of the M.B.C.C. are extremely anxious to make necessary repairs at the Moose Fort School and have urgently requested the transfer of $1,000.00 from Whitefish Lake to Moose Fort in order to provide funds for the purpose. The item of $128.06 for Aklavik covers the cost of some equipment purchased for this school.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nDirector.\nTRANSFER BETWEEN ALLOTMENTS\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE TO THE SECRETARY, TREASURY BOARD, FOR THE FOLLOWING TRANSFERS WITHIN:\n\nVOTE: 181 INDIAN EDUCATION\n\n| NAME OF PRIMARY                      | AUTHORIZED AMOUNT | PROPOSED DECREASE | PROPOSED INCREASE |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS & WORKS:   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Mississauga, Ontario.                | $12,000.00        | $3,000.00         |                   |\n| Big Eddy, Manitoba.                  | 5,000.00          | 1,000.00          |                   |\n| Little Grand Rapids (UC), Manitoba.  | 3,500.00          | 1,200.00          |                   |\n| Chitek Lake, Saskatchewan.           |                   | 4,200.00          |                   |\n| Montreal Lake, Saskatchewan.         |                   | 6,700.00          |                   |\n| Atikameg, Alberta.                   | 2,000.00          |                   |                   |\n| St. Cyprian's, Alberta.              | 5,000.00          |                   |                   |\n| Red Pheasant, Saskatchewan.          | 8,000.00          | 8,000.00          |                   |\n| Thunderchild, Saskatchewan.          | 8,000.00          | 8,000.00          |                   |\n| Cold Lake, Saskatchewan.             | 8,000.00          | 7,100.00          |                   |\n\n(See explanation on attached sheet.)\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAPPROVED\n\nAPPROVED\n\nBRANCH HEAD\n\nDEPUTY HEAD\n\nMINISTER\n\nNOTE: APPROVAL OF THE MINISTER IS REQUIRED ONLY WHERE A QUESTION OF POLICY IS INVOLVED.\n\nTREASURY COMMENTS\n\nACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNTING RECORDS, THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO THESE TRANSFERS BEING MADE AND THE APPLICATION IS THEREFORE SUBMITTED FOR THE APPROVAL OF TREASURY BOARD, AS REQUIRED UNDER SECTION 25 OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE AND AUDIT ACT.\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nFOR COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\n\nT.

School.\n\n(b) Funds are included in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49 to erect the Atikameg school but owing to the isolated position of this school it is necessary to ship the materials to the school by winter freight early in March 1948. It is estimated that $1,500.00 will be required for this freight.\n\n(c) The barn at the St. Cyprian's Residential School was destroyed by fire early last spring and in order that the school could function properly a new barn was necessary. The Minister approved charging this amount to our appropriation for new construction.\n\n(d) The funds originally provided for Chitek Lake have been used elsewhere due to the fact that we could not obtain a contractor to erect the building. Recently we have been able to secure a very large amount of material from an abandoned military camp and the amount mentioned, namely, $4,200, will cover the cost of this material and by purchasing same at the present time, it will reduce the cost of the building.\n\n(e) Due to the fact that we were unable to obtain contractors to proceed with the different schools that we proposed to erect in the province of Saskatchewan this year, we secured a pre-fabricated house as a teacher's residence at Montreal Lake. The building previously used was beyond repair and it was simply impossible for us to obtain a teacher to keep the school in operation unless suitable living quarters were provided.\n\nRECOMMENDED APPROVED APPROVED\n\nBRANCH HEAD DEPUTY HEAD MINISTER\n\nNOTE: APPROVAL OF THE MINISTER IS REQUIRED ONLY WHERE A QUESTION OF POLICY IS INVOLVED.\n\nTREASURY COMMENTS\n\nACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNTING RECORDS, THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO THESE TRANSFERS BEING MADE AND THE APPLICATION IS THEREFORE SUBMITTED FOR THE APPROVAL OF TREASURY BOARD, AS REQUIRED UNDER SECTION 26 OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE AND AUDIT ACT.\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER FOR COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\n\nB.

While we appreciate the difficulty of\nplacing extra windows in these classrooms, we feel\nthat the children farthest from the windows will have\ngreat trouble in reading unless electricity is provided.\n\nWe understand that extra windows can not be placed\nabove the blackboards opposite the windows because\nof the position of the folding doors between the two\nclassrooms. Our calculations were that the present\nfenestration is only twelve and a half percent. In\nmost provinces a fenestration of twenty percent is\nrequired. Therefore, we would recommend that higher\nwindows be provided and if at all possible extra windows.\n\nIf necessary we are prepared to dispense with the\ncupboards provided in the corners of the rooms so that\nextra windows can be placed there. We could have low\ncupboards substituted along the rear of the room under\nthe blackboards or low cupboards under the windows.\n\n(b) It is recommended that blackboard panels be provided\nfor the folding doors.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, February 17, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nTwo Classroom Day School with Teacher's Residence\n(for Northwest Territories Type)\n\nReference your I.A. 1856-9.\n\nThese plans have been studied at some length\nand we have the following comments to make:\n\n(a) There are only five windows on one side of each\nclassroom.

School during the fiscal year 1948-49 it is necessary to purchase the materials at the present time. The cost of these materials will be charged to our appropriation for 1947-48. However, it is necessary at the present time to provide an amount of $4,300.00 to freight the materials supplied from Slave Lake to the school. It would be impossible to arrange this during the summer; winter freighting is the only feasible way of moving the material.\n\nArmy buildings have been secured and while funds are being requested in the 1948-49 supplementaries for removing and renovating these buildings to make them suitable for class room purposes at the Blood and St. Paul's residential schools, it is necessary to pay the cost of the buildings immediately. Funds are available as stated above in schools which will not be erected during the current year in the province of Saskatchewan due to the fact that we were not able to obtain contractors to proceed with the necessary work.\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAPPROVED\n\nAPPROVED\n\nBRANCH HEAD\n\nDEPUTY HEAD\n\nMINISTER\n\nNOTE: APPROVAL OF THE MINISTER IS REQUIRED ONLY WHERE A QUESTION OF POLICY IS INVOLVED.\n\nTREASURY COMMENTS\n\nACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNTING RECORDS, THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO THESE TRANSFERS BEING MADE AND THE APPLICATION IS THEREFORE SUBMITTED FOR THE APPROVAL OF TREASURY BOARD, AS REQUIRED UNDER SECTION 26 OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE AND AUDIT ACT.\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nFOR COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\n\nT.

Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 12, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOBY\n\nSchool Construction Program, 1948-49\n\nI have read Mr. Mills' comments on our building program and I agree entirely with him as to the need for employing casual assistance, a number of men familiar with building construction, to whom could be assigned areas in which they would carry out inspections on any work for both this Division and the Agencies Division.\n\nI understand that Mr. Ostrander has such a man in mind for Saskatchewan and that there is also such a man available in Manitoba. Now that the estimates have been tabbed, I feel that we should proceed with the hiring of such assistance. Therefore I am in agreement with Miss Walton's recommendations in this regard and am prepared to cooperate entirely with her on our joint building program.\n\nEven where we are contemplating prefabricated schools, it is still necessary that a proper sound foundation be put under such a building. Therefore, it is most essential that we have a skilled foreman on hand even if only for a week while the cement is being poured. I feel that Mr. Mills' recommendation is a sound and feasible one and would ensure not only that our building program be carried out, but that it would be carried out in such a way that it would give us good buildings which would be little trouble to us in the years to come.\n\nBernard F.

It may be pointed out that the freight rate from Waterways to Coppermine is in the vicinity of $10.50 per 100 lbs. It is realized that you are interested in the providing of funds for Coppermine and that the Indian Affairs Branch is supplying the money for the other locations. It may be that you will have to revise your Estimates to provide funds for Coppermine and that Mr. Hey may have to readjust his Estimates for the funds necessary for the other places.\n\nIt will be noted that we are entirely without precise information, since there has not been sufficient time to obtain an up-to-date set of plans, and have the bill of materials taken off with the corresponding weights of the several items. Thus, on an assumption that the total weight of materials amounts to 70 tons at $10.50 per 100 lbs., the total cost would be $10,750.00 for freight. It is therefore considered that an item of $20,000 might be placed in the Estimates, and if a further amount of several thousand dollars is necessary, that this might be included in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.W.

Hoey,\nDirector of Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nOTTAWA - Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhile the matter of the establishment of schools in the Northwest Territories has been under discussion and the subject of various memoranda from time to time, I wish to point out that more is involved than actually the construction of the school building itself. The school building will be placed on a lot, on ground selected for this purpose, and if the activities, in a construction sense, ended here, only part value would be received for the facilities provided.\n\nThe problem of providing education is two-fold --\n\n(a) the actual teaching of subjects according to the school curriculum;\n\n(b) the creation of recreational facilities.\n\nUnder (a) - Actual education - this will be provided for by the construction of the school building,\n\nUnder (b) - Recreational facilities - some attention must be given to the provision of playground facilities in the vicinity of the school property and, in fact, this should be placed on the school grounds. Particularly with the type of native population (Indian and Eskimo) met with in the Northwest Territories, and who have had, up to now, little chance for education, it is felt their interest in education will be more quickly aroused by having them become interested in the playing of games and in the use of such facilities as playground and recreational activities will provide.\n\nYour attention is drawn to the fact that playground facilities can be added at relatively small cost while the school building is being built. There will be considerable lumber shipped to the site (more than is actually used in the actual school building itself) and this lumber will remain over after the completion of the building. This additional lumber is used during the construction period for the erection of stagings for plank-ways or passageways for movement of materials by hand-barrow or cart, and for allied construction purposes. On completion of the Project considerable of this lumber could be used in the creation of playground facilities, and the carpenter crew while at that point could obtain local unskilled labour and build these recreational facilities at relatively small expense. It would cost considerably more if the work were carried out at a later date.\n\nAttached hereto is a suggested list of equipment which might be considered as standard for each school building to be built in the Northwest Territories. Most of the above facilities can be provided, as above noted, from construction lumber remaining on hand. There will be a few items of Sports' equipment, such as Basketball end sets, Teeter-totter apparatus, some parts of the Giant Stride apparatus, and so forth which will be required. On the whole, however, the equipment to be brought in of special manufacture, is relatively small.\n\n(over)\nYour attention is drawn to the fact that an endeavor is being made to interest persons of all ages in the schoolground equipment. For this reason the provision of sand boxes, teeter-totters, swings and ice slides have been provided particularly for the use of the younger members. There is also intended to be installed sufficient apparatus for the playing of games such as Volleyball, Football, Softball, Baseball, and so forth, which will attract the interest of the teen-age children and even grown-ups.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Mr. W.J. Johnston, District Engineer of the Department of Public Works, Edmonton, and he assures me that much of the construction lumber could be re-used in the provision of playground facilities and that the carpenter force, when at the site, could have the installation made under the supervision of the carpenter-foreman, at a relatively small over-all cost.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that some additional expense over and above what is required for the bare establishment of a school building, will be required. This provision of recreational facilities should, therefore, be considered as part of the creation of the school project, and be included in the total cost.\n\nI would like your comments, please, that this provision of recreational facilities is approved, if this approval is necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.W. MacKinnon\nInspector of Schools for the Northwest Territories.\n\nEnclosure.\nMarch 17, 1948.\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIn connection with the proposed construction of school buildings in the Northwest Territories, your School Inspector, Mr. McKinnon, has called on our District Engineer in Edmonton and discussed the matter with him.\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of a report, dated March 15th, from Mr. Johnston making certain proposals concerning the carrying out of this work. Mr. Johnston suggests that three buildings, those at Smith, Rocher River and Fort Norman, might be carried out this season while buildings at Good Hope, Arctic-Red River and Coppermine should not be constructed until 1950, although materials might be obtained and shipped in this year.\n\nThis report is submitted for your information and consideration and instructions as to whether you think the proposal made by Mr. Johnston should be acted upon. As requested by Mr. Johnston, a copy of the report is also being forwarded to Mr. R. A. Hoey, Director of the Indian Affairs Branch of your Department.\n\nR.

Hoffer, F.R.A.I.C., Architect, who is in practice at 48 Elgin Street, Ottawa, Ontario, is a reputable architect employing a staff adequate to provide the services required, and that he is agreeable to perform such services, in consideration of the fee defined in the Schedule of Professional charges, established by the Ontario Association of Architects, under authority of the Architects Act, 1937 R.S.O., Chapter 223 as amended Sec. VI Chapter 47 (1938).\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted to enter into an agreement with the said W.E. Hoffer, F.R.A.I.C., 48 Elgin Street, Ottawa, Ontario, to obtain such architectural services, either wholly or in part, as may be considered necessary or advisable, in connection with such building structures as are provided for in the Departmental estimates for the 1948-49 fiscal year; and to pay for the services, from funds provided under the appropriate Departmental votes, for the 1948-49 fiscal year, the recognized and approved fees and expenses, to which, under the Schedule of Professional charges of the Ontario Association of Architects, the said W.E.

With this layout all you would have to do, would be to get a tinsmith to connect the new furnace casing with your warm and cold air pipes that are now installed.\n\nIt might be that you would have to add another warm air or possibly another extra cold air pipe, in order to give sufficient circulation of air through the new furnace.\n\nNow in the next case, you may be building a new house and if you wish to have a pipe furnace, then we can supply you with a furnace and casing and it would be necessary then for you to get a tinsmith to install this furnace for you, putting in the registers and the necessary warm and cold air pipes.\n\nNow in the next case, you might be able to use a pipeless furnace instead of a pipe furnace. This depends upon the situation of the principal rooms of your house.\n\nIf you will send us a plan of your house, marking the rooms and the size of each room, then we can tell you whether you can use a pipeless furnace. A pipeless furnace can be installed by any handy man for the reason that we give you directions how to do it.\n\nOne good point about a pipeless furnace is the fact that with it you have very, very little heat in the basement or cellar of your home and this style of furnace frequently keeps your cellar sufficiently cool so as not to make it too warm for the vegetables stored in the basement.\nWith a pipeless furnace, you fill your home with warm air and in this respect it is necessary for you to have a pipeless furnace of the proper size, in order that you would have no cold air drafts on the floor.\n\nWith a pipeless furnace, practically all the heat goes into your home.\n\nWe might state that a pipeless furnace can be made particularly suitable for any size house up to eight or nine rooms.\n\nA pipeless furnace can be used in a larger house, if of square construction with a large centre hall in it.\n\nPipeless furnaces have been abused by people installing a furnace that is entirely too small. We might state that a pipeless furnace is the most economical style of furnace you can possibly use.\n\nAny room you do not wish to heat, all you have to do is close the door.\n\nWe have no hesitation in recommending a pipeless furnace if we know how the rooms in your house are situated.\n\nUnder these conditions, we would advise you therefore to give us the information regarding your requirements. Then we would be pleased to make our recommendations.\n\nThanking you, we remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTHE HALL FOUNDRY CO., LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nPOOR COPY\nFireco Bridgewall Flueless Furnace\n\nDesigned and Built\nto Burn\nAny Kind of\nCanadian Soft Coal\n\nNo horizontal flues to fill with ashes and soot.\nWhen burning hard coal and coke it requires clean-out only once in ten years.\nWhen using wood or soft coal you clean it out only once in three years.\nThe casing is oval in form, and spacious, guaranteeing a rush circulation of air.\nIt has two varieties of Patented Bridgewall Construction.\nThere are three vertical combustion chambers of patented design.\nCombustion is complete in this furnace, insuring a saving of more than half the fuel.\nYou can hold fire for fifteen hours with wood and produce heat all the time.\nWe guarantee you can clean out this furnace in five minutes without having to employ any outside help.\nBuilt and designed to burn any kind of Canadian soft coal with perfect satisfaction.\nAll horizontal friction flues are eliminated.\nThis furnace cannot choke up.\nThe simplest construction ever put on the Canadian market.\nSold only on an honest money-back guarantee.\nAny other fuel can be burned equally as well as soft coal.\nThe \"Acme\" of cleanliness when burning soft coal.\nNo dirt, no dust, no smudge.\nWill burn any kind of cheap fuel.\nWorks equally as well with any Oil Burner.\n\nMade in six sizes with capacity up to an eighteen-room house\n\nWRITE FOR FULL PARTICULARS\n\nThe HALL FOUNDRY CO., Limited\nHESPELER, ONTARIO\nOTHER PATENTS APPLIED FOR\nRULES FOR BURNING SOFT COAL in a FIRECO BRIDGEWALL FLUELESS FURNACE\n\n1. Never cover fire completely with fresh fuel.\n2. When coal hardens in the fire pot, break it up with the furnace poker.\n3. Never put fresh coal on a dull fire.\n4. All fresh coal must be put on the FRONT HALF of the fire pot.\n5. Give your furnace plenty of draft for 10 or 15 minutes after putting on fresh coal.\n6. Poke the live coals to the back of the fire pot before putting on fresh coal.\n7. Always allow the fire to burn up before putting on fresh fuel.\nSTRESSED SKIN PLYWOOD BUILDINGS ON FLOATING FOUNDATIONS IN PERMAFROST AREAS.\n\nThe aim of every designer of Arctic buildings is to provide adequate and comfortable permanent shelter within as low a cost range as possible.\n\nAs transportation is one of the main cost factors in Arctic building, a lightweight, stressed skin plywood building of a permanent nature has been developed by the writer which can be assembled by a small crew in a few days and incorporates the latest scientific design features.\n\nMarine plywood panels are glued and nailed to a stud frame and contain within a sandwich of triple insulation against radiation, conduction and convection. The panels are held together by patented connectors. All joints are covered with felt lined joint strips which make the building quite air tight. The floors are heavily insulated and according to information received from one station before Christmas, operators have been walking barefoot on the floor at an outside temperature of -42\u00b0 below and a 50 mph storm.\n\nThe inside of the buildings is painted with bright fire resistant paint, chosen by psychologists to counteract the feeling of drab monotony on lonely Arctic Stations.\n\nWhen the building is erected, the panels form a rigid frame. It has been found that in areas of high permafrost level such a rigid frame can advantageously be floated on a gravel bed. As practically no heat escapes through the floor, the permafrost level stays undisturbed and the buildings do not move.\n\nAs every location in the Arctic presents a different problem a careful survey of soil characteristics and permafrost levels should be undertaken before erecting any permanent structure. Special consideration must be given to the surface drainage on top of the permafrost. In many areas a certain amount of excavation with subsequent gravel fill will be necessary to insure a wide enough gravel bed on which to float the building. The lower the permafrost level, the higher the gravel bed has to be.\n\nGEORGE JACOBSEN.\nFEATURES OF OUR ARCTIC BUILDINGS.\n\n1. PERMANENCE, GOOD DESIGN, LOW UPKEEP.\n   Aluminum painted, marine plywood is highly resistant to elements as smooth surface does not offer any points of attack to wind, water, sun or frost.\n\n2. LIGHTWEIGHT, COMPACTNESS, LOW TRANSPORTATION COSTS.\n   With limited and very costly Arctic transportation facilities a great part of Arctic construction costs are made up by transportation costs. Lightweight reduces transportation costs. Compactness of parts prevents them from being lost on site and during transportation.\n\n3. EASY ERECTION BY SMALL CREW.\n   Buildings can be erected by crew of 4 - 6 men within a few days.\n\n4. TRIPLE INSULATION.\n   Against convection, conduction and radiation, therefore low heating costs, and saving in fuel transportation.\n\n5. AIR INTAKE CONTROL.\n\n6. SCIENTIFIC COLOUR SELECTION.\n   Inside painted with fire resistant paint. Bright colours chosen by psychologists counteract drab monotony of lonely Arctic outposts.\n\n7.

E. Residential School. We purchased materials for this block last year but failed to interest a contractor. I understand that the Lands and Development Services Branch are preparing plans and that the Bond Construction Company is prepared to undertake the project.\n\nA part of the Lac la Ronge funds have been used to do necessary alterations on the temporary Prince Albert army camp.\n\nI understand there is also a possibility that some of the Tealin funds might be considered for transferring to the purchase of materials for the proposed residential school at Hay Lakes.\n\nI would also recommend that we be permitted to request transfers from these available funds for the heating and plumbing work required to complete the Blood and St. Paul's classroom blocks. These two blocks are now set up on basements and an engineer is working on the plans and specifications for the heating units required.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nOttawa, November 2, 1948.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Treasury Board, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the 17th March 1948.\n\nMINES AND RESOURCES\n\nThe Board recommend that Order in Council of October 18, 1947, P.C. 65/4200, be amended by the following transfers of funds:\n\n1. An amount of $122.91 from Grouard R.C. Residential School to Sturgeon Lake R.C. Residential School.\n\n2. An amount of $458.33 from Fort William R.C. Residential School. Of this amount $335.83 should be transferred to Squanish R.C. Residential School; $72.50 to Fort George R.C. Residential School and $50.00 to Ermineskin R.C. Residential School.\n\n3. An amount of $824.66 from Maintenance of Equipment. This amount is to be distributed as follows: Albany R.C. Residential School - $654.91; Youville R.C. Residential School - $169.65.\n\n4. An amount of $328.67 from Joussard R.C. Residential School to Thunderchild R.C. Residential School.\n\n5. An amount of $388.65 from Vermilion R.C. Residential School to St. Mary's Mission R.C. Residential School.\n\n6. An amount of $1,128.06 from Whitefish Lake C.E. Residential School. Of this amount, $128.06 should be transferred to Aklavit C.E. Residential School and $1,000.00 to Moose Fort C.E. Residential School.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable,\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources.\nMarch 19, 1948\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe notice by today's press reports that estimates are provided for the erection of a number of new Indian Day Schools and Residential Schools. We would appreciate very much the opportunity of submitting any prices for such equipment as pupil's desks, teacher's desks and blackboards that may be required. We carry large stock of these on hand at Brandon and on which we can give real prompt deliveries.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCHRISTIE SCHOOL SUPPLY LIMITED\n\nManaging Director\nOttawa, March 20, 1948.\n\nMr. Rose,\n\nI have been awaiting word from you regarding work to be executed with funds in your 1948-49 estimates, and for which you will wish to have the cooperation of the Engineering and Construction Division of this Branch.\n\nA news release of March 17th gives some information about your plans but we have had no definite word regarding any specific projects other than those undertaken in the fiscal year just ending, and the following:\n\n1. New Indian Residential School, Teslin, Y.T.\n2. New Indian Residential School, Lac la Ronge, Sask.\n3. New Indian Residential School, Norway House, Man.\n4. New Indian Residential School, Seven Islands, Que.\n5. New two-room day school with teachers' quarters, Fort Norman, N.W.T.\n6. New two-room day school with teachers' quarters, Roche River, N.W.T.\n7. New two-room day school with teachers' quarters, Fort Franklin, N.W.T.\n8. New two-room day school with teachers' quarters, Fort Good Hope, N.W.T.\n9. New two-room day school with teachers' quarters, Arctic Red River, N.W.T.\nIn regard to the two-room schools for the Northwest Territories we have received a copy of a letter sent to you by Inspector McKinnon who has been discussing the school building programme with District Engineer Johnston of the Department of Public Works at Edmonton. Apparently, Mr. Johnston is afraid that he cannot get all the material in to complete all of these schools this year and he favours reducing the number of schools to be built in 1948 and shipping in of supplies for the balance so that the construction can be carried out in the ensuing year. We would like to discuss this with Col. Neary on Tuesday when it is expected he will be returning to the office.\n\nIn addition to the above we understand that a series of inspections will be required for existing Indian Residential Schools, and that our Architectural personnel has been contacted directly for heating and electrical designs for four-room Indian Day Schools your Branch will be responsible for at Cowessess, Saskatchewan, Kamloops, B.C. and Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nIf you will furnish me with all further information you can assemble in connection with projects where you are expecting co-operation from this Branch during the coming fiscal year, we will be in a position to consider what we can do to help you.\n\nR. M. Gibson,\nDirector.\nOttawa, March 30, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nConstruction Program - 1948-49\n\nI have for answer your memorandum of March 20 with regard to our 1948-49 Estimates. This is to advise you that the following sums remain in our Estimates for projects which we wish you to undertake:\n\nA. Residential Schools\n\n1. Indian Residential School, Teslin, Y.T. $200,000.00\n2. Indian Residential School, Lac la Ronge, Sask. 100,000.00\n3. \" \" Norway House, Manitoba 100,000.00\n4. \" \" Seven Islands, P.Q. 50,000.00\n\nB. Classroom Blocks - Residential Schools\n\nYou have already received a memorandum concerning the construction of Indian day schools in the Northwest Territories, outlining the changes which we consider necessary. To review the situation,\n\n1. Arctic Red River Purchase of materials only $20,000.00\n2. Fort Franklin Purchase of materials only 20,000.00\n3. Fort Good Hope Purchase of materials only 20,000.00\n4. Rocher River Construction of School 40,000.00\n5. Fort Norman Construction of School 40,000.00\n\nIt is also our intention to seek your advice with regard to arrangement of heating and electrical designs for classroom blocks to be constructed at Cowessess, Sask., Kamloops, B.C., and Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nIn order not to confuse our building program with our repair program, we will send you, under separate cover, a memorandum with regard to major repairs which will require supervision by your Branch at our Indian residential schools.\n\nDIRECTOR.\nOttawa, April 3, 1948.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nCompletion of 1947 Contracts.\n\nRef. your V60, V175, V56 of January 8, 1948.\n\nIt is understood that work still has to be completed on the following projects:\n\n(a) Revisions and additions to hot water heating system at Elkhorn Residential School. Original contract $5,260.47.\n\n(b) Revisions to domestic water services and boiler equipment at Brandon Residential School. Original contract $12,793.96.\n\n(c) Major repairs to the heating system at Gordon's Residential School. Original contract cost plus 15% with an estimate of $33,500, plus 15%.\n\n(d) Repairs and replacements to domestic hot and cold water system now installed at Shubenacadie Residential School. Original contract $7,250.\n\n(e) Revisions to plumbing and domestic hot water supply system Port Alberni Residential School. Original contract $2,120.\nAs it was originally anticipated that contractors would be able to complete their contracts by March 31, 1948, amounts for these projects were not included in our 1948 Main Estimates. It will, therefore, be necessary to include these items in our 1948 Supplementary Estimates. Could we please be advised as to the sums which will be required in each instance.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nBFN/HN.\nOttawa, April 3, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nConstruction Program 1948-49.\n\nI have for answer your memorandum of March 20 with regard to our 1948-49 Estimates.

Indian Residential School, Seven Islands, P.Q., $50,000.00\n\nB. Classroom Blocks - Residential Schools:\n\nIt would now seem evident that we will be able only to construct one of the projected four classroom blocks. The one selected is at the biggest school, namely, Kamloops, British Columbia. This classroom block will be the subject of further correspondence.\n\nC. Day Schools - Provinces:\n\nYou are, of course, aware of our requirements at the Caughnawaga Day School (12 rooms).\n\nThe only other day school in the provinces which we will likely request your branch to build is the school at Hazelton, British Columbia. This will be the subject of further correspondence as the exact size of the school is yet to be determined.\nD. Day Schools - Northwest Territories:\n\nYou have already received a memorandum concerning the construction of Indian day schools in the Northwest Territories, outlining the changes which we consider necessary. To review the situation,\n\n1. Arctic Red River Purchase of materials only $20,000.00\n2. Fort Franklin Purchase of materials only $20,000.00\n3. Fort Good Hope Purchase of materials only $20,000.00\n4. Roche River Construction of School $40,000.00\n5. Fort Norman Construction of School $40,000.00\n\nIn order not to confuse our building program with our repair program, we will send you, under separate cover, a memorandum with regard to major repairs which will require supervision by your Branch at our Indian residential schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, April 5, 1948.\n\nMemo for FILE:\n\n12 Blueprints, one-room School with residence\n12 Specifications,\n3 Bills of Material\n\nmailed to Mr. G.

Money will have to be provided for this project from Supplementary Estimates.

A separate letter will follow concerning this project.\n\nIn the majority of these cases, your Engineers have visited these schools and it is on the basis of their reports that these items have been included in our Estimates.\n\nIn the majority of the other cases not included above, the repairs are minor ones that can be carried out under the supervision of our field officials or with the co-operation of the denominations concerned in the operation of the schools. If any of these projects require supervision we will advise you immediately but it is felt that the above projects constitute by far the major part of our requirements for 1948.\n\nDirector.\n\nBFM/HM.\nARMY MESSAGE\n\nUNCLASSIFIED (OUTGOING) FILE\n\nPLACE DATE\n\nOttawa April 10 1948\n\nM J WATER\nIndian Agency Office\n536 Dominion Public Building\nWINNIPEG Manitoba\n\nA J DOUGT WILL ARRIVE WINNIPEG TUESDAY MORNING\nDISCUSS SCHOOL BUILDING PROGRAM 1948-49 -stop- OUR INTENTION\nTHAT HE VISIT RESERVES AND SCHOOLS MANITOBA -stop- HE WILL\nADVISE DETAILS ON ARRIVAL\n\nCONFIRMATION\n\nBernard F Henry\n\nPhoned to: .............\nPhoned by: ..................\nTime: .............\n\nORIGINATOR'S INSTRUCTIONS\n\nSIGNATURE DEGREE OF PRIORITY TIME OF ORIGIN\n\nSIGNED\n\nCOPY 4\nOttawa, April 10, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMISS WALTON\n\nAs requested yesterday, please find below the information concerning the buildings of this Division which are located in the Macleod Constituency:\n\n1.

Funds for the Mistassini school are provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nThe Caradoc School is being built by day labour under the direction of the Indian agent. It is a four-room school and owing to the shortage of labour the erection of this school which started in the fiscal year 1946-47 is being continued during the fiscal year 1947-48 and the amount requested is required to cover the expenditure for materials and day labour during the fiscal year 1947-48. The building will not be completed until the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nIn all the other instances the proposed increases that are requested are necessary to complete the buildings which have been under construction during the fiscal year 1947-48.\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAPPROVED\n\nAPPROVED\n\nBRANCH HEAD\n\nDEPUTY HEAD\n\nMINISTER\n\nNOTE: APPROVAL OF THE MINISTER IS REQUIRED ONLY WHERE A QUESTION OF POLICY IS INVOLVED.\n\nTREASURY COMMENTS\n\nACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNTING RECORDS, THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO THESE TRANSFERS BEING MADE AND THE APPLICATION IS THEREFORE SUBMITTED FOR THE APPROVAL OF TREASURY BOARD, AS REQUIRED UNDER SECTION 25 OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE AND AUDIT ACT.\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nFOR COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\n\nT.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDivision\n\nLands and Development Services Branch\n\nApril 17, 1948.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Indian Affairs - Construction Programme.\n\nYour marginal notation dated the 6th instant on Mr. Hoey's memorandum to you of April 3rd last, requests comment on Items A, B, and C, under which headings Mr. Hoey has listed the schools on which it is desired to undertake construction operations during the 1948-49 fiscal year.\n\nIn this connection comment is furnished as follows:\n\nA. Residential Schools\n\n1. Indian Residential School - Teslin, Y.T. - A set of preliminary sketch plans has been furnished to our Chief Architect by Mr. Noffke, which Mr. Buck has examined, discussed, and has left with Col. Neary of the Indian Affairs Branch. The sketches have not yet been examined by Mr. Hoey. It is our Architect's opinion, that in his initial sketches, Mr. Noffke has over-reached the demands of the project. Certain features he has planned must be eliminated and several accommodational areas reduced in size. When Mr. Hoey has had the opportunity of reviewing the sketches with his officers, he will advise you of his opinions. These processes will not be permitted to interfere with the Architect's progress.\n\nWe feel that the arrangements reached between this Branch and the Works and Accommodation Directorate of National Defence, their Major Stevens and the assignment of Mr. Noffke to the architectural phases of the project completes the organization of this school.\n\n2. Indian Residential School - Leo la Ronge, Sask. - As well as being reduced from a five building group to a four-classroom building only, we are advised by Col. Neary that this proposed school has become a matter of considerable discussion between the Province of Saskatchewan, the religious order, who will operate the school, and the Indian Affairs Branch, both as regards the area in which the school will be built and the arrangements for operation. Col. Neary has advanced the opinion that these matters will likely result in abandoning the building operations this fiscal year.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nA. Residential Schools (Cont'd)\n\n3. Indian Residential School - Norway House, Man. -\nThis project has been reduced for the present to providing a four-classroom building adapted to conditions at the school instead of the original five building plan visualized by the Indian Affairs Branch. Some study will be required and additions made to our typical drawings so that extensions to services can be properly made when the ultimate development is undertaken. The Indian Affairs Branch have requested that tenders be invited by advertisement in which we concur. It is suggested that supervision might be requested from the Works and Accommodation Directorate of National Defence. Major Stevens will advise Mr. Buck in this connection.\n\n4. Indian Residential School - Seven Islands, P.Q. -\nThis project has also been reduced for the time being to a four-classroom school for future incorporation into a five building plan.\n\nWe are advised by Col. Neary that the exact site in the Indian area has not been determined, but that this information will be furnished to us as soon as available. It is expected that the same plan used for Norway House can be utilized in this instance.\n\nDuring a discussion with Mr. Miller of the Donald Inspection Company, it was learned that his firm is now supervising construction of a large dam at Seven Islands. It is suggested that arrangements might be made to have that firm supervise construction of our building when a contract is awarded.\n\nB. Classroom Blocks - Residential Schools\n\nThis item, which has been receiving action by our Architectural staff, was the adoption of standard four-classroom school plans for use at three Residential Schools as additional classroom accommodation. These Residential Schools were; Kamloops, B.C., Alert Bay, B.C., and Cowessess, Sask. Engineering drawings showing heating equipment and piping demanded by temperature conditions in their areas, as well as electrical layouts were completed for the three projects before we were informed that only Kamloops will be erected this year.\n\nSince Mr. Hoey indicates that this project is to be the subject of further correspondence, we are reserving comment.\n\nC. Day Schools - Provinces\n\nMr. Hoey in his memorandum furnishes remarks concerning the twelve-room school at Caughnawaga, Quebec, and at Hazelton, B.C.\n\nThe former calls for no comment and Indian Affairs are not yet certain of their requirements for the latter.\nWith reference to Residential Schools where Indian Affairs may be willing to provide funds for over-all inspections by an inspection company, Col. Neary has kindly undertaken to compile a list of such schools as soon as possible for the use of this Division.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, April 20, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you please forward instructions and bulletins on hygosan septic toilets and combinations to the following address:\n\nMr. C. Buck, MRAIC,\nChief Architect,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nNorlite Building,\nOttawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. D.E. Cameron,\nRural Sewage Disposal,\nEquipment Limited,\nVernon, Ontario.\n\nBFN/HK.\nOttawa, April 21, 1948.\n\nMr. Boey\n\nRe - Indian Affairs Construction Program\n\nPlease refer to your memorandum of the 3rd instant and the attached memorandum dated the 17th instant from the Chief Engineer of the Engineering and Construction Service.\n\nIt should be possible to complete the design and specifications for the school at Teslin within a reasonable time so that the contract can be let and the work done this year under the supervision of the Department of National Defence. A lot depends on how fast Mr. Noffke is able to complete the information that we need to call for tenders. In the meantime, we are getting from the National Defence Department information about the site and the water supply.\n\nAs we understand it, nothing is to be done about the Lac La Ronge school this year. If you want a design made please let me know as soon as you can so that we can ask Mr. Noffke to undertake it.\n\nIt is our intention to ask Mr. Noffke to make ready the plans and specifications for whatever is to be built at Norway House. There is no chance whatever of the Army undertaking the supervision or construction in this case but we will seek authority to have the Donald Inspection Company supervise if we can get the plans and specifications ready and let the contract.\n\nSimilarly, we will seek authority to have the Donald Inspection Company supervise construction of any building that is erected at Seven Islands. Here again, Mr. Noffke's plans will be used and we will have to call for tenders for the work.\n\nWe are awaiting further word from you about the class room blocks at certain residential schools.\nThe contract has been awarded for the construction of the Caughnawaga school and this is being supervised by Mr. Maurice Payette.\n\nAs soon as you have made up your mind about the school at Hazelton, will you please advise me.\n\nI should be given notification respecting any other projects which you are considering, for it takes some time to get things done under present conditions.\n\nH.A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nOttawa, April 21, 1948.\n\nRe: Proposed Two Room School with Teachers' Accommodation.\n\nIn accordance with the verbal agreement between yourself and our Chief Architect, we are forwarding to you herewith, two sets of blueprints of our working drawings index no. 860, sheet no's 1/2 and 2/2.\n\nT.S.

Elkhorn Residential School, Establishment 576, $5,500\n   The firm contract is $5,260.47, and the balance consists of engineering expenses. There were no expenditures in 1947-48 on the above project.\n\n2. Shubenacadie, Establishment 265, Plumbing and Heating Repairs $8,000\n   The firm price contract is $7,250, and the additional amount consists of engineering expenses plus an allowance for possible increase in the price of materials. There were no expenditures on this project during 1947-48.\n\n3. Albemarle School, Establishment 877, Plumbing and Heating Repairs $3,850\n   $1,700 was spent in the 1947-48 season, and it is estimated that it will take another $3,850 to complete the job.\n\n4. Gordon's Residential School, Establishment 654, Plumbing and Heating Repairs $25,000\n   There was an expenditure of $15,250 during 1947-48 season, and it is estimated that another $25,000 will be required to finish the project. This amount is exclusive of water supply system.\n\n5. Brandon Residential School, Establishment 576, Revisions to water service and boiler equipment $13,500\n   The above amount consists of firm price contract $12,795, plus engineering expenses and an allowance for possible increase in the price of materials. Approximately $1,000 was spent on the above project in 1947-48 season, mostly engineering expenses and material purchased outside of the firm price contract amounting to $12,795.\n\nR.A.

CAMERON\nSALES ENGINEER\nVERNON, ONT.\n\nRURAL SEWAGE DISPOSAL EQUIPMENT, LIMITED\nTORONTO - HAMILTON\nTHE HYGEOSAN SEPTIC TOILET GIVES YOU CONVENIENCE OF A CITY HOME!\n\nIf you are the owner of a summer cottage, camp, or country home, there is no need to continue enduring the discomfort and embarrassment of the outdoor privy. Throughout Canada, hundreds of Septic Toilet Combinations have been installed in summer homes, farm homes, service stations, tourists camps and other buildings located any distance from regular plumbing facilities.\n\nCLEAN, SANITARY\u2014The illustration is from an actual photograph of a Hygeosan Septic Toilet Combination. The bowl is of snow-white, vitreous, double-fired, stainless china, with double-dowelled, lift-up seat and cover nickel trimmed. Easily kept clean and attractive.\n\nNOTHING TO GET OUT OF ORDER\u2014There are no moving parts in the Hygeosan Septic Toilet Combination. No chemicals are required\u2014no agitation\u2014no service\u2014no maintenance! Your first cost is your only cost. The system is practically \"Self-operating\" and relies solely on natural means for disposal.\n\nREQUIRES NO ATTENTION\u2014All that is necessary, to keep the system in efficient working order is, one pailful of water daily, poured into the bowl. Nature and nature alone does the rest, providing unfailing sewage disposal for years and years after installation.\n\nLOW COST\u2014Taking into consideration the equipment supplied, and the wonderful convenience and comfort provided\u2014the price is surprisingly moderate. And, too, the original cost is your only cost.\n\nRURAL SEWAGE DISPOSAL EQUIPMENT LIMITED\n\n67 YORK STREET\nHAMILTON, ONTARIO\n(Branch Office)\n\n2067 DUNDAS ST. W.\nTORONTO, ONTARIO\n(Head Office)\nKeep this fact constantly in mind, when considering the \"Hygeosan\" Septic Toilet Combination\u2014no chemicals, no mechanical or other than natural means are required to assist in the disposal of sewage wastes. Nature has provided everything, and for the benefit of those who do not understand how this can be, the following simple questions and answers will, we feel sure, clarify the situation in sufficient detail to convince the most skeptical.\n\n1. (Q) What is a Septic Tank?\n\n(A) A tank that is a water-tight container, so designed and arranged, and of correct capacity, to provide conditions under which sewage may decompose, or be broken down, through biological activity without putrefaction. Into this tank sewage is discharged, and because the tank is water-tight, and so arranged, the solid sewage is held in suspension, allowing the free activity of anaerobic bacteria and the circulation of gases.\n\n2. (Q) What Takes Place in a Septic Tank?\n\n(A) When the tank is properly designed and fabricated, the solid sewage sinks to the bottom, forming what is known as the sludge bed; here the sewage is immediately attacked by millions of bacteria, known as anaerobic bacteria, because they only live where there is no oxygen or light. These bacteria, by their rapid life functions (being born, living, and dying by the millions to the square inch per hour) break the solid sewage into its component parts of liquid and gases. The lighter sewage, or floaters, rise to the top, forming what is known as the scum; this scum seals the tank against the ravages of oxygen and light, and also provides an ideal culture ground for the bacteria.\n\n3. (Q) Does a Septic Tank Finally Dispose of Sewage?\n\n(A) No! The function of a septic tank is to break down the sewage into a condition fit to mingle with the soil, or be absorbed into the atmosphere by evaporation. For this reason, an area of final disposal must be provided. This can usually be accomplished, by tile drains running to a leaching pool, or tile drains without a leaching pool as illustrated. If these methods do not appear practicable for you, write us outlining your problem, and we may be able to offer you further suggestions to suit your particular requirement.\n\n4. (Q) Will a Septic Tank Freeze?\n\n(A) No! If properly designed and installed, and of correct capacity, when in use the Septic Tank should maintain a steady temperature of 70\u00b0 F. If not in use, that is to say, if sewage is not being regularly discharged into the septic tank, the tank may freeze.\n\n5. (Q) Will Freezing Destroy the Septic Tank?\n\n(A) If manufactured from iron or steel welded, no! Iron or steel is impervious to moisture, therefore the material of which the tank is constructed does not absorb water and only the contents of the tank will freeze. Because of the solids in the tank the outer shell will not crack or fracture and the tank is not destroyed.\n\nMADE IN MULTIPLES\nThe manufacturers of The Hygeosan Septic Toilet Combination have had fourteen years experience in producing and installing rural sanitation of all kinds. The Hygeosan Septic Toilet Combination is the result of this experience, and has been tried and proven over ten years before being offered for general use to the public. The System is fully approved by competent health authorities everywhere.\n\nHere is what The Hygeosan Septic Toilet Combination consists of\u2014\n\n1. Septic Tank of at least one hundred and fifty gallons working capacity, manufactured throughout of copper bearing steel, all welded. Fitted with the necessary baffles, together with cast-iron inspection opening cover and frame. The whole treaded inside and battened with rust-proof wood exhibiting solution, of sufficient depth, length and breadth to provide ideal functioning properties for anaerobic biological activity.\n\n2. One vitreous white, double-fired, stainless china bowl, complete with double-dowelled seat and cover, with nickel-plated trimmings.\n\n3. One \"Armeo\" ingot iron, galvanized (rust resisting) funnel or drop tube to connect tank with bowl.\n\n4. Sufficient vent pipe to run through to the highest point of roof, together with roof flashing and anti-down draft ventilator.\n\n5. Oakum, putty, plastic cement, toilet paper holder, roll toilet paper, bowl brush, floor screws, etc.\n\nAll of the above packed in cartons or crates for shipment with the exception of the tank.\n\nFarm Drain Tiles can be purchased more economically locally, due to the difficulty and breakages in shipping, and are not included in our prices. Our installation men are highly-paid specialists, and for this reason all digging should be arranged locally.\n\nWrite us or wire us collect for an estimate for your particular requirement, there is absolutely no obligation to buy attached to this offer.\n\nFor hygienic, sanitary, safe, simple and carefree sewage disposal equipment, investigate the Canadian Sanitation Company way.\n\nDesigned by, and produced exclusively for\n\nRURAL SEWAGE DISPOSAL EQUIPMENT LIMITED\n(Successors to CANADIAN SANITATION COMPANY LIMITED)\n67 YORK STREET\nHAMILTON, ONTARIO\n(Branch Office)\n\n2067 DUNDAS ST.

It is a complete disposal system.\n\nAlways bear in mind that the system is for the disposal of wastes from the human body\u2014garbage, tea leaves and slops from the kitchen should not be thrown in the tank.\n\nBath or hand lavatory water can be run into the tank, but it is usually desirable to by-pass the tank with these liquids and run them directly into the tile bed. There is no good reason for polluting these waters with sewage. When bath or hand basin water is to be disposed of, the tile or underground disposal area should be enlarged sufficiently to take care of the additional fluids.\n\nThis combination operates on identically the same principal as the pressure of the sewage disposal system.\n\nFollow the simple rules contained in this folder, and your Septic Toilet Combination will render you years of carefree service.\n\nOn our sales folder we illustrated method of setting tank partly under building. The illustration here shows method of setting tank in a basement entirely under building, with 3\" iron pipe running through wall. Be sure to caulk drop tube well on this type. Also cement around manhole to prevent escape of gases into the basement.\n\nD. E. CAMERON\nSALES ENGINEER\nVERNON, ONT.\n\nPHONES:\nMETCALFE RURAL 32832\nOTTAWA 5-9671\nSetting Tank Etc.\n\n1. First choose a location, on the ground floor. (Septic Toilet can be installed on the second floor, but it is generally difficult to get an unobstructed direct course to the tank from the second floor.)\n\nWhen you have located the place that you want the bowl to stand, be sure that you have a direct, unobstructed connection to the tank, thirteen inches in diameter.\n\nDig your hole for the tank if one is required, and place the tank directly below the spot you have chosen for the bowl location. Allow if possible not less than twenty inches from the bottom of the bowl to the top of the tank. However, a drop tube thirty inches long is shipped with each outfit and this will allow up to twenty-eight inches from the top of the tank to the bottom of the bowl. If a greater distance is desired, a drop tube extension will be required. See figure No. 1.\n\n2. Now take the paper template of the bowl bottom, mark out and cut hole in floor, being sure that bowl is facing in direction you desire. The bowl is longer from front to back than it is wide. See Fig. No. 2.\n\n3. Now slip drop tube through floor, and into tank sleeve welded into top of tank. Then take the piece of oakum provided, and caulk around the drop tube outside, but inside tank sleeve, using a screw driver or some such instrument and pack firmly. Now take a putty knife or something flat of that nature, and liberally cover the oakum, so as to make this a gas tight joint. This is important so that no gases can come up outside the drop tube below the bowl. See Fig. No. 1 and 3.\n\nMADE IN MULTIPLES FOR LARGER INST.\n4. Now the tank and drop tube are in place. Take some of the putty supplied in tin and roll between the hands into a sausage-like shape. Either lay it around the edge of the drop tube on the floor side of the opening, or turn the bowl upside down and press firmly into the orifice provided on the flange. Then place the bowl in position, facing in the right direction, and tighten down the floor screws supplied for this purpose. If the floor is of hard wood before putting the putty place the bowl in its correct position and mark the holes in the base, then removing bowl, bore some small holes at the designated spots and screw in the boltshanks before putting bowl finally in position with putty.\n\n5. You may now proceed to run the ventilating pipe through to the roof. (See the suggestion contained on the back page of this booklet.) To commence, take the adaptor, which is the piece of pipe $3\\frac{1}{2}$\" at one end and 4\" at the other, insert the small end into the small hole at the back of the bowl and proceed from there following the plan you have selected through to the roof. When you have cut the hole in the roof, place the universal roof safe in position, nail it down and put some of the heavy cement around the edges. After the pipe has been run through roofsafe, place some of the plastic cement around the top of the flashing where the pipe comes through. This roofoise or flashing is universal in that it does not matter what the pitch of the roof, the pipe remains vertical. You may now place the anti-down draft ventilator in position.\n\n**DRAINS**\n\nAbout twenty to thirty feet of drain tile is sufficient, using the higher figure where the ground is heavy.\n\nThe drains are composed of four inch farm drain tiles laid with weeping joints \u2014 that is the tiles are laid end to end loosely and a piece of tar paper or two placed over the top of each loose joint so that water will not enter the tile. The bottom of the joint is thus free and open, permitting the fluids to leak away into the surrounding soil.\n\nIf hard clay or clay clay dig the trench deep, and fill in with some gravel or other material of such nature to keep the trench filled with a supply of air, this will aid in the penetration into the air. At the end of the tile line dig a hole two or three feet across and two or three feet below the tile line and fill in with loose rock or open gravel, or bore some holes in a wooden barrel as illustrated. This is a safety measure to take care of any overflow from the tiles in rush periods.\n\nKeep the tiles near to the surface, 12 to 16 inches, so that air and sunlight may assist final disposal by evaporation.\n\nIf you have any special conditions, write the Company outlining your problem. We can advise and help you.\n\n**ALLATION - ESTIMATES ON REQUEST**\nSome Useful Hints on Ventilation\n\nProper ventilation plays a very important part in the efficient operation of a Sewage Disposal Plant. Read the following instructions very carefully.\n\nFig. A\u2014This shows the proper way to install the pipes where toilets are located at opposite sides of the building.\n\nFig. B\u2014This plan is improper and should be avoided, because of the counteracting influence that one pipe has upon the other, depending upon direction the wind is blowing.\n\nFig. C\u2014This plan is always in favor and when possible run the vent alongside the chimney, but make sure that the ventilator is above the top of chimney, so that the chimney does not prove an obstruction to air currents.\n\nFig. D\u2014There is only one condition under which we can recommend a chimney connection, and this is where the fire is kept going the year round. Unused chimneys become dead and soggy and the air will not move.\n\nFig. E\u2014Shows two styles of which Style 3 is best. Style 2 would not be recommended for cold climates unless the pipe outside be reduced to one-third the total. It is better to keep under and follow the roof to the peak.\n\nFig. F\u2014Shows two plans both of which are entirely wrong and Style B cannot work either way. Any attempt to install toilets according to either of these plans can be reasonably certain that results will be disappointing. Style C, Fig. F, will give bad results on account of possibility of back drafts. Style A fails for same reason and for the additional reason that it has two right angle turns.\n\nFig. G\u2014A header, as here illustrated, is used to join the vents from several bowls. From the header up the same rules apply as to single bowl toilets.\n\nFig. H\u2014This shows the best plan for joining vents on a two bowl toilet. This plan should not be used to join bowls located in separate adjoining rooms. The vents from toilets in each room should always be kept separate.\n\nFig. I\u2014Shows two views of an electric exhaust system. This plan of ventilation is always successful. Any plan for introducing continuous heat into the vent pipes also gives splendid results.\nRE YOUR LETTER OF 24TH INST RECEIVED TODAY STOP ACCORDING TO W J JOHNSTON OF DPW MOST OF THE PLAYGROUND EQUIPMENT WILL BE MADE FROM LEFTOVER MATERIAL STOP MOYERS CATALOGUE I UNDERSTAND HAS PRICES FOR METAL ACCESSORIES NEEDED FOR HOMEMADE EQUIPMENT STOP UNDERSTAND JOHNSTON IS GOING TO SUPPLY FIGURES AS TO THE COST OF SAME STOP HAVING AN EXCELLENT INSPECTION TRIP RAN INTO SEVERAL STORMS AND VERY COLD WEATHER STOP REGARDS\n\nJ W MCKINNON\nINSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS\n\nCopied:\nJGM\nConstruction of Fort Good Hope Indian Day School .................. $5,000.00\n\nThis building will be constructed by the Department of Public Works, under arrangements made by our Lands and Development Services Branch. Of the $40,000.00 voted for this school, $20,000.00 only will be used this year for the purchase of materials.\n\nA copy of this encumbrance certificate is being sent to the Department of Public Works for their information.\nMay 8, 1948.\n\nThe Director,\nLand and Development Services Branch.\n\nI have your memorandum of April 29th in regard to the discussion we have had on the subject of co-operation between this branch, the Indian Health Services and Public Works in connection with our building programme.\n\nThere always has been and still exists close co-operation between this branch and the Indian Health Services. Officers of Indian Health charged with responsibility for the construction of buildings and officers of Indian Affairs responsible for the same type of work continually confer with each other.\n\nAs an example of this liaison Miss Walton learned from Dr. Moore that a contract was being let by Public Works for the construction of the large Hospital on Moose Factory Island. She immediately took steps to ascertain whether the same contractor could be employed by this branch to construct our warehouse. This contractor is going to handle this work as an extra to the contract which he has with Public Works, and we will have the benefit of the supervision provided by Public Works and the accounts will be audited by the auditor of the Cost Audit Division of the Treasury who is being employed by Public Works, in view of the fact that the contract is a cost plus fixed fee contract.\n\nSimilarly, before proceeding with the work at the St. Hugh Indian Agency Miss Walton consulted the Indian Health Services, and as a result has learned that they are not yet ready to go ahead with the Nursing Station. Mr. Farley has, therefore, been asked to tender on the Indian Superintendent's residence so that an early start will be made on this job and when the Public Works are ready with the Nursing Station specifications he will be invited to tender on their job also.\nMiss Walton has reviewed all of the projects mentioned in your memorandum with Dr. Fulcher and Mr. Connolly of the Indian Health, and we find that there are very few where the consolidation of the building programme is feasible.\n\nNorway House - Indian Health probably will not undertake any work during 1948.\n\nSioux Lookout - Indian Health are proceeding with this large contract being let by Public Works, but the Education Division do not feel that the firm would be interested in tendering on the repairs to the School, which is the only other job to be done at this agency.\n\nMoose Factory - recited in Para. 5 of this memorandum.\n\nPrince Rupert - No decision has been made as to what Indian Health propose to do - but it will probably be a prefab. job.\n\nFort Qu'Appelle - Contract has been let by Public Works, Education Division has a repair job only, and the Agencies Division is purchasing a residence.\n\nNorth Battleford - Decision has not been made as to what steps Indian Health will take.\n\nNelson House (In all these projects Indian Health are erecting prefabricated buildings.)\n\nGrosset Lake\n\nInland Lake\n\nOrford House\n\nLac la Ronge - Indian Health are not taking any action.\n\nOnion Lake - The Indian Health Services project at this point is a water system. You will recall that an engineer of your division designed the presently installed system and there have been complaints about it. The Agencies Division has transferred to Indian Health the Agency residence, in return for which Indian Health are to provide a sanitary water system.\nRobbins - The Agencies Division intend to invite tenders for the Clerk's house either by advertising or inviting local tenders. Indian Health have made no decision as yet, but it would appear that they may erect a prefabricated building.\n\nDriftpile - Indian Health are proceeding with a prefab. job.\n\nWilliams Lake - Indian Health are proceeding with a prefab. job.\n\nLillooet - Indian Health are proceeding with a prefab. job.\n\nPine Falls - Indian Health have made no decision as yet. Education job is an electric pole line and will be done by the Power Company.\n\nWalpole Island - Nothing definite has been planned by either department yet.\n\nSix Nations - Indian Health are providing prefab. job. Education is using demolished army buildings. Agencies Division is not building.\n\nSt. Regis - See para. 4 of this memorandum.\n\nRestigouche - If Indian Health do not erect a prefab. job we will probably co-operate with them in building.\n\nEdmonton - The work to be done by both departments are not at the same locations. Education Division's work is on the Alexander Reserve and Indian Health intend to do work at the Charles Tannell Hospital. Education Division is buying materials and having their job done by day labour.\n\nNorman -\nGood Hope -\nMacPherson -\nAklavik -\nCoppermine -\n\nIndian Health providing prefabs. at all these points, under the supervision of their own engineer, who has a full schedule of work.\n\nM.

This would include:\n   (a) Kind of construction material used.\n   (b) Wall thickness.\n   (c) Type of insulation (if any).\n   (d) Condition of floors, roof, paint, weather stripping and all details pertinent to the structure.\n   (e) Full report covering electrical water, plumbing and heating systems.\n   (f) Our recommendations covering the reconditioning or rebuilding if necessary. The latter to be referred to you before being incorporated into the final report.\n   (g) Scale drawings showing general dimensions and major details of building.\n   (h) The taking of water samples in sterile bottles and forward them to the nearest Provincial Testing Laboratory in accordance with your regular procedure.\n   (i) Ten copies of the report will be forwarded to each school.\n\nBefore initiating our inspection programme, we would submit to your department for approval a field form or inspector's note-book, covering all items which should be covered by such an inspection. This will be subject to your approval, addition or revision before it is put into effect.

Canon Henry G. Cook\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nAppropriations 1948-49 Departmental Estimates\nAnglican Church-owned Indian and Eskimo Residential Schools\n\nOn 1st April, 1948, in the course of a conversation in your office you advised me that the following amounts were provided in your 1948-49 appropriations:\n\n| Location       | Amount   |\n|----------------|----------|\n| Moose Factory  | $1,000.00|\n| Fort George    | $500.00  |\n| Wabasca        | $8,000.00|\n| Whitefish Lake | $1,000.00|\n| Carcross       | $1,300.00|\n| Aklavik        | $3,500.00|\n\nTotal $15,300.00\n\nAccording to our records we have requested the following expenditures and/or reimbursement of our expenditures against the above appropriations and I shall be glad to be advised as to the present situation in regard to these requests.\n\nMoose Factory\n\nOur letter of 13th Sept., 1948. Request for reimbursement of $821.40 expended on labour for painting.\n\nFort George\n\nOur letter of 25th June, 1948. Request for provision of materials for combined pumphouse, powerhouse and workshop at estimated cost of $505.00\n\nWabasca\n\nNo special requests submitted as it was presumed that the $8,000.00 provided would be applied towards the new building.\nWhitefish Lake\n\nYour 131-10-5(E.6) of 12th August, 1948, advised that $306.60 for labour in 1947-48 had been charged to 1948-49 appropriations, leaving a balance of $693.40 which our letter of 17th September, 1948 requested should be applied toward roofing materials, etc., for this school.\n\nCarcross\n\nYour 156-1-5(E.1) of 31st August, 1948, advised that $60.00 of the $1,300.00 appropriation had been used to provide a teacher's desk, leaving $1,240.00 available to apply towards the amount of $3,065.80 required for the new lighting plant.\n\nIn our letter of 2nd Sept., 1948, we suggested that the $1,825.80 needed to provide for the lighting plant be transferred from the Aklavik appropriation.\n\nAklavik\n\nOn the assumption that $1,825.80 is transferred from Aklavik to Carcross (see preceding paragraph), the balance remaining on the $3,500.00 appropriation would be $1,674.20. Against this sum we have requested:\n\n(a) In letter of 24th August, 1948\n\nReimbursement of $1,338.25 expended on lumber, etc., for repairs to roofs and ceilings\n\n(b) In letter of 16th Sept., 1948\n\nReimbursement of $210.64 expended on a Westco Electric pump and service switch\n\nthus leaving, according to the above, about $125.00 available for other services.\n\nIt will be appreciated if you would furnish me, as early as you can conveniently do so, with a statement showing the detail of expenditure and commitments to date against the appropriations listed in the first paragraph above in order that we may know the size of the uncommitted balances.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\nOctober 12, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. G. BICK,\nLands and Development Services Branch.\n\nEducational Plans - Western Provinces and Northwest Territories.\n\nI understand that you have been requested to prepare a brief summary, for our Minister, of the school building program for the Western Provinces and the Northwest Territories.\n\nIn British Columbia, we have now on order or under construction 6 one-room Indian day schools and 2 two-room Indian day schools. Some of these buildings are prefabricated ones. We have also completed the conversion of army buildings into day schools in the Alert Bay Agency and classes are now being conducted in these buildings.\n\nIn Alberta, we have completed the day schools at Michel and Stony Plains, near Edmonton. Contracts have recently been let for a two-room day school at Sarcee and a one-room day school on Alexander's Reserve, near Edmonton. Air Force buildings were moved and set up on permanent foundations to provide extra classroom blocks at the St. Paul's and Blood Residential Schools near Cardston, Alberta.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, the Nut Lake and Pecuma Indian Day schools are nearing completion. A contract has recently been let for another day school on the Meewasin Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nIn Manitoba, day schools are under construction or have been completed on the following reserves: Valley River, Nelson House, Little Grand Rapids, Peguis, Fisher River, Oak River, Island Lake and Cypress Lake.\n\n...... In\nIn the Northwest Territories, two-even day schools are nearing completion at Fort Norman and Moosonee River. A four-room day school is being erected at Hay River.\n\nIn addition to the above new schools, we have been able to open several temporary classrooms in rented church buildings and halls. In this way we have managed to provide educational facilities for some 300 Indian children for whom we were unable to provide educational facilities previously.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, October 20, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nTwo Room Indian Day School Drawings\nand Specifications.\n\nIncluded in our plans for 1949-50 are a number of two room Indian Day Schools with attached teachers' quarters. Our present plans for this school are your Index No. 849. It is understood that your Chief Architect and our Superintendent of Education have discussed the following changes which could be profitably made in these specifications:\n\n(1) That the landing at the foot of the stairs leading to the teachers' bedrooms be eliminated. This will allow more space in the living-room and will also permit large pieces of furniture being taken upstairs. This is not possible at present due to the hand rail at the foot of the stairs.\n\n(2) That Sheet #3 be amended by removing the door of the clothes closet in the left hand bedroom.\n\n(3) That Sheet #2 be amended by altering the windows in the living-room.\n\nIn view of the fact that it will probably be necessary to have this school built in certain areas by day labour, it would be appreciated if a standard bill of materials could be prepared for all the supplies required for the erection of this school. A similar bill of materials which was prepared for the standard one room school has proven of great value in our work this year.\n\nBFF/HH.\n\nActing Director.\nNovember 1, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Marshall:\n\nAs I advised you on the phone, we have now received a further list of school and teacherage requirements for British Columbia. This additional list has been compiled as a result of our school inspector's visits to these areas since the opening of the school term.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I can then arrange my inspection trips so that I will be in town when you visit here. Our address, incidentally, is 220 Queen Street.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nBernard N.

The advantages of fire-resistance, sturdiness and economy are common to all Quonsets and Quonset adaptations.\n\nThe enclosed photographs are of the school at Moosonee, Ontario. It is an adaptation obtained by the utilization of the Quonset \"24\" and Quonset \"40\" buildings.\n\nWe will be only too pleased to submit to you further information upon request. I will be in Ottawa in the near future and would appreciate the opportunity of discussing our buildings with you.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nGREAT LAKES STEEL CORPORATION\nSTRAN-STEEL DIVISION\n\nJ. N. Harshaw,\nDistrict Engineer.\n\nMANUFACTURERS OF QUONSET BUILDINGS & STRAN-STEEL FRAMING\nProvince of Saskatchewan\n\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\nRegina, November 19, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI have forwarded under separate cover a set of blue prints for one-room schools. There are five schemes ranging from the portable school up to a fairly elaborate type. A number of these better type schools have been built in Saskatchewan this year and are very highly praised. You will note that the most complete type includes an area for teacher's room, kitchenette, library, etc. The activities area, as you will note, has a flat roof which of course must be a 20 year bond roof. One school unit in the province modified this by eliminating a part of the clerestory lighting and making this portion into an ell with a peak roof. In order to make sure that a shingled roof would prove satisfactory, they raised the pitch of the main roof and the ell to correspond.\n\nI would be glad to receive a set of the blueprints and specifications of your standard one-room school with attached teacher's residence. The regulations in our province forbid building attached teacher's residence but personally I think our regulations are wrong. In one or two cases the regulations have been broken and one I have in mind is one of the best teacherages I have seen in the province.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Superintendent of Schools.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nOTTAWA November 19th, 1948.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention Mr. P. Phelan.\nRe: Frigidaire For our Residential Schools.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI take the liberty of enclosing copies of two letters from the Keyes Supply Company of Ottawa giving prices for 8 x 10 x 9 refrigerator which is about the size needed for our residential schools with a pupilage varying from one hundred to one hundred and fifty. It seems to me that the price is quite reasonable.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that the power needed for these refrigerators is never more than twenty-five amperes at the highest consumption and would therefore be suitable in all our schools because the ampere strength of all our D.C. systems is at least two hundred and fifty amperes.\n\nThe building material, such as lumber and insulating compounds are not included in the above, but all our schools will be glad to supply all that is necessary for the erection and building of these frigidaires if the Department allows $500.00 for such purpose.\n\nI hope that you will give this matter your kind attention, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, o.m.i.\nKeyes Supply Company Limited,\n\nOttawa, November 18th, 1948.\n\nFather J. O. Plourde,\nOttawa University,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our letter of November 10th, relative to refrigeration equipment suitable for the Indian Schools, we wish to advise regarding electrical power requirement.\n\nThe unit proposed is of 1hp, D.C. and as such will require an average of 1.3k.w. The starting current will run as high as 25 amperes, and this condition will exist for possibly ten to twenty seconds. The current will then rapidly drop to about 14 amperes and gradually drop from 14 amperes to about 10 amperes, as the refrigeration load tapers off.\n\nIf your battery banks are of 200 ampere hour capacity or larger; no difficulty in operation can be foreseen.\n\nWe hope that this is the information required, if we may be of further service please do not hesitate to call.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nKeyes Supply Company Limited,\n\nC. R. Jones,\nRefrigeration Manager.\nKEYES SUPPLY COMPANY LIMITED\nAlbert and Kent streets, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nNovember 10, 1948.\n\nFather J.O. Plourde,\nOttawa University,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn accordance with our recent conversations relative to refrigerator equipment for Indian Schools, we are giving prices herewith on suitable equipment to refrigerate rooms 6'x10'x9' inside dimensions, insulated with 4\" Falco wool or equivalent to 35 F.\n\nThe various items of equipment discussed are listed below:\n\n1: Model A-100 FH Brunner Condensing unit, air cooled type using Freon 12 as refrigerant, complete with low pressure control, and equipped with a 1 HP 110 VOLT, D.C.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFH/AM\nOttawa, December 1, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Director,\nLands and Development Services Branch\n\nRe: Revised Plan for One-Room Indian Day School with Attached Teacherage\n\nAt the present time, we are building a number of standard one-room Indian Day Schools with attached teacher's residences according to plans, specifications, and bills of materials as prepared by your branch (your Index No. 37).\n\nThis school is proving quite satisfactory on the Reserves where accommodation is required for a fairly large number of pupils. The size of the classroom is 26 ft. 6 ins. by 22 ft., and accommodation is provided for forty pupils.\n\nWe are gradually meeting the educational requirements of Indian Reserves on which there are thirty or more Indian pupils. To the top of our priority list are now coming Reserves where some fifteen to twenty-five pupils require classroom facilities.\n\nThe standard one-room school and attached teacherage (Index No. 37) costs from $14,000.00 to $20,000.00, depending on location and transportation facilities. It is felt that a less expensive and somewhat smaller type of school would suffice for Reserves where only some fifteen to twenty-five children require education.\n\nTherefore, we would request that plans, specifications, and a bill of materials for a low cost school be prepared. In this connection, I am forwarding to you a sketch made of a school built by the Breanett Lumber Company of Bresen, Ontario. Two such one-room schools...\nwere erected in Chatham Township in 1948. On the Building Committee for these projects was Inspector Barrett of the Provincial Department of Education. In the original sketch no lighting facilities were provided on the far side of the classroom opposite the \"wall of windows\". In the sketch we are forwarding to you please note that we have indicated two small windows above the blackboard on this side.\n\nI would emphasize that this sketch is being forwarded to you only as an indication of our requirements. Naturally, in some instances, we will have to provide an attached teacherage along similar lines to the accommodation provided in Index No. 837.\n\nI am advised that the Bresett Lumber Company have erected these two schools for approximately $6,000.00. Could a similar low cost school be designed for our Education Division?\n\nTo summarize, we would request that plans, specifications and bills of materials be prepared for:\n(1) a low cost one-room day school,\n(2) a low cost one-room day school with attached teacherage (three rooms).\n\nWould it be possible to have this data prepared by January 10, 1949? We intend to build two of these schools at Oxford House, Norway House Agency, next summer and will have to buy the materials by January 31 to have the supplies shipped in by tractor train.\n\nActing Director.\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Director,\nLands and Development Services Branch\n\nRe: Revised Plan for One-Room Indian Day School with Attached Teacherage\n\nAt the present time, we are building a number of standard one-room Indian Day Schools with attached teacher's residences according to plans, specifications, and bills of materials as prepared by your Branch (your Index No. 837).\n\nThis school is proving fairly satisfactory on the Reserves where accommodation is required for a fairly large number of pupils.

As a rule they are very interesting and contain useful comment, but frankly we are a little disappointed with the lack of details and I intend to go into this with Mr. Macaulay who told us before the investigations were ordered that his engineers would be able to tell us not only what was wrong with the buildings but also how to rectify the situation in each case. Certainly we do not want to order any additional engineering investigations if we can get along with the information we now have.\n\nThe pressing need at the moment is what funds are available for repair work on these various places so that plans can be made accordingly if we are to do the work.\n\nI would be glad if you would arrange to have the officers of your branch who are interested in these matters confer with Mr. Mills, Chief of the Engineering and Construction Service, at the earliest possible date with the view to making progress with these matters.\n\nR.

This plan has now been prepared and the attached bill of materials covers the items required for its construction. It is our intention to build this school on the more isolated reserves where freight charges on the present plan are often very high. The building contains no basement and the teacher's residence and the classroom are all on the same floor. We will be sending to you, under separate cover, a number of the blueprints for this building.\n\nTo summarize, we will be building in future a new type of one-room school according to drawings No. 888 as prepared by the Lands and Development Services Branch.

We would like to have further information as follows:-\n\n(a) Size of fire-box,\n(b) Will the grates handle both wood and coal?\n(c) What is the B.T.U. per hour rating?\n(d) What is the length of smoke pipe provided?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.A. Doucet,\nSupervisor of Vocational Training.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nRe: Index No. 891 - Two Classroom Indian Day School (Water and Electricity)\n\nThe draft plan submitted by you for a two room Indian Day School with attached teacher's quarters on Reserves where electricity and running water can be made available, has been studied carefully by officials of our Education Division. The following observations have been made as a result of their consideration:\n\n(1) Unexcavated part below water toilets - It is felt that these two parts might well be excavated because not only of the possibility of giving difficulty in presenting a danger from frozen pipes, but also because of the fact that this space can be utilized as dressing rooms. In fact, on one or two Reserves we may contemplate the installation of a small shower room in this space.\n\n(2) Fenestration - The fenestration in the new one room school, Index No. 888, has been highly commended by both our field and education officials. Would it be possible to add a sixth window to the main bank of windows in each room and thus raise the fenestration ratio from 5:28 (below the ideal) to 6:28.\n\n(3) Shelves - We are constantly requested for additional shelves by our teachers, and I would suggest that these be provided as follows:\n\n(a) under the windows in the classroom\n(b) a narrow shelf in the coat rooms so that children's lunches can be placed in safety above the reach of dogs, etc. This shelf should be five feet high and approximately eight inches wide.\n\n(4) Partition between kitchen and living room. It is presumed that this partition will be thick enough to handle a four inch drain pipe.\n\n(5) Kitchen chimney - This chimney can be eliminated, and I would ask that heavy wiring be provided so that a small electric range can be provided in the teacherage. This will be preferable from the teacher's point of view but will mean that heat will also have to be provided from the furnace for the kitchen.\n\n(6) Glass brick - As we are anxious to keep the cost of our schools as low as possible, could we please be advised as to the necessity of placing this glass brick over the two entrance doorways. If the cost is as low as the installation of windows then we are prepared to accept this item. If it is much higher, then we would prefer windows.\n\nYou will note that the above are all relatively minor points and that, on the whole, we are very pleased with this plan. We feel that this design will provide very satisfactory classroom accommodation and comfortable teacher's living quarters. It is hoped that these can be built at a reasonable cost. Could we also be provided, when the final plans are completed, with copies of any changed specifications required over our present design and a bill of materials.\n\nDirector.\n\nBFN/AM\nOttawa, February 15, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH,\n\nPlan for one-room day school with one-storey teacher's quarters (Index No. 888).\n\nWe have now received the amended plans for this low-cost school and a number of them have been distributed to our field officials concerned.\n\nWe would very much like to have 120 more copies of this plan as we anticipate building a number of them during this coming academic year. Before these are sent, we would appreciate your advice as to the suitability of the attached store-room/toilet unit to be built in connection with this type of school. Since there is no basement, it is felt that a small storage space will have to be provided, both for dry kindling wood and for extra school supplies. The attached sketch is an illustration of the type of low-cost unit which we have in mind.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nDirector.\n\nBFM/EM\n16th February, 1949.\n\nThe Hall Foundry Co., Ltd.,\nHespeler, Ontario.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe are interested in further information on your Bridgewall Flueless Furnace and also your heaters.\n\nFor our one-room schools we use gravity feed hot air furnaces of the following capacities (depending upon the location in which the school is constructed):\n\n(1) 30,000 btu per hour at register,\n(2) 105,000 btu per hour at register.\n\nFor our two-room schools we require the following two types of furnaces, again depending upon the locality:\n\n(1) 154,000 btu per hour at register,\n(2) 200,000 btu per hour at register.\n\nOur specifications call for heavy duty all cast fire boxes, and preferably steel radiators. The above two types of buildings include teachers' residences, hence our rather heavy requirements. In addition to the above information about furnaces, I would like more details with regard to the two types of heaters which you have available.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nB.F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, February 16, 1949.\n\nRes: Donald Inspection Company Reports Covering Seventeen Indian Residential Schools.\n\nYou are advised that we have received and carefully read the reports submitted by the above firm.\n\nIn general it can be stated that these reports present an outline description of the buildings and property with certain comments and general recommendations with reference to maintenance and repairs.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this memorandum to criticize these reports, but it must be pointed out that in order to make intelligent recommendations with regard to repairs and revisions in connection with mechanical and electrical services, thorough inspections will have to be carried out by men well qualified in these lines.\n\nThe reports contain repeated suggestions that by the installation of vacuum pumps, the heating systems can be made satisfactory. This statement is misleading to say the least. No reputable manufacturer would be willing to guarantee satisfactory operation of a vacuum pump without being assured that the return piping had been thoroughly checked for possible leaks and that the radiator traps were all either removed or satisfactorily repaired. Since no mention has been made in any of the reports in question that piping and accessories have been checked, it can only be assumed that the Donald Inspection Company did not consider it their obligation to make a thorough analysis in this connection.\n\nWhile the boiler sizes have been given in several instances, no attempt was made to provide the very necessary information with regard to piping connections. Generally it can be stated with definite assurance that the reports merely point out the various conditions requiring specialized investigation and attention, and as previously mentioned, there is a complete lack of essential data.\n\nIn summary, it can be taken for granted from the reports that large sums of money will be required in order to bring the mechanical and electrical services up to a reasonable point of efficiency.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThis is not surprising as many of the buildings are from 20 to 60 years old and there is evidence that only nominal attention to maintenance has been given in the past.\n\nIt is our understanding that the Indian Affairs Branch are considering closing down some of the older schools. With this in mind, it is suggested that they be requested to provide this Division with a list of the schools intended to be kept in operation, with requests for the necessary inspections and recommendations.\n\nWith such information, it would then be possible to make the necessary arrangements to have the surveys carried out.\n\nChief Engineer\n\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nI am sure that our Chief Engineer can get more information from the Donald Inspection Company and he will do so, but first we would like to know whether you are going to close down any of these schools that were inspected by the Donald Inspection Company. In the case of the ones which are to remain in operation we will get what information we can from Donald Inspection and then have any necessary additional information gathered by our own engineers.\n\n17/2/49.\n\nDirector.\nToronto, February 19, 1949.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nOn request from officials of this Department, Inspector W. J. Greening has procured from you and forwarded to this Department certain plans and specifications for use in constructing the one-room schools under your Indian Affairs Branch. These plans are being placed on file and will be of great use to us in advising boards as to plans for schools. It is understood from Inspector Greening that you are having these plans revised. This Department wishes to thank you for your co-operation and help in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n22nd February, 1949.\n\nMr. B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have just received your letter of February 16th.\n\nWe are enclosing the literature on our \"Fireco\" Bridgewall Flue-less Furnace. Please look over this literature.\n\nNow, we might state that these furnaces are made in six different sizes and our method of concluding the size of the furnace required is computed by the cubic contents of the place required.\n\nIf, therefore, you will send us plans or blue-prints of the buildings you require to be heated, then we can give you something definite with regard to the same.\n\nThanking you very much, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE HALL FOUNDRY COMPANY LIMITED.,\n\nPresident.\n\nZAH/MM\nDear Sir or Madame:\n\nWe have just received your coupon and notice you are interested in purchasing a new furnace.\n\nIf you happen to have a furnace in your home now and you would wish to change it for a new furnace, then we can supply you with a furnace and casing. With this layout all you would have to do, would be to get a tinsmith to connect the new furnace casing with your warm and cold air pipes that are now installed.\n\nIt might be that you would have to add another warm air or possibly another extra cold air pipe in order to give sufficient circulation of air through the new furnace.\n\nNow in the next case, you may be building a new house and if you wish to have a pipe furnace, then we can supply you with a furnace and casing and it would be necessary then for you to get a tinsmith to install this furnace for you, putting in the registers and the necessary warm and cold air pipes.\n\nNow in the next case, you might be able to use a pipeless furnace instead of a pipe furnace. This depends upon the situation of the principal rooms of your house.\n\nIf you will send us a plan of your house, marking the rooms and the size of each room, then we can tell you whether you can use a pipeless furnace. A pipeless furnace can be installed by any handy man for the reason that we give you directions how to do it.\n\nOne good point about a pipeless furnace is the fact that with it you have very little heat in the basement or cellar of your home and this style of furnace frequently keeps your cellar sufficiently cool so as not to make it too warm for the vegetables stored in the basement.\nWith a pipeless furnace, you fill your home with warm air and in this respect it is necessary for you to have a pipeless furnace of the proper size, in order that you would have no cold air drafts on the floor.\n\nWith a pipeless furnace, practically all the heat goes into your home.\n\nWe might state that a pipeless furnace can be made particularly suitable for any size house up to eight or nine rooms.\n\nA pipeless furnace can be used in a larger house, if of square construction with a large centre hall in it.\n\nPipeless furnaces have been abused by people installing a furnace that is entirely too small. We might state that a pipeless furnace is the most economical style of furnace you can possibly use.\n\nAny room you do not wish to heat, all you have to do is close the door.\n\nWe have no hesitation in recommending a pipeless furnace if we know how the rooms in your house are situated.\n\nUnder these conditions, we would advise you therefore to give us the information regarding your requirements. Then we would be pleased to make our recommendations.\n\nThanking you, we remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTHE HALL FOUNDRY CO., LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRESIDENT\n\nZAH/FD\nEnclosed you will find a leaflet on our new Fireco Flueless Furnace. We would like you to make a special study of the construction of this furnace. It is so simple, however, that no doubt you will see at a glance the objects we had in view when building it.\n\nWe built this furnace with the intention of burning either blocks of wood or any kind of Canadian soft coal or Lignite. Of course this furnace will burn any other kind of fuel equally as well.\n\nThe method of combustion in this furnace is about as perfect as it possibly can be made. You will notice the second combustion chamber which is of equal diameter with the first combustion chamber, and the extreme down fire travel mixing your gasses and giving you almost complete combustion of your fuel.\n\nWith this new style of furnace if you burn hard coal or coke, we would say that this can be done for a period of ten years without having to clean out the furnace and at the same time you will have no depreciation in the method of combustion, and also as the flues in this furnace are all perpendicular combustion chambers you therefore lose practically nothing in the radiation of heat.\n\nAt the back of the second combustion chamber and at the bottom is a clean out pipe with stopper. This clean out pipe extends through the outside casing and therefore when you wish to clean out the furnace all you have to do is to remove the stopper and take the soot out through this opening. Then your furnace is thoroughly cleaned because the bottom of the second combustion chamber is the only part of this furnace where the soot and ashes can collect.\n\nThis work can always be done by yourself without any outside help, and at any time it will not take any longer than three or four minutes to clean out your furnace.\n\nIn one department of our works we have used two of these furnaces. In them we have burned nothing except Nova Scotia soft coal. After burning these furnaces the total winter we removed the stopper and cleaned out the furnaces and, to our amazement, there was less than three small shovelfuls of soot and ashes in the bottom of the second combustion chamber. This proves to us, conclusively, that you can use these furnaces for at least three years at a stretch and use nothing only Nova Scotia soft coal in them without having to clean them out.\n\nWe have built many ordinary furnaces and our ordinary furnaces are just as good as those built by any other firm in Canada. We have tested these out with soft coal and found that the longest time you could possibly use these ordinary furnaces and burn nothing only Nova Scotia soft coal would be from two to three weeks.\nThe FIRECO Bridgewall Flueless Furnace\n\nWith\n\nPOSITIVE\n\nBOOSTER\n\nWarm Air Pipe\n\n\"It Works Like A Charm\"\n\n1. What every furnace man has tried in vain to do for hundreds of years has now been accomplished.\n\n2. The only warm air furnace supplied with Booster pipes.\n\n3. They overcome every objection to former methods of warm air heating.\n\n4. An absolutely new device for equal distribution of warm air.\n\n5. It increases the efficiency of warm air furnaces by at least thirty percent.\n\n6. It causes a thorough mixing of all gases in the second combustion chamber, thus increasing combustion and producing volumes of extra heat.\n\n7. It accelerates the air travel within the furnace casing.\n\n8. No more noisy Booster fans are required for the proper distribution of warm air.\n\n9. What the fan is supposed to do the Fireco Bridgewall flueless furnace now does of itself.\n\n10. The heat formerly wasted to the chimney is now drawn out of the furnace and delivered to even the farthest room in the house.\n\n11. It is an extra active fuel saving device.\n\n12. It is the only device by which you can have a positive forced circulation of warm air.\n\n13. It strengthens both air-conditioning and humidification.\n\n14. Booster pipes are all concealed and add no extra hindrance in the cellar.\n\n15. An even temperature throughout the whole house is maintained.\n\n16. It's the construction of the inside of a furnace that matters. Study this one and be convinced.\n\nPATENTS PENDING, IN CANADA AND U.S.A.\n\nThe Hall Foundry Company, Limited\n\nHESPELER, ONTARIO\nFireco Bridgewall Flueless Furnace\n\nDesigned and Built\nto Burn\nAny Kind of\nCanadian Soft Coal\n\nNo horizontal flues to fill with ashes and soot.\nWhen burning hard coal and coke it requires clean-out only once in ten years.\nWhen using wood or soft coal you clean it out only once in three years.\nThe casing is oval in form, and spacious, guaranteeing a rapid circulation of air.\nIt has two varieties of Patented Bridgewall Construction.\nThere are three vertical combustion chambers of patented design.\nCombustion is complete in this furnace, insuring a saving of more than half the fuel.\nYou can hold fire for fifteen hours with wood and produce heat all the time.\nWe guarantee you can clean out this furnace in five minutes without having to employ any outside help.\nBuilt and designed to burn any kind of Canadian soft coal with perfect satisfaction.\nAll horizontal friction flues are eliminated.\nThis furnace cannot choke up.\nThe simplest construction ever put on the Canadian market.\nSold only on an honest money-back guarantee.\nAny other fuel can be burned equally as well as soft coal.\nThe \"Acme\" of cleanliness when burning soft coal.\nNo dirt, no dust, no smudge.\nWill burn any kind of cheap fuel.\nWorks equally as well with any Oil Burner.\n\nMade in six sizes with capacity up to an eighteen-room house\n\nWRITE FOR FULL PARTICULARS\n\nThe HALL FOUNDRY CO., Limited\nHESPELER, ONTARIO\nOTHER PATENTS APPLIED FOR\nRULES FOR BURNING SOFT COAL in a FIRECO BRIDGEWALL FLUELESS FURNACE\n\n1. Never cover fire completely with fresh fuel.\n2. When coal hardens in the fire pot, break it up with the furnace poker.\n3. Never put fresh coal on a dull fire.\n4. All fresh coal must be put on the FRONT HALF of the fire pot.\n5. Give your furnace plenty of draft for 10 or 15 minutes after putting on fresh coal.\n6. Poke the live coals to the back of the fire pot before putting on fresh coal.\n7. Always allow the fire to burn up before putting on fresh fuel.\nThe second combustion chamber in this furnace is made of 16 gauge black iron. The first combustion chamber is made of similar 14 gauge reinforced on the inside with heavy cast iron. The tops and bottom of the second combustion chamber are heavy cast iron.\n\nWith this new style of furnace our actual test has been a saving of more than 60% of the fuel together with double saving in time spent cleaning out the ordinary furnace.\n\nWe make these furnaces with 18\", 20\", 22\", 24\", 26\", and 28\" fire pots.\n\nWe figure that a 20\" fire pot in this style of furnace is equal to a 24\" fire pot with our ordinary Pilot Success style of furnace. This, of course, is on account of the extra radiation surface.\n\nThe casing of this new style furnace is not round but is oval in form.\n\nWhen purchasing a furnace we therefore advise you to purchase both the furnace and the casing for the reason that the ordinary tinsmith would find great difficulty in making this new shape and new style of casing.\n\nWe figure that this new style furnace will be a source of genuine revenue to yourself.\n\nNow we would like you to send us a plan of your house showing the different rooms and the size of each room, also the size of the house over all. Then we should be pleased to tell you the style of furnace you should have, whether pipe or pipeless, and the size of the same. The prices are as follows:\n\nPIPELESS, complete with Double Casings and Floor Register:\n- No. 118 $198.15\n- No. 120 $228.65\n- No. 122 $251.55\n- No. 124 $264.25\n- No. 126 $290.50\n- No. 128 $314.25\n\nPIPE Furnace and Casing only:\n- No. 118 $149.85\n- No. 120 $177.80\n- No. 122 $195.60\n- No. 124 $218.50\n- No. 126 $238.80\n- No. 128 $254.60\n\nWe pay the freight to your nearest railway station.\n\nThis is without any obligation whatever on your part.\n\nKindly let us know if you now have a furnace in your home, and you might mention the diameter of the fire pot on the same.\n\nShould you wish any further explanation regarding this furnace we would only be too pleased to furnish it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTHE HALL FOUNDRY CO., LIMITED\n\nH/W.

Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nPLEASE READ THIS\n\nTHE PIPELESS FURNACE\n\nMany people object to the use of the pipeless furnace. They say, for instance, that the floors are always cold.\n\nThere is a reason for this and the reason is that the person who purchased the furnace happened to buy one that was too small to heat the house. If the furnace had been a size larger it would have filled the house with warm air and when a house is filled with warm air it is heated and no objection can be found.\n\nThe installers of furnaces invariably find fault with the pipeless furnace for the reason that any handyman can install a pipeless furnace without any difficulty and therefore it lessens the work and the original cost of the furnace.\n\nWith the pipeless furnace all the heat generated in the furnace itself passes directly into the home and practically no heat is left in the basement, or very little.\n\nThis is a good point because vegetables in the basement are not softened and sometimes dried up with the heat in the basement as when a pipe furnace is used.\n\nWith the pipeless furnace you have no warm or cold air pipes filling up the basement of your house and making it more or less inconvenient for other uses.\n\nWe find that many installers of furnaces will not install a furnace that they are not handling themselves. The reason for this is no doubt very evident to you.\n\nIn a six or seven roomed house, or even a larger house, a pipeless furnace can be used to great advantage both with regard to cost of installation and also to the distribution of heat throughout the home.\n\nWe advise you to buy your furnace NOW. Don't wait until September or October to place your order.\n\nTHE HALL FOUNDRY CO., LIMITED\n\nHespeler, Ontario\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Two Classroom Indian Day School Having Water and Electric Supply,\n(Index No. 891)\n\nThe memorandum of the 11th ultimo from the Director of Indian Affairs Branch to you has been studied. Working drawings are now in hand and the following comments arise from the Director's observations:\n\n1. Unexcavated part below water toilets - This is agreed, and these spaces are being designed for dressing rooms.\n\n2. Fenestration - The figures 5:28 and 6:28 given for the fenestration ratio are not understood. Normally, windows are expressed as a percentage of floor area. Maximum requirement in any Canadian province is 20%. The design we submitted provided 20.4% - a greater amount than the One Room School, Index No. 888. However, as suggested, a sixth window is being added raising the window area to 24.5%.\n\n3. Shelves - These will be incorporated in the design.\n\n4. Partition between kitchen and living-room - This partition can contain a 4\" drain pipe.\n\n5. Kitchen chimney - This chimney is being eliminated and electric stove wiring and heat will be provided to the kitchen as requested.\n\n6. Glass block - The cost of glass block to the stairways would be lower than double hung windows with storm sash and screens. The principal saving will result from maintenance, since the glass block will prevent breakage.\n\nRevised specifications for this school are being prepared, and these will be supplied with the final drawings.\n\nR.A.

If the Donald Inspection Company had submitted sufficient information, it is felt that we would not have had to request your engineer to make such reports. This Company has not provided sufficient detailed facts for this Branch to proceed with the advertising for tenders required to carry out these repairs. The only school in the list which we intend to consider closing this year is that at File Hills, Saskatchewan.\n\nDirector.\n\nBFH/AM\nMarch 11, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S.

Box 76,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: School Construction Program\nRef.: your C-11-3 of March 2\n\nThe plan for the new low cost one-room school was forwarded to the Great Lakes Steel Corporation, but we have not yet received from them their specifications and blue print as requested. We will advise you as soon as this information is received.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/AM\nMarch 11, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOL BUILDING PROGRAMME.\n\nWhile feeling that our Indian day school construction programme is progressing satisfactorily, I am rather concerned over the many proposals being made for the erection of residential schools. As I have advised you previously, it is my feeling as an expert that the present cost of building, equipping and operating residential schools is such that I recommend only the building of residential schools in those areas in which we are definitely assured of the impossibility of educating Indian children in day schools.\n\nIn the past, one denomination in particular has assumed the attitude that day schools should only be built in areas in which there were not enough Indian children to warrant the building of a residential school. I feel that this is the wrong attitude and that therefore we should proceed with caution in meeting recommendations advanced for the building of certain residential schools. At the same time we will have to make it clear that residential schools will only be built when there is no hope of operating day schools. I feel that my main concern as Superintendent of Education is to provide educational facilities for as many Indian children as possible. This cannot be done by the building of residential schools wherever they may be. It is now clear that a residential school of 150 pupils will cost at least $40,000 to build and equip fully. The per capita grant which will have to be paid to the denomination operating this school will be at least $250 higher, depending on its location. In any year of operation it will cost the Department at least $40,000. In other words, for the sum required to build and\nequip one residential school, we can build and equip at least twenty-five one-room day schools and teacherages. For the cost of operating one residential school for a year, we can operate at least fifteen day schools. To summarize, therefore, we can educate, in equivalent day schools, approximately 750 children as compared with 150 children educated in a residential school.\n\nIt is not my intention at this time to present to you a long list of the pros and cons of educating Indian children in residential schools. Your long experience in Indian affairs and your many contacts with denominational authorities have provided you with all the various arguments in this regard. I fully appreciate the fact that residential schools can provide a broader curriculum than day schools because of their facilities for vocational education. However, I do feel that we should proceed with great caution in examining every residential school project request and therefore I present to you now a review of the main demands made by the various denominations:\n\nCHURCH OF ENGLAND:\n\n(1) Carcross Residential School:\nThe request here is that the school now being operated in temporary quarters be replaced with a modern building. In Appendix A I attach my recommendation for procedure in this particular case.\n\n(2) Lac la Ronge Residential School:\nThe request here is for a dormitory block to be operated in conjunction with a provincial day school under the control of the provincial Department of Education. In Appendix B I attach my recommendation in this connection.\n\n(3) The Pas:\nIn this instance the church is considering the closing of the Elkhorn Residential School in central Manitoba and requesting the rebuilding of the former Maskay Residential School at The Pas. This school was closed many years ago as the result of fire and the children were moved to Elkhorn. In Appendix C you will find my recommendations in this regard.\n(4) Onion Lake\n\nThis school is presently housed in the former Anglican Theological College in Prince Albert and there is no urgency in the consideration of this request.\n\nWe are already proceeding at the present time with the other project requested by this Church, namely the building of a dormitory block at Wabasso.\n\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\n(5) Norway House\n\nThis request is for the rebuilding of the former school destroyed by fire in 1946. In Appendix D attached you will find my report and recommendation on this situation.\n\nIn addition to this project, we also have under consideration the closing of the File Hills Residential School and the replacing of it by day schools as we did at Mount Elgin. There is also a situation at the Round Lake Residential School requiring further study.\n\nROMAN CATHOLIC Church\n\n6. Teslin, Yukon.\n\nThis request has been fully investigated by our Educational Survey Officer and by our Inspector of Schools for British Columbia. Originally there were requests for two residential schools, one at Fort St. John, British Columbia, and the other at Teslin, Yukon. We are agreed that the one school at Teslin will satisfy the requirements of those children who need residential school education. The building of this school should begin this summer.\n\n7. Hay Lakes, Alberta.\n\nThis request is for a residential school and is a result of an educational survey made by a Provincial School Inspector. The building of this school should begin this summer.\n8. **Thunderchild, Delmas, Saskatchewan.**\n\nThis request is for the rebuilding of the former school destroyed by fire in 1946. In Appendix B attached, you will find my report and recommendation concerning this school.\n\n9. **Island Lake, Manitoba.**\n\nThis request is for a new school in an area now served by day schools. This situation will have to be handled with care as the United Church have been prominent in missionary activities in this area for many years. I feel that their pressing for a school at Norway House (see No. 5) is a result of the activities of R.C. missionaries in this area. In Appendix F you will find my report and recommendation.\n\n10. **Nelson House, Manitoba.**\n\nThis request is for a new school to serve the R.C. Indians of Nelson House and South Indian Lake. Our preliminary survey indicates no need for this school and we are now proceeding with the building of a new day school at Nelson House for R.C. pupils. A day school was built last year for the U.C. pupils.\n\n11. **Armstrong, Ontario.**\n\nAll other requests for R.C. residential schools have been submitted by the various Bishops of the diocese concerned through the local Oblate Indian Welfare and Training Commission. This request is from the Jesuits engaged in missionary activities in Western Ontario. In Appendix G you will find my report and recommendation.\n\n12. **Albany, Ontario.**\n\nThis request is for building a school previously destroyed by fire and now housed in a building which the Bishop asserts he wants for a hospital. In Appendix H you will find my report and recommendation.\n\n..... (13)\n13. **Abitibi Agency** (in or near Amos, P.Q.)\n\nThis request is for a new school. There has been a previous report and you will find my recommendations in Appendix I, attached.\n\n14. **Seven Islands Residential School**, P.Q.\n\nThis request has been under consideration for some time and surveys have been made by the Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for Quebec, the Supervisor of Vocational Training and our Educational Survey Officer. A memorandum has been sent to the Lands and Development Services Branch for the preparation of plans for a school to educate 100 residential school pupils and 60 day school pupils. A sum has been included in our estimates for its construction and the project now awaits the completion of the necessary plans.\n\nIn addition to these projects there have also been representations for the rebuilding of the following R.C. Schools:\n\n15. **Cariboo Residential School**, Williams Lake, B.C.\n\nThis is an old and dangerous building. You will find my recommendation in Appendix J attached.\n\n16. **Ermensekine Residential School**, (Hobbs Agency, Alberta)\n\nThis also is a frame building which now presents a serious fire hazard. You will find my recommendations in Appendix K attached.\n\nThere have been a few other requests but these have mainly been already satisfied by the erection of day schools in the last two years.\n\nWhile it is relatively easy to decide on the need for, the positioning of, and other matters relating to the building of a day school, it is not possible to have one official make such decisions concerning a residential school. Often we place an unfair responsibility on our field officials in requesting recommendations from them concerning representations received for the building of such schools. I therefore feel that in order to fairly assess the\neducational needs of the Indians concerned, educational survey committees should be formed as fast finding bodies to present a report to the Department on each request for a residential school. The costs of such committees would be small and would be amply justified in view of the large expenditures of public funds involved in the building of the many residential schools requested.\n\nI feel that we must always keep in mind the fact that the erection of a residential school is but an initial item in contributing to the high cost of educating an Indian child in one of these schools. The present per capita rate is high and will probably continue to be so. In erecting one of these schools, we are therefore committing the Canadian taxpayer to an outlay of public funds over a period of 30 or 40 years to come. Due to the present Vote distribution, it is difficult to ascertain exactly the cost of educating an Indian child at a residential school as compared with educating an Indian child at a day school. However, I have detailed one of my officials to obtain such information so that we will have exact figures to present to you in the near future.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, March 12, 1949.\n\nRe: One Room Indian Day School with Teachers' Quarters. (Index No. 888)\n\nAs requested in your memorandum of February 15th, we are sending today, under separate cover, 120 copies of plans for the above school.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nT.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDIRECTOR LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nIndian Education Building Projects 1949-50\n\nOur 1949-50 Estimates have recently been finalized, and I am now in a position to provide you with information concerning our Education votes. As you are aware, the building of schools is still occupying high priority in the policies of this Branch. We have had considerable correspondence with you this winter concerning specific projects, and I attach for your information the various items submitted by our Education Division.\n\nResidential Schools:\n\n(1) Seven Islands - We have already corresponded with you concerning this project and would ask that this be given top priority as soon as the Tealin plans are finalized.\n\n(2) Norway House Residential School - The size of this building has yet to be determined, but we will submit our proposals to you immediately a decision is reached.\n\n(3) Thunderchild Residential School - An Educational Survey Committee is expected to visit the reserves of the Battleford Agency in order to determine our educational requirements. Our recommendations will be submitted at a later date.\n\n(4) Lac La Ronge - This project is still the subject of correspondence between this office and the Bishop of Saskatchewan and the Provincial Department of Education. It is expected that a dormitory block somewhat similar to that now under erection at Wabasca will be required.\n(5) Hay Lakes - This project has been the subject of previous correspondence and meetings.\n\n(6) Sabacon (C.E.) - This project is now under erection and we have included an amount for its completion.\n\n(7) Alert Bay classroom block - It is Mr. Indian Commissioner Arnell's intention to submit plans for the erection of a classroom block at this school similar to the day school block erected recently from surplus Army buildings from Fort Ardy. You can anticipate a request for cooperation in this project when we hear further from Mr. Arnell.\n\n(8) Alberni Residential School - We are in correspondence with Mr. Indian Commissioner Arnell concerning educational requirements at this school and will submit a separate memorandum on this project.\n\n(9) Cariboo Residential School - A memorandum was sent recently concerning our plans for this school and little action can be taken until your heating engineer has reported on our proposals. We would ask that his visit to this school be given priority.\n\n(10) Teslin Residential School - It is anticipated that tenders will soon be called for the construction of this building.\n\nDay Schools:\n\nIn accordance with our previous agreement, we are proceeding with the building of one and two-room schools under Branch arrangements. This is placing a great burden on the Education Division, and I find that these officials are spending too much time in carrying out a day school building program and not sufficient time on other educational matters which should receive their attention. It is a source of some concern to me to find trained educators occupied almost exclusively in a construction program and in correspondence over contracts, progress payments, etc., rates, orders for bills of materials, etc. The responsibility of building these schools was taken over at a time when there was a shortage of staff in your Engineering and Construction Division. It was thought that this shortage was a temporary situation but such has not proven to be the case.\nFor the past two years all one and two-room day schools have been built, therefore, by our Education Division whose staff has remained the same and whose normal correspondence has increased greatly as a result of the new schools thus opened.\n\nThe projects listed below are those for which we will require technical and other assistance.\n\n(1) Whitefish Bay - We have asked that this school be built entirely by your branch and presume that tenders will be called in the near future.\n\n(2) The Pas - It may be necessary to request visits from one of your engineers during the construction of this two-room school. We found that this arrangement worked satisfactorily last year at Lake St. Martin and at Barree.\n\n(3) File Hills - We anticipate that a request will be made for a supervisory visit from an engineer during the course of erection of this school.\n\n(4) British Columbia two-room schools -\n   (a) Fort Babine\n   (b) Cape Mudge\n   (c) Hartley Bay\n   (d) Laxalasp\n   (e) Kincolith\n\nThe demand in British Columbia is definitely on the erection of day schools, and you will note that our building program here is a large one. It is anticipated that we will have to request supervisory visits from an engineer for the above projects. We are in correspondence with Indian Commissioner Arnell concerning these two-room schools, and a memorandum will be sent to you soon listing our requirements.\n\n(5) In addition to the above projects we will be requesting a sum in the Supplementary Estimates for a two-room school at Thunderchild in the Battleford agency in Saskatchewan.

We will advise you when this matter has been settled.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDIRECTOR LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nIndian Education Building Projects 1949-50\n\nOttawa, March 14, 1949.\n\nOur 1949-50 Estimates have recently been finalized, and I am now in a position to provide you with information concerning our Education votes. As you are aware, the building of schools is still occupying high priority in the policies of this Branch. We have had considerable correspondence with you this winter concerning specific projects, and I attach for your information the various items submitted by our Education Division.\n\nResidential Schools:\n\n(1) Seven Islands - We have already corresponded with you concerning this project and would ask that this be given top priority as soon as the Tealin plans are finalized.\n\n(2) Norway House Residential School - The size of this building has yet to be determined, but we will submit our proposals to you immediately a decision is reached.\n\n(3) Thunderchild Residential School - An Educational Survey Committee is expected to visit the reserves of the Battleford agency in order to determine our educational requirements. Our recommendations will be submitted at a later date.\n\n(4) Lac La Ronge - This project is still the subject of correspondence between this office and the Bishop of Saskatchewan and the Provincial Department of Education. It is expected that a dormitory block somewhat similar to that now under erection at Wabasso will be required.\n(5) Hay Lakes - This project has been the subject of previous correspondence and meetings.\n\n(6) Wabasca (C.E.) - This project is now under erection and we have included an amount for its completion.\n\n(7) Alert Bay classroom block - It is Mr. Indian Commissioner Arnell's intention to submit plans for the erection of a classroom block at this school similar to the day school block erected recently from surplus Army buildings from Fort Iardy. You can anticipate a request for cooperation in this project when we hear further from Mr. Arnell.\n\n(8) Alberni Residential School - We are in correspondence with Mr. Indian Commissioner Arnell concerning educational requirements at this school and will submit a separate memorandum on this project.\n\n(9) Cariboo Residential School - A memorandum was sent recently concerning our plans for this school and little action can be taken until your heating engineer has reported on our proposals. We would ask that his visit to this school be given priority.\n\n(10) Teslin Residential School - It is anticipated that tenders will soon be called for the construction of this building.\n\nDay Schools:\n\nIn accordance with our previous agreement, we are proceeding with the building of one and two-room schools under Branch arrangements. This is placing great burden on the Education Division, and I find that these officials are spending too much time in carrying out a school building program and not sufficient time on other educational matters which should receive their attention. It is a source of some concern to me to find trained educators occupied almost exclusively in a construction program and in correspondence over contracts, progress payments, rate rates, orders for bills of materials, etc. The responsibility of building these schools was taken over at a time when there was a shortage of staff in your Engineering and Construction Division. It was thought that this shortage was a temporary situation but such has not proven to be the case.\nFor the past two years all one and two-room day schools have been built, therefore, by our Education Division whose staff has remained the same and whose normal correspondence has increased greatly as a result of the new schools thus opened.\n\nThe projects listed below are those for which we will require technical and other assistance.\n\n(1) Whitefish Bay - We have asked that this school be built entirely by your Branch and presume that tenders will be called in the near future.\n\n(2) The Pas - It may be necessary to request visits from one of your engineers during the construction of this two-room school. We found that this arrangement worked satisfactorily last year at Lake St. Martin and at Sarcee.\n\n(3) File Hills - We anticipate that a request will be made for a supervisory visit from an engineer during the course of erection of this school.\n\n(4) British Columbia two-room schools -\n   (a) Fort Babine\n   (b) Cape Mudge\n   (c) Hartley Bay\n   (d) Mackenzie\n   (e) Kincolith\n\nThe emphasis in British Columbia is definitely on the erection of day schools, and you will note that our building program here is a large one. It is anticipated that we will have to request supervisory visits from an engineer for the above projects. We are in correspondence with Indian Commissioner Arnell concerning these two-room schools, and a memorandum will be sent to you soon listing our requirements.\n\n(5) In addition to the above projects we will be requesting a sum in the Supplementary Estimates for a two-room school at Thunderchild in the Battleford Agency in Saskatchewan. We will require supervisory visits from an engineer at this project also. We will advise you when this matter has been settled.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, March 15, 1969.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH,\nOne-Room Indian Day School with Teacher's Quarters,\nIndex No. 888.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of 120 copies of plans for the above school. It is noted from your memorandum of March 5 that drawings are being prepared for a store-room/toilet building to be erected in connection with this type of school.\n\nDirector.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note: INR/EM]\nOttawa, 15th March, 1949.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDirector, Lands & Development Services Branch\n\nRe: Plans for Indian Day Schools\n\nCould we please be provided with the following plans and specifications:\n\n(1) Index #865 - One-room Indian Day School with teacher's quarters (electricity and running water).\n\n(2) Index #890 - One-room Indian Day School.\n\n(3) Index #738 - Two-room Indian Day School.\n\nWe will require twenty of each of the above sets.\n\nBEN / ST\n\nDirector.\n18th March, 1949.\n\nMr. J.

We now submit a further amendment.\n\nThe amounts requested in Section 1 apply to schools owned by the Church of England, and the transfers requested will allow us to complete all expenditures at these schools for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nThe amounts requested in Sections 2 and 3 transfer funds from certain residential schools owned by the Roman Catholic Church to other residential schools owned by the same Church. Most of the amounts are small and will allow us to complete all expenditures at these schools for the fiscal year 1948-49. The large amounts being transferred to Akilavik R.C. Residential School will permit making payment of the amount authorized by the Minister in Memorandum dated March 16th, 1949. There are funds available to meet the expenditure authorized at the Fort Resolution R.C. Residential School, and consequently, it is only necessary to transfer funds to the Akilavik R.C. Residential School.\n\nPP/ST Director.\nApril 8th, 1949.\n\nFOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL:\n\nApproval of the transfer of funds included in P.C. 45/3600 of August 13th, 1948, for the purchase and maintenance of equipment, repairs and improvements at church-owned Residential Schools: $293.76 to Fort George C.E.

LOW FIRST COST\n\nSteelox Buildings give you the many economies of all-steel standardized construction, yet are readily adaptable to your specific needs. Material costs are less because the patented Steelox\u00ae Section provides both structural support and finished surface. For sidewalls it saves framing and exterior covering. On the roof it replaces rafters, sheathing and exterior covering.\n\n2. LOW INSTALLED COST\n\nOn permanent installations you will probably want a poured concrete foundation. Where the building location is temporary, masonry blocks or even wooden sills will do. Then a few unskilled laborers, using ordinary tools, easily assemble the building by following the instructions that come with each structure. The work moves fast and labor costs are low. Armco\u00ae Steelox Sections are light in weight and nestable to save on handling and transportation.\n\n3. LOW MAINTENANCE COST\n\nSteelox construction assures long life and low upkeep. There is nothing to get out of order\u2014nothing to crack, warp or rot. The unique Steelox joint keeps these buildings looking trim and youthful. About the only maintenance required is an occasional painting. Even here you save money because paint lasts longer on the special Armco Galvanized Paintcoat Steel. It has a zinc coating especially Bonderized to take and hold paint. No acid staining or weathering.\n\n*Residential & Office Furnishings\nOrder the exact building you need\n\nChoose your Steelex Building from a wide range of standard sizes. There are so many combinations that you are sure to find the exact building you want. Doors and windows are available in a wide variety of types and sizes and may be placed wherever you need them. Conventional materials for insulation against heat or cold can be used. Interior finishing and other special details can be done the same as for any other building.\n\nMeets changing conditions\n\nChanging conditions never catch you flatfooted when you own an Armco Steelex Building. After years of use as a permanent building, the entire structure can be quickly dismantled and moved to a new location without loss of material. It can readily be expanded or adapted to a new use. If you need more room the building can easily be extended with standard parts obtainable at any time. Loosen the base angle and unclamp the panels permits changing doors and windows. Obsolescence is never a problem when you build with Steelex.\n\nExceptionally weathertight\n\nWith all their flexibility of construction, Armco Steelex Buildings remain sturdily rigid and weathertight. Even buildings that have been moved several times are tight and dry. The patented Steelex joint withstands expansion, contraction and unequal settlement\u2014cannot open up or pull apart. There are no nails to work loose\u2014no holes in the covering.\n\nFire-resistant\n\nThe all-metal construction is fire-resistant and can be made lightning-safe by grounding opposite corners. Lightning rods are not needed.\n\nOther money-saving features\n\nEvery feature of Armco Steelex Buildings is designed to save you time, trouble and money. For example, individual Steelex Sections are made of 18 gauge or 20 gauge galvanized Paintless steel. This is 2 or 3 times heavier than ordinary corrugated galvanized roofing and siding used on many Industrial buildings. Long life is assured. Tight construction keeps out rain and other pests. Storms hold little danger because these buildings are designed to withstand wind velocities in excess of 75 miles per hour. Insurance rates are therefore low.\n\nYou will always be proud of your Steelex Building. It stays neat and attractive through the years. Thousands of installations have proved their value. A partial list of users will be found inside the back pocket. Check this and other data given in this folder\u2014then mail the enclosed postage-free card for additional information.\n\nEasy-to-handle roof panels are dropped into place and held securely by the eave plate and ridge construction. The job is simple and done quickly.\n\nWindow and door openings are no problem. Short wall panels are used in place of the regular panels. They are set in place and fastened the same as other panels to frame the opening.\n\nAttaching the top plate is simply a matter of placing it in position. A single hook-bolt fastens each joint.\nStandard ARMCO STEELOX Buildings are made of specially-designed steel panels having a uniformly high strength/weight ratio. Panels are interchangeable.\n\n**STANDARD DIMENSIONS**\n\nSteelex Buildings are available in any of the following heights, widths and lengths to meet individual needs:\n\n- **HEIGHTS:** 8'-0\", 10'-0\", 12'-0\", 14'-0\" (Height not to exceed width)\n- **WIDTHS:** 8'-0\", 12'-0\", 16'-0\", 20'-0\", 24'-0\", 28'-0\"\n- **LENGTHS:** Any desired length up to 200 feet or more in increments of 16' (Length should never be less than width)\n\n---\n\n**WINDOWS**\n\n- **#822**\n- **#824**\n- **#82140**\n- **#824141**\n\n**NON-VENTILATED**  \n**HORIZONTAL PIVOTED**  \n**COMMERCIAL PROJECTED**\n\n---\n\n**DOORS**\n\n- **Single swing \u2014 Hollow metal, industrial type.

B. F. Neary, Superintendent\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe wish to thank you for the courtesy extended to us on our call last Wednesday re Armco Steelox Buildings for schools, also for a print of plan 888 sheet 1/1.\n\nWe will study this with the idea of adapting Steelox construction to your requirements.\n\nThe next day we called on Mr. T. S. Mills in connection with our other products and had an opportunity to meet Mr. C. Buck with whom we also discussed Steelox.\n\nWe believe we left a copy of Assembly Instructions with you and intend sending one also to Mr. Buck.\n\nThe location of the school in North York, about which you inquired, is at Newtonbrook between Lansing and Thornhill on No. 11 Highway. The school is the Golding Memorial School and is on Drewry Avenue just west of the Highway. The Steelox construction 24' x 76' x 12' high was just an addition to the present school and probably wouldn't give you a very good idea of the appearance of a complete school.\n\nHowever there is a complete school at Richvale about one-half mile south of Richmond Hill on No. 11. This is a two room school 24' x 80' x 12' about 300 yds. west of the Highway.\n\nWe would be pleased to have you look at these, particularly at Richvale.\n\nWe are also mailing you our general catalogue for your information.\nApril 11th, 1949.\n\nEducation Service, Indian Affairs Branch\n\nWe will be pleased to give you any information we can on any of our products.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nARMCO DRAINAGE & METAL PRODUCTS OF CANADA LTD.,\n\nG.H.Chalmers/eb\n\nP.S. - If you know who was responsible for finding my gloves in your department and mailing them to me here, please tell them it was greatly appreciated.

However, during the galvanizing process, a thin layer of asbestos felt is pressed into the molten zinc (galvanizing). This layer is impregnated with a special saturant and seal coat after which the sheets are corrugated and formed into pipe.\n\nA bituminous pavement is applied to the lower one-fourth of the pipe to a thickness of at least \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch over the crest of the corrugations. The pipe may then be given a full coating of the same bituminous material.\n\nUSES\nWherever utmost durability is required and wherever the soil or contents of the pipe are highly corrosive to galvanized metal. Also economical for normal conditions where long life is a factor. This may be for highway, railway or industrial drainage, levee openings, subdrains, storm and sanitary sewers, ocean outfalls, siphons, etc.\n\nTABLE 1: Diameters, Gages and Approximate Weights of Asbestos-Bonded Pipe\n\n| Diameter in Inches | Gage* | Approx.

The pipe also meets the need for strong, watertight joints and flexibility to resist disjoining on a shifting foundation.\n\nCUTS MAINTENANCE COSTS\nView of 60-in. Asbestos-Bonded Pipe being installed on unstable foundation. Where rigid structures are likely to undermine or disjoin, this flexible corrugated metal pipe requires no maintenance or early replacement.\n\nACCEPTANCE:\nIndustrial plants, railway engineers, cities, U.S. engineers and highway departments specify Asbestos-Bonded Pipe for severe conditions as well as for normal conditions where long life is a factor.\n\nLITERATURE REFERENCES:\nHandbook of Culvert and Drainage Practice\nARMCO Sewer Book\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nCorrugated metal pipe of standard riveted construction is supplied in diameters from 8 to 96 inches. (See Table 1.) The proper gage to use depends on diameter, depth of fill, and kind of traffic.\n\nStandard lengths are in multiples of 2 feet, with shipping facilities governing the maximum length. From 20 to 36-foot lengths can easily be handled with ropes and skids. For each coupling hand, the line gains \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inches in length.\n\nGalvanizing of 2 ounces per square foot, (total on both sides), protects against corrosion. Where needed, the pipe is provided with a bituminous paved invert to resist wear; for the most severe corrosive conditions, an asbestos-bonded coating can be supplied.\n\nUSES:\n1. Culverts\n2.

Flexibility and reasonable care in installation enable corrugated metal pipe to resist crushing, cracking and dislocating under high fills, impact and vibration of heavy loads, poor foundations, shifting soils, undermining and frost action.\n\nEASY, SPEEDY INSTALLATION. Light weight, long sections, fewer joints and simple couplings make for quick, economical installation. Detours are kept at a minimum, and the pipe can be put in in any weather. Only a few small tools are needed.\n\nDURABILITY. ARMCO Ingot Iron Culverts have been serving for more than a third of a century (since 1906). They outlast the road, but can often be salvaged and re-used.\n\nACCEPTANCE:\nCorrugated metal pipe is used for the highest type of engineering construction\u2014by the railroads under main line tracks\u2014under superhighways and low cost roads; for sanitary sewers under main paved streets; under levees and dams.\n\nLITERATURE REFERENCES:\nHandbook of Culvert and Drainage Practice\nARMCO Drainage Calculator\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nPaved Invert Pipe is the same as galvanized corrugated metal pipe (standard riveted construction) with the addition of a bituminous pavement. It is supplied in diameters from 8 to 96 inches. (See Table 1.)\n\nStandard lengths are in multiples of 2 feet, with 20 feet being most common. For each coupling band, the line gains 2\u00bd inches in length.\n\nThe thick pavement in the bottom, applied at the fabricating plants, consists of a special bituminous material which fills the corrugations in the invert of the pipe (about the lower \u00bc) and covers the crest of the corrugations to a minimum depth of \u00bd inch.

Wherever erosion is a factor or where superior durability is desired because of safety or replacement costs\nADVANTAGES OF PAVED INVERT PIPE\n\nEROSION RESISTANCE\u2014DURABILITY\u2014ECONOMY. In the ordinary drainage situation, first carrying silt and water, failure will come first where the wear is heaviest. Yet the greater part of the structure may still be in good condition.\n\nThe logical new bottomless design\u2014and in the Asco Paved Invert Pipe above the smooth bituminous pavement will make the bottom last as long as the top. Even under the most abnormal service conditions, the life of the pipe is increased sufficiently to more than justify the cost.\n\nFLEXIBILITY\u2014STRENGTH. Under high fills, where corrosion might disintegrate or poor foundations might otherwise mean short life and expensive replacement, flexible Asco Paved Invert Pipe gives added life and economy. The use of a 60-inch Paved Invert Pipe under a high fill on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.\n\nACCEPTANCE:\nPaved Invert Pipe is used under superhighways and low cost roads where erosion is a factor; under main line railways; for sewers; levee culverts, and other uses.\n\nLITERATURE REFERENCES:\nHandbook of Culvert and Drainage Practice\nAsco Drainage Calculator\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nThere are two types of Perforated Corrugated Pipe, Hel-Cor and riveted. Hel-Cor, with helical corrugations and folded and locked seams, is most commonly used and comes in 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18 and 21-inch diameters in 18 and 16 gage galvanized Ingot Iron or steel. Bituminous coatings and paved invert can be added.\n\nRiveted Perforated Pipe comes in 8 to 30-inch diameters in 16 and 14 gage galvanized iron or steel. This type can be supplied with paved invert and asbestos-bonded coating.\n\nTwo or more rows of 5/16-inch perforations in the lower quarters are separated by an unperforated area.\n\nPipe comes in any lengths, usually 20-feet.\n\nUSES: SUBDRAINAGE\n\n1. Soft spots in roadbed\n2. Wet cuts and backslopes\n3. Frost boils and heaving\n4. Landslides and slips\n5. Grade crossings\n6. Yards and terminals\n7. Airport runways and other areas\n8. Recreational areas\n9. Retaining walls\n10. Infiltration galleries and well casings\n11. Dams and levees\nADVANTAGES OF PERFORATED METAL PIPE\n\nSTRENGTH AND EASE OF INSTALLATION: A small crew can lay long sections of perforated pipe in a trench or on an embankment by hand. The corrugated design gives the pipe strength to resist the impact of heavy vehicles or other traffic. Long lengths with strong couplings ensure continuous service.\n\nNO CLOGGING: Cross-section of intersecting subdrain with perforated pipe outlet. The use of graded backfill or \"filter\" material ranging from 1/2-inch down to fine sand keeps silt from clogging the pipe. The perforation admits very little backfill material.\n\nEFFECTIVE DRAINAGE: View showing perforated pipe being installed on an intersecting drain on a highway ditch; end view of perforated pipe which kept water pockets in a railroad fill.\n\nACCEPTANCE: Principal railroads use perforated metal pipe to stabilize roadbeds for high-speed trains; highways, low-cost roads, city streets, industrial areas, airports, dams and levees, and other important uses.\n\nLITERATURE REFERENCES:\nHandbook of Culvert and Drainage Practice\nAirport Drainage Manual\n\nARMCO MULTI PLATE PIPE\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nMULTI PLATE plates are curved, corrugated, delivered to the job knocked down, and bolted together by unskilled labor with ordinary wrenches. For standard diameters, see Table No. 1.\n\nThe plates are approximately 52 and 72 inches wide by 6 and 8 ft. long. Corrugations are 6 x 1 1/2 inches. Gages range from No. 12 to No. 1 (9-32-in.).\n\nPlates are supplied in ARMCO Ingot Iron or steel, heavily galvanized. Added durability for the bottom of the pipe is provided by using heavier gages or adding a bituminous pavement applied in the field according to special instructions. Joints can be made watertight for operation under low heads.\n\nUSES:\n1. Large culverts, sewers, stream enclosures\n2. Small bridge replacements\n3. Reinforcing existing culverts or large sewers\n4.

Very little equipment is required for its installation. ARMCO pioneered this type of construction.\nADVANTAGES OF MULTI PLATE PIPE\n\nAMPLE STRENGTH. For large openings and under low or high fills, the flexibility of MULTI PLATE assures the needed strength. It functions the same as riveted corrugated pipe. Both strengths assure salvageability in case of changing conditions. This photo is of a 15-foot diameter culvert.\n\nQUICKLY INSTALLED. Unskilled labor can easily bolt the interchangeable sections together in any weather. Detour time is shorter. There is little or no maintenance.\n\nACCEPTANCE: MULTI PLATE Pipe is used under main-line railroads, superhighways, low-cost roads, city streets, dams and levees.\n\nLITERATURE REFERENCES:\n- MULTI PLATE Design Manual\n- ARMCO MULTI PLATE Bulletin\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nMULTI PLATE plates are curved, corrugated, and delivered to the job knocked down.

Relining or extending existing culverts and bridges\n4. Conduits\n5. Underpasses for pedestrians or live stock\nADVANTAGES OF MULTI PLATE ARCHES\n\nLOW CLEARANCE. The arch type of structure is ideally suited to low headroom requirements. In addition the MULTI PLATE arch is the finished \"form\" and requires no encasement, no curing time. It has strength to resist live load, impact and vibration. Headwalls can be simple yet effective. The two views above show before and after replacement of an old bridge.\n\nRELINING. Complete replacement of failing old arches or bases can be avoided by threading an ARMCO MULTI PLATE arch inside the structure and grouting or backfilling between the two.\n\nACCEPTANCE:\nMULTI PLATE arches are used under main line railroads, superhighways, low cost roads, city streets, parks and other locations.\n\nLITERATURE REFERENCES:\nMULTI PLATE Design Manual\nHandbook of Culvert and Drainage Practice\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nSpecial heavy presses form the Pipe-Arch from riveted galvanized corrugated metal pipe. It becomes a broad arch with a slightly curved bottom. See the accompanying Table 1 for sizes and weights.\n\nStandard lengths are in multiples of 2 feet, with 20 feet as an average. For each coupling band used the line gains \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) inches in length.\n\nThe Pipe-Arch is always protected by a galvanized coating. Where needed, a bituminous paved invert is added to resist wear in the bottom\u2014usually a good investment. Where severe corrosive conditions exist an asbestos bonded coating can be furnished.\n\nUSES:\n\n1. Culverts: highways, railways, airports, street intersections, industrial plants\n2.

An ARMCO Pipe-Arch provides a low, wide waterway which insures fast, efficient run-off\u2014an especially effective structure where headroom is limited. It fits the ditch and keeps the water level down. Besides, the pipe-arch has the same superior strength as flexible, corrugated pipe.\n\nEASILY INSTALLED. Long lengths are easily handled without expensive equipment. The length of each half-arch are bolted together with a sturdy band coupler. Detours are kept to a minimum. The flat surfaces simplify cleaning if that becomes necessary. In case of changing conditions, the pipe-arch can always be salvaged and re-used.\n\nACCEPTANCE:\nRailroads, highway departments and cities prefer the Pipe-Arch for many locations.\n\nLITERATURE REFERENCES:\nSupplement A to Handbook of Culvert and Drainage Practice\nDescriptive Bulletin PO 85-41\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nCorrugated plates of three different radii are bolted together on the job to form an arch with an integral top and bottom. The plates are of three widths, approximately 33, 52 and 72 inches, and two lengths, 6 and 8 feet. Corrugations are 6 by 1\u00bd inches. Gages vary from No. 12 to 1.\n\nThe sizes shown in the accompanying Table 1 include spans from 6 to 16\u00bd feet. The lengths are any multiple of 2 feet.\n\nThe plates are of ARMCO Ingot Iron or steel with 2 oz. galvanized coating. For greater durability and resistance to erosion, the bottom plates may be of a heavier gage than the top, or may be protected with a special bituminous coating applied after installation.\n\nTABLE 1\u2014Dimensions and Recommended Minimum Gages for Improved MULTI PLATE Pipe-Arches.

HYDRAULIC EFFICIENCY. Especially on the modern streamlined roadway, the End Section blends into its surroundings. It also adds to the hydraulic efficiency of the culvert inlet and outlet.\n\nSAFETY, NO OBSTRUCTION. Headwalls that protrude above the roadway are a hazard to fast moving traffic, as well as an obstruction to moving machines and snow plows. The ARMCO End Section avoids both these objections.\n\nEXTENSIONS, SPEED, ECONOMY. When roads are widened or relocated, ARMCO End Sections can be salvaged and reinstalled. Installation is fast, requiring only a few watchers and no concrete mixer or other equipment. They are economical.\n\nACCEPTANCE: State and county highway departments have used End Sections extensively. Others are adopting them.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nCalco and Hardesty Water Control Gates come in a wide variety of types, models, sizes and materials. Some of these are for use in connection with corrugated metal pipe, while others are for attaching to concrete headwalls of drainage and outlet structures.\n\nTypes: Included are simple flap gates, small slide gates pushed up and down by hand, slide headgates operated with a handwheel or crank, metergates for measuring irrigation water, radial type gates, and roller bearing gates.\n\nModels and Sizes: There are 27 models with sizes ranging from 8 inches to 120 inches in diameter, and from 12 inches to 96 inches square; radial gates up to 20 feet wide. These gates are capable of withstanding face pressures from a few feet up to 50 feet. See Table 1 for further details on models and sizes.\n\nMaterials: For simple irrigation ditch controls, an all sheet metal gate with cast iron seat is used. Other gates and supports are of cast iron, cast steel, structural steel, or bronze to fit the service conditions.\n\nTABLE 1.

These shop-fabricated panels are load-bearing, their strength resulting from forming the edges of steel sheets into interlocking panel flanges.\n\nAssembly of Steelex into a building is accomplished by fitting the panel flanges together and then securing them to the foundation and to each other by means of suitable connection pieces and fastenings.\n\nSteelex panels are usually of 18 or 20 gage, in several widths and depths to suit the structural requirements. For exterior walls they are usually 16 inches wide. Lengths are up to 18 feet. Standard Steelex frameless buildings range up to 28 feet in width, of any length and up to 14-foot eave heights.\n\nSteelex panels are formed from ARMCO steel, with galvanized Paintgrip coating, or uncoated. All bolts, screws and fastenings are made of special hardened and coated steel.\n\nBuilding Products. Steelex panels, besides comprising the basic parts of ARMCO Metal Buildings, are available separately for roof deck and floors for building construction of other types. They are also used as forms for concrete.\n\nUSES\n\n1. SERVICE BUILDINGS: Offices, shops, warehouses, laboratories, sheds, garages\n2. HANGARS: transport and private\n3. ROOF DECK\n4. FLOORS\n5. CONCRETE FORMS\nADVANTAGES AND USES OF STEELOX CONSTRUCTION\n\nAn ARMCO Standard Steelex Building 24' x 14' x 60' in South-Western Ontario, in use as a Railroad Shop. Steelex building panels offer a fast, economical and durable method of constructing industrial and commercial buildings. Steelex erection does not require skilled labor.\n\nAnother Standard Steelex Building in Ontario used as a steel fabricating shop, is 24' x 12' x 60' high. It has a \"PANTGRAPH\" finish which can be painted immediately without any etching or weathering. These buildings are weather tight, fire resistant and lightning safe, besides being inhospitable to termites.\n\nACCEPTANCE:\nARMCO metal buildings of Steelex construction have been used for the past decade or more by highway departments, cities, railroads, airlines, oil companies, public utility companies, manufacturing plants, mining companies, contractors, the Army, Navy and Air Force, agricultural groups, schools and colleges and many other groups.\n\nLITERATURE REFERENCES:\n- Standard Steelex Buildings, 8 to 28'\n- Steelex Long-Span Roof Deck\n- Steelex Floor-Ceiling Construction\n- ARMCO Steelex T-Hangers\n- Drawings, photos, and other helps\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nAn ARMCO Bin-Type Retaining Wall is a wall composed of bins or cells bolted to columnar units at the corners, filled with earth or other material to give weight and stability.\n\nBy varying the gage (No. 16 to 10) of the stringer units which form the face and rear of the wall, a uniform bin or panel length of 10 feet is maintained, regardless of wall height. Similarly, by varying the gage (No. 16 to 12) and length (5.2 to 14.0 ft.) of the spacer units which extend from front to back of wall, single-bin construction is possible for both low and high walls.\n\nMore than thirty standard designs are available varying from 4 to 30 feet in height.\n\nThe metal parts are all heavily galvanized. For severe conditions a bituminous coating is asbestos-bonded to the metal.\n\nUSES:\n1. Serve valuable right-of-way where embankment slopes encroach on private or industrial property\u2014at grade separations, bridge wingwalls, dock areas, etc.\n2. Serve as a boundary for made land\n3. Provide stable slopes or save excessive fill as along the edge of a hillside road\n4. Prevent encroachment of streams, lakes and other bodies of water\nADVANTAGES OF BIN-TYPE RETAINING WALLS\n\nSTRENGTH and DURABILITY. These walls have ample strength to resist the buffeting of wind waves. Placed on a slight batter or slope, they resist overturning and sliding. The stiff corner columns transmit lateral thrust to the base of the wall. With a service record of 14 years to date, these walls should equal the culvert record of nearly 40 years.\n\nSPEEDY CONSTRUCTION. With a few shovels and wrenches a small crew quickly erects an all-metal bin-wall in any kind of weather. The heaviest unit weighs only 140 pounds. As erection progresses, the wall can be backfilled and put into immediate use. No curing is necessary.\n\nADAPTABILITY. An Armco Bin-Wall can be built on a curve; it can be extended, raised or lowered; and in fact can be completely disassembled for another purpose without losing its usefulness. Another advantage is the nestability of the units which conserves space in transporting and storing.\n\nACCEPTANCE:\nHundreds of installations have been made during the past 14 years by the Public Roads Administration, U.S. Corps of Engineers, state and county highway departments, railroads, municipalities, private industries and others.\n\nLITERATURE REFERENCE:\nDesign Data: Descriptive Bulletin H-37\n\nARMCO STEEL SHEETING\n\nLight-weight corrugated steel sheeting is an effective, money-saving tool on most construction jobs.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nCorrugated sheeting of light weight steel is made in two principal types, interlocking and flange with nominal covering widths of 14 and 12 inches respectively. Standard lengths are multiples of 2 feet from 6 to 20 feet or more. The sheeting comes in black steel but for permanent installations may be galvanized. A hammer whose striking parts weigh 25-10 lbs., and not over 500 blows per minute is recommended for driving. Holes are provided for pulling purposes. For the interlocking type, corner angles of various degrees can be supplied. For further details see Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1\u2014Physical Properties of ARMCO Corrugated Sheetings\n\n| Gauge | Approximate Thickness in Inches | Section-Modulus per Sheet | Weight per Linear Foot of Sheetings (lbs.) |\n|-------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|       |                                 | Interlocking               | Flange                                   |\n| 12    | 7/64                            | 0.763                     | 0.670                                    |\n| 10    | 9/64                            | 0.983                     | 0.790                                    |\n| 8     | 11/64                           | 1.204                     | 1.010                                    |\n| 6     | 13/64                           | 1.300                     | 1.155                                    |\n| 4     | 15/64                           | 1.300                     | 1.272                                    |\n| 3     | 1/4                             |                           |                                          |\n\nUSES:\n\n1.

Cutoff walls and aprons\nADVANTAGES OF ARMCO STEEL SHEETING\n\nPage 38\n\nFAST, EASY DRIVING. Closing a break in a levee with corrugated sheeting, later serving as a core wall for the permanent levee. A light hammer does the job quickly.\n\nSALVAGE AND RE-USE. ARMCO Steel sheeting is easy to pull and re-use. In many instances it has been used twice or more. It handles and stores easily.\n\nSTRENGTH, RESISTANCE TO DAMAGE. A convenient steel driving head with a corrugated slot gives protection to the driving edge of the sheeting. Even in lengths up to 30 ft., the sheeting has adequate strength. The driving can be driven to penetration before excavating.\n\nACCEPTANCE:\nUsed by contractors, railways, street and sewer departments, highway departments and others.\n\nLITERATURE REFERENCES:\nManual on ARMCO Corrugated Sheeting\nSupplement to Handbook of Culvert and Drainage Practice\n\nARMCO TUNNEL LINER PLATES\n\nPage 39\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nARMCO Tunnel Liner Plates are structural units of corrugated metal 18 inches wide, flanged along each edge, bolted together on the job. Standard tunnel liner plates are available in inside diameters ranging from $45\\frac{1}{2}$ to $397\\frac{1}{4}$ inches (33 ft.), and in gages from No. 14 to 3. The gage to be selected depends upon whether the installation is to be permanent or temporary, as well as a knowledge of local conditions, including depth and stability of overburden, and type and moisture content of soil.\n\nUSES\nThe plates may be used for new openings or for relining existing tunnels, shafts or conduits. They may serve to hold the opening until the lining can be placed. Uses include:\n\n1. Tunnels\n2. Shafts and escape ways\n3. Caissons\n4. Conduits and overcasts\n5. Mine entries and haulways\n\nAssembly is accomplished from the inside by the use of shoulder bolts held in place by spring steel clips. Comfortable seams are flanged inside to facilitate bolting from the inside.\nUSES AND ADVANTAGES OF ARMCO TUNNELS\n\nSTRENGTH, LIGHT WEIGHT, FIREPROOF. These are a few of the advantages gained by the use of ARMCO heavy-duty steel liner plates in relining this 18-ft. wide tunnel. It was covered with several inches of shotcrete and protected with asbestos-bonded blast plates.\n\nSAFETY. A stiping mine entry was built with turned lining plates, lined, with a span of 15 ft. Passageways and rooms for machines and other equipment can also be built. Another use is for conveying concrete aggregates at a central storage or mixing plant.\n\nACCEPTANCE:\nUsed by contractors, cities, railroads, highway departments, mines, industries and others.\n\nLITERATURE REFERENCE:\nARMCO Tunnel Liner Manual\nSupplement to Handbook of Culvert and Drainage Practice\n\nNO HEAVY EQUIPMENT. Individual plates are light and readily bolted together. A minimum of excavation is required. Tunnels of this kind are an improvement over open trenches for sewers, water mains, tunnels, underpasses and the like. No need to blockade streets, tracks or roads.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nThe services of a construction organization, experienced in the special features of drainage and underground work, is available to contractors or other users of Armco products. Its principal function is to efficiently install Armco Drainage and other metal products, although their experience and competence does not limit them to this.\n\nJACKING 80 ft. of 36\" corrugated pipe under the main tracks of a principal railroad without interference to heavy and fast traffic. The Construction Department has jacked hundreds of pipes 36\" to 84\" in diameter, and in lengths to 200 ft.\u2014for culverts, underpasses and conduits.\n\nNO HEAVY EQUIPMENT. Individual plates are light and readily bolted together. A minimum of excavation is required. Tunnels of this kind are an improvement over open trenching for sewers, water lines, conduits, underpasses and the like. No need to blockade streets, tracks or roads.\n\nDrainage surveys and investigation of the causes of early slides, and installing drainage where feasible, to effect a cure, are examples of work frequently performed. Often contractors sublet the difficult drainage part of their work to the Construction Department of Armco Drainage & Metal Products of Canada Ltd. Estimates and quotations are made without obligation.\n\nKINDS OF JOBS\n1 Jacking Pipe\n2 Threading Pipe\n3 Arch Lining\n4 Subdrainage (surveys, plans, installation)\n5 Tunneling\n6 MULTI PLATE Erection\n7 Retaining Wall Erection\n8 Miscellaneous\nSUBDRAINAGE. Plan view of drainage system installed in railway yard. This is only one of many satisfactory jobs of this kind accomplished at substantial savings for railroads and others. Surveys can also be made.\n\nARCH LINING. Large arches that are failing can be returned to usefulness by relining with MULTI PLATE Arch.\n\nTUNNELLING. Whether for constructing new openings or relining existing tunnels, the Construction Department has had wide experience. At the right is shown a permanent underground utility tunnel installed for an industrial plant in Quebec.\n\nERECTING MULTI PLATE. Installing a twin 16 ft diameter MULTI PLATE pipe under a railway trestle. Other jobs have been on sewers, stream enclosures, siphons, and conduits for cities, industries and highway dept's.\n\nRETAINING WALL ERECTION. This is another type of work economically handled by the Construction Department of AMCO. Other jobs consist of heavy bridging over railroad rail and miscellaneous construction.\n\nACCEPTANCE:\nA long list of contractors, railroads, cities, attest the acceptable work done by this highway departments and industrial concerns Department.\n\nLITERATURE REFERENCE:\nNine Construction Services, a booklet\n\nINDEX\n\nA\nAbutment Drainage .............. 7, 17\nAggregate Tunnels ............... 39\nAir Lines ......................... 29, 31\nAprons ........................... 19\nArches\u2014Multi Plate ............... 15\n\u2014Pipe, Riveted .................. 13\n\u2014Pipe, Multi Plate .............. 15\nArea Ways ......................... 23\n\nB\nBridge Deck Irving Open Mesh 25, 26\nBridge\u2014Small ..................... 3, 9, 11, 15\nBuildings\u2014Metal .................. 33\n\nC\nCatch Basins ...................... 3\nCatch Basin Covers ............... 23\nChecks\u2014Ditch .................... 37\nConcrete Forms ................... 33\nConduits ......................... 39\nConnections and Fittings\u2014\nCorrugated Pipe .................. 17\nWelded Steel ..................... 99\nConstruction Service .......... 41\nCovers\u2014Manhole and Catch Basin 25\nCulverts .......................... 1 to 19\nCut-off Wells ..................... 37\n\nD\nDecking Bridge\u2014Irving Open Mesh 95\nDesign and Engineering Service 41\nDitch Checks ..................... 37\nDown Spouts ...................... 99\nDrain\u2014Tee ....................... 7\nDredge Pipe ...................... 99\n\nE\nEnd Sections ..................... 19\nEngineering Service and Design 41\n\nF\nFittings and Connections\u2014\nCorrugated Pipe .................. 17\nWelded Steel Pipe ............... 99\nFloor\u2014Open Steel ............... 83, 94\nFlumes .......................... 1-6\nFoundation Piling ............... 99\nFoundation Sheeting ............. 37\nFuel Supply Lines ............... 31\n\nG\nGarages .......................... 33\nGates\u2014Water Control .......... 21\nGas Lines ......................... 31\nGrating\u2014Open Steel ............. 23, 24\nGuard Rail ....................... 27, 28\n\nH\nHangars .......................... 33\n\nI\nLand Drainage Outlets .......... 7\n\nJ\nManholes .......................... 1\nManhole Covers .................. 95\n\nK\nOffice Buildings ................. 33\nOil Lines ......................... 31\n\nL\nPiers and Abutments ............. 37\nPipe\u2014\nCorrugated, Asbestos Bonded 1\nGalvanized ....................... 2\nHelcor .......................... 7\nMulti Plate ...................... 9\n\nM\nEnd Sections ..................... 19\nFittings and Connections\u2014\nSpiral Welded ................... 29\n\u2014Pipe, Dovetail ................. 29\n\u2014Pontoon ....................... 99\n\u2014Shore ......................... 99\n\nN\nPipe Arches\u2014Multi Plate ......... 15\n\u2014Riveted ......................... 13\n\nO\nPiling\u2014Foundation ............... 29\nPiling Sheet ...................... 37\nPlant Piping ..................... 90\nPump Houses .................... 33\n\nP\nRetaining Walls .................. 35\nRoof Deck ....................... 33\n\nQ\nSections\u2014End ..................... 19\nService\u2014Engineering and\nConstruction ..................... 41\nSewers\u2014Storm 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13, 15\nSanitary .......................... 1\n\nR\nSheeds ............................ 33\nSheeting ......................... 37\nSiphons ........................... 1, 99\nSnow Rollers ..................... 3\nSpillways or\nOutlets 17, 21, 3, 13, 37, 35\nStair Treads\u2014Steel ............. 23, 24\nSteelox ........................... 33\nSteps\u2014Steel ...................... 93, 94\nSteam ............................ 3\nEnclosures 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13, 15\nSubdrainage ...................... 7\nSupply Lines ...................... 99, 31\n\nT\nToe Drains ....................... 7\nTool Houses ...................... 33\nTrench Covers .................... 35\nTunnels .......................... 39\nTunnel Liner Plates ............. 39\n\nU\nUnderdrains ...................... 7\nUnderpasses ...................... 11, 3, 5, 9\nWarehouses ...................... 33\nWater Supply .................... 99\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nSELED TENDERS addressed to the Director, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada, and endorsed \"Tenders for Indian Day School(s)\", will be received until noon on , 1949, for the construction by contract of :\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nContractors shall tender in complete accordance with the relevant drawings, specifications, and tendering documents supplied by the Department of Mines and Resources.

B. Neary,\nSupervisor of Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nWe have received from our Ontario dealer a final quotation for the one-room Indian Day School and Teachers' Living Quarters, in accordance with the set of drawings prepared by ourselves based on your drawing #888.\n\nIt is estimated that this building will cost $10,633.00 complete, erected in Deseronto, or, Alexandria, Ontario. This figure is higher than what I indicated last week in Ottawa, but it appears the dealer was originally basing his quotation on his own rough drawings based on drawing #888, and which did not include a concrete wall three feet above grade.\n\nOur Alberta dealer has quoted the sum of $10,296.00, our Saskatchewan dealer $10,600.00.\n\nIn all of the foregoing cases, the price is based on a six inch floating concrete slab with whatever floor finish desired by yourself, storage cupboards beneath the sidewall blackboard, a cedar siding frontwall.\n\nWe have here a letter of acceptance from the Federal Housing Authority of the United States which we will gladly forward to you, if required.\n\nFurther to the two schools for the James Bay area, the dealers wish to contract for the same on a cost plus fixed fee basis because of unpredictable labour costs in that area. The Stirling Construction Company are building close by and would contract for the concrete work. Their plant and equipment being located there would reduce costs in transportation of the same, including labour.\n\nOur district office maintains an engineering and construction\n\nMANUFACTURERS OF QUONSET BUILDINGS & STRAN-STEEL FRAMING\nadvisory service able to provide all necessary information and help to fulfil your needs. We supervise our dealers, seven in number throughout Canada. Stran-Steel dealers have their own fabrication shops, erection and general construction crews, and carry a sizeable stock of buildings at all times. That means that no matter what site location you select, you are assured of fine engineering, perfect construction methods and service year in and year out.\n\nControl of sources from ore mines to finished steel means that our Company or our dealers need not depend on other sources for component building parts. Dealers can furnish and erect Quonset buildings by the time footings are cured. Weather permitting, these buildings would be ready for occupancy from thirty to sixty days from the date of your order.\n\nThese Quonset buildings, as designed, will have an appearance of which any local community will be proud. The insulation provided (which is comparable to 18 inches of masonry) will make the buildings comfortable in summer and winter.\n\nHoping to see you in the near future, we remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nGREAT LAKES STEEL CORPORATION\nSTRAN-STEEL DIVISION\n\nJNH:LG\nJ.

If possible, 25 to 30 foot candles of illumination should be provided. They further provide that the glass area of all classrooms shall equal one fifth of the floor area of the rooms.

COUSINS\nLIGHTING ENGINEER\nTHE HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER COMMISSION\nOF ONTARIO\nTHE CLASSROOM AND ITS VISUAL TASKS\n\nBy GEORGE G. COUSINS\n\nLighting Engineer\n\nThe Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario\n\nFor many years there has been an increasing consciousness of the importance of good seeing conditions in schools. It has been obvious that there is an increasing percentage of children wearing glasses as they progress from grade to grade (see Fig. 1). More parents are concerned about the welfare of their children. Public Officers of Health realize that defective sight retards the acquisition of knowledge, also that attempts to see under adverse conditions, whether caused by defective eyes or poor lighting, reacts to the detriment of the health of a child, as well as its progress. Teachers know by experience that on dull days the seeing conditions are so poor that there is a lack of attention and response on the pupils'. These conditions are directly related to the ability of the pupils to see mentally and distinctly the work that confronts them and in the end they result in a general retardation of the pupils' progress. There are many factors that affect the legibility of the various details that a pupil is required to see during the periods of instruction. The following is a discussion of some of these factors and the way in which they affect the pupils.\n\nIn the design of new schools provision for the best seeing conditions should be made, but there are hundreds of old schools to be lighted for the first time and old inadequate lighting replaced by modern lighting. Consequently, while those interested in schools may look forward to the advantages of modern design and equipment there will be existing schools that must remain in use for many years and every known means of improving the seeing conditions in them must be used. The requirements for good seeing are the same in both old and new schools.\n\nTHE EYES\n\nThe eyes are sensitive organs designed by Nature to operate under a wide variety of conditions. This does not mean that they operate equally well under all conditions. Nature demands perfect vision and the eyes will automatically strain themselves in an attempt to accomplish this, even under very adverse conditions. However, as the eyes are controlled by delicate muscles, they, like any other muscles, quickly become tired when forced to work under conditions that are different to the normal easy working range. Consequently, prolonged use under difficulties will exact a toll which may appear as fatigue, headaches or other disturbances to the nervous system. It is necessary to recognize this fact in order to appreciate the tasks of the eyes in the classroom.\n\nThe eye is equipped with an iris, the purpose of which is to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye. When the eye is exposed to a bright surface the iris adjusts the size of the pupil to a relatively small opening. If the eye is then exposed to a dark surface the iris expands. The greater the difference in brightness, the greater is the range of adjustment necessary. This naturally results in greater muscular effort and greater fatigue.\nComfortable lighting depends to a great extent upon the contrasts in brightness in the field of view. In order to see an object or detail clearly there must be a strong contrast between the object and its adjacent background. This is necessary but strong contrasts in brightness in the field of vision are also detrimental. Strong contrasts between chalk and the chalkboard or between a pencil or penmark and the writing surface is vision. On the other hand, strong contrast between bright parts of lighting fixtures and the ceiling or wall or between the sky viewed through a window and the adjacent wall or between a white paper and a dark desk top is detrimental to vision. A very bright area is a definite distraction which tends to cause the iris to contract when the work upon which the eyes are focussed may demand that the iris expand. It cannot do both at once.\n\nDAYLIGHT\n\nDaylight is thought of as abundant, which it is out of doors, but it is not adequate for easy seeing indoors, except for a very few feet from the windows. Therefore, it is generally not adequate for the normal working distance for most of a classroom, and, moreover, daylight is difficult to control; it can be severely glaring if not properly controlled. It is thus obvious that the control of daylight cannot be overlooked in any plan of seeing conditions for classrooms.\n\nFig. 3 illustrates the decrease of daylight from the window to the dark side of the room. The figures are values of daylight averaged from a large accumulation of measurements. The light vertical bars represent measurements made on clear days and the striped bars represent measurements on dull days which comprise 20% or more of the days during the school season. This graph does not apply to classrooms with clerestory windows or directive glass blocks.\n\nIt is obvious that there is a serious need of good artificial lighting in the dark side of the rooms during all of the dull days and most of the clear ones.\n\nCLERESTORY WINDOWS AND GLASS BLOCKS\n\nTwo departures from the long established type of school have appeared during the past few years. The first is a classroom with a clerestory ceiling. Windows are placed high in the right-hand wall (as one faces the chalkboard). Conventional windows are placed in the left wall. The windows in the right wall, known as clerestory windows, are designed to admit light to what has heretofore been known as the dark side. Fig. 3 shows a room of this type. The clerestory windows being high in the wall are liable to admit sunlight into the room during some hours of the day and seasons of the year. Furthermore, there frequently will be an excessive contrast in brightness between the high part of sky, viewed through these windows, and the adjacent wall surface which will become a source of serious glare. These will necessitate window shades on these clerestory windows. When no direct sunlight is admitted and the clerestory windows are unshaded, the daylight in the otherwise dark side is appreciably improved. If typical deep window shades are drawn down to obscure the sun through these windows the daylight in the otherwise dark side increases so that in the conventional type of building, because the windows in the left wall are not so high as the conventional design and it is the upper part of the high windows that are most important for the illumination of the dark side of the room (see Fig. 15). On the other hand, if the clerestory windows are shaded with translucent material such as Scotch-holland or muslin, some of the benefit of them will be retained. The full advantage of the clerestory windows depends almost entirely upon keeping them unshaded. It is therefore obvious that they will demand more attention by the teacher in order to derive the full benefit from them.\nThe second type of new design is based upon the use of light-directing glass block. This particular type of block deflects light from the sky upward into the room in such a way that it reinforces the natural distribution of daylight in the far side of the room. Fig. 4 illustrates such a classroom. When the sun shines on these blocks there is an improvement in the daylight in the far side of the room, but on the shady side of a building or on a dull day the daylighting is not much better than in a reasonably modern school of conventional design. The windows are equipped with clear glass, 2 feet 6 inches in depth, below the glass blocks, so as to prevent a shadow falling. These blocks are made of the same type of glass blocks, so that they eliminate the necessity of window shades, except when unobstructed sky viewed through the clear glass may be excessively bright. In such cases, the clear glass only need be shaded.\n\nThese new designs represent important steps toward greater utilization of daylight. The graphs showing the distribution of daylight in them represent measurements made in two schools only and under two conditions of daylight. Consequently, it is logical to assume that in different schools under different daylight conditions there will be many days in which the results will be less favourable than those shown. Nevertheless, they represent distinct improvements over older conventional designs. It cannot be claimed that they eliminate the necessity of artificial lighting.\n\n**DESK LOCATION**\n\nThe location of a pupil's desk in the classroom may be a strong factor in the pupil's progress. Pupils near the front left of a room (near windows) are favoured with short distance from the chalkboards from which the work written thereon appears large and easy to see distinctly. There is no reflected chalkboard glare to obliterate the writing on any part of the chalkboard. There is no diminution of glare due to the brightness of the sky. There is an abundance of daylight illumination for desks A, B, C. All of these factors tend to prevent eye strain and fatigue. All of these advantages do not exist in the other parts of the room. Consequently, pupils in the other sections are handicapped, some of them severely so. Because of this it cannot be expected that all of the pupils will be able to accomplish their tasks with an equal degree of ease. Fig. 5 illustrates the effect of desk locations on the legibility of work written on the chalkboard when viewed from four points of view. The positions of the pupils with the desk fronts A, B, C have been selected for the basis of comparison because they represent the most favourable combination of conditions. The legibility from point A is rated as 100 and as percentages of this from the other points. The values were measured with a visibility meter.* Those who may be handicapped by defective sight or slow mental process may find it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to keep up with the work of the pupils succeeding in the less favourable locations in the classroom are added to their personal handicap. Therefore, such pupils should be given the benefit of the best locations in the classroom. Normal eyes can adapt themselves to a reasonably wide range of conditions without appreciably affecting the individual. Thus, the choice of the most favourable location in the classroom would be of minor benefit to pupils with normal sight, but it would be a matter of serious need to pupils with defective sight. There have been many cases of apparent mental dullness that were caused by inability to see distinctly.\n\n*A visibility meter is an instrument that permits actual measurements of the visibility of objects.\nIt is not economically practicable to eliminate completely these inequalities but the adverse effects can be minimized by relatively simple means such as properly planned artificial lighting, placing defective-sight-pupils in the favourable locations, suitable window shades, AND THE INTELLIGENT USE of them.\n\nARTIFICIAL LIGHTING\n\nIt is obvious from the foregoing that artificial lighting is necessary to supplement daylight in order to overcome some of the handicaps under which about half of the children in a classroom work. If artificial lighting is located on account of lighting handicaps, children tend to advance as rapidly as uninhibited ones; there will be an appreciation of the real value of artificial lighting and less tendency to regard it simply as a means of complying with a regulation as cheaply as possible. It will be a real asset instead of a liability.\n\nFor about ten years the standard of classroom lighting in Ontario has been 15 foot-candles* on desks and chalkboards of ordinary classrooms. Previous to that time it was exceedingly rare to find a classroom lighted to more than half that intensity. The adoption of that standard raised the level of many hundreds of classrooms in Ontario and has greatly benefited the thousands of pupils attending those schools. Recent studies of classroom lighting requirements have led to the adoption by the Illuminating Engineering Society of a new set of standards in which 30 foot-candles on the work (desks, chalkboards, etc.) for ordinary classrooms is stipulated, and higher for special classes. See Table I.\n\n| Location | Foot-candles |\n|----------|-------------|\n| Classrooms\u2014on desks and chalkboards | 30 |\n| Work benches, including art rooms, offices, libraries, shops and laboratories | 30 |\n| Study lighting, including library lighting\u2014on desks and chalkboards | 30 |\n| Drafting rooms, typewriting and sewing rooms | 50 |\n| Recreational and recreational and auxiliary rooms | 30 |\n| Auditoriums (not for study), cafeterias, locker rooms, washrooms, corridors containing lockers and stairways | 10 |\n| Open corridors and store rooms | 5 |\n\n*A foot-candle is the intensity of illumination produced on a surface one foot from a standard candle.\nThe new requirements represent a higher standard of lighting than the previous ones, and these should be the basis of lighting for all new schools. They are nonetheless desirable for old schools. However, for old schools which may be replaced in a few years its cost may be a deterrent to its use.\n\nIn planning lighting for classrooms a minimum number of outlets and fixtures will be necessary to produce a desirable approach to uniformity. The required number of footcandles will determine the wattage of the lamps to be used.\n\nThe following requirements should be met:\n\n1. The intensity of illumination must be sufficient to enable all of the pupils to see what they should see instantly and without conscious effort.\n2. There should be no noticeable shadows on desks or chalkboards.\n3. There should be no glare. Even mild glare that would not be obvious is detrimental when the eyes are exposed to it for lengthy periods of time.\n4. The fixtures must be so designed and constructed that they will not collect dust in excessive quantities and they must be easily cleaned.\n5. There should be no strong contrasts in brightness in the normal field of view.\n\nSELECTION OF FIXTURES\n\nThe most difficult task for the school trustees is the selection of a suitable type of lighting fixture. Far too many decisions are based upon the first cost. Low first cost must be accompanied by some compromise with visual comfort. This is illustrated by a comparison of white glass diffusing tungsten lamp fixtures and indirect fixtures. A considerable difference may be made between types of fluorescent lamp fixtures. It is a simple matter to construct efficient indirect fixtures that are free from glare. On the other hand it is practically impossible to make white glass enclosing units entirely free from mild glare, although the glare may be minimized by the use of large diameter units mounted high enough to be as far as practicable from the normal lines of vision. Indirect units provide the maximum usable light at the surfaces where it is distributed throughout the room. (See Fig. 6, groups 1 and 2.) There are no excessively bright parts exposed to view, therefore, there is nothing to interfere with comfortable vision. On the other hand with diffusing white glass units all of the usable light must pass through the glass. (See Fig. 6, group 4.) Consequently, if the glass is too small in diameter its brightness will be too high to look at without discomfort.\n\nIt is true that the indirect lighting fixtures are a little higher in cost than diffusing fixtures but if the difference in cost is spread over ten years the difference per year for a classroom would probably not be more than $5.25 or 30\u00a2 a month for each school section. This small difference in cost represents the difference between high quality lighting and that which would be at all acceptable for classrooms. An ordinary classroom accommodates about 40 pupils. In 10 years this represents 400 pupils who can be provided with high quality lighting for an equipment cost for 10 years of about 12\u00a2 each more than the cheapest lighting. When glareless, comfortable lighting means so much to the pupils is not this slight additional cost justified? This question must not be passed over without mention of the problem of maintenance which will be discussed later.\n\nTUNGSTEN vs. FLUORESCENT LIGHTING\n\nThe choice between tungsten and fluorescent lighting is principally one of cost. Fluorescent lamps and fixtures possess distinctive advantages and are capable of producing lighting of the highest quality when properly applied. Fluorescent lamp fixtures are much higher in cost than tungsten lamp fixtures. Also their price range includes cheap glaring fixtures and much better ones at correspondingly higher cost.\n\nFluorescent lamps produce the required intensity of illumination with much less power than that required by tungsten lamps. Consequently, when the cost is spread over a period of years the fluorescent lighting may not cost any more than tungsten lighting for an equal intensity of illumination.\n\nAll fluorescent lighting is not good. Exposed bare fluorescent lamps are subject to the same objection as white glass tungsten fixtures. The high costs of bare fluorescent lamp fixtures are not consistent with the relatively low quality lighting that they produce. Enclosed lamp fixtures with louvres or diffusing glass or plastic are capable of producing the highest quality lighting that is available at this time. (See Fig. 7.)\n\nFluorescent lamps are particularly valuable in the application of the new lighting standards as they will produce the higher intensities with no more power consumption than that now required by tungsten lamps for the older standards. One four-lamp fluorescent fixture consuming about 200 watts is equivalent in light production to one 300 watt tungsten lamp. The heating effect on the pupils produced by fluorescent lamps is very much less than that produced by tungsten lamps of equal wattage. When used on 25 cycle circuits extra care must be taken to select fixtures which are designed so that they minimize the flicker. This involves the shielding of the lamps by suitable louvres or glass or plastic shields. Curved or wavy louvres are somewhat better than flat straight louvre surfaces for 25 cycles. Many of the fixtures that are suitable for 60 cycle operation are not best for 25 cycles.\nFig. 8 shows a typical lighting plan of a classroom. It will be noted that the circuits are so arranged that the inner and outer rows of fixtures and the chalkboard lighting may be used independently of each other. There are also two plug receptacles indicated, one at the front and the other at the rear, for the use of picture projectors, radios or other electrical appliances.\n\nSPECIAL CLASSES\n\nThe visual tasks of ordinary classrooms are to a considerable extent standardized. The pupils in sight-saving classes have the same work as those in ordinary classes. Their abnormal vision requires considerably higher intensities, approximately twice as much as ordinary classes and the lighting should be as accurate as possible. Drafting or stenography call for high intensities. The former involves working out fine details (thread points, etc.). In stenography the eyes are not used to guide the hands but they must follow the material to be transcribed. Speed and accuracy are essential and these are obtainable only with good lighting as there must be no hesitation in reading notes accurately.\n\nSewing, especially on dark goods, demands high intensity of lighting. Each branch of manual training requires the same kind of lighting as is used for the trades that are taught.\n\nEach of such special classes is an individual problem.\n\nMAINTENANCE\n\nNo lighting system, however good it may be initially, will retain its efficiency without some attention. Dust will collect on fixtures and lamps, particularly where hot air heating systems are used. Lamps will become aged. Fluorescent lamps may become erratic in operation and unless attended to promptly will rapidly depreciate. Therefore, regular maintenance of the lighting equipment is necessary, the frequency of cleaning will depend upon the type of fixture and local conditions.\n\nFixtures may be grouped into three general types with respect to maintenance.\n\n1. Those in which the lamps are enclosed within the fixture. They may be either tungsten or fluorescent. Most of these direct the light predominantly downward. Therefore, the loss of illumination resulting from a layer of dust on the fixture is relatively small. Usually they are reasonably dust-tight and easily cleaned.\n\n2. Indirect and semi-indirect. These project most of the light on the ceiling from which it is distributed throughout the room. Considerable layers of dust on the fixture will absorb light, thereby causing a serious loss of illumination. Any form of open indirect reflector or diffuser will collect dust. The light from the lamp must penetrate the layer of dust to reach the reflecting or diffusing surface and then penetrate it again to escape to the ceiling. There is thus a double absorption of light. (See Fig. 9.)\n\nThere is a type of indirect unit designed for the use of silver-bowl lamps which has a definite advantage. (See Fig. 10.) The actual reflecting surface is deposited upon the interior of the lower part of the bulb where it is protected from dust. The upper part of the bulb slopes at a steep angle which counteracts the tendency of dust to settle upon it. These lamps are used in pan-shaped fixtures, the purpose of which is to shield the upper part of the bulb which would be glaring if exposed to view and to present a pleasing appearance. The pan has very little effect as a reflector. These lamps with their fixtures are particularly suitable where maintenance is uncertain and the ceilings are low.\n\n3. Open top and bottom. Some fluorescent lamp fixtures are open at both the top and the bottom. There is nothing to collect dust except the upper surface of the lamps. Consequently, there is little loss of illumination from dust.\n\nCHALKBOARDS (Blackboards)\n\nThe chalkboard is a very important item in classroom instruction. If the pupils cannot see clearly what is written on it they cannot profit by the instruction that is given through its use. Mention has previously been made of some of the difficulties associated with its use.\n\nThe common material of which they are made is slate which acquires a semi-polish or sheen which in turn causes glare, which viewed from certain directions obscures the letters that have been written on it. The glare may be reflected on its surface of the sky or bright outdoor surfaces. Fig. 11 shows a typical glare zone in a classroom. The light that causes the glare enters through one or two windows near the end of the chalkboard. (See Fig. 12.) The only practical means of preventing it is to shade the windows through which it enters. As this will seriously reduce the illumination of the room, supplementary lighting will be required to improve the visibility. This may be supplied by the room lights, but much better results will be produced by special supplementary lighting installed for the purpose. The intensity of the supplementary lighting should be at least as high as the general room lighting. They must be of a type that will be free from all glare when viewed from the pupils' seats. The choice between recessed units and those mounted on the ceiling depends upon the value placed upon the room appearance. Recessed units result in a more finished appearance than those mounted upon the surface of the ceiling. Figs. 13 and 14 illustrate both types in use.\nThere is a growing tendency to depart from the use of black slate boards and to select boards of lighter tone and more pleasing colors such as green and ivory. Green boards are used with white or yellow chalk and the ivory ones with dark blue. The dark boards have an advantage of aiding visual acuity and the ivory boards may be more comfortable visually. Any one of them will be satisfactory if the illumination is good and free from glare.\n\nCHALK\n\nChalk may appear to be an unimportant detail of school supplies but it plays an important part in the legibility of work written on the chalkboard. The greatest visual acuity results from the highest contrast between a letter and its background, that is the contrast between white and black. Hard white chalk makes narrow, gray lines that contrast poorly with the chalkboard whereas soft chalk makes broader, white lines of strong contrast with the board. The same applies to coloured chalk\u2014hard grades reduce the legibility of the written characters and soft grades increase it.\n\nThis is another example of a condition that may not adversely affect pupils with normal sight seated in favourable locations but may add to other difficulties of children labouring under adverse conditions such as poor sight or unfavourable location. In well lighted classrooms of normal length hard chalk, which is preferred by teachers, may be generally satisfactory.\n\nWINDOW SHADES\n\nDaylight will be beneficial if it assists vision and detrimental if it causes glare or interferes with vision in other ways. Therefore, it must be controlled in order to make the most effective use of it.\n\nUnobstructed sunlight on white paper is intolerably bright which necessitates shading the windows. The sky exposed to view without direct sunlight may also be glaring when the eyes are exposed to it for appreciable lengths of time, although it may not appear so at a casual\nBecause of this children sitting in one place may face severe glare which the teacher may not be aware of. In such cases, if the room is provided with adequate artificial lighting it may be advantageous to shade the sky by the window shades and turn on the artificial lighting. However, if shading the windows would rob pupils at the inner desks of much needed light, the lesser of the two evils would be to not shade the windows.\n\nAs intimated previously, the pupils at the inner rows of desks (farthest from the windows) suffer most from the vagaries of daylight and its improper control. By reference to Fig. 15 it will be seen that the upper part of windows is the most valuable source of illumination for desks near the center of the window row. Most light comes by the upper half whereas only 37% of the light on the desks near the windows is furnished from the upper half of the windows. Therefore, any unnecessary shading of the upper half causes a very serious reduction of the lighting on the dark side where it is usually insufficient at best. Fig. 16 shows two examples of a common practice of covering the upper half of the windows on the dark side of the room under unfavorable sky conditions. If this data is studied with relation to Fig. 2 (daylight distribution) which shows actual intensities of daylight in rooms with unshaded windows the seriousness of the reduction of daylight illumination by shading the upper halves of the windows will be apparent. It is thus obvious that a single blind does not provide sufficient flexibility for use to provide for conditions that change during the day and through the seasons. Fig. 17 shows a method of mounting two roller blinds, one between the top and the bottom of the window, one to be drawn up over the upper half of the windows and the other to be pulled down over the lower half. This arrangement provides flexibility for variations in conditions through the day and season.\n\nThe correct operation of window shades is important. Glare must be eliminated and if this requires the shading of the windows artificial lighting should be brought into use. Each teacher should study the conditions in his or her room. Sky glare may be troublesome in one room of a school and absent in another.\n\nWindow blinds play an important part in the achievement of good seeing conditions in classrooms. The commonly used heavily coated opaque materials are not suitable for classroom use. A medium green of such material absorbs all of the light that strikes it. None goes through. Light cream and white of the same type would allow about 8% of the light to pass through. These blinds waste energy and should be used. There is a material known as Scotolightblind which is a medium white bleached cotton impregnated with translucent filler and stiffening that allows about one-third of the light to pass through. The density of this material is sufficient to prevent glare from direct sunlight or sky. The light that it transmits is softly diffused throughout the room and although it is relatively low in intensity it produces a pleasantly bright environment with the light that is totally wasted with opaque blinds.\nVenetian blinds possess some advantages but they require considerable care in their operation to use them most effectively. Under some conditions of wind, when the windows are open, the vibration of the slats makes an intolerable noise.\n\nAll window shades or blinds should be as rugged and positive in their operation as possible to withstand the use that they get in classrooms.\n\nGLARE\n\nThere are many forms of glare, all of which are detrimental in one way or another. One of the most common forms in classrooms is the high brightness of fixtures or parts of them. This applies more particularly to diffusing enclosing tungsten units and to unshielded fluorescent lamps. A different form of glare is that caused by windows visible beyond the chalkboard, usually in a cloak-room. Fig. 16 shows examples of this, also Fig. 18 (blackboard glare). Such windows should be permanently darkened by paint or other means. It is characteristic of human nature that people will recall from danger of the sudden death variety, but complacently tolerate the slow but sure kind. It is the same with glare. Blinding glare is remedied because it is intolerable, but mild insidious glare is allowed to exact its toll of eye strain and fatigue which in the end may be more injurious than more obvious glare.\n\nThe effect of glare is to nullify a proportion of the useful light. This effect is most pronounced when the source of glare is close to the line of vision. The following table illustrates this:\n\n| Glare source* | Percentage of light wasted |\n|---------------|---------------------------|\n| 5\u00b0 from the line of vision | 83% |\n| 10\u00b0 from the line of vision | 73% |\n| 20\u00b0 from the line of vision | 60% |\n| 40\u00b0 from the line of vision | 48% |\n\nIt is for this reason that lighting fixtures should be free from bright spots and if they exist the fixtures should be mounted as high as practicable.\n\nChalkboard glare and sky glare are referred to in other sections. A little thought will convince one that these forms of glare can be entirely eliminated by the co-ordination of artificial lighting and window shades.\n\nThe teacher's desk should not be near windows because when he or she stands near the window to address the pupils they will probably have to face the windows and thus be confronted with sky glare. Furthermore, being close to the windows the teacher will be less conscious of the fading of daylight.\n\nAUTOMATIC CONTROL OF LIGHTING\n\nThe best artificial lighting is worthless unless it is used. Ordinarily in late afternoon the intensity of daylight decreases so gradually that the eyes can easily accommodate themselves to the slow change. Under such conditions a point is reached at which the intensity is too low for the normal use of the eyes.\n\nIt is easy for the teacher to fail to notice this with the result that the pupils would not have the benefit of the artificial lighting when it was most needed.\n\nThe use of photo-electric automatic control of the lighting system will prevent such a condition. It can be set to turn on the lights when the daylight falls to a selected value and to turn them off when it increases to a predetermined value.\n\nUsually the inner rows of lamps should be lighted all day. These can be turned on at the beginning of the session by the teacher. The outer rows of lamps may be operated automatically. Each school has its own set of conditions that will determine the method of use. It is a simple matter to make provision in the wiring for automatic control if it is desirable to postpone its purchase to a future time.\n\n*Data from Dr. M. Luckiesh.\nROOM FINISHES\n\nNo lighting plan for classrooms is complete without reference to the finish of the ceiling, walls, floor, desk tops and furniture generally. Light ceiling (matte white) and moderately light upper walls (light gray, ivory or green) are necessary to obtain an efficient lighting system. Contrast in brightness should be avoided wherever possible. White paper on a dark stained desk top would result in a brightness ratio of about 10 to 1 which is too high for comfort. The same paper may present a brightness ratio of only 2 or 3 to 1 on a natural unstained desk top which would be quite comfortable. Similarly, light finished floors will be much more comfortable as a background for books and paper than dark ones. As the eyes roam from bright surfaces to dark and vice versa they must adjust themselves to each change in brightness. When the brightness contrasts are high the eye adjustments are severe which naturally results in fatigue. Low brightness contrasts reduce slight muscular strain and are therefore conducive to eye comfort and avoidance of strain and fatigue. Light finishes, room equipment and furniture make their contributions to a comfortable and cheerful environment.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe adverse factors discussed in the foregoing are common in classrooms, although not necessarily all of them in all rooms. Every step tending to reduce these factors will be a contribution to better vision and easier seeing. On the other hand, if they are ignored they will continue as retarding factors. Good lighting is the basic factor in the achievement of good seeing conditions but it alone cannot completely accomplish the desired result. The combination of good lighting, light toned paint and other room equipment produced by suitable paint and varnish, elimination of glare, intelligent use of window shades and elimination of strong brightness contrasts, will minimize the inequalities that exist in classrooms and produce conditions that are conducive to the most rapid advancement with the least eye strain; least physical ills resulting from it and the least effort.\n\nEighty-five per cent of our knowledge is gained through the sense of sight; in other words through seeing and hence seeing is directly based upon lighting it naturally follows that adequate and correct lighting plays a vitally important part in a child's progress in school. Artificial lighting can supply the deficiencies of daylight and can be controlled to suit any condition.\n\nThe teachers should know from personal observation what the seeing conditions are in the different locations in their rooms. Handicaps can be removed or overcome by readily available means. Children with defective sight should be given the benefit of the most favorable conditions.\n\nIf two individuals are given identical loads to carry for the same distance, one over smooth level road, the other over rough, uneven ground; the one who travels the rough road will either take longer time or be more tired, or both. Similarly, children working in school under good conditions will perform their tasks with little fatigue whereas others in the same classroom will have to work slower and harder and consequently become more fatigued. The eyes cannot work as fast and with as little expenditure of energy under poor as under good lighting.\n\nAll of the pupils as well as the teachers will benefit by good lighting, but those with defective vision will derive more benefit than those with normal vision. Children with defective vision are handicapped for life. Therefore, the employment of any means of preventing the development of eye defects or of assisting those already afflicted is the responsibility of every person entrusted with the equipment of our schools.\nTHE HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER COMMISSION OF ONTARIO\n\n620 UNIVERSITY AVENUE, TORONTO 2\n\nApril 19, 1949\n\nMr. Bernard F.

This will, no doubt, be forthcoming within the next few days.\n\nAt the same time, I touched very briefly on problem you were facing with the two room school but did not go into it very deeply as I have been expecting to receive a copy of the specifications of which you spoke.

We will also require an occasional supervisory visit at this school.\n\nHowever, our main difficulty in the erection of two-room schools now lies with the following three projects, all in the Skeena Agency, Prince Rupert, B.C.:\n\nHartley Bay School,\nLehaleay School,\nKincolith School.\n\nIt was our intention to erect these buildings following your plan No. 2, with which everyone is quite satisfied. However, I have\nreceived a self-explanatory letter from Mr. Arneil concerning the electrical specifications which will render it impossible for this Branch to erect these buildings. I attach for your information a copy of this letter. You will note that Hartley Bay Village has 120 Volt D.C. current and Lakalap and Kinsoloth Village have 110 Volt D.C., 60 cycle plants.\n\nHad it not been for the difficulty concerning the installation of electricity, we had intended to advertise for tenders for these three projects. Please find attached also a self-explanatory sample advertisement. I have purposely left the dates blank but you will note that it was our intention to advertise these three projects together. I feel that one contractor will probably be prepared to bid on all three schools and thus save money for the Department.\n\nThis therefore may be taken as an official request for your Branch to assume the responsibility of the erection of these three schools with the request that the electrical specifications for plan S91 be modified to suit the individual requirements of the three villages concerned. Once these specifications have been altered I would request that tenders be called for as soon as possible. We have the funds available for these three projects and had intended to advertise immediately. As I indicated to you on the telephone, construction during the winter should be possible at the three sites selected by Mr. Indian Superintendent Anfield.\n\nI am endeavouring to find out from the Agencies Division further details concerning the lighting plants at these three villages and will write you immediately I have this data on hand.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

B. F.

It was referred to as the \"idea stage\" and not a \"state of planning\". While some policy guidance might be employed in providing amounts under this heading it was stressed that no policy decision was involved.\n\n(e) \"Shelf\" Projects\n\nClarification was requested of 3-l which reads \"of which now registered on shelf\". The Chairman interpreted this to mean all projects now fully planned, but not yet provided for in estimates.\n\n(f) Signing Authority\n\nThe \"signature of Authorized Officer\", so far as this survey is concerned, includes the Director and/or the Superintendents of the Services or Divisions concerned.\n\n(g) Channels\n\nCompleted Forms are to be forwarded through the office of the Deputy-Minister, Mines and Resources. (Mr. Odell).\n(h) Publicity\n\nThe Chairman stated that it was not the intention to release information to the public on any one or group of projects included in this survey. Only total probable expenditures would be publicized.\n\nThe Chairman summarized the purpose of the survey as being to indicate the Government's intention of meeting unemployment by means of public investment.\n\nThe foregoing is passed for your information, please.\n\nAdmin.

The cost of installing a good lighting system is small compared to the benefits accruing from it. Some of these benefits are: minimized eye strain, clear seeing from all parts of the room, increased efficiency of teacher, independence of variations in daylight; better progress and fewer examination failures, greater benefits to pupils with subnormal eyes, better discipline, and more cheerful surroundings.\n\nRequirements of the System\n\nThe principal requirements of classroom lighting are that it shall provide evenly distributed illumination of adequate intensity for all desks, with sharp shadows minimized and with the least possible glare.\n\nTypes of Lighting\n\nThere are three types of lighting that may be used for classrooms. The selection will be influenced chiefly by the cost of the fixtures, the provision for cleaning them regularly, and the maintenance of the ceiling in good reflecting condition.\n\nIndirect Tungsten Lighting, See Plate 2, groups 1 and 2\n\nThis is produced by projecting light to the ceiling from which it is distributed throughout the room. Consequently the ceiling MUST be maintained in a highly reflective condition: white or near white.\n\nIf the fixtures are of the OPEN type, units 1, 3, 4 and 5 of group 1, Plate 2, or those of group 2, they will collect considerable dust which will necessitate frequent cleaning. Unit No. 2, group 1 uses a BOWL-SILVERED lamp in which the reflector is deposited upon the inside of the bulb where dust cannot collect. Therefore, a reasonable accumulation of dust will not seriously reduce their efficiency. This is a decided advantage.\n\nThe quality of properly designed and installed indirect lighting is excellent - softly diffused light that is beneficial to the eyes.\nSemi-direct Tungsten Lighting. See Plate 2, group 4.\n\nThis lighting is produced by enclosing-glass units; No. 1, group 4 is of prismatic glass; units 2 to 5 are of white or milk glass. White glass units to comply with these recommendations must be greater in diameter than in depth.\n\nSemi-direct fixtures are satisfactory if they are of the specified size and shape, and suspended at the specified height.\n\nThe lighting is somewhat less refined in quality than indirect, but does not depreciate quite as rapidly from the accumulation of dust or discoloration of the ceiling.\n\nFluorescent Lighting.\n\nThis is much more efficient than tungsten and will produce twice or more as much light for the same amount of power. It has advantages for high intensity lighting. Fixtures with bare lamps fully exposed are not suitable for classrooms.\n\nIn school the pupils spend a considerable amount of time looking straight ahead at the blackboard or the teacher. If bare lamps are exposed to view the glare may be objectionable.\n\nWhen fluorescent lighting is to be used on 25 cycle power, the utmost care is needed in the selection of fixtures that will minimize the flicker that is caused by the 25 cycle power.\n\nRelative Cost.\n\nFluorescent lighting is higher in first cost than tungsten lighting, particularly in 25 cycle districts. Indirect tungsten is next, and semi-direct tungsten the lowest.\n\nBlackboard Lighting.\n\nIt is most important that all the pupils be able to see distinctly the work that is written on the blackboards. Most blackboards reflect glaring light that prevents clear seeing.\n\nThe most effective way of overcoming this is to shade the windows that admit the glaring light and illuminate the blackboards by supplementary units installed especially for the purpose.\n\nMaintenance.\n\nAll lighting fixtures collect dust, particularly indirect open type fixtures of any kind. Dust absorbs and wastes light. This wasted light is paid for but not received. Cleaning of lighting equipment is just as necessary to a lighting system as lubrication to an automobile.\nMaintenance (Cont'd)\n\nDo not let the ceiling become dull with age. Dark ceilings increase glare and reduce the efficiency of the lighting.\n\nAllowance for Depreciation.\n\nIn the preparation of this recommendation an allowance has been made for natural depreciation of the lamps and the accumulation of dust on the lighting equipment between cleaning periods. The lighting will therefore appear higher in intensity when the system is new than it will after a few months' use.\n\nWiring.\n\nThe importance of adequate wiring is evident from the fact that a 10% voltage loss, due to inadequate current-carrying capacity, will cause a light loss of approximately 24%. The minimum wire size is noted on the drawing. This size is based on a maximum voltage loss of 2%, which is in accordance with good wiring practice. (In no case should wire smaller than No. 12 B & S Gauge be used for branch circuits).\n\nWindow Shades.\n\nAttention is directed to the proper use of window shades. They are installed particularly to shield the desks near the windows from direct sunlight.\n\nIt is only under the MOST favourable conditions that the desks farthest from the windows receive fair daylight illumination. When the window shades are drawn over the upper half of the windows, the illumination on desks farthest from the windows may be decreased 60% or more, depending upon the local conditions.\n\nConclusion.\n\nThis plan has been carefully prepared for this particular school. Emphasis is placed on the importance of providing lighting in accordance with present-day standards. REDUCTION OF THE NUMBER OF FIXTURES, OR THE SUBSTITUTION OF SMALLER LAMPS OR INFERIOR LIGHTING EQUIPMENT WILL RESULT IN INFERIOR LIGHTING THAT WILL NOT PRODUCE THE DESIRED RESULTS. The following steps are necessary in order to take full advantage of the benefits of better lighting.\n\n1. Install the lighting outlets as indicated.\n2. Insist on adequate wiring with wire sizes shown on the drawing.\n3. Install only mogul-socket fixtures for classroom lighting (for tungsten lamps).\n4. Select the type and size of fixture specified.\n5. All electrical work must be approved by your District Electrical Inspector.\n\nSupervising Lighting Engineer.\nEXPLANATORY NOTE.

If you are not fortunate enough to have one of these dependable diesels in your equipment now, replacement engines, engineered to fit your shovels, can be obtained from Russel-Hipwell Engines Limited.\n\nThese diesel engines operate for less than 1/3 of the cost of operating a similar gasoline engine... this means more profit for you. They have much better torque characteristics than gasoline engines... they bite deeper, work faster, get your job done sooner. They are more rugged than most gasoline engines... this means lower maintenance costs, longer life, fewer shutdowns, faster schedules. These diesels are simpler to operate and maintain... there is no ignition system to give trouble, all parts are readily accessible and easily replaced so you save time and money.\n\nThese engines run by themselves... simply push button starting gets them going; no operator is required to watch over them... are complete with speed governors... they cut down labour costs.\n\nGenerating Sets\n\nFor municipal, industrial, marine and camp use, Russel-Hipwell offers a range of diesel generating sets from 2 Kilowatts (2,000 Watts) to 1200 Kilowatts. Our experienced engineering staff is available to design any generating set to your specific needs, and since nearly all sets are assembled and thoroughly tested in our plant, we are able to see that you get equipment which will best fill your requirements.\n\nGenerating Sets are available in a very wide range of electrical characteristics involving output capacity, voltage, frequency, phase, and speed. The sets are available in high speed, medium speed, and low speed units, and the experience Russel-Hipwell Engines Limited have gained in building hundreds of generating sets of all ratings will be placed at your disposal to see that you properly solve your power problem.\n\nThere is no other form of power known to man which combine to such an extent, low initial cost, low operating cost, maximum dependability, extreme flexibility, and guaranteed service. For complete information on electric power where you want it, when you want it... check with Russel-Hipwell Engines Limited, your Headquarters for Diesel Power.\nIn powering trucks, tractors, and heavy earth-moving equipment of all kinds, the Cummins \"Dependable\" Diesel has proven itself to be the best. The exclusive Cummins fuel system... one pump for all cylinders... gives every engine smoothness, flexibility and pep which cannot be equaled. All the working parts of a Cummins diesel are extra heavy, extra large... all non-working parts are light and compact. When you have a Cummins \"Dependable\" Diesel, you carry bigger payloads, because of the low weight per horsepower... get more miles per gallon, because of the full diesel four stroke cycle principle... have less maintenance, because of the extra rugged construction... have faster acceleration of the diesel unit and ability to pull. Cummins \"Dependable\" Diesel automotive engines are offered in a range from 100 to 550 H.P. The job you want done is now being done by a Cummins \"Dependable\" Diesel, cheaper, faster, better.\n\nIn the smaller horsepower ranges, for light vehicles, the Sheppard diesel is available from 10 to 100 H.P. Offering all the advantages of a high quality four stroke cycle engine, Sheppard diesels can save you money in dozens of applications.\n\nThrough co-operation and careful, experienced engineering, a line of flexible switching locomotives has been developed, employing the Cummins \"Dependable\" Diesel for motive power. There are several advantages to be gained in the application of a Cummins diesel engine in the modern high-speed diesel powered switchers... they are ready to go to work at a moment's notice without costly warm-ups... at the end of a job, they cost no more than to keep ready and waiting for the next job... they have ample smooth, flexible, rugged power, minutely adjustable by finger-tip control. These, and many other important features mean less worry, less trouble, and more money in your pocket. Solve your switching problems with a Cummins powered switcher, available in capacities most suited to your requirements. These engines can be obtained in many makes of locomotives as original equipment, and Russell-Hipwell Engines Limited can supply engines to replace existing power in your present equipment.\nPower Units\n\nPower Units designed specifically for operation in sawmills, grist mills, gravel plants, and other similar installations are available with ratings ranging from 3\u00bd to 550 H.P. The installation of a Sheppard or Cummins Diesel power unit will increase your profits in the following way... the fire hazard is reduced with a resulting lower insurance rate... a completely packaged unit lowers installation costs... no fireman or attendant is required, and the use of low-cost diesel fuel greatly reduces operating expenses... ease and simplicity of operation also contribute to economical operation of these power units.\n\nIf a unit of larger capacity is required, we recommend the Enterprise diesel engine, with ratings ranging up to 2000 H.P. Power units can be supplied to meet your requirements, ready to install, ready to operate, ready to save you money.\n\nPumping Engines\n\nTo power pumping units, the Sheppard, Cummins, and Enterprise engines are unsurpassed. Their horsepower-speed characteristics match up with centrifugal pump requirements perfectly to give you high overall efficiency, rugged dependability, quick starting, reasonable price, and economical pumping.\n\nFor fire pump service, water works stand-by and peak load service, industrial pumping applications, water tower pumping, and every other pumping application where instant starting, extra dependability, minimum fire hazard, and overall efficiency are important, consult Rusel-Hipwell Engines Limited, your Headquarters for Diesel Power... we have an engine to satisfy your pumping requirements... you can obtain a complete pumping unit designed to your specific needs, powered by a diesel which will give you the best service. The engines more than meet all Underwriters' requirements.\nMARINE ENGINES\n\nSAFE -- DEPENDABLE\nWITH EXTRA POWER WHEN NEEDED\n\nSheppard, Cummins, and Enterprise marine diesel engines are of the four stroke cycle principle, normally aspirated or supercharged. To you this means extra power, extra space, extra profits, more dependability and lower maintenance cost. All of the working wearing parts are extra large to give prolonged life and trouble-free operation.\n\nThe makers of these three lines of engines offer a combined total of 44 basic models... give a complete range of from 1/2 to 2,000 H.P... provide a money-saving answer to your power problem. With one of these diesels in your boat, the fire hazard is gone... and you get lower insurance rates too!\n\n1. Sheppard marine engine Model 6F\n   31 continuous horsepower\n2. Cummins marine engine Model HM-60\n   93 continuous horsepower\n3. Enterprise marine engine Model DMG-38\n   1000 continuous horsepower\nSheppard, Cummins, and Enterprise engines are all of the heavy duty\u20144 stroke cycle\u2014full diesel types. All three engines are leaders in their particular field... are built for ruggedness, dependability, long life, and cheap operation on the toughest jobs... are built by companies with years of experience in the diesel engine business... are sold by Russell-Hipwell Engines Limited, your Headquarters for Diesel Power, with complete engineering and service facilities throughout Eastern Canada.\n\nFrom this complete range of diesel engines, with 44 basic models from 3\u00bd to 2000 H.P., you can choose the unit to solve your power problem, whether it be for a marine, industrial, locomotive, automotive, or any other application.\n\nFrom the stand-point of first cost, operating cost, and adaptability, diesel is the most economical power known to man. Consult your Headquarters for Diesel Power, without obligation, for the very best solution to your power problem.\n\nDesigned to Serve You...\n\nToo many times an operator, after spending possibly thousands of dollars on a diesel plant, finds himself shut down because of lack of parts, and lack of service. To avoid any possibility of this occurring with a Sheppard, Cummins, or an Enterprise diesel engine, Russell-Hipwell Engines Limited have set up a service organization throughout Eastern Canada which is second to none of its type.

With this request Mr. Jeffries sent me four drawings identified as your Index #67 - 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5.\n\nOn these plans there is nothing specific as to your intentions regarding lighting etc., and I have made up an approximate summary of my ideas of the power requirements based on a very sparse knowledge of this type of work in isolated areas. In order that you may check my calculations, I will give my assumed power breakdown as follows:\n\n| SECTION                  | POWER DETAILS                      | KILOWATTS |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Classroom                | 15 - 200 watt bulbs                | 3.00      |\n| Living Room              | 2 - 300 watt bulbs                 | .60       |\n| Kitchen                  | 1000 watts                         | 1.00      |\n| Two Coat Rooms           | 4 - 60 watt bulbs                  | .24       |\n| Two Stairways            | 2 - 60 watt bulbs                  | .12       |\n| Workshop                 | 12 - 100 watt bulbs                | 1.20      |\n|                          | 4 - 60 watt local lighting bulbs   | .24       |\n|                          | 3 - 1/4 H.P.

To start up the engine all that need be done is to depress the starter button and screw the throttle control knob in to the stop. As this is being done the engine comes up to speed and everything then is under control. This operation however can be performed only right at the engine.\n\nThere is another form of starting which we call remote manual starting, and consists merely of having the engine starting push-button located at some point distant from the engine itself. In order that there will be no air lock in the fuel system when the engine is shut down from a remote point, the Sheppard Engine Company have found it advisable to use a hydraulic throttle for this type of service, which adds slightly to the cost. This scheme however to my way of thinking would be the best compromise between a fully automatic set and one which would have to be started at the engine every time power were required.\n\nThe third method of starting is what we call load demand control. This is a completely automatic starting equipment which causes the engine to start up whenever any light switch or other power demand is turned on. The engine runs continuously until the last light switch is turned off, at which time the engine automatically shuts down. This would be a very lovely arrangement for the schools, but frankly it involves some rather tricky electrical relay circuits etc., and we feel here that we should not advise its use in such a remote point, where knowledge of electrical circuits etc., should not be expected.\n\nAs far as the location of the generating set is concerned, I would strongly suggest that it be installed on a concrete block in the basement store-room. This site is chosen in preference to the boiler room merely because the latter is directly under the teacher's living room, and since there is of necessity some noise while the set is operating we thought it would be better to get it away from the living quarters.\n\nThe equipment that we would recommend tentatively is as follows:\n\nITEM #1\n\n1 - diesel electric generating set rated 5 K.W. - 120 volts - single phase - 60 cycle - self-regulated - in accordance with the attached specification sheet - complete with batteries - hand starting equipment - and a generator panel.\n\nPRICE per set complete - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $2,429.00\nITEM #1-A\n\nPRICE addition for manual remote starting equipment for one station - $95.00\n\nIf additional stations are required, these can be supplied at an additional price of approximately $5.00 per station.\n\nITEM #1-B\n\nPRICE addition to Item 1 for complete load demand control if required - $408.00\n\nITEM #2\n\n1 - set of batteries for engine starting, consisting of two - heavy duty - 6 volt - 25 plate batteries, with jumpers and 20' cable.\n\nPRICE per set - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $70.00\n\nITEM #3\n\n1 - engine exhaust silencer, and a length of flexible exhaust tubing for connection next to the engine manifold.\n\nPRICE each per set - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $43.00\n\nITEM #4\n\n1 - engine hour meter to indicate the total running time of the engine in hours\n\nPRICE each - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $29.00\n\nAll above prices would be subject to a discount of 10% to a Federal Government Agency. The prices are quoted f.o.b. Owen Sound, payable in Canadian Funds, with sales tax extra if applicable.\n\nShould there be a general price change prior to your placing an order for this equipment this quotation will be reviewed. After an order has been placed, prices will be maintained except where influenced by cost changes beyond our control, and in any event they will not be increased more than 5%.\n\nDelivery of the equipment quoted above could be made in a very short time, in probably a matter of a couple of weeks from receipt of an order.\n\nIn closing his memo, Mr. Jeffries mentioned that there was a second problem you had, and on which he did not as yet have details. I would certainly appreciate Colonel Neary if you would let me have your comments on these remarks, and also give us the opportunity of being whatever assistance we can on any other problems you may have.\nIn closing I just might point out that shortly after we were in touch with one another before relative to the 75 K.W. generating set for Wabasca School I heard from the contractor and I believe he was phoning from Ottawa. At that time he was very interested in getting information on 15 K.W. units, and indicated to me that he expected to be able to give me a verbal order to go ahead almost immediately. I didn't hear anything more from him, and unfortunately didn't know where to get in touch with him. If you could shed any light on this you might do so at the same time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRUSSEL-HIPWELL ENGINES LIMITED,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant General Manager.\n\nEnclosure: 5 K.W. spec.\nDiesel Power\nMultiple Engine Spec.\nJune 11th, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMAJOR MACKAY\n\nIn reply to Mr. Gibson's memorandum of June 3rd, the funds have been provided in the current year's appropriation for school buildings at the undermentioned points in the Northwest Territories and Yukon:\n\nNorthwest Territories:\n(1) Rocher River\n(2) Fort Norman\n(3) Fort Franklin\n(4) Fort Good Hope\n(5) Arctic Red River\n(6) Hay River\n\nYukon:\n(7) Mayo\n(8) Teslin\n\nThe first seven mentioned above are day schools, and are intended to provide educational facilities that are necessary for Indian, half-breed and white children at the points shown above.\n\nConstruction of the seven day schools is under the direction of the Public Works Department, who have working crews in that part of the country.

A few expensive models were built for the amusement of wealthy Europeans who could buy them, but transportation by motor vehicle remained out of reach of the masses until several ingenious American mechanics turned their attention toward the European toys.\n\nThese pioneers visualized the day when motor vehicles would become a common tool for all men, and toward that end they worked to build a better, cheaper car using special machinery and more efficient methods of manufacture. Soon the toy of wealthy Europeans became the tool of working Americans.\n\nThat, according to the Automobile Manufacturers Association is how it happened that this year the United States completed the building of its 100 millionth motor vehicle. During the same period the rest of the world combined has produced only 24 million; so today our country has one passenger car for every five persons while the rest of the world has one for every 231 persons.\n\nWhat are the reasons for America's superiority in motor transportation? Perhaps the best single answer is\u2014freedom. Freedom to plan, invest, buy, and invent has enabled each manufacturer to compete with other manufacturers for a fair share of the mass market. Frequent advertising and sell has made it possible to create that market in the minds of free men. Last, but perhaps the most important reason, is our system of free roads.\n\nTHE NEED FOR MODERN HIGHWAYS\n\nThe first census of American roads was taken in 1904, several years before automobiles began to appear in any numbers. It revealed that there were then 2,151,570 miles of rural highways in the United States, but only 141 miles were paved. This was not the kind of road system needed to encourage motor transportation, but it did, at least, provide a point from which to start working.\n\nThroughout the period from 1904, highway development has lagged behind that of motor vehicles. When automobiles were first made available, roads were little more than crooked, dusty or mud-choked trails totally unsuited for motor transportation. Public demand for passenger cars created a strong demand for surfaced, all-weather roads, which were built as fast as funds could be made available. However, the urgent need for lifting rural roads out of the mud, left little time in which to consider future needs, so that shortly after highways were completed, they became outmoded because of new vehicle developments.\n\nToday, as in the past, vehicle manufacturers are far ahead of road builders. Cars have been made to travel faster even though steep hills, sharp curves, and narrow pavements still exist on our highways. The design of new and better trucks is limited by narrow, weak bridges, unstable pavements, and steep grades.\n\nEfforts are being made in every state to advance highway construction to standards comparable with motor vehicle developments. Even more important, engineers are attempting to anticipate highway needs ten or twenty years from now so that roads built today will still be adequate then. This is a difficult, expensive task, but it is the only way to keep vehicle manufacturers from saying to the public, \"We could give you better cars if our roads were capable of handling them.\"\nOlympic National Park\n\nA unique blend of nature's objects and processes combined with an unusual climate\n\nby Gunnar Fagerlund\n\nIn 1788, while sailing near the coast of northern Washington, John Meares, the English navigator, saw a dominating, glacier-clad peak and was so impressed with its beauty that he named it Mount Olympus after the mythical abode of the Greek Gods in Macedonia. The Olympic Peninsula and the Olympic Mountains derive their names from the mountain.\n\nThe Olympic Mountains remained a land of mystery for more than a hundred years after Meares saw them. Even today many areas have not been trod by the foot of man.\n\nWhen in 1938 Congress established Olympic National Park, conservationists the country over realized the fruits of 34 years of struggle to preserve a superb forest and mountain wilderness. They had fought in vain with a bill in Congress to establish the Elk National Park. It failed to pass, but in 1909 President Theodore Roosevelt set aside 600,000 acres of the Olympic wilderness as Mount Olympus National Monument. From 1912 to 1929 half of this area was withdrawn and returned to commercial use. The 1938 Act provided for a national park of 898,000 acres, which has since been reduced to about 850,000 acres. At present only Yellowstone, Mount McKinley, and Glacier National Parks are larger than Olympic.\n\nCongress had three reasons for establishing this park: (1) preservation of a substantial area of virgin coniferous \"rain forest,\" (2) protection and preservation of interesting fauna, notably the Roosevelt Elk, (3) protection of some of the finest scenic wilderness areas in the nation. As a national park the values inherent in this wilderness are preserved for the inspirational and educational benefit of all the people of this and future generations.\n\nOlympic National Park's outstanding features are mainly a result of the wet climate. The wettest climate in the continental United States prevails on the west side of the park where yearly precipitation exceeds 140 inches. In contrast the east slope of the park is the driest on the west coast, outside of southern California.\n\nThrough the centuries an extraordinary forest growth has developed on the western slopes of the Olympics. The predominant forest: Sitka spruce, Douglas fir, red cedar and western hemlock. They attain heights that exceed 200 feet and diameters greater than 10 feet. Here are found the largest Douglas fir and the largest red cedar on record. They are 17 feet 8 inches and 20 feet in diameter, respectively.\n\nThe rain forest offers more than big trees. It is a fairyland of plant life, not dark and gloomy, but luminous with a misty green light. Mosses are everywhere, forming a soft carpet underfoot and creating draperies to decorate the whole forest. Even the sphagnum or peat moss grows here, not in bogs but on the ground and on trees. Epiphytic ferns (air plants) venture nearly to the tops of some trees.\n\nAs mountains go, the Olympics are not high. Olympus, the highest of the peaks, fails to reach 8,000 feet, but this mountain mass has its base at sea level. Many peaks in Olympic National Park are over 7,000 feet high.\n\nNobody knows exactly how much snow falls in the high country around Mount Olympus, but from the amount of water that flows back to the ocean in streams, it has been calculated that precipitation must be close to 250 inches every year. The summers are not long enough nor warm enough to melt all the snow, and under such conditions glaciers are born and grow. The glaciers have not all been counted, but there are probably more than a hundred in Olympic National Park. Most of these are small, but a few exceed two miles in length.\n\nAll the Olympic mountain glaciers combined cover 30 square miles or more. But the high country is not all snow and ice. By the first of July the snow has melted away from most of it, and on the heels of the melting drifts comes a kaleidoscope of alpine flower gardens in which the pattern of species changes from spring to fall.\n\nWith the melting of the snow, animal life, too, springs quickly into action in the high country to take full advantage of the few summer months. The Roosevelt Elk, numbering nearly 5,000, move upward, the cows to rear their calves and the bulls to grow their antlers on the abundant, mineral-rich forage. During this important business the cows and bulls remain separated. As autumn approaches antlers are matured, the females harden and the polygamous bulls rejoin the herds of cows. Each bull strives to secure as large a harem of cows as he can and many are left without followers.\nBut these bachelors don't give up hope. Their bugling challenges often lead to fights in their attempts to take over a herd. One of the most stirring sounds in nature is the bugling of the bull elk during the mating season.\n\nOf animal species, no matter how interesting and magnificent, does not make a complete national park wildlife picture. Plant eaters and flesh eaters, animals that prey and those that are preyed upon are equally important. It is the assemblage of all the native animals living undisturbed in their natural home that the National Park Service believes is important. The Olympic wildlife picture includes deer, cougar, black bear, marmot, beaver, otter, mink, skunk, weasel, raccoon and many other mammals.\n\nUp to now there are few roads, and the bulk of this wilderness park probably will never be penetrated by a road. Nevertheless, it is possible for the visitor to see a considerable part of the park from an automobile. Roads extend up some of the river valleys a short distance into the park. Coniferous rain forests can be seen in the valleys of the Hoh, Queets, or Quinault Rivers, and during the winter, elk will likely be seen there also. Two winding mountain roads rise to elevations of 6,000 feet where Mount Olympus and much of the interior Olympics may be viewed. The Cascades, a hundred miles away to the east, are visible, and to the north the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Vancouver Island can be seen. But to fully appreciate and enjoy the park's attractions, visitors should venture onto the trails either on horseback or on foot.\n\nOlympic National Park is easily reached from Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, Bremerton or Aberdeen, Washington, and from Vancouver or Victoria, British Columbia. Ferry boats cross Puget Sound on regular schedules from Seattle and Edmonds.\n\nLodges, hotels, and cabin camps are available in and outside the park along the Olympic Loop Highway, U. S. 101. This highway may be entered from Olympia without needing to ferry.\n\nIf you prefer to camp, the National Park Service maintains campgrounds along the spur roads that penetrate the park and on Highway 101 at Lake Crescent.\n\nMaryland gives U. S. 40 a face-lifting\n\nFive-million dollar rehabilitation program on 20 miles of dual highway between Baltimore and Philadelphia places burden on the stabilizing effect of subdrainage pipe\n\nby W. H. Spindler\n\nEditor, The Highway Magazine\n\nAbout a decade ago the Maryland State Roads Commission built a modern, high-type dual divided-lane highway to replace the obsolete, U. S. Route 40 between Baltimore, Maryland, and Wilmington, Delaware. Alignment, grading and sight distances were excellent. The 26-foot concrete lanes were constructed with a low lip curb on the inside and were divided by a crowned, grassed parkway area.\n\nMost of the pavement was laid on a pervious subbase, but in some instances without adequate drainage. Conditions proved more severe than anticipated. Traffic was and is extremely dense, with a high concentration of heavy, through trucks. During the war years, the Edgewood Arsenal, the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, the Martin bomber plant and other war industries contributed heavily to the traffic on this highway.\n\nTo make things worse, long sections of U. S. 40 cross low, tidal marsh areas where it was difficult to secure a stable foundation for the pavement, thus there was severe cracking and settlement. Experience has since proved to the Maryland State Roads Commission that adequate subdrainage in the cut sections would have lowered the water table and prevented subsurface water from rendering the pavement foundation unstable.\n\nDrastic action was necessary to salvage this comparatively new highway. Engineers and officials of the Maryland State Roads Commission faced the issue courageously and took a \"stitch in time\" by ordering an extensive resurfacing and drainage program. Early in 1948 four contracts were let for repaving 20.465 miles of U. S. Route 40 between Baltimore and Aberdeen. These contracts were sixty per cent completed as of November 1, 1948.\n\nThe reconstruction of U. S. 40 includes three phases: (1) Removing the lip curbs\nUnstable subgrades caused the pavement on U.S. 40 to settle and crack. The repaved area in the left photo shows the depth and extent of settlement at one point on the highway. In the right photo, half of the pavement was replaced. Note the condition of the other half.\u2014HIGHWAY MAGAZINE PHOTO\n\non the inside lanes, changing from a crowned to a depressed parkway between the pavement lanes, and installing drainage inlets at all low points; (2) placing a subdrain pipe along both sides of each lane to drain the pervious subbase, and providing outlets at each low point in the grade line; and (3) widening the pavement slabs from 20 to 24 feet (2 feet on each side), and covering the old pavement with a concrete slab 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)-\\(7\\frac{1}{2}\\)-5 inches thick. Another phase of the work is complete reconstruction of the approach slabs and subbases at all bridges.\n\nPrecedent for this type of reconstruction was established by favorable experiences in the use of subdrainage on sections of this road and on an adjoining section of U.S. 40 near Elkton, Maryland. On the latter, 18,000 feet of 8-in. perforated metal pipe was installed in 1946 for subsurface and base drainage. On some of the sections involved in this reconstruction, maintenance forces of the Maryland State Roads Commission installed several thousand feet of perforated metal pipe to drain the subbase with the result that under unusually severe conditions, the pavement at these locations has withstood the heavy traffic without failure.\n\nFour contracts for adjoining projects were awarded by the Maryland State Roads Commission during the period June 30, 1948. Work was started between June 10 and July 22 inclusive. The starting point for this work was at Rossville, about 3 miles east of the Baltimore city limits. The first section of 4.086 miles was awarded to Carozza-Hamill & Company of Baltimore, Maryland, at $1,052,925.00. The second section of 5.052 miles beginning 2,200 feet east of Covington Road and extending to 1.5 miles east of Little Gunpowder River was awarded to C. J. Landefield & Sons, Inc., of Baltimore, Maryland, at $1,063,308.20. The third section of 6.157 miles which extends to 0.5 miles west of Bynum Run was awarded to the Wilson Contracting Company, Inc., of Newcastle, Delaware, at $1,428,246.50. The fourth section of 5.17 miles which extended to Aberdeen, Maryland, was awarded to the Rea Construction Company of Charlotte, North Carolina, at $1,229,471.50.\n\nThese contracts involved the following quantities of subdrainage pipe:\n\n(1) 76,200 ft. clay cradle-invert pipe\n4,200 ft. of 6-in. vitrified clay pipe outlets\n\n(2) 100,000 ft. of 6-in. ARMCO HEL-COR Perforated Pipe\n4,880 ft. of 6-in. ARMCO HEL-COR (not perforated)\n\n(3) 112,000 ft. of 6-in. ARMCO HEL-COR Perforated Pipe\n4,500 ft. of 6-in. ARMCO HEL-COR (not perforated)\n\n(4) 81,000 ft. of 6-in. ARMCO HEL-COR Perforated Pipe\n3,500 ft. of 6-in. ARMCO HEL-COR (not perforated)\n\nBid prices for this pipe, including laying, aligning and connecting ranged from $1.18 to $1.50 per foot.\n\nConstruction was started by all four contractors on the east-bound lane. Meanwhile, traffic was diverted to the westbound lane, and the road was well posted in order to keep travelers at a minimum on the two heavily traveled lanes.\n\nThe original pavement consisted of two 10-foot lanes of 9-7-9-inch thick concrete with a lip curb on the inside edge. The first step consisted of breaking off this lip curb with pavement breakers. Each side of the pavement was to be widened 2 feet, increasing the overall width from 20 to 24 feet, with widened sections having a uniform thickness of 10 inches.\n\nThe trench for this widened section was excavated by means of an auto-patrol grader which also removed the earth for the 7-foot gravel shoulder on the outside and the depressed parkway on the inside. A mechanical loader was used to remove the earth excavated from the trench and shoulder. Standard trenching machines were used to excavate the 18-inch wide trench for the sub-drains. A layer of gravel was placed in the bottom of the subdrain trench as a bed for the pipe, which had been strung along each side of the pavement.\n\nThe perforated metal underdrain was placed with the perforations down. Pervious backfill (46 stone) was placed around and over the pipe by means of an ingenious piece of equipment. This consisted of a self-propelled machine into which dump trucks discharged their loads while being pushed (out of gear) ahead of the discharge trough. A belt-conveyor moved the pervious backfill into the trench where a strike-off kept it at the proper level, about 6 inches above the pipe. Then a base layer was added to fill the trench. The top 6-inch layer consisted of material having a plasticity index ranging between 3 and 6. All of this subbase material was compacted with a light roller. The sub-drains along the outside edge of the pave-\n\nTraffic used one of the dual lanes while contractors installed subdrains and paved the other. The entire parkway was depressed to aid drainage.\n\nPerforating machines were used to trench 18 inches wide on both sides of each concrete pavement. HEL-COR Perforated Pipe was then installed to remove water from the subgrade and prevent future breakups.\nA specially-built machine covered the pipe with porous backfill material, automatically heeling it off at a height about 6 inches above the pipe. A maximum of 4500 feet of pipe was laid and covered in one day by a 6-man crew, shown in the picture.\n\nThe new concrete surface, 24 feet wide, is required to be poured in one operation. Air-entraining cement is used. Curing of the pavement is done by spraying a thin bituminous coating over the surface and edges as soon as it has taken its initial set. This retards evaporation of moisture from the newly laid concrete pavement.\n\nOn the three contracts in which perforated corrugated metal pipe was used for the subdrains, about 650 feet each of the southbound lane was completed by early September, 1948. Traffic was being diverted to this completed pavement as work began on the westbound lane.\n\nPlans and surveys for the reconstruction projects were prepared by J. Spence Howard, Consulting Engineer, Baltimore, Maryland. Contracts were let by the Maryland State Roads Commission for which W. F. Childs, Jr., is Chief Engineer. Inspection of construction is under the direction of D. P. Campbell, District Engineer and T. M.

Over half a million dollars and two years' time were saved by aerial topographic mapping for the highway's design and location.\n\nAerial mapping proved to have several advantages over conventional ground surveying methods on this big project. Aerial maps can be produced faster, and inaccuracies are reduced to a minimum. But perhaps the most important advantage in these days of high costs is the economy of aerial mapping. The design and location engineers for the turnpike extension estimated that the aerial mapping was accomplished at one-fifth the cost of ground surveys. Moreover, the aerial method made possible the gathering of necessary data without divulging the proposed location at an early date to land speculators.\n\nThe route of the extension was flown and photographed in comparatively few days, without the help of ground surveyors. The newspapers of Pennsylvania, which joined in the wide general guessing regarding the probable route, failed to name any point within 5 miles of the actual route, and the highway's location remained secret until the governor of Pennsylvania formally announced the route.\n\nThe location studies for the new 100-mile extension, which will be a two-lane divided expressway linking Harrisburg and Philadelphia, were carried out by Gannett, Fleming, Corddry, and Carpenter, Inc., design and location engineers of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. They hired Aero Service Corporation...\nof Philadelphia to perform the aerial mapping. Aero Service completed the topographic mapping in the record time of 145 days. The first map sheets were delivered within 45 days after the work began, and partial deliveries were made at 30-day intervals thereafter until the final group was completed.\n\nFor the final design and location data it was necessary to have a large number of field men on the job. However, the use of aerial photography reduced the staff which would have been needed for the surveying, had ground methods been used for the entire project. This work was done during a period when there was an acute shortage of engineering personnel, and aerial surveys made it possible to carry out the project without serious delays.\n\nA proposal is now under consideration that final location be based on aerial topographic maps made on a larger scale with smaller contour intervals. The accuracy of the aerial mapping for the preliminary location indicates that this is entirely practical. Aero Service has mapped 2-foot contour intervals in other fields, and the application of this technique to highway work is being studied.\n\nWhile aerial mapping at the smaller contour intervals is necessarily more expensive, it is felt that the increase in cost will still be less than the cost of ground surveys necessary.\n\nThe cost of the photogrammetric work on the eastern extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike was less than $1.00 per acre. The men engaged in designing this highway maintain that engineering involved in the location work will probably be the only operation to cost less than similar work on the original 160-mile strip.\n\nSince aerial mapping must be done when foliage is off the trees, those involved in planning the project concentrated only on general route studies during the summer months of 1947. An outline of the through course of flight was made from maps of the United States Geodetic Survey, Army Map Service, and the Pennsylvania Department of Highways. The photogrammetric work was done in the autumn of 1947, and the Aero Service Corporation, which has over 2,000,000 square miles of mapping experience, carried on this work at the rate of about one square mile of finished topography per day.\n\nApril \u2022 1949\npilot and photographer used a single-engine light plane with good range and stability to map the proposed route. They flew at a height of more than a mile above the area, using a Brock camera to photograph the ground on glass plate negatives. The photographer exposed the plates at approximately 20-second intervals.\n\nThese glass plate negatives were flown to the aerial surveyor's laboratories in Philadelphia daily. Prints were made, and sets were returned each day to field surveyors who established the necessary horizontal and vertical control data. These crews used new precision theodolites, combining traverse and bench leveling.\n\nRadio communication was also used to speed ground survey work. Field parties used short-wave radio receiving and broadcasting units, powered by self-contained battery units, to coordinate basic control.\n\nWith the field survey data at hand, topographic maps were compiled from the aerial surveys. The individual photographs were exposed so that full stereoscopic coverage was obtained for each area. This method employs basically the same principles as the old parlor stereopticon, but modern aerial photographs are made by means of precision cameras and lenses and are therefore more accurate. Each photographic plate has a forward overlap of 55 per cent as well as considerable overlap on the sides. These photographs were taken about a half mile apart at an altitude of more than a mile, giving greater accuracy and increased stereoscopic depth in the view.\n\nAfter field surveys established control points and the plates were rectified for tilt, contouring began. The mapping equipment operates on a principle similar to a military range finder. A stereometer operator measured the exact ground elevations from the views. He was then able to draw contours on the photograph to within one-half the contour interval. Planimetric detail appearing on the aerial photos was then added to the topographic maps.\n\nCollateral photographic information, to increase the usefulness of the maps, required intensive preparation. This included photo-mosaics with a scale of 1 inch to 400 feet and boundaries corresponding to the topographic maps; a set of contact prints from the mapping negatives at a scale of 1 inch to 1,000 feet; a set of enlargements at a scale of 1 inch to 400 feet; an assembled photo index for all photography completed; and a tabulation describing the elevations and coordinates of the aerial mapping control points.\n\nThe savings in time and costs through aerial mapping on the eastern extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike recommend its use on other highway projects. Many states have already employed this method in highway projects, and some cities, notably Cleveland and Cincinnati, Ohio, are using aerial methods for their city mapping. In any project requiring the mapping of large areas, rapidly and economically, aerial mapping can be an important surveying tool for the modern engineer.\n\nMan-made rain\n\nEconomy, efficiency, and better crops result from sprinkler irrigation\n\nby W. A. Groom\n\nPresident, Colorado Association of Soil Conservation Districts\n\nIn the early days of irrigation, water was plentiful, the land was fertile and cheap, labor costs were low, and very little thought was paid to fertilization and conservation of the soil and water. Now that production costs are continuously increasing and a large amount of the rich top soil has been washed away, farmers in general, and orchard men in particular, are becoming more interested in better ways of applying water.\n\nIn choosing an irrigation system, these points should be kept in mind: cost of applying water, even distribution, proper penetration, soil fertility, soil erosion and water supply.\n\nWith the old method of flooding or furrow irrigation it required the constant attention of a man to see that the water was evenly distributed and running where it was wanted. This is expensive at the present rate of labor, and it is almost impossible to get all the land uniformly wet as there are always high and low spots. The high spots remain dry and the low spots drown out unless careful and expensive leveling has been done and care is taken from year to year to keep the surface of the land uniform.\n\nProper penetration of water and uniform depth of penetration is very essential in plant growth as it is necessary to get the water to the depth the plants feed. If more water than necessary is used, soil fertility is carried below the roots and wasted. In order to get the desired penetration and also get the surface soil wet at the lower end of the field, with the old method a great deal more water had to be applied at the upper end than was needed, which resulted in a waste of water and the loss of fertility.\n\nWatering a field of pole beans. Notice that the sprinkler line has been run across the top of the poles.\n\n\u2014Grooms et al., authors.\n\nIn the early days of irrigation, very little thought was given to the slope of the land so long as water would run. This caused an enormous amount of erosion on some lands and a waste of water.\n\nThe sprinkler system, since the use of light-weight pipe has been adopted, takes...\ncare of nearly all these features. The cost of operation is small, depth of penetration can be controlled, and an even application of water to the topsoil can be secured. By controlling the amount of water applied and penetration, soluble mineral elements are retained in the root zone area and leaching of this valuable material prevented. Since there is no runoff from use of sprinklers, there is no erosion and loss of valuable topsoil. There is no need for expensive leveling as the pipe can be run over most uneven land. Irrigation engineers claim sprinklers save only 10 to 40 per cent as much water as the old method. This is a very vital advantage, as it is becoming more and more necessary to use our water to its greatest efficiency over more acreage in order to feed the ever increasing population of the world.\n\nIt has been found that the main feeder roots of trees, as well as all other crops, are close to the surface of the soil, and that this is where the fertility, both mineral and organic, should be put. Orchard men are turning to cover crops to supply organic matter. Under the old method of irrigation a great deal more water was needed to germinate these small seeds than was good for the trees. With sprinklers the surface can be kept moist enough for a good growth of a cover crop without adding to the free water table in the subsoil.\n\nThe use of commercial fertilizers is becoming more common in the growing of all crops. How to get this fertility into the soil so it will be uniformly available to all the feeder roots has always been a problem. The sprinklers, together with liquid fertilizer, will solve this as the desired amount of fertilizer can be run through the sprinklers and then enough water put on the land to get this material down to the proper depth so the feeder roots can pick it up and make use of it.\n\nSprinklers are like every other method of irrigation in that the farmer must study his land, his application of water, and see that his system is working properly at all times. The time has not yet arrived when we can rely by the pushbutton method. But by proper use and care, sprinklers should conserve both the topsoil and water, and produce better crops at a substantially lower cost. It will eliminate the high dry spots and the low wet spots. Moreover, in a great many cases the cost of a sprinkler system will be less than the cost of leveling the land for an old style system of irrigation.\n\nFailure of a front tire is almost three times as likely to result in an accident as is a failure of a rear tire or a trailer tire.\n\nOntario highway reception centers\n\nProviding free travel service for visitors to Canada\n\nby James Montagnes\n\nAmerican motorists crossing the international border into Ontario, Canada's most popular vacation province, no longer have to go hunting for someone to give them information about roads, hotel accommodations or good fishing spots. At twelve points on the international border the Ontario government has opened reception centers where attractively uniformed girls have the latest data available on most any subject the motorist and his family want to know about Ontario.\n\nThe reception centers, as more than just information booths on road conditions. Not only is the latest data on provincial roads available, but the girls can also tell the motorist what he is most likely to find lodgings if he has no advance reservations. They will even put through long distance calls, at no charge, to make reservations for the traveler if necessary. Many tourists pick their destinations without securing advance reservations and find that there are no accommodations open when they arrive. The Ontario receptionist will phone ahead for information, and if it is too crowded at the one locality, she will be able to recommend another suitable resort.\n\nPart of the system to make the reception centers most useful to visiting American motorists, is an accurate up-to-date check on tourist accommodations throughout the province at frequent intervals. In this way each reception center is kept posted on the number of vacancies at hotels and camps, and can advise the motorist where he is most likely to find good lodgings.\n\nThe reception centers are attractive bungalows, tastefully decorated, and staffed at all times by two or three girl attendants. Most of the reception centers are open about 18 hours a day, and on busy holiday weekends they may be open longer. The girls work in shifts, so that there are always enough on hand to answer all questions. The inform...\nOntario's reception centers are attractively furnished and provide pamphlets, maps, writing paper, postcards, telephones, and clean rest rooms. Attendants dispense accurate travel information and will even assist in arranging accommodations.\n\nTolls To Be Raised On Maine Turnpike\n\nThe executive director of the Maine Turnpike Authority announced that tolls for passenger cars will be increased from 50 cents to 60 cents on May 1. Tolls for commercial vehicles will be increased from 5 cents up to 25 cents depending on the classification. He said these increases are necessary to offset higher costs than were anticipated when toll structures were set up and also to improve revenues. A deficit has been threatening the turnpike.\n\nTwo Dayton, Ohio, auto thieves are in jail because a quick-witted police telephone operator trapped them by turning downtown traffic lights red.

H. SPINDLER, EDITOR\nC. W. CAMPBELL, ASSOCIATE EDITOR\nEDITORIAL OFFICE: MIDDLETOWN, OHIO\nCarlsbad Caverns National Park\n\nThe world's greatest underground wonderland\n\nby Donald S. Libbey\n\nSuperintendent, Carlsbad Caverns National Park\n\nCarlsbad Caverns National Park is located in southeastern New Mexico approximately 27 miles from the city of Carlsbad. Although the park area is in the rugged foothills of the Guadalupe Mountains, the region consists of picturesque semi-desert country. Its cactus vegetation is as strange as the vast network of subterranean passageways, and its vaulted chambers are draped with myriad dripstone and flowstone formations. The ceilings hang stalactites and helictites of fantastic shapes and color designs and from the floors of the many rooms extend stalagmites of tremendous size.\n\nAll that is known of the first man to see the entrance of Carlsbad Caverns is that he was an Indian. Evidences of prehistoric inhabitation are the circular rock mescal or cooking pits and the grinding bowls found on the surface, in addition to the paintings, or photographs, found on the walls of the entrance. It is doubtful, however, that the Indians ventured far into the caverns.\n\nEarly pioneer trails passed near the caverns' entrance. The Spanish conquistadors are believed to have come into the Guadalupe Mountains near the caverns, and the historic old Butterfield Express Trail, the first express trail across the West, crossed the route of the Spaniards at this point.\n\nClosely following the wayfarers of the Butterfield Trail came the cattlemen and the first permanent settlers. They knew of the caverns, referring to them as the Bat Cave, and may have explored portions of them. Their interest, however, was not caused by their natural beauty but by the discovery of valuable deposits of bat guano. Mining operations to remove this nitrate-rich fertilizer began at the turn of the century, and the guano miners made extended explorations of the underground chambers and passageways.\n\nAmong these early miners was a local youth, Jim White. He was impressed by the wonders he saw beneath the surface and took every opportunity of visiting the caverns and encouraged others to visit them. Later, Jim White became an unofficial guide for the caverns, and when the area was included within the national park system, he was made a park ranger and subsequently, chief ranger.\n\nAs more settlers came to the region the fame of the caverns grew, and in 1923 Robert Holley, of the General Land Office, United States Department of the Interior, surveyed the cave to determine whether it should be included in the areas making up the national park system. His report stressed the magnificence of the caverns, and on October 25, 1923, President Coolidge proclaimed the area the Carlsbad Cave National Monument. Also in 1923, and again in 1924, Dr. Willis T. Lee, of the Geological Survey, made comprehensive explorations, and the publishing of his findings in the National Geographic Magazine gave the caverns national publicity. An act of Congress, approved May 14, 1930, changed the status of the area to the Carlsbad Caverns National Park.\n\nThe underground caverns are extensive with over 23 miles of explored passageways, some rich in cave formations and others of archeological interest. The park area itself covers an area of 49,608 acres.\n\nAn understanding of the manner in which these vast subsurface caverns have been formed is no less interesting than the thrill of visiting them. The study of this underground wonderland and the rock structure in the area of the Guadalupe range makes it evident that two great geological processes were active in the creation of the caverns. The first process accomplished the hollowing-out of an extensive network of subterranean chambers and passageways in the once-solid rock; the second produced the spectacular decorative array of travertine, drapestone formations that embellish the walls, ceilings and even the floors.\n\nVisitors to Carlsbad Caverns explore three miles of well lighted trails leading through...\nthe most spectacular portion of the caverns. All who are physically capable of the cavern visit are urged to make the complete tours which require about four hours and involve walking down several flights of stairs, entrance on ramp-like trails and stair steps through what is termed the Main Corridor on the top of the ancient rubble heap of rock fragments that developed during the first stage in the formative process.\n\nThe true cavern floor is reached in the first of four scenic rooms. The Green Lake Room, which is 829 feet below the surface, is a chamber of breathtaking beauty with draperies, dazzling white columns, and literally thousands of stalactites. Formed by a constant drip from the ceiling, the blue-green water of the Green Lake is mirror-clear. Any visitor can be seen a \"Frozen Waterfall\" of glistening flowstone, which for all the world resembles a raging torrent of \"white water\" frozen in place with all the rapids and cataracts preserved.\n\nSuperlatives, however, should be saved for the next room, the King's Palace. This is generally considered the most beautiful room in the caverns. It is circular in form with a profusion of fantastic stalactites and draperies hanging from the ceiling. The forms range in architectural style from ornate Gothic through the most florid Baroque to intricate filigree traceries in stone that suggest Moorish embellishments.\n\nThe \"key-hole\" separates the King's Palace from the Queen's Chamber. This opening is through delicate sheets of translucent, gleaming onyx that swirl like vast theatrical curtains. The Queen's Chamber, though smaller in size, excels even the Palace in intricacy of design and magnitude of the draperies.\n\nAfter passing through the smallest of the scenic rooms, the Papoose Room, the path leads into the King's Palace and then climbs \"appetite hill\" some eighty feet to the level of the underground lunch room. A stop of 40 minutes is made 754 feet below the surface in this natural lunch room, a space so large than one thousand people can dine at the same time.\n\nThe first part of the tour from the natural entrance down the main corridor and through the four scenic rooms involves the steep descent and a walk of 1\u00be miles in order to reach the lunch room.\n\nAfter luncheon visitors are escorted around the edge of the Big Room, which is shaped like a gigantic cross two thousand feet in length and eleven hundred feet in width. Its grandiose size, the high vaulted ceilings, and the massive, even monumental, formations defy description. The ceiling rises 285 feet above the trail and a stalagmite towers 62 feet in height. The wings of an angel, painted grottoes, a \"Bottomless Pit,\" the huge unsupported natural arch, totem poles, intricate varicolored chandeliers, a \"Fairyland,\" and the \"Hall of Giants\" combine to create the most impressive and inspiring mass of natural formations to be found in any underground wonderland.\n\nThe bat spectacle is one of the great attractions of Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Each evening about sundown a great number of bats come forth from Bat Cave during the frost-free months. Flying out through the entrance arch in a spiral, they stream off over the rim in a southerly direction, later to separate into flocks which disappear in the distance for a night's foraging. When night-flying insects such as moths and beetles are numerous literally millions of bats join the flight, but as the insect food supply wanes so does the number of bats, and during the winter months most of them migrate to warmer regions.\n\nBats return from their nocturnal insect feeding just before dawn. They dive into the entrance at amazingly high speed and fly directly to the Bat Cave, where they spend the daylight hours at rest. Bats at roost hang by their hind legs, head downward, in dense clusters from the ceiling of their particular part of the caverns.\n\nA talk on the bats is given by a national park service naturalist each summer evening at the cavern's entrance just before the flight begins.\n\nCarlsbad Caverns is a year-around park. Four complete cavern tours occur each day, starting at 9, 10, 11 A.M., and 12:15 P.M. It requires from 4 to 4\u00bd hours to complete a tour and return to the surface. All visitors have the opportunity to return to the surface by elevator service, although after the completion of the 10 and 11 A.M. tours, those who desire have the opportunity to return to the surface by the cavern trails.\n\nEach day a special photographic tour starts from the cavern lunch room and those with flash bulbs and tripods are given an opportunity to photograph many of the formations. Only snapshots are permitted on regular tours, but they are not encouraged since the cavern lighting is not adequate for such exposures.\n\nCarlsbad Caverns National Park is served by the Santa Fe Railroad on the north through the city of Carlsbad. Train passengers can reach the park by auto, bus or taxi-cab. The park is also served by the Texas and Pacific, Rock Island, and Southern Pacific Railroads by way of El Paso. Daily airplane service is provided to the Carlsbad airport. By automobile the park can be reached over U.S. Highway No. 62, U.S. Highway No. 285, and from U.S. Highway No. 80.\n\nAll visitors are conducted through the caverns by national park rangers who explain the caverns story and are glad to impart authentic information.\nMetal forms for concrete piers\n\nAt Riverton, Cherokee County, Kansas, the Long Construction Company of Kansas City, Missouri, devised a unique and economical system of driving forms for deep concrete foundation piers. The piers were poured for a boiler and turbine plant erected as part of a new 30,000 KW generating unit for the Empire District Electric Company.\n\nTest borings indicated that it would be necessary to excavate 70 feet deep for most of the piers to reach a solid foundation. A 4-foot diameter was specified for 12 of them while the remaining twenty were 6 feet 7 inches in diameter. All piers consisted of reinforced concrete.\n\nWhile the first few feet of earth was being excavated for each pier, workmen made up 12-foot sections of cylindrical forms on top of the ground. One of these was lowered into the hole as soon as it was deep enough. The sections were made up by placing pieces of 10 gage ARMCO Flange-type Sheeting around circular bands of angle-iron. Because of the light weight and flexibility of this sheeting, it was easily formed around the small circles. The flanges of adjacent sheets were overlapped to provide tighter joints and assure straighter driving.\n\nAfter a section of the forms had been lowered into the hole for the pier, excavation proceeded to a depth 3 or 4 feet below the bottom of the sheeting. The digging was performed by hand with a bucket hole being used to remove the dirt from the hole. Each piece of sheeting in the form was then driven individually by an air hammer to the bottom of the excavation. Additional circular angle-iron bands were installed every 6 feet and separated by metal bars. This procedure continued until the 12-foot lengths of sheeting in the first section of forms had been driven almost entirely into the ground.\n\nAt this point, an additional piece of sheeting was welded to the top of each piece in the first section, and driving continued in the manner outlined above. Before welding on additional sheets, it was necessary to trim a few inches of metal from the driven end of each sheet to secure a neat, strong connecting weld.\n\nWhen the proper depth of excavation was reached, cylinders of reinforcing steel, previously assembled on top of the ground, were lowered into the hole. The concrete was then poured in approximately 12-foot lifts. Before this concrete received its initial set, the length of sheeting was pulled up to the connecting weld, burned off, and reclaimed for future use. The device used for pulling the sheeting consisted of a pair of metal tongs connected to an air hammer and suspended from the cable of a crane.\n\nBy using ARMCO Steel Sheeting to make up the forms, the contractor was able to reclaim the material in the forms and use it again and again with very little loss of metal. Its light weight made it convenient to handle, and its durability and strength enabled it to resist damage in driving and pulling.\n\nFloyd Gibbons was superintendent of the project for the Long Construction Company.

In order to prevent erosion of the bare slope along the right-of-way, which might ultimately undermine the road itself, grass has already been planted.\n\nUnder the supervision of T. E. Huffman, Dallas urban expressways engineer for the state highway department, a new method has been used to hold the loose soil on side slopes until the grass has had a chance to grow and grip the ground beneath it with its tenacious roots.\n\nThe operation is simple and efficient. First the ground on the slopes is thoroughly pulverized, and then if necessary, it is raked by hand to remove all large roots, clods and rocks. Following that, the area to be treated is carefully sprayed with water. When the ground has dried sufficiently to be worked on, workers broadcast Bermuda Grass seed over the soil. This seed is raked and rolled into the earth and covered with a layer of asphalt. The asphalt is easily sprayed on by hand or by mechanical sprayers mounted on tank trucks.\n\nThis layer of asphalt is nothing more than a thin membrane which covers the soil. It is adherent enough to hold the earth, thereby preventing erosion, and yet it is thin and delicate enough that the growing grass is able to push its slender blades through the surface and develop to maturity. This asphaltic mixture is necessarily non-toxic to grass plants. As it has proved an economical method of mulching, it is favored by engineers and taxpayers alike.\n\nMr. Huffman, pleased with the results, says \"In about ten days the grass has germinated and is sticking its green shoots through the black asphalt. We expect that Texans will see more and more of this type of seeding work along our highways because it has proved successful in preserving top soil along our rights-of-way.\"\n\nDrive-through Rivals Drive-in\n\nSaid to be the first of its kind in the country, an auto shopping lane will be placed under construction in Chicago this spring. Shoppers will be able to drive their cars into parking areas alongside cars. Groceries, meat, drug store items and even ice cubes may be purchased from behind the steering wheel.\n\nThe 8-acre site will also include parking lots for those who want to stretch their legs while shopping.\n\nAsphalt is being used by the Texas Highway Department to hold the loose earth on banks, ditches and shoulders until a covering of grass or other plants can be grown. Above at the right shows a bare slope damaged by wind erosion. Below, the same slope has been reshaped, seeded and covered with asphalt.\n\n\u2014PHOTOS BY COURTESY TEXAS HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT\nTest Your Powers of Observation\n\nby Louise Price Bell\n\nJust how observant are you?

A NATIONAL PARK in the \"Centennial\" state features the Fire House and Fire Temple among the ruins of ancient cliff dwellers. NAME THE PARK AND THE STATE!\nTiny tunnel for a miniature railroad\n\nLocated in the city of Northampton, Massachusetts, home of Smith College and heart of the Pioneer Valley, Frank Newhall Look Memorial Park is visited by over a quarter million people every year. Opened to the public on July 4, 1930, the park was a gift to the city from Mrs. Look in honor of her husband.\n\nWithin its 160 acres, Look Park contains many entertainment facilities including a swimming pool, locker building, play fields and baseball diamonds, picnic areas, a public store, and the Pines Outdoor Theater, which is large enough to seat 4,500 people. In addition there are many scenic attractions such as the Swan Pond and the Lily Pools.\n\nUnder the management of M. Foss Narum, Look Park is constantly being improved for the enjoyment of children and adults alike. During 1948, a miniature streamlined train, believed to be the first of its kind ever owned and operated by a municipal park, was added to the park.\n\nThe tiny railroad operates over 4,800 feet of 16-inch gauge track and has rolling stock of the most modern design. The locomotive is a model, built on a scale of 1 to 5, of General Motors' newest locomotive, the FP3. Powered by a 4-cylinder, air-cooled 4V motor, its 16 driving wheels give it a drawbar pull of 800 pounds. Details are exact in every respect for the locomotive and cars alike, even to the spacing of the rivets and knobs on the sand box door.\n\nThe track is laid through open fields, where a large expanse of the park is open to view, and through a wooded area bordering an enclosure where many deer are kept. To make the miniature railroad more like its big brothers, a 90-foot tunnel was constructed on the line. This tunnel also serves as a \"round house\" when the train is not in operation.\n\nDesigned by E. J. Dunn and A. J. Runnals of the New England Metal Culvert Company, the tunnel consists of a 10 gage ARMCO MULTI-PLATE Arch with a base width of 6 feet 10 inches and a clear height of 6 feet 4 inches. The two top plates of the arch have a 36-inch radius of curvature while the other two plates are curved on a 200-inch radius.\n\nThe structure is set on metal channels anchored to concrete abutments. Because of subsurface water encountered during excavation, several hundred feet of HEL-COR Perforated Pipe was installed along the sides of the tunnel. In addition, it is expected that portal entrances made of field stone will be added to the arch this summer to more nearly simulate a tunnel on a \"big\" railroad.\n\nThe miniature line operated only a few weeks in 1948, but Narum estimates that during 1949 it will carry close to 100,000 riders.\n\n* * *\n\nThe diameter of the cables on the George Washington suspension bridge, which spans the Hudson River in New York City, is 36 inches.\n\n* * *\n\nAutomobile registrations for 1948 increased 8 per cent over those for 1947. Truck and bus registrations were up 10 per cent for the same period.\nCabrillo Freeway Serves San Diego\n\nby Mark McMillin\n\nConstructed at a cost of $3,500,000, the recently-completed Cabrillo Freeway in California extends 7.1 miles from San Diego to connect with U.S. Highway 395, and is regarded by highway engineers as a model of freeway construction. The new road is a four-lane divided highway, having a width from 150 to 200 feet. Wherever possible, the right of way is fenced.\n\nOriginally planned in 1938, the project was shelved temporarily because of the war. In the meantime, however, other highway units and structures in the vicinity, which have since been completed, were planned as an integral part of the Cabrillo Freeway.\n\nUltimately, the northern terminus, Highway 395, will also be modernized for a distance of approximately 120 miles northeast. This project is now under construction.\n\nIn planning and building the new freeway, highway engineers overcame many difficult problems. It was necessary to acquire approximately 200 separate parcels of land for the right-of-way, and to move several residences to new locations. However, it was not necessary to resort to a single contractor. Twelve contractors were involved in the work, each of them having several different structures under way at the same time. A total of two bridges and 13 grade separations were constructed. Two and one-half miles of city sewer and water mains were relocated and reconstructed, and six miles of culverts and storm drains were installed. Because the freeway bisects Balboa Park, it was also necessary to transplant many shrubs and trees which were in the path of the project.\n\nApproximately 6,000,000 cubic yards of earth was moved because of the hilly nature of the terrain along the entire length of the freeway. All suitable top soil was salvaged as part of the grading operations, and this soil was later spread on the embankment slopes to a depth from 6 to 8 inches. These slopes were then covered with straw and planted with grass to prevent erosion. Within the city proper, the slopes have been planted with shrubs and trees to harmonize with the landscaping of Balboa Park, one of the most beautiful in the world. Approximately half a million plants, in 28 varieties, were used on this phase of the project.\n\nOne interesting feature of the new freeway is the traffic interchange at the Mission Valley Highway. It is the first of its particular type to be placed in service in California. This unit provides for the free flow of traffic in all directions with a minimum of interference.\n\nThe freeway cuts through the heart of the business district in San Diego, but since it has seven times the traffic capacity of any of the downtown streets on which parking is permitted, no serious traffic problems are likely to develop from its use. In fact, the new freeway is expected to reduce the accident rate per million vehicle miles by 40 per cent.\n\nMay \u2022 1949\n\nAnswers to photo quiz on pages 108 and 109\n\n1.

Huntress\n\nIn the Northwest, as in many parts of the country, our modern highways often follow quite closely the old pioneer wagon roads, which in their time followed the earlier Indian trails through the same mountain passes, along the same rivers, and across the same dry stretches of scrub brush. Many of our highway bridges, too, span streams and rivers at ancient crossings.\n\nNowadays few real signs of the past remain along the more traveled highways, but the history-conscious motorist can still find authentic traces of days gone by if he ventures off the beaten track. Among these are old buildings, often scenes of violence in the early days, and here and there even the ruts of the old immigrant roads, always deeper cut on the uphill pulls where the oxen strained against their loads.\n\nOne such stretch of the Old Oregon Trail can still be found just south of Vale, almost at the mid-point on the Oregon-Idaho border, beside a county road leading to the famed Owyhee Dam. A downhill grade, it is not so deeply rutted as some, but is plainly visible, taking a more direct route through the ravine than does the modern road. One can almost reconstruct the thoughts of the pioneers as they approached this particular stretch, for there were much anticipated hot springs just ahead. For the men this meant a warm bath, for the women a bath and a chance to do the family washing after the heat and dust of the trail. Today there's a modern laundry on that spot, just across the river from the town of Vale.\n\nOwyhee Dam, a few miles farther south, draws visitors by the hundreds during the summer, though the road is not yet in the best condition. At the time of its completion, in 1932, the dam was the second highest in the world, raising 405 feet above bedrock and extending 175 feet below. The reservoir formed by the dam extends back some 40 miles in the Owyhee Canyon, one of the wildest and most remote parts of Oregon. This area has long been famous for spectacular scenes and wild horse roundups. The name Owyhee, incidentally, is an early day corruption of Hawaii, and was named for two Hawaiians who were killed by the Snake Indians near there in 1819.\n\nAnother historic spot of interest is Laurel Hill, in the foothills just below Mt. Hood on Oregon State Highway 56. This was a place to strike fear, even despair, into the hearts of the pioneers traversing the old Barlow toll road around the mountain and down toward the Willamette Valley, fertile goal of their months-long journey. The wide paved curves of the highway today carry thousands of skiers from Portland and vicinity up toward Government Camp and Timberline Lodge every winter. Most of them are so intent on the sport above that they fail to consider the contrast of a hundred years ago on that very hill where pioneers eased their loaded wagons down the steep grade from level to level by ropes tied around the trees. It is said that the marks of the ropes can still be seen in a few places.\n\nSherar's bridge across the Deschutes River extracted tolls from travelers in stagecoach days, but all that remains of a once thriving community is the old barn in the background.\n\nif you know where to look for them. \"We went down Laurel Hill like shot off of a shovel,\" wrote William Barkow, son of the road builder.\n\nThis historic hill has its tales of gold, too, both mined and buried by man. Prospect holes bear witness to the former, while loot, said to have been buried by a highwayman who killed his partner and only confessed on his deathbed, has long been sought there in vain.\n\nOne would think the descent of Laurel Hill would have been difficult enough for the weary immigrants, now almost in sight of the \"promised land,\" but a few miles farther down the road they faced another kind of barrier\u2014the toll gate where the charge was $1.00 a head for stock and from $2.50 to $5.00 (accounts differ) for a wagon. Widows, with a touch of generosity, were allowed to go through free, and if a man reaching that point was quite destitute, he could pay by promissory note.\nOver on the Deschutes River, famous fishing stream of central Oregon, there's a bridge that marks a crossing with more than its share of exciting history. Sherar's Bridge is still its name, though the actual bridge there now is simply another familiar white-fenced highway bridge, and the real Sherar's Bridge is long gone. A few miles below Tygh Valley, it stands on the route of the old stagecoach road from the mines on the Columbia River to the John Day mines. This is the road that was so dangerous it had to be guarded by U.S. cavalry for many years to protect travelers against holdups by Indians and outlaw whites.\n\nAt the site of an ancient Indian crossing, the first bridge was built in 1860. Swept away by a flood the next year, it was rebuilt in 1862, and nine years later was bought for $7,040 by Joseph Sherar, a native of Vermont who had mined in California and freighted in southern Oregon. He spent about $75,000 improving the roads that led to his bridge, charged a high toll for crossing, and built an inn there that became the nucleus of a small settlement. Nothing is left now except the original barn and the water pipes that led to the inn.\n\nThere's a thrill in finding these evidences of the past for yourself that you can't get any other way. It's one thing to stop and read a neat, precise bronze historical marker placed beside the road for your edification as you travel\u2014so many Indians killed here, so many white men massacred there\u2014but it's much more adventurous and satisfying to read your history of the region, study old maps or follow a tip from an old-timer, and then go out on the backroads and pick up the trail yourself.\n\nThe Highway Magazine\n\n\"Typhoid Mary\" Starts her day\n\nJust forty years ago, \"Typhoid Mary\" was caught by the New York Health Department.

This sticky material is inflammable, and when the smoke is cooled, will deposit itself on the handiest object, where it is ready to burst into flame. In the brick chimney, the cold walls cool the smoke rapidly as it passes through, causing tar and gum to be deposited on the porous brick. The brick becomes saturated with this sticky, inflammable deposit, and when the chimney becomes overheated in severe weather, a very dangerous fire hazard is created.\n\nA brick chimney costs more \u2014 is less efficient\n\nA brick chimney requires a concrete foundation to support its weight \u2014 plus the cost of brick, cement, flue lining, flashing and labor. A brick chimney takes a good deal of time and trouble to construct, and when built is subject to deterioration and constant repair.\n\nBrick chimneys are by far the greatest cause of fires which, if not extinguished promptly, cause complete loss of property and often lives. For instance, of 2,089 fires in Winnipeg in 1947, 676, or more than 32%, were caused by fires in the chimney. Is YOUR house likely to be next?\n\nIt's a NEW PRINCIPLE in Chimneys\n\nTwo things are necessary to make a chimney efficient. First, the flue must be so constructed as to present a smooth, hard surface that the smoke and tar cannot cling to. Second, some method must be devised whereby the smoke and gases will not be cooled until they reach the open air. Keeping the waste smoke hot increases draft, making the furnace or stove work more efficiently, and in addition, eliminates tar deposits which cause chimney fires.\n\nSelkirk Chimneys are doubly insulated to keep waste smoke and gases hot \u2014 first with a 2\u00bd inch fireproof insulation \u2014 second with a \u00bd inch sealed air space surrounding the flue. The flue itself, of heavily galvanized iron, provides a round, hard, smooth, even surface free of corners, cracks and crevices.\nBE SAFER - SAVE MONEY -\nGET MORE HEAT FROM FUEL -\n\nwith a Selkirk INSULATED CHIMNEY\n\nSelkirk Chimneys are designed and built to do the job right. Waste gases are conducted efficiently, economically, and safely to the outside air. Tar cannot form on the smooth, hard, round inner flue. In addition, Selkirk Chimneys cost less than old-fashioned brick chimneys\u2014give far more for your money.\n\nSAFETY\nNo danger of chimney fires, when tar and gum deposits are eliminated. Many brick chimneys, when old, deteriorate and crack, leaking dangerously into confined spaces inside the house. This can't happen with the Selkirk as gases cannot escape through 3 walls of iron pipe and insulation. All seams heavily riveted. Selkirk's weight will not affect the Selkirk, as it is suspended on roof and floor flanges and thus moves up or down with house.\n\nLIGHT WEIGHT\nThe Selkirk weighs only 19 pounds per linear foot, compared to 135 pounds per linear foot for a comparable brick chimney. This saves the trouble, space and expense of a foundation, and saves labor because of the ease of installation.\n\nLOW COST - LONG LIFE\nYou save labor and building materials with a Selkirk\u2014it comes as a complete unit and ready to install. It neither needs cleaning nor maintenance\u2014inside surfaces of flue stays clean at all times. No chimney fires have been reported in 15 years.\n\nAPPEARANCE\nCap presents a neat appearance from the outside\u2014may be painted to match color of roof or house. In ordinary roof construction, cap emerges 2 feet above highest point of roof ridge.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nThe patented design of the Selkirk Chimney consists of three sleeves of heavily galvanized iron, one inside the other. The two outer sleeves contain 2\u00bd inches of fireproof insulation, which keep the waste gases hot until they reach the outer air. The 1\u00bd inch sealed air space surrounding the inner flue gives additional insulation. This provides greatly increased draft and better burning of fuel\u2014and ensures that the flue itself keeps clean and free from tar deposits. Designed to operate efficiently no matter what fuel\u2014coal, wood, or oil\u2014is burned.\n\nINSTALLATION\nBeing light in weight, the Selkirk is relatively easy to install. No special foundation is needed. The chimney comes complete with special flange made to fit the house; this rests on the roof, where most of the weight is supported. In addition, a sleeve which fits in the crown provides rigidity and supports the bulk of the weight.

We have had complete satisfaction on all installations, and on the basis of reports from the Engineer, it would appear that these chimneys are to be highly recommended on the basis of their cleanliness, simplicity of installation, and fire reduction of fire hazards.\n\nYours very truly,\nSASKATCHEWAN BOARD OF MANITOBA T. A. J. Conrady, Secretary/Treasurer\n\nTo Whom it May Concern:\nRegarding the Selkirk Chimney, I have had one in use in my home since 1937 and up to now have found no trace of creosote deposit in the chimney and can find it particularly free from ash and dust and soot.\n\nW. Bennet\n\nTo Whom it May Concern:\nThis is to certify that I have inspected several metal chimneys manufactured by Selkirk Metal Products Co., Ltd., Selkirk, Manitoba. After ten years' continuous use installed for 18 years, I have no hesitation in recommending this chimney to be installed anywhere.\n\nL. J. L. Kercock\nChief Fire Prevention Officer,\nCity of Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nTo Whom it May Concern:\nI, as Fire Chief of the Town of Selkirk, can say that the Selkirk Insulated Chimney is in my opinion an excellent product.\nI have in my capacity as Fire Prevention Officer had occasion to examine the said chimney over a period of ten years in various stages and conditions of use and have found no evidence of accumulation of creosote or tar and consequently never have been called upon to extinguish the main chimney which makes both an efficient and safe chimney.\n\nSgd. S. E. Davidson\n\nDear Sirs:\nDuring the four years we have distributed Selkirk Chimneys through Cooperative Stores in Manitoba, our only complaint has been that we could not get them delivered faster. They appear to have given clean, trouble-free service, and we have no indication of any complaints regarding performance.\n\nYours very truly,\nMAN. COOP. WHOLESALE LTD.\nC. B. Fraser, Asst.

In fact, we made a check to ensure that it had not been delayed in coming to my desk and are assured that it only arrived in Ottawa today.\n\nBy now you will have received information regarding the Peguis schools, and probably will have heard from Mr. Davy concerning the contract. We will probably be advertising for tenders for the other schools mentioned in your letter.\n\nI was very pleased to read the details of the two proposed Indian homes, and would suggest that you write to our new Superintendent of Welfare with similar details. Colonel Jones has been recently appointed to this position, and will, no doubt, be pleased to have the plans available.\n\nI am, of course, interested in plan 66-1 as a possible small teacherage. I expect to write you further about one or these buildings as we have spots in mind where they will be required.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard W. Henry,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. C.J.

A re-arrangement of the portions shown on the plan could be made on the site for the individual requirements. A sketch showing a cross-section of the construction detail of the unit is also attached. This is an economy-type of building using a minimum amount of materials. We would be pleased to include any additional material that is deemed advisable by your Department such as shiplap sheathing on the exterior of the wall studs under the siding. The dimensions are 7'6\" in height to allow free circulation of the air from the stove. With the basic unit we supply a 1' sink unit with a drain extending through the wall and the necessary amount of paint for each building. Our price on the present plan is $1179.35 for Plan 66-1 and $897.35 for Plan 46-1. These prices are quoted f.o.b.

We are negotiating with the company now, as you know, for such schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

However, we have prepared a preliminary floor plan of this type of school utilizing a Quonset \"40\" building and a Quonset \"32\" building on a two-storey layout. If you would be kind enough to give this floor plan your surveillance and make whatever corrections you think fit, we will then go ahead immediately with a complete set of drawings.\n\nThis school utilizing these types of buildings on a two-storey layout, will furnish you with a very efficient and economical set-up. The exterior can be given many architectural embellishments to offer a pleasing appearance. If we had some knowledge of the proposed location of these schools, we could determine the soil conditions at these locations and possibly furnish more suitable and economical foundation.\n\nWe are also enclosing illustrative literature of a new type of furnace manufactured by the Mortemp Company of Canada Ltd., which is a very efficient unit and of low cost with floating slab construction. Heat ducts are run throughout the slab which offers the feature of radiant heating combined with conventional hot air type of furnace. The National Research Council and Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation have approved this unit for housing in Canada and have installed the same in their own experimental houses at Ajax, Ontario.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nGREAT LAKES STEEL CORPORATION\nSTRAN-STEEL DIVISION\n\nJ.

This tall tubular furnace is installed inside a 25\" brick chimney.\n\n(2) A Gas Burner at the bottom of this tall tubular furnace heats the furnace.\n\n(3) An air circulating Blower in the attic draws air up from the house and then blows it down over the heated furnace, this air passing down in the space between the outside of the furnace and the brick walls.\n\n(4) The furnace heats this air and warm air flows out into the rooms from registers connected to any opening in the brick walls.\n\n(5) The furnace operation is entirely automatic. A room thermostat controls temperatures and a full set of standard controls automatically operate and protect the heating system.\n\n(6) Valuable house-space is saved by locating the furnace inside the building, especially in the popular no-basement homes. Extra rooms and closets, laundry space and other valued features, as well as lowered costs result from the exclusive MorTemp structure.\n\n(7) Absolute safety and permanence is secured by locating this furnace inside the brick housing vented directly to the outdoors. All gas or fumes are discharged directly outdoors and the furnace is fully protected from contact or accident.\n\n(8) MorTemp Furnaces deliver as much as 20% more heat per fuel dollar than others. MorTemp's heat surface is closely twice that of others. MorTemp's counter-flow air circulation reduces heat lost out the chimney from the usual 500\u00b0 down to under 200\u00b0.\n\nMORTEMP SPECIFICATIONS:\n\nMODEL NO G-60-B\n\n(1) GAS INPUT 95000 BTU\n(2) EFFICIENCY 80%\n(3) A.G.A approved automatic gas burner.

NORTHERN CONSTRUCTION; REVIEW OF 1950 PROGRAMME\n\n6. The Secretary reported that if the practice instituted last year of allocating responsibility for construction activities by areas in the North was to be continued, consideration should be given to the timing of submission of tentative departmental programmes for consideration by the Committee.\n\nAn explanatory note had been circulated. (Secretary's memorandum dated August 25, 1949 - Document C/ND-4)\n\n7. The Committee after some discussion agreed -\n\n(a) that the practice of reviewing departmental northern construction programmes and allocating work in areas where two or more departments had commitments in such a manner that one department assumed responsibility for construction, should be continued;\n\n(b) that tentative departmental northern construction programmes for 1950-51 should be forwarded to the Secretary by October 1st; and\n\n(c) that \"carry-overs\" from the 1949 programme should be included in the 1950-51 programme.\nEagelux Traffic Beacon\nand Flasher\n\nFOR SCHOOL CROSSINGS \u2014\u2014\n\n\u2014- WITH\n\nAUTOMATIC TIME CONTROL\n(Eagle Bulletin No. B10A)\n\nPERMANENT AUTOMATIC PROTECTION AT YOUR\nSCHOOL CROSSINGS . . .

An accident may place this unit on the sick list in a split second! Are the necessary parts going to be available? Your stock of spare parts for the modern traffic signals will contain all the parts necessary to adequately maintain this unit. All parts are readily available and will be rushed to you upon request from Eagle Signal Corporation in Moline, Illinois. The pedestal is standard (4\u00bd\") O.D. seamless steel pipe leaded into a high grade cast iron base with the usual large service door for convenient wiring. The pedestal is furnished with four anchor rods for permanent concrete base installation.\n\nMechanical parts such as flasher and time clock are identical to those used in the best of traffic installations. Flasher produces 60 flashes per minute. Time clock is equipped with three sets of \"on\" and \"off\" levers for morning, noon, and evening settings. Time Clock contains the omitting device. The unit is in operation only on school days at specified times preset on the time clock.\n\nThe beacon unit is identical to and carries with it all the important features of the modern traffic signal optical unit (see Efficiency of Illumination).\nAPPLICATION FOR THE TRAFFIC BEACON\n\nIS THE UNIT COMPLETELY FLEXIBLE?\n\nThe Traffic Equipment you purchase must fit your application. This unit is priced and sold as a package unit which includes two complete beacon, pedestal and sign units with one flasher, time clock and cabinet assembly and clamps for installing. In order that our equipment be custom built to your application, as is our policy, we offer you the alternates listed in the next column at no additional cost.\n\nARE ALL COMPONENTS EASILY ACCESSIBLE?\n\nThe actual photographs in this bulletin verify the accessibility of this unit better than words can tell. The flashing unit which includes the flasher, radio interference filter and fuse block, lifts off easily after three screws have been loosened. The time clock is mounted by four screws and is also easily removed from the dust and waterproof cast aluminum cabinet.\n\nDO WE GET THE MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY IN OUR OPTICAL UNIT?\n\nThe beacon used in this unit is only to be compared in actual comparison test with any other to determine which has the greater \"punch\" to the motorist or pedestrian.\n\nThis unit is dust and water tight. It is the same unit throughout as is used in the Eaglelux Traffic Signal which has within its design the feature of \"Anti-Sun Phantom.\" This feature prevents the sun's reflection in the lens, thereby eliminating confusion to traffic.\n\nIS THIS UNIT ECONOMICAL IN OPERATION?\n\n150 watts operates the two beacons, time clock and flasher in the two unit package.\n\nIS THE UNIT COMPETITIVE? ARE WE GIVING THE HIGHEST QUALITY FOR THE MINIMUM OF COST?\n\nThis is what you receive...\n\nI-SIIICPF Unit which includes:\n(a) I-SIIIC Beacon\n(b) I-UA108 Pedestal and Base\n(c) I-Regulation Diamond Shaped School Sign w/ clamps for mounting.\n(d) I-EP6 Flasher unit and time clock w/water proof cast aluminum cabinet. Clamps for mounting furnished.\n\nAll Equipment is Guaranteed for a period of one year against defects in materials and workmanship.\n\nIn order that our equipment be custom built to your application we offer these alternates to you at no additional charge.\n\n| STANDARD | ALTERNATES AVAILABLE |\n|----------|----------------------|\n| 8 ft. pedestal | 5 ft. pedestal |\n| Amber Lens (Proceed with caution) | Red Lens (Stop then go) |\n| Standard Visor | 8\" Tunnel Visor |\n| Entire Unit Painted Yellow | 8\" Full Circle Visor |\n| School Sign as Shown | Yellow School Sign With Standard Green Pedestal, Beacon and Flasher Box |\n| Other Messages Available |\n\nThese units are available as package units as described at this low price or each individual component unit may be ordered individually as desired.

This would seem to be an appropriate occasion to review the basic policies upon which the activities of the Department are predicated.\n\nIt would, of course, be possible to go on from session to session dealing in the traditional manner with such problems as may arise in the course of our routine activities. This would be an easy and, perhaps, an adequate way of meeting our responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, we might create a sensation and perhaps do some good by working up two or three big projects and making each of them the subject of a spectacular campaign.\n\nIntermediate between these two courses lies a third and, in my opinion, a more satisfactory alternative. Under this programme we would work out a vigorous, positive and progressive policy in connection with each of the developmental activities that fall within the range of departmental responsibility. To some extent have been doing this over the last two or three years. Much of our time during that period, however, has been taken up with revising the Departmental organization and obtaining personnel for services which were seriously depleted during or prior to the war. As matters now stand, our organization is in reasonably good shape (except for the fantastic difficulties caused by the present physical distribution of our establishment in the city of Ottawa). The personnel position is more satisfactory than it has been for many years and is steadily improving. The Government has displayed a willingness to provide funds for most of the projects that we have recommended.\nGiven these conditions, I suggest that we should now undertake a review of the activities of each of the Branches and decide in the light of discussions with the Directors on the objectives that we should accept as being desirable and possible of attainment within the next five years. This may lead to the formulation of a general and over-all programme for the development of our natural resources. On the other hand we may decide to confine ourselves to a series of more limited and less ambitious objectives. At least we shall have the satisfaction of knowing all our decisions are the result of a careful and integrated study.\n\nIf you think well of this suggestion, I should like to ask each Director to prepare a memorandum on this subject to be used as the basis for a discussion with you and myself. I would suggest that such discussions might be timed to take place during the months of October and November and that they should be sufficiently far advanced by the end of that time to enable us to take whatever consequent steps seem appropriate in the preparation of our final estimates for 1950-51.\n\nI shall be glad to have an indication of your views as to the desirability of the proposed procedure.\n\n(Signed) H.L.

Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\nOctober 31, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nFive Year Plan - Indian Education.\n\nI feel that this program can best be defined under the following categories:\n\n1. Indian Residential Schools,\n2. Indian Day Schools,\n3. Joint Schools,\n4. Secondary Education,\n5. Adult Education and Extension Work,\n6. Administration.\n\nI will now treat with each of the above categories and outline what I feel should be the basic policies in each field during the next five years:\n\n1. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS\n\nI feel that no residential schools should either be promised or planned in any way until a thorough educational survey has been carried out by a committee of competent educators. In order that we may have a proper perspective, it is most essential that a representative of the Department of Education of\nthe province concerned be appointed to this committee.\n\nOnly in this way can a systematic program of residential school construction be carried out where such schools are specifically required.\n\nIn the past the various denominations have taken the initiative with regard to the establishment of residential schools and have pressed the Department into making decisions with regard to their construction. I feel that a new policy must be instituted in which the Department decides on the basis of professional surveys and reports, as to the necessity of erecting this type of school.\n\nWe have now 17 requests on hand for the construction of these schools and I am convinced that several of them are not required. However, it is not possible to arrive at such a decision unless a thorough inspection is made of the reserves concerned and a proper picture presented as to the type of educational facilities which should be provided.\n\nI would estimate that some 12 new residential schools will be required during the period 1950 to 1953, both in new districts and as replacements for present schools.\n\nTo clarify this situation, therefore, I feel we should make it known to the denominations that in future the Indian residential school will be mainly for the following categories of Indian pupils:\n\n(a) those who are orphans or who come from homes in which competent welfare workers decide that institutional care is needed,\n\n(b) those whose parents earned their living through occupations which demand their absence from reserves or villages during long periods of the standard academic year,\n\n(c) those pupils coming from reserves on which the number of Indian children of school age are either too few or whose homes are too scattered to permit the operation of Indian day schools,\n(d) those who are ready for high school education and for whom residential schools can provide board and lodging while they attend nearby provincial high schools.\n\n2. INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nI feel that the main emphasis in our five year plan should be the erection of Indian day schools on all reserves upon which our inspectors report that conditions will permit the erection of such schools.\n\nWe have made a good start during the past three years towards the elimination of reserves upon which no educational facilities whatsoever were provided. The number of Indian children in our schools increased last year by 2,000 and we hope for a similar increase this year.\n\nWith this emphasis on the provision of day schools, we must also be prepared to provide good salaries and securities for teachers of such schools. We cannot compete with provincial schools in the field of social activity, amenities of living such as hygiene, running water and similar facilities, but we must be prepared to outbid provincial schools in such matters as salaries, leave to attend universities, and better living conditions in the schools and teacherages.\n\nI have already reported on the great shortage of teachers which exists now in Canada and which will continue to exist. Therefore a basic feature of our five year program will be the attraction to our day schools of a better qualified and experienced teacher.\n\n3. JOINT SCHOOLS\n\nAs you are aware, the Parliamentary Committee made the following recommendation with regard to joint schools:\n\n\"Your committee recommends the revision of those sections of the Act which pertain to education, in order to prepare Indian children to take their place as citizens.\n\n... \"Your\nYour Committee, therefore, recommends that wherever and whenever possible Indian children should be educated in association with other children.\n\nWith this in mind, we should not build Indian day or residential schools on or near reserves on which the Indian children can be educated in white schools. In order to have our children admitted to these schools, we must be prepared to pay a proportionate share of the capital cost of additional schools or classrooms which might be required because Indian children are admitted.\n\nWe will never get local school authorities to educate Indian children unless we are prepared therefore to do the following:\n\n(a) to pay adequate tuition fees based on the annual cost of education per pupil in the school concerned;\n\n(b) where necessary to contribute to the capital cost of additional buildings or classrooms required for Indian children.\n\nWe have made a good start in having Indian children admitted to white schools and last year there were 925 children enrolled in joint and in provincial schools.\n\n4. SECONDARY EDUCATION\n\nThis is becoming an increasing item in our educational estimates. With the improvements in our school system, there are naturally more pupils who are reaching the upper grades.\n\nOur policy is of course that these children be educated in provincial high schools. This often makes it necessary to have the Indian children commuted back in the communities in which the schools are located. Due to present high living conditions, this is a very expensive item and we are becoming increasingly careful in the selection of students.\nI feel that certain of our residential schools could well be expanded for caring for some of these Indian children during the time they are attending local high schools. While not too many of these residential schools are located near towns, we do have those which could be used for this purpose. This would not preclude their being used for younger children but would mean dormitory alterations to accommodate high school pupils and to give them adequate study space, etc. Insofar as university education is concerned, it is recommended that there be more rigorous in checking the reports submitted upon all students who are suggested for such courses. The education of one of these pupils for one year can otherwise amount to fifty per cent of the cost of operating a small one-room day school with possibly twenty children in attendance.\n\nI would also recommend that care be taken in assessing the progress made by these pupils and that aptitude tests be given, particularly to those intending to go through for Law, Medicine and other costly professions.\n\n5. ADULT EDUCATION and EXTENSION WORK.\n\nI feel that a great deal can be done towards the promotion of good attendance at our Indian day schools by the establishment of Home and School or Parent-Teacher Clubs. One of the weaknesses of our day school system up to the present time has been the insatisfactory attendance of the pupils. We are attempting to overcome this by better schools, better teachers and better equipment. However, these efforts on our part will do little if we fail to achieve the co-operation of the Indian parents. We must make our schools \"community centres\" and have the teachers reach out to the parents, not only through the medium of home and school clubs but also by means of concerts, sports events and social evenings.\n\nWhen a Supervisor of Physical Education and Recreation has been appointed, I feel that he should be given the opportunity of preparing a five year program in this regard, covering such features as the following:\n(a) The Indian Day School as a part of Indian reserve life;\n\n(b) Adult education in health, general welfare and educational subjects through the use of films, lectures and classes;\n\n(c) The promotion of sports and athletics on Indian reserves and in Indian schools;\n\n(d) The institution of a program of health education and corrective physical education.\n\n6. ADMINISTRATION:\n\nI feel that another feature of our five-year policy should be the continued decentralization of our educational system. It is impossible now, with the number of schools concerned, to make proper decisions on all matters here in Ottawa. I have recommended before and I again recommend most strongly the establishment of positions to be entitled \"Regional Administrator of Indian Education.\" This position would combine the duties of School Inspector with supervision of buildings and equipment, the selection of teachers and the general administration of the schools in his region.\n\nMany other changes have been made within the last three years and on a recent inspection trip, many teachers commented on the improvements which had been made. One point in particular is with regard to the provision of school text-books. I feel that the improvements which have recently resulted are well worth all the time and effort which it took on our part to negotiate with the King's Printer and others concerned. The school supply situation is much better than it has ever been and we will endeavour to keep it thus.\n\nWe are also endeavouring to speed up the answering of correspondence but find this very difficult in many cases, due to lack of professional advice from the field. I feel that many\nquestions are referred here now which could be entirely settled in the field without any need for correspondence with the Department. For example, in British Columbia, many professional matters are settled by Inspector Davey and the number of problems raised in letters from the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia is relatively much fewer than from the Regional Supervisors in other provinces.\n\nBernard J. Murray,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOctober 27, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\n1950-51 Estimates - Residential Schools.\n\nI have discussed with Father Plourde and Canon Cook the various requirements for these two denominations with regard to next year's building program. Dr. Dorsey has previously discussed this matter with me.\n\nI would therefore present, for your information, the following outline of proposed residential school buildings by denominations for 1950-51:\n\n1. CHURCH OF ENGLAND:\n   (a) Carcross - Dormitory block, probably identical to Wabasca.\n   (b) Alert Bay - Classroom block.\n   (c) Moose Fort - Classroom block\n\nCanon Cook also raised the question of our plans for Lac La Ronge but I do not feel we should take any action further on this project until an educational survey committee has been sent in to the district to be served by this school.\n\n2. ROMAN CATHOLIC:\n   (a) Lower Post\n   (b) Seven Islands\n   (c) Thunderchild.\n3. **UNITED CHURCH**\n\n(a) Norway House\n\nIt is a debatable question as to whether we should send in an educational survey committee to this district. I do not know how far the Department was committed by former Ministers with regard to the erection of this school.\n\nI do feel that care must be taken in committing ourselves to any future residential school requests. You will note that in the above I have recommended one definite educational survey task, namely at Lac la Ronge, and one possible survey task, namely at Norway House. We also have a third request which might well be investigated next year, namely the Roman Catholic request for a residential school at Armstrong.\n\nI have just received the Educational Survey Committee's report on the proposed Anos School and will be sending this to you tomorrow.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. George G. Cousins,\nLighting Engineer,\nHydro Electric Power Commission,\n620 University Ave.,\nToronto 2, Ont.,\n\nEncl:\nOttawa, November 4, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH,\n\nSupplementary Estimates - 1949-50.\n\nIn accordance with your requests over a period of time, the following items have been included in our 1949-50 Supplementary Estimates:\n\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS\n\nONTARIO:\nSlocan Lookout Repairs to plumbing and heating systems .......... $5,000.00\nCecilia Jeffrey Repairs to plumbing and heating systems .......... 7,230.00\n\nSASKATCHEWAN:\nMuscowequan Repairs to heating system .. 3,000.00\n\nALBERTA:\nEdmonton Major repairs and replacements to plumbing, heating and sewage disposal systems ..... 25,000.00\nBlue Quills Extensive repairs to heating system ............. 15,000.00\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA:\nSechelt Repairs to plumbing ....... 7,000.00\nAlert Bay Extensive repairs to plumbing and heating systems ............. 8,500.00\nIn addition to the above items, we also have included an amount of $10,000.00 for the completion of the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School in the Kenora Agency and $19,000.00 to complete the dormitory block at the Wabasego Church of England Residential School.\n\nDirector.\nAIR MAIL\n\nNovember 4th, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nAs you are aware, we included in our appropriation a few years ago, an amount for a classroom block at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. We did not proceed with the construction of this building, and no funds have been provided for it in the appropriation for the current fiscal year.\n\nWe have received representations lately that the school management has been applying for some years past for a classroom block at this school, and they consider that funds for the construction of the building should be included in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1950-51.\n\nPlease let us have your comments on the matter by army signal as soon as possible. It is noted that you did not include this item in your letter of October 7th, in which you forwarded a list of the Indian day schools which you consider should be erected in the Province of Saskatchewan during the next fiscal year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nChief, Education Division\nOttawa, November 7, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nHartley Bay, Kinsolitb and Lakalap Indian Day Schools.\n\nIncluded in our Main Estimates for 1949-50 is the sum of $30,000.00 each for the erection of two-room schools and teacherages on each of the above reserves, in the Skeena River Agency, near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.\n\nWhereas our day school building program has met with considerable success in the other provinces, we have encountered many difficulties in British Columbia. At Valuliet, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room school and attached teachers' residence and the lowest tender for standard construction was $42,612.00. This same school, we are having built in Saskatchewan for $29,000.00. As you are aware, we finally decided to erect a cement school at Valuliet.\n\nAt Cape Mudge, we advertised for a one-room school with attached teacher's residence complete with electricity, plumbing, etc. We are having two such schools erected in Ontario for about $17,000.00. The one and only tender received for the erection of the Cape Mudge School was $29,744.75.\n\nAt Fort Nelson, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room Indian day school and teacherage but received one tender only, in the amount of $67,392.00.\n\nTherefore, due to the scarcity of contractors bidding on our projects and the high prices tendered by them, our officials in British Columbia have come to the decision that prefabricated\nschools should be erected on each of the above three reserves. Their decision in this regard has been aided by the satisfaction obtained from the company which erected the two-room school and teachersage at Pemberton Meadows in the New Westminster Agency and the one-room school at Metlakatla in the Skeena River Agency.\n\nThis company is Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, B.C., and I attach both the previous Order-in-Council covering the provision of the Pemberton Meadows School and photographs taken by Inspector Davey of the completed building.\n\nOur officials are perfectly satisfied with these buildings and Mr. Indian Superintendent Anfield, who knows how to supervise the erection of this type of school from his experience at Metlakatla, makes the following statement:\n\n\"I am satisfied that it will wear well, operate economically and that the type of construction is suitable and most adaptable for the type of country in the Skeena Agency. The school has been viewed with considerable approval by the Provincial School Inspector, Mr. J. Shell, at Prince Rupert. It is recommended that two-classroom schools of this type, with teachersages attached, be constructed at Hartley Bay, Greenville and Kincolith, with the least possible delay.\"\n\nWith regard to advertising for tenders, not only have we our previous disappointments as a guide, but Mr. Anfield makes the following statement:\n\n\"I have approached Messrs. Mitchell and Currie, Green and Bridgen, both contracting firms of Prince Rupert and they refuse to bid on the construction of new schools at these three points, giving isolation of location and risk re transportation as the main reasons. These and other contractors in Prince Rupert have so much other work on hand that they are just not interested.\"\n\nMr. Indian Commissioner Ament concurs in these recommendations and points out that these buildings can be erected at a cost to the Department considerably less than we could get a quotation from a contractor. In this regard he makes the following statement:\n\"You will note Mr. Amfield's reference to the need for employment at these Indian villages. Erection of these schools will provide some of that much-needed employment and in addition will assure most urgently required classroom accommodation and, as previously pointed out, at a saving of several thousand dollars in each case.\"\n\nThe only other company in British Columbia producing schools of this type is Precision Housing Company, which produces pre-cut schools. These are much more difficult to erect with the type of semi-skilled Indian labour we will have available and are not recommended by our field officials.\n\nTherefore, I have no hesitation in recommending to you for presentation to the Minister, the attached submission to Council covering the purchase of three prefabricated schools from Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, B.C., for erection on these three reserves in the Skeena River Agency. We have foremen-carpenters in mind and can employ the Indians who are fairly competent mechanics and carpenters, under white supervision, for the erection of these prefabricated buildings.\n\nDirector.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 22 September 1948.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report dated September 14, 1948 from the Minister of Mines and Resources, representing:\n\nThat it is immediately necessary, and funds are provided in the 1948-49 estimates, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources, to provide a two-room Indian day school with attached teachers' residence on the Pemberton Indian Reserve, in the New Westminster Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia;\n\nThat it is essential that educational facilities be provided for the Indian children on the Pemberton Indian Reserve;\n\nThat Section 36 of The Public Works Act, Chapter 166, R.S.C. 1927, provides in part as follows:\n\n\"Whenever any works are to be executed under the direction of any Department of the Government the minister having charge of such Department shall invite tenders by public advertisement for the execution of such works except in cases (a) of pressing emergency in which delay would be injurious to the public interest...........\"\n\nThat, due to the very isolated situation of this reserve, there are no builders or contractors in the area nor are outside contractors interested in tenders if invited as aforesaid, as they have all the work they can do in their own localities;\n\nThat a competent building company, namely Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, British Columbia, has agreed to undertake the provision of a prefabricated two-room school with attached teachers' residence immediately on a basis of $9,750.00 f.o.b. Vancouver, plus freight and erection supervisor's wages, fare and expenses;\n\nThat it is considered that the provision of this school is a pressing emergency and within the exception provided in Section 36 above recited and further, it is considered that the work can be more expeditiously and economically executed as suggested herein.\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted to enter into a contract with Prefabricated Structures, Limited, for the provision of this building as outlined above, this being the only arrangement possible at the present time and it being essential that this work be undertaken at once and carried to completion in order that the building will be available for use by the time the Christmas school term commences.\n\nThe Honourable A.

I am enclosing, herewith, copy of our letter dated October 28, 1949 containing the required information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Day School Construction Program - 1950-51\n\nReference your letter file 1-1-5 dated October 17, 1949, herewith the list of the schools which I feel should be built within the Province of Manitoba, during the coming year.\n\nIn connection with the Northern schools, I would recommend that Selkirk chimneys be ordered in place of the standard chimneys shown on the present plan, and materials for the Northern schools - with the exception of those in the Clandeboye Agency, should be ordered in time to go in by winter freight.\n\nAs soon as I am advised of the number of schools we can build this year, I will see that requisitions go forward for the necessary desks and furniture, so that these items - as well as materials - may go in by winter freight.\n\n1 two-room day school - Church of England - Plan 888B (The Pas Agency)\n\n1 One-room day school - United Church - Plan 888A, at Poplar River (Clandeboye Agency)\n\n1 one-room day school - United Church - Little Black River, Plan 888A (Clandeboye Agency)\n\n1 one-room day school - Roman Catholic - Berens River. This school without teacherage. This is a replacement, as the school presently in use is in very poor condition. (Clandeboye Agency)\n\n1 one-room day school - United Church - Hollow Water. Plan 888A. This building is also for replacement as the present school is an old log building beyond repair and there is no teacher's residence. (Clandeboye Agency)\n\n1 one-room day school - Roman Catholic - God's Lake, Plan 888A. Material for this school should be shipped to Ilford, Manitoba, not later than January 1, 1950. (Nelson River)\n\n1 one-room day school - United Church - Oxford House, Plan 888A. Material for this school should be shipped to Ilford, Manitoba, not later than January 1, 1950. (Nelson River)\none-room day school - Shamattawa - Plan 888A.\nThis school was in operation last summer, under Mr. A. G. McBeath, and was a complete success.\nI strongly recommend the material for this school should be shipped to Ilford not later than January 1, 1950, and go in by winter freight.\n\nNelson House U.C. Day School teacherage.\nAt present there is no accommodation for a teacher; therefore, we are experiencing considerable difficulty in securing teaching services.\nI would recommend that a four-room teacherage be purchased from the North American Builders, Limited, something along the same line as the Split Lake teacherage. However, the Split Lake teacherage was supplied without inside doors, and I think they should be supplied with doors.\n\none-room day school - Roman Catholic - Lizard Point (Waywayseecappo Reserve) Plan 888A (Portage la Prairie Agency)\n\none-room day school - United Church - Lizard Point (Waywayseecappo Reserve) Plan 888A\n\nI was including one R.C. and one U.C. school at Lizard Point (Waywayseecappo Reserve). It was the intention to build a school for the U.C. this year, but no action has been taken; therefore, I think it should be included in our building plans for 1950-51.\n\nI am not certain that the R.C. school will meet with the approval of the Church authorities. However, I am including same and the matter can be further discussed with you before action is taken.\n\nIsland Lake R.C. day school (Maria Portage) a two or three-room school will have to be built at this point, and the material shipped to Ilford by January 1, 1950.\n\nLumber can be sawn and finished in our own mill, or can be purchased from the R.C. Church and built on the same basis as the present teacher's residence. I would like to have your views on this matter. However, I strongly recommend the schools be built next summer, as the present school facilities are very poor.\n\nI trust that the foregoing will completely answer the request contained in your circular letter.\n\nR.

We felt it best to let you have this information as quickly as possible and to suggest that you give permission to ship instead, our #18 Slow Combustion Heater. This heater would cost you $39.50 F.O.B. Sackville, as contrasted with $52.25 for the #70, which you ordered. It is a heater made, of course, for the exclusive burning of coal, but it will burn any grade of soft coal, even the poorest grades. It is a more powerful heater than the #70 and has one great advantage which the #70 hasn't - that is, it will hold the fire for many hours without attention, and that is a factor which we find for schools particularly, is a most important one. For example, the stove can be filled up with fuel at night; in the morning the building is warm and the temperature can be rapidly increased. The stove holds almost one hundred pounds of coal, so that firing is not frequent and it will even hold the fire for thirty-six hours without attention. Of course, if from time to time one wishes to burn wood in it, that can be done, but it then operates just like an ordinary Quebec Heater, as primarily it is designed...\nfor coal burning.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nReplying to your 1-1-5 of the 16th inst., in respect to the visit of Mr. Hargreaves of the Lands and Development Services Branch to the Western Provinces, there are a number of schools at which an inspection by him could certainly be made to advantage. Assuming that his time is limited, this should be confined to those which require a report and recommendation from a qualified engineer.\n\nThere is a water supply problem at the St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve, Cardston; there is a very serious sewage disposal problem at the Old Sun School, Blackfoot Reserve; at the Morley Residential School a report on an improved laundry and heating system is desired, while there will be a heating problem at the Blue Quills Residential School at St. Paul if the uncompleted addition is to be finished.\n\nIt is recommended that he report to the Regional Office when the most urgent problems may be discussed and his itinerary in this Province based on that and the time at his disposal.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\n\nGHG: IDF\n29 November, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nFive Year Plan - Indian Education.\n\nAs I have previously discussed with you, I feel that our policies for the next five years can best be defined under the following categories:\n\n1. Indian Residential Schools,\n2. Indian Day Schools,\n3. Joint Schools,\n4. Secondary Education,\n5. Adult and Vocational Education and Extension Work,\n6. Administration.\n\nIn the following paragraphs I will deal with each of the above categories and outline what I feel should be the basic policies and the construction required during the next five years.\n\n1. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS\n\n(a) Policy -\n\nI feel that no residential schools should either be provided or planned in any way until a thorough educational survey has been carried out by a committee of competent educators. In order that we may have a proper perspective, it is most essential that a representative of the Department of Education of the province concerned be appointed to this committee.\nOnly in this way can a systematic program of residential school construction be carried out where such schools are specifically required.\n\nIn the past the various denominations have taken the initiative with regard to the establishment of residential schools and have pressed the Department into making decisions with regard to their construction. I feel that a new policy must be instituted in which the Department decides on the basis of professional surveys and reports, as to the necessity of erecting this type of school.\n\nWe have now 17 requests on hand for the construction of these schools and I am convinced that several of them are not required. However, it is not possible to arrive at such a decision unless a thorough inspection is made of the reserves concerned and a proper picture presented as to the type of educational facilities which should be provided.\n\nI would estimate that some 12 new residential schools will be required during the period 1930 to 1935, both in new districts and as replacements for present schools.\n\nTo clarify this situation, therefore, I feel we should make it known to the denominations that in future the Indian residential school will be mainly for the following categories of Indian pupils:\n\n(I) those who are orphans or who come from homes in which competent welfare workers decide that institutional care is needed,\n\n(II) those whose parents earned their living through occupations which demand their absence from reserves or villages during long periods of the standard academic year,\n\n(III) those pupils coming from reserves on which the number of Indian children of school age are either too few or whose homes are too scattered to permit the operation of Indian day schools,\n\n(IV) those who are ready for high school education and for whom residential schools can provide board and lodging while they attend nearby provincial high schools.\n(b) Construction Required.\n\nIn view of the policy outlined above, it will be appreciated that we cannot clearly define the exact number of residential schools required during this five year period. An estimate, however, would be that between six and ten such schools will be required. In some cases these will only be hostels and the Department will operate the classrooms or arrange with provincial school boards to operate them.\n\n2. INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\n(a) Policy.\n\nI feel that the main emphasis in our five year plan should be the erection of Indian day schools on all reserves upon which our inspectors report that conditions will permit the erection of such schools.\n\nWe have made a good start during the past three years towards the elimination of reserves upon which no educational facilities whatsoever were provided. The number of Indian children in our schools increased last year by 2,000 and we hope for a similar increase this year.\n\nWith this emphasis on the provision of day schools, we must also be prepared to provide good salaries and securities for teachers of such schools. We cannot compete with provincial schools in the field of social activity, amenities of living such as hydro, running water and similar facilities, so we must be prepared to outbid provincial schools in such matters as salaries, leave to attend universities, and better living conditions in the schools and teacherages.\n\nI have already reported on the great shortage of teachers which exists now in Canada and which will continue to exist. Therefore a basic feature of our five year program will be the attraction to our day schools of a better qualified and experienced teacher.\n\n(b) Construction Required.\n\nIt is estimated that 450 day school classrooms at least will be required and possibly 500 by 1955. Of the\n460 used as a minimum figure about 350 will be one-room schools, 30 will be two-room schools and some 40 classrooms will have to be provided in three, four and six-room schools.\n\n3. JOINT SCHOOLS\n\n(a) Policy\n\nAs you are aware, the Parliamentary Committee made the following recommendation with regard to joint schools:\n\n\"Your committee recommends the revision of those sections of the Act which pertain to education, in order to prepare Indian children to take their place as citizens.\n\n\"Your Committee, therefore, recommends that wherever and whenever possible Indian children should be educated in association with other children.\"\n\nWith this in mind, we should not build Indian day or residential schools on or near reserves on which the Indian children can be educated in white schools. In order to have our children admitted to these schools, we must be prepared to pay a proportionate share of the capital cost of additional schools or classrooms which might be required because Indian children are admitted.\n\nWe will never get local school authorities to educate Indian children unless we are prepared therefore to do the following:\n\nI. To pay adequate tuition fees based on the annual cost of education per pupil in the school concerned;\n\nII. Where necessary to contribute to the capital cost of additional buildings or classrooms required for Indian children.\n\nWe have made a good start in having Indian children admitted to white schools and last year there were 925 children enrolled in joint and in provincial schools.\n3. JOINT SCHOOLS (cont'd.)\n\n(b) Construction required\n\nWe are not in a position to calculate the amounts which will be required as contributions to the erection of joint schools or as assistance in the addition of extra classrooms in provincial schools. In item No. 6 I am recommending the establishment of positions to be entitled \"Regional Administrator of Indian Schools\". When these officials are appointed we will no doubt have many requests from local school boards as they are contacted and made acquainted with our new policy with regard to joint education. I would estimate that approximately $500,000.00 will be required in such joint projects over the next five years.\n\n4. SECONDARY EDUCATION\n\n(a) Policy\n\nThis is becoming an increasing item in our educational estimates. With the improvements in our school system, there are naturally more pupils who are reaching the upper grades.\n\nOur policy is of course that these children be educated in provincial high schools. This often makes it necessary to have the Indian children commuted board in the communities in which the schools are located. Due to present high living conditions, this is a very expensive item and we are becoming increasingly careful in the selection of students.\n\nI feel that certain of our residential schools could well be earmarked for caring for some of these Indian children during the time they are attending local high schools. While not too many of these residential schools are located near towns, we do have those which could be used for this purpose. This would not preclude their being used for younger children but could mean dormitory alterations to accommodate high school pupils and to give them adequate study space, etc. Insofar as university education is concerned, it is recommended that we be most scrupulous in checking the reports submitted upon all students who are suggested\nfor such courses. The education of one of these pupils for one year can otherwise amount to fifty per cent of the cost of operating a small one-room day school with possibly twenty children in attendance.\n\nI would also recommend that care be taken in assessing the progress made by these pupils and that aptitude tests be given, particularly to those intending to go through for Law, Medicine and other costly professions.\n\n(b) Construction Required\n\nWe might possibly be requested occasionally to contribute a small amount towards the addition of extra classrooms at local white high schools. I do not feel that this should cost more than $50,000.00 over the next five years.\n\n5. ADULT AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND EXTENSION WORK.\n\n(a) Policy\n\nI feel that a great deal can be done towards the promotion of good attendance at our Indian day schools by the establishment of Home and School or Parent-Teacher Clubs. One of the weaknesses of our day school system up to the present time has been the lack of parental attendance of the pupils. We are attempting to overcome this by better schools, better teachers, and better equipment. However, these efforts on our part will do little if we fail to achieve the cooperation of the Indian parents. We must make our schools \"community-conscious\" and have the teachers reach out to the parents, not only through the medium of home and school clubs but also by means of concerts, sports events and social evenings.\n\nWhen a Supervisor of Physical Education and Recreation has been appointed, I feel that he should be given the opportunity of preparing a five year programme in this regard, covering such features as the following:\n\n(i) The Indian Day School as a part of Indian reserve life;\n\n(ii) Adult education in health, general welfare and educational subjects through the use of films, lectures and classes;\n(iii) The promotion of sports and athletics on Indian reserves and in Indian schools;\n\n(iv) The institution of a program of health education and corrective physical education.\n\n(b) Construction required\n\nAt the present time we do not intend to inaugurate a very heavy program of construction of recreation halls and gymnasia. When our construction of day schools begins to catch up with the demand, then some consideration can be given to such projects. In the meantime, we are confining these items to contributions towards recreation halls at residential schools which have inadequate facilities in this regard.\n\n6. ADMINISTRATION\n\n(a) Policy\n\nI feel that another feature of our five-year policy should be the continued decentralization of our educational system. It is impossible now, with the number of schools concerned, to make proper decisions on all matters here in Ottawa. I have recommended before, and I again recommend most strongly, the establishment of positions to be entitled \"Regional Administrator of Schools\" or \"Regional Inspectors of Indian Schools\". This position would combine the duties of School Inspector with supervision of buildings and equipment, the selection of teachers and the general administration of the schools in his region.\n\nMany other changes have been made within the last three years and on a recent inspection trip, many teachers commented on the improvements which had been made. One point in particular is with regard to the provision of school text-books. I feel that the improvements which have recently resulted are well worth all the time and effort which it took on our part to negotiate with the King's Printer and others concerned. The school supply situation is much better than it has ever been and we will endeavour to keep it thus.\nWe are also endeavouring to speed up the answering of correspondence but find this very difficult in many cases, due to lack of professional advice from the field. I feel that many questions are referred here now which could be entirely settled in the field without any need for correspondence with the Department. For example, in British Columbia, many professional matters are settled by Inspector Davy and the number of problems raised in letters from the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia is relatively much fewer than from the Regional Supervisors in other provinces.\n\n(b) Construction required\n\nOther than the provision of offices for the regional administrators or regional school inspectors, I do not think that any funds will be required under this heading.\n\nSUBJECT:\n\nThe basis of our preparation of this five-year plan is the immediate need for some 450 classrooms to provide educational facilities for Indian children who have none whatsoever. A minimum of 70 additional classrooms will be required by the end of 1955 to provide replacements for completely dilapidated buildings and to allow for natural increase in school population, based on census figures. Twenty-five (25) joint schools will be a minimum requirement.\n\nIt is felt that this need can best be provided by the erection of the following classrooms with estimated costs as shown:\n\n(a) Day Schools . . . 460 . . . $8,440,000.\n\n(b) Residential Schools 60 . . . 1,280,000.\n\nThis means the erection of about 350 one-room schools, 30 two-room schools and 40 classrooms in three, four and six room day schools. It provides for the minimum of six residential schools at the most needed sites as recommended by educational survey committees.\nThe total contribution towards joint elementary and secondary schools will amount to approximately $550,000.00.\n\nIt is impossible to calculate how many of our day schools can be considered as joint schools until field officials are appointed who can work with educational committees, provincial inspectors and local school boards in determining where and to what extent such joint educational plans are possible. Many of our one-room schools may thus become joint schools and more of our children handled by provincial educational authorities.\n\nThe grand total estimated required for the erection or as contributions towards the erection of these schools will amount to $10,270,000.00.\n\nI have prepared a chart attached hereto, to indicate the breakdown of these schools by type and by provinces.\n\n[Signature]\nBernard J.

We would, therefore, request that the following plans and specifications be prepared to be available by the 15th of March, 1950:\n\nYou will note that specific suggestions are given in each case so that this deadline date can be met.\n\n(a) ONE-ROOM SCHOOLS:\n\nAt present we are building in accordance with your plan 826 and attached specifications. This building has proven to be quite satisfactory but modifications are required especially in providing a sub-basement with a gravity-feed or blower type furnace (depending on the availability of hydro). We do not wish full basements for this type of school and a sub-basement is all that we require.\n\n(i) Without Teachers' Room:\n\nThis plan can be based almost directly on that prepared by the Ontario Association of Architects. We feel that little improvement can be made in this plan and that\nit will meet our requirements entirely. It is suggested, however, instead of the two plans, one with electricity and toilets and the other without electricity and toilets, being prepared, that one plan only need be prepared. This would provide for electricity and toilets but would indicate how these can be omitted in districts where hydro is not available. In other words, the space shown for the toilets could be used as storage space and could be converted to its proper use at a later date if and when hydro becomes available on the reserve.\n\n(ii) High Teacherage:\n\nThis could be based on the plan outlined above by the provision of the same type and size of teacherage as now provided in plan 688.\n\n(b) TWO-ROOM SCHOOLS:\n\n(i) Without Teacherage:\n\nUnder separate cover, we are sending a photostatic copy of a two-room school of the type we require. You will note that a full basement is not required. The manual training and domestic science activities are carried out in small rooms separated by glass partitions from the main classrooms. A sub-basement is provided permitting the installation of a gravity hot air furnace and allowing for storage space.\n\nAs for the one-room school, it is felt that toilet and hydro services should be planned for but indication should be given that other use can be made of this space if hydro is not available.\n\n(ii) With Teacherage:\n\nA small \"T\" can be extended to provide the usual two bedrooms, living room and kitchen, all on the one floor.\n(c) FOUR-ROOM SCHOOLS:\n\nThis can be redesigned to provide all classrooms on the one floor with a small glassed-in manual training and domestic science room at the end of the classrooms, as provided for in the two-room schools.\n\nA sub-basement and storage room only need be provided.\n\nIt is the considered opinion of the school inspectors and officials of the Department of Education in Ontario that basements can well be eliminated in view of the heavy costs of excavation and pouring of concrete. You will note that most small schools are now being planned as indicated above and our Superintendent of Education reports most favorably on a two-room school without basement, seen recently in one of his inspection trips. This was completed for just over $30,000.00 and even provided hot water heating.\n\nAll schools should have insulated floors and the exterior should be covered with cedar siding. Now that this is available, we intend to drop the use of Insul Brick and Asbestos Shingles.\n\nIt is suggested that a meeting be held in the near future with your Architects, Engineers and our Education Officials so that work on these plans can be commenced. We are particularly anxious to have the one-room school plans prepared as we hope to begin advertising for tenders early this year. This type of school should be given priority and we would like it ready by February 1. It is felt this should be possible as it is based on a prepared set of plans.\n\nDirector.\nOntario Chemicals Limited\nManufacturers of Sanitary Products and Chemicals\nO.C.L.

The immediate purpose of the survey is to have available for consideration by the government at an early date an accurate and detailed list of all such projects, with relevant information to enable an analysis of the character and probable cost of projects and of the time at which it might be possible or desirable for projects not now under way to go forward.\n\nCabinet has directed that the survey include, not only projects which would be executed entirely by agencies of the federal government, but also those which might be undertaken jointly with provincial or municipal governments. The return from each department or agency of government should show:\n\n(a) projects now under way, or ready to be put under way immediately;\n\n(b) projects in various stages of planning; and\n\n(c) projects in the proposal stage and still under preliminary examination.\nThe statistical work to coordinate the survey is to be undertaken by the Economic Research and Development Branch of the Department of Trade and Commerce. To provide the necessary information on a comparable basis questionnaire forms are being prepared by the Branch. A copy is enclosed herewith. Working copies for completion can be secured from Mr. Alex Skelton for the Department of Trade and Commerce. To cover any details which may not be clear, and to provide any additional information which your officials may require Mr. Skelton will be glad to make officers of his Branch available for consultation. Such consultation might be of help in ensuring the uniformity of information and details which is important for the survey.\n\nFor convenience, the questionnaire is for return direct to the Economic Research and Development Branch of the Department of Trade and Commerce. I should appreciate it, however, if you would let me know how long you think it may take to have material prepared along the general lines I have indicated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd) H. A. Robertson\n\nH. A. Robertson,\nSecretary to the Cabinet\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Day School Construction Program 1950-51\nYour File 1-1-5 (E)\n\nJust prior to receipt of Mr. Neary's letter of October 15th, with regard to the above-mentioned subject, District School Inspector Davey had spent some time preparing a memorandum regarding our school building requirements in British Columbia, a copy of which, together with the enclosures referred to therein, is attached. It is felt that this memorandum, together with the photographs of the existing school buildings, should effectively bring to the attention of those concerned the most urgent need of a comprehensive and effective school construction program in British Columbia.\n\nWe still have hopes that our proposal for the erection of prefabricated school buildings in the Skeena River Agency and at Fort Babine, may be favourable considered by the Department this year, in which case the schools required at these points may be deleted from the list and in any case, the amounts reduced to cover erection costs only.\n\nReturn of Mr. Davey's pictures of the existing school buildings is requested.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOctober 15, 1949\n\nSCHOOL CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS\n\nAn examination of the building requirements at day schools indicates that roughly half of our existing plants are wholly inadequate\u2014at least three of them are in imminent danger of falling down, fourteen are hopelessly over-crowded, and fifteen are buildings designed for some totally different purpose but which have been used as schools presumably for a temporary period which has lasted in some cases over twenty years, as for example at Kincolith and Rocher Deboile.\n\nI have arranged the attached list indicating the requirements in the order that I believe priority should be given to the projects. You will note that I have commented after each of the first fifteen. The picture of some of the other buildings will indicate that many of the remaining projects also require the very earliest possible attention. It will also be noted that nine of the first 15 were to have been undertaken in the current year. No reference is made to the need at the Cariboo Residential School as it is believed the Department is fully aware of the condition there. It will also be noted that the Cape Mudge School has been left off the list, which I hope will be undertaken before the end of the fiscal year.\n\n1. Bella Bella - 4 rooms required with teacherage for two)\n\nA review of our files indicates that this school has been over-crowded since before the resignation of my predecessor, Captain Barry, in 1942. Indeed even as far back as that date children below the age of seven and over the age of fourteen were denied admission because of the lack of accommodation. In 1946 Mr. J.A. Findlay, then acting agent at the Bella Coola Agency, made a survey of the school-age population on this reserve, including only those children from seven to fifteen years of age. This showed a school age population of 157. Of these, 35 were enrolled in Residential schools, and six were in hospital, leaving 116 on the reserve to attend the two room day school capable of handling not more than seventy. At the present time\nthere are 181 children of school age (6 to 16) of whom probably\n20 should be either in a hospital or residential school,\nleaving 161 for enrolment in the day school. It is only because\nthis reserve is removed from a white community that the\ndeplorable conditions have not received unwelcome publicity.\nThere appears to be no reason why this requirement should not\nreceive immediate attention, at least to prepare for building\nnext year. Certainly the need has existed longer and is greater\nthan at Fort St. James.\n\n2. Lakalsap (Greenville) - see attached pictures - 2 rooms with\nteacherage.\n\nI am surprised that the one class-room school building\nat this point survived the 1948-49 winter. The accompanying\npictures indicate to some extent the alarming bulge in the end\nwall but do not show how the teacherage section, apparently\nadded some time after the main portion of the building was\nconstructed, is separating from the remainder of the building.\nI was able, on the occasion of my visit in the spring of 1948\nto stand in the kitchen of the teacherage and see the sky\nthrough the ceiling. Not only is the building falling down but\nthe one class-room is quite inadequate for the school population\nof over 50, after deducting those who should be enrolled in a\nresidential school.\n\n3. Fort Babine (see attached pictures) - 2 rooms with teacherage.\n\nThe above school is an old Hudson Bay building long\nabandoned by the company. The teacherage which appears in the\npicture to be in reasonably good condition is also an abandoned\nHudson Bay Company log house.\n\n4. Hartley Bay (see attached pictures) - 2 rooms with teacherage.\n\nIn this case I can speak from an experience of two years\nof service as teacher from 1933 to 1935. At that time the\nschool was too small and the lighting quite inadequate. This\nyear for the first time two class-rooms have been established\nto accommodate over 50 pupils. This has been made possible by the utilization of an old Indian hall and the continued use of the building shown in the picture. I might add that the hall had been abandoned by the Indians who have constructed a new one.\n\n5. Alert Bay - six class-rooms\n\nIt has been proposed that the pupils from the Residential School attend the Indian Day School. This latter is a four-room building constructed from the former army camp huts at Port Hardy. The Residential school is now using two class-rooms in the main building and two rooms in a condemned building known locally as the \"Old Girls Home\". This fire trap is in such poor condition that classes have had to be discontinued temporarily because of the amount of water which leaks through the roof during heavy rainstorms. The authorized enrolment of the Residential school is 210 which with the 120 pupils in the day school, indicates a need for a total of nine rooms immediately and a tenth to provide for the rapidly growing day school population. I have previously recommended the construction of six rooms on the day school site, leaving the two habitable rooms in the Residential School for the badly needed recreational space for the Residential School pupils. This was to be done by the construction of a four room class-room block and the utilization of an army hut to provide for the other two rooms.\n\n6. Kincolith (see attached picture) - 2 class-rooms with teacherage\n\nThe attached picture taken in 1940 indicates the type of accommodation provided for over fifty pupils, crowded into one class-room. It was with great difficulty that the Superintendent of this Agency persuaded the teacher to return, and I believe that this was only accomplished through his assurance that work would be begun on a new school this year.\n\n7. Shalalth - addition for teacherage\n\nThe teacher of this school is at present sleeping in\na small room at the end of the building originally planned for a small library room. This teacher was also given to understand that the Department expected to provide better accommodation next year.\n\n8. Fort St. James - 2 class-rooms and teacherage required\n\nThe initial planning for construction at this point is already under way.\n\n9. Chehalis - 2 class-rooms required\n\nIt was originally planned to construct a one room addition this year. However, a more detailed examination of the existing building indicated that the foundation and framing were in such poor condition that a two room unit should be constructed. The anticipated enrolment for this year is over 45.\n\n10. Alberni - 3 rooms required\n\nThe Alberni Residential school has a four room block to provide for its authorized enrolment of 225. Temporary accommodation is provided in a section of the basement of the block and by a \"make-shift\" partitioning of a section of the girls' recreation room. The shortage of proper class-room facilities has existed since the construction of the school in 1940.\n\n11. Ahousaht (see attached picture) - 2 class-rooms with teacherage required\n\nThis tiny chapel now used for a school is totally unsuited in every respect.* It housed a maximum enrolment of thirty-nine last year. Some indication of the class-room lighting may be gathered from the windows shown in the picture. These are the chief source of light for the class-room.\n\n12. Moricetown (see attached picture) - 2 class-rooms with teacherage\n\nThis old building can provide only one class-room for the 40 children of school age on this reserve. The lighting is extremely poor, in fact it is one of the most depressing class-rooms I have ever been in. The building is rented from an Indian.\n13. **Rocher Deboule** (see attached picture) one room with teacherage required\n\nThis building is also rented from an Indian and is one of the poorest on a reserve reputed to have had the worst housing conditions of any in B.C. The picture would certainly tend to confirm this. The Superintendent of the Babine Agency is making considerable progress towards the improvement of the housing problem and it is unfortunate that the school building should be such a poor example.\n\n14. **Kitwancool** (see attached picture)\u2014one room with teacherage\n\nThis is another building rented from an Indian. It is totally unsuited for school purposes, and I find it remarkable that teachers have been secured in the last few years.\n\n15. **Village Island** (Mamalilikulla) \u2014one room with teacherage\n\nThe school was apparently held in the church building in the years preceding the war and the teacher in those days occupied a building presumably owned by the church. This latter building has now fallen into such a poor state of repair that it is uninhabitable. A teacher was secured for the current academic year but when plans for the rental of an Indian home as a teacherage fell through he accepted a position at the Alberni Residential School. Anticipated enrolment in this school is 20.\n| Priority | School          | Requirements                                      |\n|---------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | Bella Bella    | 4 class-rooms and teacherage for 4 teachers       |\n| 2       | Lakalsap       | 2 class-rooms with teacherage                     |\n| 3       | Fort Babine    | 2 class-rooms with teacherage                     |\n| 4       | Hartley Bay    | 2 class-rooms with teacherage                     |\n| 5       | Alert Bay      | 4 room block with teacherage                       |\n| 6       | Kincolith      | 2 class-rooms block with teacherage               |\n| 7       | Shalalth       | addition for teacherage                            |\n| 8       | Fort St. James | 2 rooms with teacherage                            |\n| 9       | Chehalis       | 2 rooms with teacherage                            |\n| 10      | Alberni        | four room block with teacherage for 3 teachers    |\n| 11      | Ahousaht       | 2 rooms with teacherage                            |\n| 12      | Moricetown     | 2 rooms with teacherage                            |\n| 13      | Rocher Deboule | 1 room with teacherage                             |\n| 14      | Kitwancool     | 1 room with teacherage                             |\n| 15      | Village Island | 1 room with teacherage                             |\n| 16      | Okanagan       | 2 rooms with teacherage                            |\n| 17      | Kitsegukla     | 1 room with teacherage                             |\n| 18      | Inkameep       | 1 room with teacherage Must be relocated because of lack of water. |\n| 19      | Glen Vowell    | 2 class-rooms with teacherage                     |\n| 20      | Tsartlip       | 2 class-rooms with teacherage                     |\n| 21      | Kitwanga       | 2 class-rooms with teacherage                     |\n| 22      | Quatsino       | 1 room with teacherage                             |\n| 23      | Kyuquot        | teacherage - 2 teachers                            |\n| 24      | Kispiox        | 2 class-rooms with teacherage                     |\n| 25      | Homalco        | 2 class-rooms with teacherage                     |\n| 26      | Gwinaha        | 1 class-room with teacherage                      |\n| 27      | Old Fort       | 1 class-room with teacherage                      |\n| 28      | Kitkatla       | 1 class-room with teacherage                      |\n| 29      | Saanich        | 1 class-room with teacherage                      |\n| Priority | School               | Requirements                      |\n|---------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 30      | Deadman's Creek      | 1 class-room with teacherage      |\n| 31      | Musqueam             | 1 class-room                      |\n| 32      | Nootka               | 1 class-room with teacherage      |\n| 33      | Fountain             | 1 class-room with teacherage      |\n| 34      | Glo-oose             | 1 class-room with teacherage      |\n| 35      | Sugar Cane           | 1 class-room with teacherage      |\n| 36      | Katz                 | 1 class-room with teacherage      |\n| 37      | Alberni Residential  | Hostel for High School pupils     |\n| 38      | St. Georges          | class-room block.                 |\n\nR.F.

McKay Company Limited,\n26 Wellington Street East,\nToronto 1, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of December 12 concerning \"Cinoplate\" blackboard material.\n\nI would like very much to examine one of these blackboards which has been in use for four or five years. Could you tell me of a \"Cinoplate\" blackboard installed in a school in the vicinity of Ottawa?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/McN\ncc Mr. Vincent\n29 November, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nFive Year Plan - Indian Education.\n\nAs I have previously discussed with you, I feel that our policies for the next five years can best be defined under the following categories:\n\n1. Indian Residential Schools,\n2. Indian Day Schools,\n3. Joint Schools,\n4. Secondary Education,\n5. Adult and Vocational Education and Extension Work,\n6. Administration.\n\nIn the following paragraphs I will deal with each of the above categories and outline what I feel should be the basic policies and the construction required during the next five years.\n\n1. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS\n\n(a) Policy -\n\nI feel that no residential schools should either be promised or planned in any way until a thorough educational survey has been carried out by a committee of competent educators. In order that we may have a proper perspective, it is most essential that a representative of the Department of Education of the province concerned be appointed to this committee.\nOnly in this way can a systematic program of residential school construction be carried out where such schools are specifically required.\n\nIn the past the various denominations have taken the initiative with regard to the establishment of residential schools and have pressed the Department into making decisions with regard to their construction. I feel that a new policy must be instituted in which the Department decides on the basis of professional surveys and reports, as to the necessity of erecting this type of school.\n\nWe have now 17 requests on hand for the construction of these schools and I am convinced that several of them are not required. However, it is not possible to arrive at such a decision unless a thorough inspection is made of the reserves concerned and a proper picture presented as to the type of educational facilities which should be provided.\n\nI would estimate that some 12 new residential schools will be built during the period 1950 to 1955, both in new districts and as replacements for present schools.\n\nTo clarify this situation, therefore, I feel we should make it known to the denominations that in future the Indian residential school will be mainly for the following categories of Indian pupils:\n\n(I) those who are orphans or who come from homes in which competent welfare workers decide that institutional care is needed,\n\n(II) those whose parents earned their living through occupations which demand their absence from reserves or villages during long periods of the standard academic year,\n\n(III) those pupils coming from reserves on which the number of Indian children of school age are either too few or whose homes are too scattered to permit the operation of Indian day schools,\n\n(IV) those who are ready for high school education and for whom residential schools can provide board and lodging while they attend nearby provincial high schools.\n(b) Construction Required.\n\nIn view of the policy outlined above, it will be appreciated that we cannot clearly define the exact number of residential schools required during this five year period. An estimate, however, would be that between six and ten such schools will be required. In some cases these will only be hostels and the Department will operate the classrooms or arrange with provincial school boards to operate them.\n\n2. INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\n(a) Policy\n\nI feel that the main emphasis in our five year plan should be the erection of Indian day schools on all reserves upon which our inspectors report that conditions will permit the erection of such schools.\n\nWe have made a good start during the past three years towards the elimination of reserves upon which no educational facilities whatsoever were provided. The number of Indian children in our schools increased last year by 2,000 and we hope for a similar increase this year.\n\nWith this emphasis on the provision of day schools, we must also be prepared to provide good salaries and securities for teachers of such schools. We cannot compete with provincial schools in the field of social activity, amenities of living such as hydro, running water and similar facilities, so we must be prepared to outbid provincial schools in such matters as salaries, leave to attend universities, and better living conditions in the schools and teacherages.\n\nI have already reported on the great shortage of teachers which exists now in Canada and which will continue to exist. Therefore a basic feature of our five year program will be the attraction to our day schools of a better qualified and experienced teacher.\n\n(b) Construction Required.\n\nIt is estimated that 460 day school classrooms at least will be required and possibly 500 by 1955. Of the\n460 used as a minimum figure about 350 will be one-room schools, 30 will be two-room schools and some 40 classrooms will have to be provided in three, four and six room schools.\n\n3. JOINT SCHOOLS\n\n(a) Policy\n\nAs you are aware, the Parliamentary Committee made the following recommendation with regard to joint schools:\n\n\"Your committee recommends the revision of those sections of the Act which pertain to education, in order to prepare Indian children to take their place as citizens.\n\n\"Your Committee, therefore, recommends that wherever and whenever possible Indian children should be educated in association with other children.\"\n\nWith this in mind, we should not build Indian day or residential schools on or near reserves on which the Indian children can be educated in white schools. In order to have our children admitted to these schools, we must be prepared to pay a proportionate share of the capital cost of additional schools or classrooms which might be required because Indian children are admitted.\n\nWe will never get local school authorities to educate Indian children unless we are prepared therefore to do the following:\n\n(i) to pay adequate tuition fees based on the annual cost of education per pupil in the school concerned;\n\n(ii) where necessary to contribute to the capital cost of additional buildings or classrooms required for Indian children.\n\nWe have made a good start in having Indian children admitted to white schools and last year there were 925 children enrolled in joint and in provincial schools.\n3. JOINT SCHOOLS (cont'd.)\n\n(b) Construction required.\n\nWe are not in a position to calculate the amounts which will be required as contributions to the erection of joint schools or as assistance in the addition of extra classrooms in provincial schools. In Item No. 6 I am considering the establishment of positions to be entitled \"Regional Administrator of Indian Schools\". When these officials are appointed we will no doubt have many requests from local school boards as they are contacted and made acquainted with our new policy with regard to joint education. I would estimate that approximately $500,000.00 will be required in such joint projects over the next five years.\n\n4. SECONDARY EDUCATION\n\n(a) Policy\n\nThis is becoming an increasing item in our educational estimates. With the improvements in our school system, there are naturally more pupils who are reaching the upper grades.\n\nOur policy is of course that these children be educated in provincial high schools. This often makes it necessary to have the Indian children concerned board in the communities in which the schools are located. Due to present high living conditions, this is a very expensive item and we are becoming increasingly careful in the selection of students.\n\nI feel that certain of our residential schools could well be earmarked for caring for some of these Indian children during the time they are attending local high schools. While not too many of these residential schools are located near towns, we do have those which could be used for this purpose. This would not preclude their being used for younger children but would mean temporary alterations to accommodate high school pupils and to give them adequate study space, etc. Insofar as university education is concerned, it is recommended that we be most scrupulous in checking the reports submitted upon all students who are suggested\nfor such courses. The education of one of these pupils for one year can otherwise amount to fifty per cent of the cost of operating a small one-room day school with possibly twenty children in attendance.\n\nI would also recommend that care be taken in assessing the progress made by these pupils and that aptitude tests be given, particularly to those intending to go through for Law, Medicine and other costly professions.\n\n(b) Construction Required\n\nWe might possibly be requested occasionally to contribute a small amount towards the addition of extra classrooms at local white high schools. I do not feel that this should cost more than $50,000.00 over the next five years.\n\n5. ADULT AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND EXTENSION WORK\n\n(a) Policy\n\nI feel that a great deal can be done towards the promotion of good attendance at our Indian day schools by the establishment of Home and School or Parent-Teacher Clubs. One of the weaknesses of our day school system up to the present time has been the lack of additional attendance of the pupils. We are attempting to overcome this by better schools, better teachers, and better equipment. However, these efforts on our part will do little if we fail to achieve the co-operation of the Indians' parents. We must make our schools \"community-conscious\" and have the teachers reach out to the parents, not only through the medium of home and school clubs but also by means of concerts, sports events and social evenings.\n\nWhen a Supervisor of Physical Education and Recreation has been appointed, I feel that he should be given the opportunity of preparing a five year programme in this regard, covering such features as the following:\n\n(i) The Indian Day School as a part of Indian reserve life;\n\n(ii) Adult education in health, general welfare and educational subjects through the use of films, lectures and classes;\n(iii) The promotion of sports and athletics on Indian reserves and in Indian schools;\n\n(iv) The institution of a program of health education and corrective physical education.\n\n(b) Construction required\n\nAt the present time we do not intend to inaugurate a very heavy program of construction of recreation halls and gymnasiums. When our construction of day schools begins to catch up with the demand, then some consideration can be given to such projects. In the meantime, we are confining these items to contributions towards recreation halls at residential schools which have inadequate facilities in this regard.\n\n6. ADMINISTRATION\n\n(a) Policy\n\nI feel that another feature of our five-year policy should be the continued decentralization of our educational system. It is impossible now, with the number of schools concerned, to make proper decisions on all matters here in Ottawa. I have recommended before, and I again recommend most strongly, the establishment of positions to be entitled \"Regional Administrator of Schools\" or \"Regional Inspectors of Indian Schools\". This position would combine the duties of School Inspector with supervision of buildings and equipment, the selection of teachers and the general administration of the schools in his region.\n\nMany other changes have been made within the last three years and on a recent inspection trip, many teachers commented on the improvements which had been made. One point in particular is with regard to the provision of school text-books. I feel that the improvements which have recently resulted are well worth all the time and effort which it took on our part to negotiate with the King's Printer and others concerned. The school supply situation is much better than it has ever been and we will endeavour to keep it thus.\nWe are also endeavouring to speed up the answering of correspondence but find this very difficult in many cases, due to lack of professional advice from the field. I feel that many questions are referred here now which could be entirely settled in the field without any need for correspondence with the Department. For example, in British Columbia, many professional matters are settled by Inspector Davy and the number of problems raised in letters from the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia is relatively much fewer than from the Regional Supervisors in other provinces.\n\n(b) Construction required\n\nOther than the provision of offices for the regional administrators or regional school inspectors, I do not think that any funds will be required under this heading.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThe basis of our preparation of this five-year plan is the immediate need for some 450 classrooms to provide educational facilities for Indian children who have none whatsoever. A minimum of 70 additional classrooms will be required by the end of 1955 to provide replacements for completely dilapidated buildings and to allow for natural increase in school population, based on census figures. Twenty-five (25) joint schools will be a minimum requirement.\n\nIt is felt that this need can best be provided by the erection of the following classrooms with estimated costs as shown:\n\n(a) Day Schools ... 460 ... $8,440,000.\n\n(b) Residential Schools 60 ... 1,280,000.\n\nThis means the erection of about 350 one-room schools, 30 two-room schools and 40 classrooms in three, four and six room day schools. It provides for the minimum of six residential schools at the most needed sites as recommended by educational survey committees.\nThe total contribution towards joint elementary and secondary schools will amount to approximately $550,000.00.\n\nIt is impossible to calculate how many of our day schools can be considered as joint schools until field officials are appointed who can work with educational committees, provincial inspectors and local school boards in determining where and to what extent such joint educational plans are possible. Many of our one-room schools may thus become joint schools and more of our children handled by provincial educational authorities.\n\nThe grand total estimated required for the erection or as contributions towards the erection of these schools will amount to $10,270,000.00.\n\nI have prepared a chart attached hereto, to indicate the breakdown of these schools by type and by provinces.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

In a speech before the delegates, Mr. E. Spiegle, director of the division of education, said that the surplus heat should not be wasted.\n\nThere may be implications for us particularly in regard to two-room schools, or future classrooms are added at residential centres.\n\nI had hoped that Rev. Fr. Bracken's suggestion that the teaching positions at Fort Alexander would be omitted might have been adopted, but it seems not. There will, therefore, be all the features of an apartment except a bathroom, such facilities being available in the residential school fifty yards away. But the hoped-for auditorium will not be available.\n\nI note that these Dryden rooms are 50 ft. long, but the number of pupils is restricted. You will recall one of our schools which placed 60 pupils in a room 40' x 23'.\n\nI hope that at Portage and elsewhere where classrooms are added our architects will design something with flexibility in mind.\n\nC.A.V.

We now have a new standard one-room school plan in the course of preparation. It is our intention to provide three separate sets of toilets, as follows:\n\n(a) Two toilets for the girls,\n\n(b) Two toilets for the boys and one wall type urinal,\n\n(c) A single toilet for the teacher.\n\nMost of these schools are in areas where no running water is available and your unit should be satisfactory for our purposes. We have noted the tank length listed in your catalogue and wonder whether it would be possible to substitute a concrete tank for the metal tank shown. These new schools would all follow a standard plan and we would like to put in a concrete tank while the school is being constructed. Would you please advise whether this would be possible and, if so, whether you could assist in designing a satisfactory unit.\n\nIf you have a representative in the Ottawa area with some engineering knowledge, it would be appreciated if you could have him call on us at his convenience.

Furthermore sometimes we find that these schools are closed down due to weather conditions or reservations and also during the holiday seasons and if these happen to occur when the winter is extremely cold there is the possibility of the septic tank freezing, and if the tank is cement it will crack and is destroyed whereas steel or iron will expand and will not crack and is water-proof.

The wall under this shelf should be lined with plywood.\n\nCost of Building - It is hoped to keep the cost of erection of this school under $14,500.00. Plan 885 has been costing about $12,000.00. I attach the preliminary drawing prepared by Precision Housing Limited for a one-room school indicating the type of window glass now being used in provincial schools and in a prefabricated school which we bought from this Company.\n\nBernard F.

O.S.S WHOLESALE COMPANY\n423 Bottomley Avenue\nSASKATOON, Saskatchewan.\n\nJanuary the 15th, 1949.\n\nThe Department Of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAttached find a circular of the \"SAFGARD\" MILK AND CREAM FASTSTERILIZERS and which we are Western Canada Selling Agents for.\n\nWe know that you will recommend these and will purchase them where you have Indian Schools and Hospitals and where local raw milk is used.\n\nThe price is $85.00 and to the Government we allow 10% discounts.\n\nDelivery time can be guaranteed within 2 weeks from the time that we receive your valued orders.\n\nShould there be a change, which we hope in the duties and taxes on those equipments from the existing rates charged, then of course the price herein stated will be lowered accordingly.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nH.J.O.S.S WHOLESALE COMPANY\n\nPer.,\nSales Manager.\n\nHJOSO\nTHE MODEL P-2000\n\nSAFGARD\n\nHOME MILK AND CREAM PASTEURIZER\n\nSpecifications\n\n1 AGITATION\nThrough the exclusive SAFGARD method, an electrically driven agitator keeps milk in constant motion. There are no \"hot spots\" to burn the milk and spoil flavor \u2014 no \"cold spots\" where bacteria can escape destruction. Agitation helps preserve the original structure of the milk; it prevents \"welling off\" of fat globules and curdling. This feature also enables you to pasteurize cream. In addition, SAFGARD continuous agitation during the cooling period, a \"must\" for fine flavor and good cream line.\n\n2 INDIRECT HEATING\nHeat is transferred by heating element to milk through an electrically controlled water jacket. Through the special SAFGARD Phosphaseal\u00ae (made by the Lay Rubber Co.), the heat wraps around the milk container, assuring a uniform transfer of heat to all parts of the milk. Improper heating without agitation of milk causes milk to acquire a burned taste, and clumps of milk rise to the surface of its best milk elements \u2014 they rise to the surface in the form of fatty, curdled scum which is almost impossible to stir back into the milk again.\n\n3 QUICK COOLING\nCooling is accomplished by flowing cold water through the unit while the agitator continuously circulates milk. Efficient overflow is easily attached to the outer jacket and can be inserted into the kitchen sink. This cools milk and cream quickly and evenly, assuring improved flavor and better cream line. A SAFGARD ice bath is available as an accessory when running water is not available.\n\n4 AUTOMATIC OPERATION\nThe temperature inside the unit is held automatically and accurately at pasteurizing temperature through a bellows-actuated, snap action type thermostat maintained by the built-in Electric Control. The thermostat is extremely accurate. The length of pasteurizing time is controlled by a Hayden electric timer switch. These automatic controls make it so simple that even a child can operate it.\n\n5 DEPENDABLE POWER\nThe solenoid motor is made of two slow-moving parts \u2014 no brushes, gears or armatures to wear or burn out. The Du pont nylon bushing assures oil-free, trouble-free performance. Operates at less than 50 watts. Plugs in any AC 110-120 Volt 60 cycle AC circuit. Large heavy heating element (\"Color Hammer-Chromalox\") is on only a fraction of the time while operating whereas smaller wattage elements are a part of the circuit. Uses only 1/2 cent per gallon to pasteurize. Minneapolis-Honeywell mercury switch controls motor action.\n\n6 SANITARY CONSTRUCTION\nMilk contact surfaces and canopy are constructed of sturdy lightweight aluminum. Weaveless aluminum milk container is specially anodized to make it non-corrosive. Con veniently located milk dipper. Stainless steel removable dasher. Attractive bakelite handles on outer container. Aluminum construction makes the SAFGARD lightweight, portable, easy to store.\n\n7 NEGATIVE PHOSPHATASE TESTS\nMilk pasteurized in the SAFGARD easily passes these rigid tests for milk's health assurance. This is your assurance that milk pasteurized in the SAFGARD is just as pure and safe as milk pasteurized in strictly supervised commercial equipment.\n\n8 The SAFGARD capacity \u2014 from two quarts to two gallons makes it adaptable to large or small family size. As little as two quarts can be pasteurized at one time. Small amounts of table cream can be pasteurized or, if the housewife desires, milk can be pasteurized each day. Because of the better keeping qualities of pasteurized products, we do however recommend that the full capacity be used so that pasteurization does not become merely daily.\n\n9 FULLY GUARANTEED\nThe SAFGARD Pasteurizer is guaranteed to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for 1 year from date of customer's purchase. If at any time during this period, the unit becomes inoperative, it will be repaired or replaced at no charge.\n\n\u00a9SAFGARD PHOSPHASEAL\u2014The scientifically designed Latex cover for the milk container. The Phosphaseal assures a negative Phosphatase test for milk pasteurized in the SAFGARD Home Milk and Cream Pasteurizer. Phosphatase tests (sometimes called \"blue tests\") are the tests recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for testing commercial pasteurizing efficiency.\n\nPRINTED IN U.S.A.\nPASTEURIZE TO PROTECT YOUR HEALTH\n\nThere are two kinds of milk-borne diseases\u2014the cattle diseases which can infect man and the human diseases which are carried from person to person in milk. The greatest possible care and sanitation in milk handling offer no sure protection against these diseases.\n\nMost dangerous and most widespread of the cattle diseases is undulant fever, sometimes known as Milk Fever, or cow's camp fever. Hard to diagnose and harder to cure, it saps the strength of the animal and ultimately shortens human life. It is a dangerous enemy that is estimated to infect 10,000 new victims each year.\n\nHaving tuberculosis is another dangerous disease which reaches man through milk from infected cattle.\n\nPASTEURIZE WITH SAFGARD\n\nHOME MILK AND CREAM PASTEURIZER\n\nSAFGARD\u2014the original home milk and cream pasteurizer\u2014is designed upon the same proved principles which make big commercial pasteurizing units such effective guards against disease.\n\nTESTED AND PROVED\u2014Exhaustive tests\u2014many of them well-known public-house or \"blue\" tests have been conducted on SAFGARD by the country's outstanding dairy college laboratories... in all cases it has more than met their standards of efficiency in its ability to kill disease-producing bacteria.\n\nEASY TO USE\u2014SAFGARD is completely automatic. It takes less than a minute to fill and start it... from then on, completely automatic precision controls take over the operation... there's no work to do, no chance for human error.\n\nECONOMICAL\u2014You can't measure the protection of your family's health in terms of money... but you can protect their health from milk-borne diseases with SAFGARD for just a penny a gallon.\n\nGET PROTECTION TODAY\u2014Don't gamble. Insure yourself against the pain and sickness which milk-borne diseases bring. Don't drink raw milk... drink pasteurized milk... pasteurized the safe, sure way... with a SAFGARD Home Milk and Cream Pasteurizer.\n\nManufactured by\nGUARD-IT MANUFACTURING CO.\n1501 SOUTH LAFLIN STREET \u2022 CHICAGO 8, ILL.\n\nDistributed by\nH.J.

It is the culmination of years of experience in designing and manufacturing dishwashing machines for commercial and industrial users. Perfect for restaurants, hotels, industrial cafeterias, hospitals, lunch counters, drug stores, and other places where food is served.\n\nArnott COMPANY LIMITED\nDUFFERIN at BOLTON WINNIPEG CANADA\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files\n(62-10, Volume File I-L-5, part 7)\nMODEL 1-A JACKSON DISHWASHER\nMEETS 3 PRESENT-DAY KITCHEN NEEDS\n\n1-A Is \"The Boy Who Can Do a Man's Job\"\n\nCompact, yet it has a rated capacity of 1,200 dishes, 8,000 glasses, or 5,000 pieces of silverware per hour. Its capacity is due to its exclusive double revolving wash and rinse spray, with the all electric welded wire basket. 1-A is ideal for small or medium-sized establishments and also makes an ideal auxiliary unit for glasses in those larger establishments already having dishwashers. Multiple installations in hospitals cost little, save money on operations and in man-and-woman power. Because of the action of the Jackson toolproof strainer, there is never any greasy contaminated water in the machine. 1-A's wash reservoir only holds 3 gallons; it is replenished automatically by overflow, kept hot and clean by fresh rinse water. Provision is made for the insertion of electric immersion heaters.\n\n1-A CAN TAKE IT\n\n1-A is built to last a lifetime. Its body consists of a one-piece casting which incorporates both wash and rinse reservoirs. All moving parts of 1-A are interchangeable and function by the physical law of centrifugal force, rather than by any mechanical means pervious to wear.\n\n1-A IS EASIER, FASTER\n\nThe perfect efficiency with which the double directional spray lines of Model 1-A and other Jackson Models function, distributing water under high pressure over every square inch of the machine's inner surface, increases the speed of the dishwashing procedure, because of the thoroughness with which it washes, rinses and sanitizes dishes, glasses, and silverware. The revolving hood of 1-A permits the operator with means of using the same wash water over and over again. Correctly installed, with basket supports flush with level of drainboard or dish table operators do not have to lift wet dishes from the beginning to the end of the dishwashing process. However, if desired it is compact enough so it can be set on a drain board.\n\nThis view of Model 1-A shows simplicity of construction in three prime essentials: Body, a one-piece casting containing built-in wash and rinse reservoirs; revolving hood, suspended from natural pivot point of top piping connection; circulatory system\u2014single hot water intake supplies water for both wash and rinse reservoirs, part of which is routed from rinse reservoir to upper rinse spray through supporting pipe shown on right.\n\nBasket for glass and silverware is part of 1-A's standard equipment; sturdy all-steel wire welded construction.\nThe JACKSON METHOD of dishwashing cleans more pieces per hour with less water, less power, less labor.\n\nBY FORCED SPRAYING, RECIRCULATION\n\nAll Jackson Dishwashers function on a principle of hydraulic force applied through a designated area. This is not a random force, as built up in the regular 'splash' method of mechanical dishwashing, but is carefully calculated and directed to cover every bit of exposed dish surface. Spray arms of Jackson machines are strategically located to facilitate the downward and upward through the basket-container area, from the orbits through which they revolve both clockwise and counter-clockwise (to cover both front and back areas). Although the Jackson Method features a constant play of solution and water over every inch inside and outside the machine, yet it does not consume any more than the modest amount of water used during the 10 second rinsing operation. This is due to the water's being recirculated through the machine, which not only assures thermal stability, but permits use of a minimum amount of dish cleanser compound. Wash water may be recirculated through a Jackson machine without becoming contaminated due to the fact that the greasy water is carried out automatically. You see, the Jackson combination strainer-overflow-drain plug segregates all particles of food and residue. A basket of greasy dirty dishes or a basket of broken dishes and yet they will come out sparkling clean. Hot water should be held at not less than 140 degrees for washing. Rinse water should be not less than 180 degrees. Temperature drop of approximately 40 degrees occurs in its passage from wash reservoir to through the machine's circulatory system, so that no other thermal control is needed. The heavy one piece casting once heated helps to maintain the proper temperature in both the wash and rinse reservoirs.\n\nJACKSON DISHWASHER \u2014 Model 1-A\n\nSTANDARD EQUIPMENT\n\nMotor: 60 cycle, 110 volts, AC (DC optional at slight extra cost).\nTwo Dish Baskets, coated to protect dishes.\nOne Combination Glass and Silver Basket of all steel wire welded construction.\nOne extension Cord ready to plug in.\n\nDIMENSIONS\n\nHeight: 33\u00bc\"\nDiameter: 20\u00be\"\n\nCLEANING OPERATION\n\nA \u00bc h.p. motor operates a centrifugal pump, recirculating the water from the reservoir through double spray arms, each with four nozzles alternated on each, revolving in opposite directions. The water sprays against the dishes at high pressure, from every angle, removing all particles of food or grease.\n\nRINSING OPERATION\n\nSeparate revolving sprays, operating at the top and at the bottom, rinse with water fresh from the rinse reservoir. The rinse water replenishes the wash water in the wash reservoir, and automatically the greasy water escapes through the overflow, leaving the water in the reservoir clean and hot for the next washing.\n\nFOR INSTALLATION\n\nSize of hole to be cut in dish table or drainboard for purpose of installing Jackson Dishwasher, Model 1-A, should be 18\u00bd\". Provision is made to install \u00be\" pipe legs to desired height.\nJACKSON DISHWASHER\n\nPIVOT SUPPORT \u2014 A\nAllows suspended hood to revolve freely through its full circumference and in either direction, so that container baskets may be inserted from one side of the dish table and removed from the other\u2014while also including upper revolving rinse spray.\n\nBASKET \u2014 B\nAll-welded steel wire construction has proven its ability to hold as many dishes as other baskets twice its size are easier and lighter to handle, more sanitary and will outlast the other makes. Coated with a protective compound which will not mark dishes.\n\nMOTOR \u2014 C\n\u00bc horsepower electric motor.\n\nPLUGS \u2014 D\nRemovable so that electric immersion heaters may be installed.\n\nSELF-CLOSING VALVE \u2014 E\nControls the entire water system. Both for filling reservoirs and doing the rinsing.\n\nSINGLE PUMP ASSEMBLY \u2014 F\nWhich incorporates shaft bearings, easily interchangeable. The John Crane water pump is a self-contained unit insuring against leakage.\n\nMONEL METAL REVOLVING HOOD \u2014 L\nContains a slide panel opening which may be turned to any position in the hood\u2019s orbit, thus providing for ease and convenience in operation.\n\nRINSE RESERVOIR \u2014 K\nIncorporated into the single-piece casting which is the body of the I-A machine, the rinse reservoir is always full with 3 gallons of fresh hot water under pressure which may be brought up to desired temperature during the brief period of the washing operation if sufficient hot water is not supplied from the tap.\n\nWASH RESERVOIR \u2014 J\nCapacity, approximately 3 gallons. It is supplied directly from the rinse reservoir, receives a constant supply of fresh hot water during the rinsing operations.\n\nDRAIN \u2014 I\nPlaced 1\u00bd inch directly underneath so that connections may be made at any angle.\n\nINTAKE \u2014 H\nThree-fourths inch threaded inlet for hot water is the only water inlet on the machine.\n\nLEG PLUGS \u2014 G\nTapped for three-fourths inch standard pipe. Tubular legs can be extended to desired height.\nCompact DISHWASHING COMPARTMENT with in-and-out openings makes possible use in Limited Space\n\nIN ONE SIDE \u2014 OUT THE OTHER!\nModified closure of Jackson Model I-A Dishwasher permits convenient installations in small spaces. This type closure, opening in both sides as shown, is an exclusive Jackson I-A feature which greatly facilitates operations. Speedier, cleaner, more convenient, it also safeguards dishes; they do not have to be lifted from table or drainboard from start to finish of washing-rinsing process.\n\nCOMBINATION STRAINER-OVERFLOW-DRAIN PLUG \u2014 A\nAn exclusive foolproof feature insures against flooding of machine and prevents damage to parts through clogging. No foreign matter can get to pump or sprays as long as strainer is in position, and water will not circulate through system when strainer is not in position.\n\nAUXILIARY STRAINER \u2014 B\nAdded protection; to be placed in front of pump.\n\nBASKET SUPPORT RODS \u2014 C\nSturdy steel rods may be brought flush with surface of dish table when machine is countersunk in it, thus allowing baskets to be slid in and out without lifting.\n\nDOUBLE REVOLVING WASH SPRAY \u2014 D\nDistributes water with even pressure to every square inch of the interior surface. These spray tubes are accessible and may be taken out for cleaning without the need of special tools.\n\nLOWER RINSE SPRAYS \u2014 E\n\nANOTHER NEAT INSTALLATION\nWhen use of the space-saving revolving hood on Jackson Dishwasher Model I-A is not desired, it may be installed as shown here. The width of the table here illustrated is sufficient to allow the operator to insert baskets from the side of the installation. For convenience care should be taken to have the basket supports brought flush with the table surface during the installation process. This facilitates handling of baskets by permitting operator to insert and withdraw them without lifting. This type of installation requires a table not less than 30 inches in width. However, if desired it is compact enough so it can be set on a drain board.\nJACKSON DISHWASHERS are used in all 48 states and foreign countries as well...\n\nJackson Dishwashers have proved their dependability and economy in eating establishments the nation over, as well as in many foreign countries. You too can do a better dishwashing job, at less cost with the modern, high-speed Jackson Dishwasher.\n\nAccessories and Optional Equipment\n\nELECTRIC IMMERSION HEATER\nProvision is made in the base of both wash and rinse reservoirs for installation of electric immersion heaters for the purpose of maintaining temperature of the water. Rinse water should be supplied at a temperature not less than 180\u00b0 F.\n\nTHERMOSTAT CONTROL\nThe thermostat control is for the purpose of controlling the temperature of the water so that the electric immersion heater shuts off when the temperature goes beyond 180\u00b0.\n\nINDICATING THERMOMETER\nThe indicating thermometer is proof of proper sanitation. When your Health Inspector comes in he merely looks at the temperature registered. A most useful accessory.\n\nDISH TABLES\nDish tables (illustrated on inside page) can be furnished as optional equipment.

Neary,\nSuperintendent, Education Service,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n220 Queen St.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nRe: Labour saving devices in Indian Residential Schools\n\nWe are interested to hear that you are purchasing more labour-saving equipment for the Indian Residential Schools. They will save time and effort in doing routine work on the part of both the staff and children and will do a better job.\n\nWith regard to the dishwashing machine described in the folder attached to your letter of January 13th, we cannot say we have had any experience with such machines. This particular type is usually installed in very small operations such as hospital ward kitchens or small soda fountains. The wash tank capacity is extremely small, actually holding not more than a good size dishpan. Following are the pros and cons for the machine as we see it:\n\nPoints For\n\n1. Small space required for installation but sufficient drain tables necessary.\n2. Metal racks lighter than wooden ones. Metal racks may increase breakage though.\n3. Price of this machine much less than most machines.\n4. Water supply limited in the Muscowequan School.\n\nPoints Against\n\n1. Doors, for children, harder to open than curtains. The reach may be too great for the children.\n2. Round rack harder to fill than square ones.\n3. Metal racks may increase breakage.\n4. 3 gallons of wash water very small quantity\u2014consideration should be given to the quantity of detergent which would be used (rapid change of water in tank).\n5. Machine may have to be emptied and cleaned of garbage residue during washing because of the small quantity of water to pro-\nPoints Against (Cont'd)\n\nportion of garbage residue which may collect.\n\n6. Better for smaller operation, e.g., hospital ward kitchen.\n7. More and better supervision required when rinse not automatic.\n8. \u00bd h.p. pump is not as efficient as a more powerful one.\n\nWhereas the rate capacity of this machine is stated at 1200 dishes per hour, it is doubtful if the children would be able to fill the rack quickly enough to operate the machine efficiently. It is doubtful whether the machine would operate for an hour without draining the tank and cleaning it.\n\nWe would recommend a machine with:\n\n(1) \u00bd h.p. motor\n(2) An automatic rinse (it is too easy to put dishes through the machine without rinsing it if a hand switch is used).\n(3) A machine with curtains rather than doors as it is difficult for children to manipulate doors.\n\nA machine with the above mentioned specifications will cost considerably more but no doubt will give more efficient and longer service.\n\nI hope this information will be of some assistance to you in making your selection.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL. B. Pett, Ph.D., M.D.,\nChief, Nutrition Division.\n15 January, 1930.\n\nMr. Weir\n\nOn the 11th instant the Reverend J. O. Plourde called on us to discuss the erection of a residential school at Chesterfield Inlet. He suggested that if this Administration would supply materials delivered at Churchill, Manitoba, his organization would be prepared to transport them to Chesterfield and erect the building.\n\nIn order that we might have some idea of the amount of money involved, I sent Mr. J. G. Wright and Father Plourde to discuss the matter with Mr. Buck. Father Plourde outlined to Mr. Buck the general specifications for the proposed school which should be designed to accommodate 50 resident pupils. The general specifications for the building were as follows:\n\n- 2 dormitories housing 25 pupils each.\n- 7 individual rooms for 7 teaching sisters.\n- 1 dining hall for 50 pupils.\n- 1 dining room for teaching sisters.\n- 1 dining room for 4 male teachers.\n- 1 recreation room.\n- 1 kitchen.\n- 1 bakery.\n- 1 laundry.\n- Cold storage quarters with 1 low-temperature compartment for meat and 1 compartment for foods which must not be frozen.\n\nFather Plourde was emphatic that the building should be designed with maximum insulation to provide economy in heating. He felt it should be heated with coal as they have found oil too expensive. It would be impossible to have a basement but a suitable central heating plant should be provided. Provision will also have to be made for requisite electric power for lighting and the operation of equipment.\n\nIn order that we may have some idea of what the cost of the materials would be for such a building, I should be glad if Mr. Buck would prepare a sketch design and let me have an estimate of the cost of materials. It will not be necessary at this stage to prepare elaborate plans or itemized details of the materials required.\n\n'sgd' R. A. Gibson\n\nR. A.

In the economic review the Minister of Finance gave in presenting the budget on October 29th, he referred to recent currency changes and to economic conditions in the United States, and mentioned the possibility of developments which might affect Canadian trade and the level of economic activity in Canada. The Minister added:\n\n\"It is with these possibilities in mind that the government is actively reviewing measures to counteract any serious downturn that might develop in our export markets and in the level of economic activity at home. As hon. members know, we have already taken steps to give still greater encouragement to housing construction, and we are in the midst of discussions with the provinces regarding both the magnitude and the timing of extensive work on the trans-Canada highway. Other development projects are also under review, so that they may be undertaken at the appropriate time. We have also been considering measures to deal with any special situations or difficulties which have already emerged or which may emerge even though general economic activity remains high.\"\n\nThe matters to which the Minister of Finance referred are of interest to most, if not all departments of the government.\n\n2. It is expected that it may be possible to proceed in the next twelve months with useful projects of a national character with less strain upon available supplies of labour and material than would have been the case until now. It is also expected that the effect of any change in the rate of economic activity may affect different parts of the country unevenly. In the circumstances it is of importance that departments of government should be in a position to proceed at an early date with projects which are already included in their estimates and which relate to areas that may be particularly affected. Similarly, departments should bring forward additional proposals which they may have for expenditures in such areas.\n\n3. Since 1945, an attempt has been made to build up a \"shelf\" of fully-planned public projects which might be carried forward at short notice when desired. The Cabinet has now directed that the basis of the shelf should be altered. It is to be replaced by a capital investment programme of construction, industrial and resource development projects in more general form, which may be planned in detail as the time approaches for implementation. The programme is to include projects solely under federal jurisdiction, and also projects shared with provincial or municipal governments and with private industry. It is to be kept approximately five years ahead at all times and to include projects in the three planning categories used in the recent survey -\n(a) those fully planned,\n(b) those in various stages of planning, and\n(c) those under preliminary consideration.\n\nTo expedite plans in relation to such projects the attention of departments is drawn to the Reconstruction Vote, which may be used for the employment of consultants, and to the engineering assistance available for specific assignments in the Department of Reconstruction and Supply. Any enquiries with regard to this matter should be directed to the Deputy Minister of Reconstruction and Supply.\n\n4. The Cabinet has also directed that a further survey of the stage of planning in relation to projects of the character referred to above should be made by the Economic Research and Development Branch of the Department of Trade and Commerce, in conjunction with the Department of Reconstruction and Supply, on March 31st, 1950. You may wish to have this in mind in order that plans may be advanced as far as possible by that date.\n\nN. A.

Indian Residential Schools,\n2. Indian Day Schools,\n3. Joint Schools,\n4. Secondary Education,\n5. Adult and Vocational Education and Extension Work,\n6. Administration.\n\nIn the following paragraphs I will deal with each of the above categories and outline what I feel should be the basic policies and the construction required during the next five years.\n\n1. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS\n\n(a) Policy -\n\nI feel that no residential schools should either be promised or planned in any way until a thorough educational survey has been carried out by a committee of competent educators. In order that we may have a proper perspective, it is most essential that a representative of the Department of Education of the province concerned be appointed to this committee.\nOnly in this way can a systematic program of residential school construction be carried out where such schools are specifically required.\n\nIn the past the various denominations have taken the initiative with regard to the establishment of residential schools and have pressed the Department into making decisions with regard to their construction. I feel that a new policy must be instituted in which the Department decides on the basis of professional surveys and reports, as to the necessity of erecting this type of school.\n\nWe have now 17 requests on hand for the construction of these schools and I am convinced that several of them are not required. However, it is not possible to arrive at such a decision unless a thorough inspection is made of the reserves concerned and a proper picture presented as to the type of educational facilities which should be provided.\n\nI would estimate that some 12 new residential schools will be required during the period 1950 to 1955, both in new districts and as replacements for present schools.\n\nTo clarify this situation, therefore, I feel we should make it known to the denominations that in future the Indian residential school will be mainly for the following categories of Indian pupils:\n\n(I) those who are orphans or who come from homes in which competent welfare workers decide that institutional care is needed,\n\n(II) those whose parents earned their living through occupations which demand their absence from reserves or villages during long periods of the standard academic year,\n\n(III) those pupils coming from reserves on which the number of Indian children of school age are either too few or whose homes are too scattered to permit the operation of Indian day schools,\n\n(IV) those who are ready for high school education and for whom residential schools can provide board and lodging while they attend nearby provincial high schools.\n(b) Construction Required.\n\nIn view of the policy outlined above, it will be appreciated that we cannot clearly define the exact number of residential schools required during this five year period. An estimate, however, would be that between six and ten such schools will be required. In some cases these will only be hostels and the Department will operate the classrooms or arrange with provincial school boards to operate them.\n\n2. INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\n(a) Policy\n\nI feel that the main emphasis in our five year plan should be the erection of Indian day schools on all reserves upon which our inspectors report that conditions will permit the erection of such schools.\n\nWe have made a good start during the past three years towards the elimination of reserves upon which no educational facilities whatsoever were provided. The number of Indian children in our schools increased last year by 2,000 and we hope for a similar increase this year.\n\nWith this emphasis on the provision of day schools, we must also be prepared to provide good salaries and securities for teachers of such schools. We cannot compete with provincial schools in the field of social activity, amenities of living such as hydro, running water and similar facilities, so we must be prepared to outbid provincial schools in such matters as salaries, leaves to attend universities, and better living conditions in the schools and teacherages.\n\nI have already reported on the great shortage of teachers which exists now in Canada and which will continue to exist. Therefore a basic feature of our five year program will be the attraction to our day schools of a better qualified and experienced teacher.\n\n(b) Construction required.\n\nIt is estimated that 460 day school classrooms at least will be required and possibly 500 by 1955. Of the\n460 used as a minimum figure about 350 will be one-room schools; 30 will be two-room schools and some 40 classrooms will have to be provided in three, four and six room schools.\n\n3. JOINT SCHOOLS\n\n(a) Policy\n\nAs you are aware, the Parliamentary Committee made the following recommendation with regard to joint schools:\n\n\"Your committee recommends the revision of those sections of the Act which pertain to education, in order to prepare Indian children to take their place as citizens.\n\n\"Your Committee, therefore, recommends that wherever and whenever possible Indian children should be educated in association with other children.\"\n\nWith this in mind, we should not build Indian day or residential schools on or near reserves on which the Indian children can be educated in white schools. In order to have our children admitted to these schools, we must be prepared to pay a proportionate share of the capital cost of additional schools or classrooms which might be required because Indian children are admitted.\n\nWe will never get local school authorities to educate Indian children unless we are prepared therefore to do the following:\n\n(i) to pay adequate tuition fees based on the annual cost of education per pupil in the school concerned;\n\n(ii) where necessary to contribute to the capital cost of additional buildings or classrooms required for Indian children.\n\nWe have made a good start in having Indian children admitted to white schools and last year there were 925 children enrolled in joint and in provincial schools.\n3. JOINT SCHOOLS (cont'd.)\n\n(b) Construction required\n\nWe are not in a position to calculate the amounts which will be required as contributions to the erection of joint schools or as assistance in the addition of extra classrooms in provincial schools. In item No. 6 I am recommending the establishment of positions to be entitled \"Regional Administrator of Indian Schools\". When these officials are appointed we will no doubt have many requests from local school boards as they are contacted and made acquainted with our new policy with regard to joint education. I would estimate that approximately $500,000.00 will be required in such joint projects over the next five years.\n\n4. SECONDARY EDUCATION\n\n(a) Policy\n\nThis is becoming an increasing item in our educational estimates. With the improvements in our school system, there are naturally more pupils who are reaching the upper grades.\n\nOur policy is of course that these children be educated in provincial high schools. This often makes it necessary to have the Indian children concerned board in the communities in which the schools are located. Due to present high living conditions, this is a very expensive item and we are becoming increasingly careful in the selection of students.\n\nI feel that certain of our residential schools could well be earmarked for saving for some of these Indian children during the time they are attending local high schools. While not too many of these residential schools are located near towns, we do have those which could be used for this purpose. This would help provide their being used for younger children but would mean dormitory alterations to accommodate high school pupils and to give them adequate study space, etc. Insofar as university education is concerned, it is recommended that we be most scrupulous in checking the reports submitted upon all students who are suggested\nfor such courses. The education of one of these pupils for one year can otherwise amount to fifty per cent of the cost of operating a small one-room day school with possibly twenty children in attendance.\n\nI would also recommend that care be taken in assessing the progress made by these pupils and that aptitude tests be given, particularly to those intending to go through for Law, Medicine and other costly professions.\n\n(b) Construction Required\n\nWe might possibly be requested occasionally to contribute a small amount towards the addition of extra classrooms at local white high schools. I do not feel that this should cost more than $50,000.00 over the next five years.\n\n5. ADULT AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND EXTENSION WORK\n\n(a) Policy\n\nI feel that a great deal can be done towards the promotion of good attendance at our Indian day schools by the establishment of Home and School or Parent-Teacher Clubs. One of the weaknesses of our day school system up to the present time has been the lack of parental attendance of the pupils. We are attempting to overcome this by better schools, better teachers, and better equipment. However, these efforts on our part will do little if we fail to achieve the co-operation of the Indian parents. We must make our schools \"community-conscious\" and have the teachers reach out to the parents, not only through the medium of home and school clubs but also by means of concerts, sports events and social evenings.\n\nWhen a Supervisor of Physical Education and Recreation has been appointed, I feel that he should be given the opportunity of preparing a five year programme in this regard, covering such features as the following:\n\n(i) The Indian Day School as a part of Indian reserve life;\n\n(ii) Adult education in health, general welfare and educational subjects through the use of films, lectures and classes;\n(iii) The promotion of sports and athletics on Indian reserves and in Indian schools;\n\n(iv) The institution of a program of health education and corrective physical education.\n\n(b) Construction required\n\nAt the present time we do not intend to inaugurate a very heavy program of construction of recreation halls and gymnasiums. When our construction of day schools begins to catch up with the demand, then some consideration can be given to such projects. In the meantime, we are confining these items to contributions towards recreation halls at residential schools which have inadequate facilities in this regard.\n\n6. ADMINISTRATION\n\n(a) Policy\n\nI feel that another feature of our five-year policy should be the continued decentralization of our educational system. It is impossible now, with the number of schools concerned, to make proper decisions on all matters here in Ottawa. I have recommended before, and I again recommend most strongly, the establishment of positions to be entitled \"Regional Administrator of Schools\" or \"Regional Inspectors of Indian Schools\". This position would combine the duties of School Inspector with supervision of buildings and equipment, the selection of teachers and the general administration of the schools in his region.\n\nMany other changes have been made within the last three years and on a recent inspection trip, many teachers commented on the improvements which had been made. One point in particular is with regard to the provision of school text-books. I feel that the improvements which have recently resulted are well worth all the time and effort which it took on our part to negotiate with the King's Printer and others concerned. The school supply situation is much better than it has ever been and we will endeavour to keep it thus.\nWe are also endeavouring to speed up the answering of correspondence but find this very difficult in many cases, due to lack of professional advice from the field. I feel that many questions are referred here now which could be entirely settled in the field without any need for correspondence with the Department. For example, in British Columbia, many professional matters are settled by Inspector Davey and the number of problems raised in letters from the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia is relatively much fewer than from the Regional Supervisors in other provinces.\n\n(b) Construction required\n\nOther than the provision of offices for the regional administrators or regional school inspectors, I do not think that any funds will be required under this heading.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThe basis of our preparation of this five-year plan is the immediate need for some 450 classrooms to provide educational facilities for Indian children who have none whatsoever. A minimum of 70 additional classrooms will be required by the end of 1955 to provide replacements for completely dilapidated buildings and to allow for natural increase in school population, based on census figures. Twenty-five (25) joint schools will be a minimum requirement.\n\nIt is felt that this need can best be provided by the erection of the following classrooms with estimated costs as shown:\n\n(a) Day Schools ... 460 ... $8,440,000.\n(b) Residential Schools 60 ... 1,280,000.\n\nThis means the erection of about 350 one-room schools, 30 two-room schools and 40 classrooms in three, four and six room day schools. It provides for the minimum of six residential schools at the most needed sites as recommended by educational survey committees.\nThe total contribution towards joint elementary and secondary schools will amount to approximately $550,000.00.\n\nIt is impossible to calculate how many of our day schools can be considered as joint schools until field officials are appointed who can work with educational committees, provincial inspectors and local school boards in determining where and to what extent such joint educational plans are possible. Many of our one-room schools may thus become joint schools and more of our children handled by provincial educational authorities.\n\nThe grand total estimated required for the erection or as contributions towards the erection of these schools will amount to $10,270,000.00.\n\nI have prepared a chart attached hereto, to indicate the breakdown of these schools by type and by provinces.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

While we will not be able to provide dishwashers for any but our larger schools, the following will help both you and the other Supervisors in considering such requests.\n\nYou will recall that the machine in question was the Jackson Dishwasher Model 1-A. We sent the folder describing this machine to the Nutrition Division and their report reads as follows:\n\n\"This particular type is usually installed in very small operations such as hospital ward kitchens or small soda fountains. The wash tank capacity is extremely small, actually holding not more than a good size dishpan. Following are the pros and cons for the machine as we see it.\"\n\nPoints For Points Against\n\n1. Small space required for installation but sufficient drain tables necessary.\n2. Metal racks lighter than wooden ones. Metal racks may increase breakage though.\n\n1. Doors, for children, harder to open than curtains. The reach may be too great for the children.\n2. Round rack harder to fill than square ones...\nPoints For\n\n1. Price of this machine much less than most machines.\n2. Water supply limited in the Muscowequan School.\n\nPoints Against\n\n1. Metal racks may increase breakage.\n2. 3 gallons of wash water very small quantity\u2014consideration should be given to the quantity of detergent which would be used (rapid change of water in tank).\n3. Machine may have to be emptied and cleaned of garbage residue during washing because of the small quantity of water to prevent overflow of garbage residue which may collect.\n4. Better for smaller operation, e.g., hospital ward kitchen.\n5. More and better supervision required when rinse not automatic.\n6. 1 h.p. pump is not as efficient as a more powerful one.\n\nWhereas the rate capacity of this machine is stated at 1000 dishes per hour, it is doubtful if the children would be able to fill the rack quickly enough to operate the machine efficiently. It is doubtful whether the machine would operate for an hour without draining the tank and cleaning it.\n\nWe would recommend a machine with:\n\n(1) \u00bd h.p. motor\n(2) An automatic rinse (it is too easy to put dishes through the machine without rinsing it if a hand wash is used).\n(3) A machine with curtains rather than doors as it is difficult for children to manipulate doors.\nA machine with the above mentioned specifications will cost considerably more but no doubt will give more efficient and longer service.\"\n\nThe recommendations of the Nutrition Division are very clear and it is felt that their specifications should be followed when consideration is being given to the provision of dishwashers. As previously mentioned, it is felt that these can only be provided for our larger schools with a pupilage of at least 300 children.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDear Bernard:\n\nI am enclosing standard plans which I have received from the Provincial Department of Education. You will notice from the accompanying literature that this type of construction is more expensive than that which we have been using in our schools to date. However, although the initial cost is high I believe that in the long run it would be cheaper as the plans are more flexible and permit additions to be readily added. I also believe that teachers could easily be attached.\n\nYou will note that provision is made for open play space along the lines I described to you when I was in Ottawa. One change I would make is the placing of a partition at one end to separate the cloakroom from the classroom. You will note that the classrooms, including cloakrooms, are approximately 40' in length and a partition running all or part way across the width of the room to provide enclosed cloakroom space would still leave ample room for classroom purposes.\n\nAdequate forecasting of the pupilage on our reserves for periods up to five years is so difficult that I believe our schools should be as flexible as possible. In any case I feel you will find these plans interesting.\n\nMy understanding with the Provincial Department was that these plans are not to be used without permission from that Department as their agreement with the architect calls\nfor payment of $75.00 for the working plans. I understand they also made a lump sum contribution to the architect for the preparation of these. If you have any school where you would like to use them you may secure the working plans from Mr. R.C. Grant, Executive Assistant to the Deputy Minister, Victoria, presumably on payment of the required $75.00.\n\nI shall be writing today concerning the Saanich Schools and I think it would pay us to use these plans at that point, but I shall outline my suggestions and those of Mr. Frederickson in greater detail in that letter.\n\nI have also secured from Mr. Frederickson a copy of the periodical \"Architectural Forum\", issued for October 1949, which is devoted entirely to school plans. I found it most interesting but the majority of articles and sketch plans included are more elaborate set-ups than we normally have on our reserves.\n\nWe are still experiencing the Arctic weather and are quite green with envy when we read about the rain and high temperatures in the East. With very best regards.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools in B.C.\n\nEnc.\nFebruary 8, 1950.\n\nMajor R.F. Devey,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Bob:\n\nThanks for the standard plans which you forwarded with your letter of February 1. I have just returned from James Bay and I know now what it must have been like in B.C.!\n\nOur architects are busy on the new one-room school plan and I am sending over to them immediately the B.C. designs.\n\nIf you particularly want one of the B.C. designs used in a special school, we could certainly buy a set of plans.\n\nThis may have to be done in the three-room school which you recommend for the Saanich Peninsula.\n\nWe will not have a three-room school plan and I believe that No. 9 would be quite satisfactory. I note that its cost would be $44,000.00.\n\nI am anxious to learn how your engineers will fit into the school building plans for next year. Will they be able to take over the three schools in Mr. Anfield's Agency? If you feel this two-room school, as prefabricated to be satisfactory, we might proceed immediately with a...\nsimilar project for Ahousaht. The Director is anxious to have this school completed and with the high cost of transportation, etc., I feel a pre-fabricated school is indicated. If there are any others from your list of projects which you would recommend for purchase from Prefabricated Housing Companies then I think we could get the necessary machinery for their purchase in action.\n\nGive my kind regards to Mr. Arneil and tell him we are really anxious to complete his school building programme for next year.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/MMcN\nFebruary 8, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSentic Toilets\n\nPlease find attached the pamphlet describing the new sentic toilet combination now on the market. Based on a principle similar to this, sentic toilets have been in use in Ontario for some 25 years with great success. Now the unit has been modified and redesigned with considerable improvement in its efficiency. I have had our engineers check this type of installation with the manager of the firm manufacturing them and they seem quite satisfied.\n\nI would like an opportunity of discussing this matter with you and of providing other information concerning these units.\n\nBernard F.

Neary:\n\nRe: Major Repairs-Residential Schools\nYour file 1-1-5 (Alta)\n\nReplying to your letter of January 28th, apparently you did not receive my letter of November 28th. I am attaching an extra copy for your information.\n\nThe sewage disposal, the problem of the Old Sun School, Blackfoot Reserve, has already been investigated by an Engineer. However, there is still a water supply problem at the St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve, and the Morley Residential School should also be visited.\n\nIf the addition to the Blue Quills School at St. Paul is completed, Mr. Hargreaves should make a report on how this addition can be heated.\n\nIt is suggested that Mr. Hargreaves call at this office first so that an itinerary can be worked out that will allow him to cover the most important problems while he is in Alberta.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta,\nNovember 28, 1949.\n\nCol. H. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA\n\nReplying to your 1-1-5 of the 16th inst., in respect to the visit of Mr. Hargreaves of the Lands and Development Services Branch to the Western Provinces, there are a number of schools at which an inspection by him could certainly be made to advantage. Assuming that his time is limited, this should be confined to those which require a report and recommendation from a qualified engineer.\n\nThere is a water supply problem at the St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve, Cardston; there is a very serious sewage disposal problem at the Old Sun School, Blackfoot Reserve; at the Morley Residential School a report on an improved laundry and heating system is desired, while there will be a heating problem at the Blue Quills Residential School at St. Paul if the uncompleted addition is to be finished.\n\nIt is recommended that he report to the Regional Office when the most urgent problems may be discussed and his itinerary in this Province based on that and the time at his disposal.\n\nG.

You can naturally appreciate our reluctance to send new desks to these summer schools which are often in operation only three or four months and where there is no caretaker during the winter. However, if you have any used desks either single or double and which are now surplus to requirements, these would prove of great help in such summer schools.\n\nI would therefore ask you to complete and return the form at the foot of this letter to me so we can give you instructions concerning the shipping of these desks. Please report only the desks which are in good condition, with no bolts, screws, etc. missing.\n\nBernard F.

B. F.

Since these drawings are not Royalty bearing there will be no charge.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. A. Meehan,\nOffice Services Department.\n\n/NAM.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa, 13 February, 1950.\n\nTo: Indian Commissioner for British Columbia;\nRegional Supervisors, and\nIndian Superintendents:\n\nREPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE TO INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nGENERAL POLICY\n\nEach Indian Superintendent is regarded as the official School Trustee for the Indian Day Schools in his Agency. Therefore, it is his direct responsibility to ensure that the principals and teachers of these schools maintain the building and that premises are clean and neat at all times. Each principal or teacher of an Indian day school has more responsibility than the corresponding principal or teacher of a provincial school. They have no Board of School Trustees immediately available and must therefore exercise greater supervision and control over the Indian school concerned.\n\nRegional Supervisors are naturally expected to inspect the classrooms and teacherages in the course of their routine visits.\n\nMAINTENANCE\n\n(a) CARETAKING\n\nIn the small one-room school this is usually done either by (a) hiring a part-time janitor or by (b) paying the teacher for janitor services. A small amount per classroom is usually allowed in return for sweeping and fuelling. Many of the small chores SHOULD be done by the school children, on a monitor basis, as is done in nearly all well conducted public schools. The Department is paying all the school operating expenses and surely the older Indian children can do some of the cleaning work.\n\nMany teachers might use the last hour of the school week on Friday afternoon for a thorough schoolroom cleaning. The older pupils set to and each, with his or her own task, scrub the floor, the desks, wash the windows, dust and generally freshen up the schoolroom. This takes some organization ahead of time by the teacher, by dividing the class into working gangs, having the hot water and janitor supplies ready, etc. Under (b) compensation for those who perform truly janitorial duties should be made from the \"janitor allowance\".\n\nIf this is laid down as a definite part of the weekly programme, many of the caretaking worries can be eliminated. In some schools we have more correspondence on the files about caretaking than about teaching the pupils or any other topic.\n\nIndian Superintendents must therefore impress upon teachers the need for a little energy on their part in solving this cleaning problem. It will not do for them to merely sit back and blame the Indian janitor if things are not clean. They must co-operate by training the children to accept the responsibility for housekeeping activities which will lighten the burden on janitors.\nWhen school closes each day, the various monitors should proceed with the cleaning of the blackboards, the checking of the toilets, the filling of the water cooler, etc. This must be done in an organized way with a list of monitors for each duty posted weekly. Where the teacher is paid for janitor services, some teachers might wish to reward these children. The cleanliness of the floor can easily be ensured by having each child responsible for the space under or near his or her own desk. No children should NEVER be dismissed at recess, noon or the close of the day without a check being made of the floor near their desks. In fact, a row should not be dismissed until the floor near their desks are clean. If children know they are being held responsible for keeping the floor clear from paper, peelings, etc., they will see to it that they put such scraps in the waste paper basket.\n\nAn article on this will appear in the next issue of the School Bulletin. When it appears, Indian Superintendents should regularly check on their monthly visits into this matter of classroom, toilet and playground cleanliness. No excuses should be accepted for carelessness in this matter. We are paying our teachers good salaries and expect that they will help in this way. Furthermore, this will do a great deal towards impressing upon Indian children the need for cleanliness in their persons and in their surroundings.\n\n(b) PAINTING\n\nThis is a major item each year in our schools. We can effect a great saving by buying the paint needed through the Departmental Purchasing Agent. This may take longer but if there is an intelligent anticipation of your requirements, we can get the paint to you in time for the school holiday period. Each year the Education Division is literally swamped with requisitions for paint, brushes, etc. This reaches its climax in August when some Superintendents suddenly realize that the summer holidays are half over and that their school or schools have not yet been painted. Then they sit back and wonder why it takes so long for the paint to arrive. If they could only see us in Ottawa during those two months with our desks piled high with requisitions for paint, etc., from many other Superintendents, they would realize why delays occur. This is not fair to the Education Division and just when we are trying to locate new teachers, to get on with the building of new schools, and other immediate business, we get requisitions for paint and requests for accountable advances, etc., from Indian Superintendents who have forgotten to forward such requests during the spring months.\n\nAPRIL is the month during which all Superintendents should forward their requests for items needed to keep their day schools in good condition. All officials needing paint for their schools can requisition NOW for the supplies which they will require. An example as to the savings which can be made by buying our paint through the Purchasing Agent and then arranging for an Indian or a painter to apply it is the following:\n\nAn Indian Superintendent got local prices from a painter for a school, as follows:\n\n| Item       | Quantity | Price per Gallon | Total Cost |\n|------------|----------|------------------|------------|\n| Paint      | 93       | $5.75            | $534.75    |\n| Undercoat  | 20       | $5.25            | $105.00    |\n| Sealer     | 6        | $5.80            | $34.80     |\n| Enamel     | 16       | $10.00           | $160.00    |\n| Turps      | 7        | $2.00            | $14.00     |\n\nThe Departmental Purchasing Agent secured tenders for the same type of paint, as follows:\n\n| Item       | Company A | Company B |\n|------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Paint      | $2.95     | $274.35   |\n| Undercoat  | $4.12     | $82.40    |\n| Sealer     | $3.40     | $20.40    |\n| Enamel     | $5.20     | $83.20    |\n| Turps      | $1.37     | $9.59     |\n| Containers |           |           |\n\nTotal Cost:\n- Company A: $469.74\n- Company B: $578.59\nIt only requires simple arithmetic to note that the Department would have saved $378.81, or nearly 45% by buying the paint from Company A. This company is one of the largest manufacturers of paint in Canada and supplies a product which meets our government specifications. (We could have saved enough money to paint two small schools by buying through the Purchasing Agent).\n\nEach year, we have a large number of schools to paint. From the above illustration you can therefore appreciate the fact that the most economical way of doing the job is by purchasing the paint directly from the manufacturer through the Departmental Purchasing Agent. In this way we can use our money to best advantage and it will enable us to paint more schools each year.\n\n**COLOUR SCHEME:**\n\nWhile we have no particular interest in the colour scheme as requested by individual teachers for their teacherages, we must insist on pastel colours and light shades in the classrooms. We would recommend the following shades:\n\n(1) Classroom Ceiling  \nWhite or off white\n\n(2) Classroom Upper Walls  \nPale green such as pastel green Arcadian light green.\n\n(3) Lower Walls  \nDarker green, equivalent to Milan green or Thistle green.\n\n**NOTE:** Where classrooms have lower walls of plywood, this should be left in light Oak varnish.\n\n**REPAIRS**\n\nIn submitting requests for repairs such as replacement of verandahs, etc., there are two methods of procedure:\n\n(a) By purchasing the materials and having the work done by day labour;\n\n(b) By letting a contract.\n\nWhen submitting a requisition for the materials required in following plan (a), be sure to give specific details of the lumber required and also to advise the name of local suppliers who could be contacted by the Purchasing Agent.\n\nIn following plan (b), try to obtain more than one fixed tender and be sure to give the name and address and to attach a written bid from the firm or firms concerned. If you cannot obtain more than one tender, you must state this in your covering letter.\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nSubmit NOW:\n(a) All paint requirements for your day schools, classifying under exterior paint, interior paint, varnishes, etc.;\n(b) All requisitions for desks, blackboards, cement, lumber, etc.\n\nSubmit LATER:\n(a) All labour tenders for painting and repairs;\n(b) All tenders for major alterations, etc.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR.\n\nREPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE TO INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nPlease find attached circular letter sent to Indian Superintendents concerning the above subject. Mr. Isham and I have suffered each summer under an avalanche of requisitions, tenders, etc. We want to know early this year the specific requirements in the various schools and to have the materials delivered to the schools before the summer holidays begin.\n\nI know you will think of at least two Indian Superintendents in British Columbia at whom this circular letter is particularly directed.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\n18 February, 1950.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nEDUCATION VOTES - SURPLUS OF APPROPRIATION OVER EXPENDITURE\n\nVOTE 516\n\nIt is a very difficult task to decide how the amount of surplus in this Vote. We have the following variables which are almost impossible to decide and where expenditure can change greatly within the next six weeks:\n\n(a) Lower Post ........................................ $150,000.00\n\nThis is being handled by another department and once the Order-in-Council is passed, every effort will be made to have the contractor buy all materials possible. It may be possible to spend all or none, depending on administrative delays, weather delays, road conditions to the school site, etc.\n\n(b) Indian Day Schools in British Columbia\n\nWe now have five projects under way and had expected these would be finished by now. The most unusual weather has completely upset our plans and it is impossible to know how if weather conditions will permit the completion of these projects. The sums involved total ............... $112,000.00\n\nLakelsap, Kincolith and Hartley Bay - $30,000 each ...... $90,000.\nCape Mudge .................. $11,000.\nAlert Bay .................... $11,000.\nThe purchase of church-owned schools from the M.S.C.C. involves an expenditure of over $150,000.00. There are legal difficulties in the way of completing these sales and $90,000.00 alone is involved in the Moose Fort School, in which both the Church of England and the Hudson's Bay Company are involved in a tangled ownership of land problems.\n\nFrom the above three examples, it can be seen that the expenditure of $412,000.00 is still very much in doubt. Our surplus, therefore, can vary between a low of $400,000 and a high of $800,000 in this Vote alone.\n\nVOTE 517.\n\nWe anticipate no surplus in this Vote.\n\nBernard F.

Caribou\n2. Alberni\n3. Christie\n4. Kuper Island\n5. Cranbrook\n6. Lytton\n\nHaving in mind the proposed replacement of the Caribou school I do not think we need concern ourselves with the heating facilities in the present building but feel that an investigation and report by Mr. Hargeaves of the other five schools would be advantageous.\n\n-W.

You can naturally appreciate our reluctance to send new desks to these summer schools which are often in operation only three or four months and where there is no caretaker during the winter. However, if you have any used desks either single or double and which are now surplus to requirements, these would prove of great help in such summer schools.\n\nI would therefore ask you to complete and return the form at the foot of this letter to me so we can give you instructions concerning the shipping of these desks. Please report only the desks which are in good condition, with no bolts, screws, etc. missing.\n\nBernard F.

Finlayson, Esq.,\nCanadian Research Institute of\nLaunderers and Cleaners,\n35 Rideau Street,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder separate cover I am returning the pamphlet on\nstain-proof cleaning processes which I regret keeping so long.\n\nAs I previously remarked, I wish I were better equipped\ntechnically to advise the operators of our Indian school\nlaundries on such points as:\n\n(a) The use and care of machinery.\n(b) The most efficient formulas for cleansing\nwith reference to the water that has to\nbe used.\n(c) Job-analyses and training of workers.\n(d) Lay-outs for new installations and for improve-\nment of existing installations.\n\nAs you know, some years ago in collaboration with the\nsoap companies, I tried to work out a formula for a universal\ndetergent and since then (I wish I may because of that) we\nhave seen the appearance of Fab, Vel, Dreft, etc., which are\nrather too expensive for institutions which have to operate\non a tight budget. Our schools, accordingly, have to fall\nback on simpler materials, and some of the workers whom I\nhave seen on the job very obviously need instruction comprehen-\nsible by a person who has not studied the chemistry of washing.\nMoreover, there is a considerable turnover of helpers in these laundries and even of the charge-hands and supervisors.\n\nTo give you an idea of the variety of water problems which have to be faced I attach a list of our residential schools with addresses showing their wide distribution. I have not visited all these school but I have seen the majority of them. Some like Kamloops, Lebret and Prince Albert have an imposing array of machinery with high pressure steam, and cater to 400 persons; some installations are geared to institutions serving only 50 people.\n\nThe job-analysis problem interests me because the helpers are usually Indian girls and laundry work is an aspect of vocational training. There is an increasing number of Indian Health Services sanatoria and hospitals in which competent laundry workers are required, and occasionally an Indian girl has found employment in a commercial laundry.\n\nThank you again for the advice and suggestions received.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\nmillions of square feet of \"Floors Without Flaws\" preserved by Horn Florcrex\nHorn Florcrex penetrates and preserves wood floors\n\nHorn Florcrex is a scientific combination of gums, resins and treated oils designed to penetrate deeply into all kinds of wood flooring. By filling the partially empty wood cells, by supporting the cell walls and by sealing all cells and pores, the wood flooring is protected and preserved against moisture, dampness, rot and splintering. The original color and grain of the wood is enhanced. Waxing with Hornglaze Wax protects the surface.\n\n7 Reasons for Using Horn Florcrex\n\n1. Penetrates into wood cells and fills them, restoring oils and resins that provided their original toughness.\n\n2. Restores and enhances the natural grain and provides a non-slip finish that resists staining alkali marks or water spotting.\n\n3. Not a surface coating\u2014spot refinishing with Horn Florcrex leaves no patched looking areas\u2014fast and economical for entire floor areas or patches.\n\n4. Effective for all types of floors whether open grained or close grained woods\u2014deep penetration in either case.\n\n5. Can be used on old floors after sanding and scraping to create a new and permanent finish\u2014practically the virgin condition of a new floor.\n\n6. Excellent spreading capacity\u2014350 to 450 square feet per gallon on open grain wood and 450 to 600 square feet per gallon on close grained wood.\n\n7. Approved as a heavy duty finish by Maple Flooring Manufacturers Association.\n\nFor homes, offices, classrooms, gymnasiums, auditoriums, factories\ndirections for applying Horn Florcrex\n\n* For best results, wood floors shall be sanded, swept clean and thoroughly dry before applying Horn Florcrex.\n\n* If cleaning agents are used instead of sanding, the floor shall be thoroughly rinsed several times with clear water to remove all residue. Floors must be thoroughly dry before Horn Florcrex is applied.\n\n* Apply one generous coat of Horn Florcrex with brush, lamb's wool applicator or a short cloth mop, rubbing against the grain.\n\n* Approximately 15 minutes later remove all excess Florcrex from the surface with lint-free clean dry rags.\n\n* Final operation consists in going over the entire area with No. 1 Grade Steel Wool approximately 4 hours after the excess Florcrex has been removed.\n\n* Close grained woods such as maple usually receive a one coat application of Horn Florcrex.\n\n* Open grained woods such as oak generally receive two or more coats, in which case repeat the operation after each coat as outlined above.\n\nMaintenance\n\nWhen waxing is desired, apply several thin coats of Hornglaze Wax. To remove surface dust and soil, use sawdust (oil and sand free) dampened with Hornglaze Cleaner. Avoid use of treated \"Dust-down\" preparations.\n\nmicro-diagrams of wood flooring\n\nOrdinary wood floor treatments remain on the surface with only a slight penetration into the wood cells. Surface coatings wear off in traffic lanes. Surface abrasion removes such treatments quickly and exposes the untreated wood cells to dampness, moisture, rot and splintering.\n\nHorn Florcrex contains scientifically treated oils especially developed to penetrate deeply into all kinds of wood flooring. Thus cell walls are supported and cells and pores sealed. Florcrex... an in-the-wood treatment... wears only as the wood itself wears.\n\nA. C. Horn Company, Inc., Established 1897\nManufacturers of materials for building maintenance and construction\nFactories: Long Island City I, N.Y. \u2022 Houston \u2022 San Francisco\nChicago \u2022 Toronto\n\nPRINTED IN U.S.A\nSubsidiary of Chemical Corporation\nHORN DUOCREX\n\nthe perfect preservative for wood and concrete floors\nHORN DUOCREX\n\nFloors are the most used and most abused portion of a building. They are often thoughtlessly treated or entirely neglected, and yet careful consideration given them will be repaid many times over.\n\nProper treatment of a floor by applying Horn Duocrex assures the user not only of a decided improvement in the appearance of the floor, but the wear and replacement cost can be avoided almost entirely. Cleaning and other upkeep expense can be reduced to a minimum.\n\nHORN DUOCREX\n\nNever becomes brittle. Does not dry with a slippery effect. Does not wear away quickly under heavy traffic. Does not require an expert to apply. Does not whiten in spots when wet. Draws half the time of most varnishes and the majority of the oil dressings. Does not leave a greasy nor a dust and dirt-holding surface. Will not soil merchandise falling upon it. Does not soil rugs placed upon it.\n\nHORN DUOCREX\n\nWhen applied to a concrete floor, Horn Duocrex is thin enough in body to work into the pores of the surface, sealing them so as to make a solid film over the entire surface. This develops a concrete floor that is waterproof (waterproof on the topside but it will not prevent water from coming through) and it serves to minimize the dusting of the concrete.\n\nWhen Horn Duocrex is used on wood surfaces it accomplishes results similar to those secured with varnish. The fact that Horn Duocrex is thinner in body makes maximum penetration into the wood surface. The first application will disappear into the surface, and in the case of concrete would seal the second. This is not to its disadvantage because herein lies the secret of the success of the product. By penetrating the wood surface, Horn Duocrex fills the minute cells, reinforcing the entire surface and greatly increasing its resistance to wear.\n\nHORN DUOCREX\n\nHorn Duocrex is a perfect preservative, dust eliminator, wear reducer (coating), and waterproofing agent for floors.\n\nHorn Duocrex is neither an oil dressing nor a varnish, but is a chemical compound of gums and preservatives designed after extensive research with the sole idea of producing a perfect dressing for floors.\n\nHorn Duocrex may best be described as a thin bodied coating, having many of the characteristics of varnish and being applied in similar manner.\n\nAfter Horn Duocrex has dried hard, the resulting surface is one that can be kept clean and attractive by merely dusting off.\nSPECIFICATIONS FOR HORN DUOCREX\n\nCONCRETE FLOORS\n\nPREPARATION OF SURFACE\nCareful preparation of concrete floors prior to the application of Duocrex is essential. The surface must be perfectly dry and free from oil, grease, wax, polish, and foreign matter. Scrubbing with Hornglaze Cleaner will remove ordinary traffic dirt and wax coatings.\n\nTo remove oil and grease, scrub with Hornglaze Cleaner and D-X Cleanser. Several coats may be necessary depending upon condition.\n\nOn concrete floors where oil and grease have penetrated too deeply remove with gasoline, naphtha or special grease removers.\n\nAPPLICATION\nThe first coat of Duocrex should be thoroughly brushed into the surface. Use a medium stiff bristle brush applying Duocrex into the pores of the concrete to assure satisfactory depth of penetration. Twenty-four hours should elapse before application of the second coat. Allow the second coat to dry for at least twelve hours before using the floor.\n\nWOOD FLOORS\n\nPREPARATION OF SURFACE\nAll oil, wax, grease, dirt and dust must be removed and the surface must be perfectly dry. Scrubbing with Hornglaze Cleaner and Horn D-X Cleanser or Maintenex is recommended. Previously varnished and painted floors should be sanded to remove the old finish before applying Duocrex. If flooring is open grain wood such as oak, Horn Paste Wood Finish should be used. On close grained woods on which a penetrant sealer is preferred, apply Horn Florene. Follow with a two-coat application of Duocrex.\n\nAPPLICATION\nDuocrex is applied in two or three coats depending upon porosity. The first coat is applied by thoroughly brushing Duocrex into the pores. Twenty-four hours should elapse between coats. Treated surfaces may be put to traffic for at least twelve hours. Sixty degrees or above with good ventilation should be maintained in the building while floors are being treated.\n\nPARTIAL LIST OF THE USERS\nAlabama Power Co.

Beaton of your interest in Flororex and Duocrex, treatment for hardwood floors, (folders enclosed).\n\nFlororex It is an amber coloured liquid which functions from the surface down. It is an impregnating wood sealer that so solidly seals the surface cellular structure of the wood, that there is no film to wear off. It provides a non slip finish that resists water spotting and staining alkali marks. It is generously applied and within fifteen minutes of application, all excess is wiped from the floor with clean, lint free rags; after about four hours time the surface is given a light steel wooling and is then ready for any type of finish, varnish, wax, etc.\n\nWe recommend two applications of Duocrex. It is very light in colour tone and dries to a very tough and friction resisting film; with good ventilation it would be ready for foot traffic over night. Flororex provides security against resanding and Duocrex enhances grain beauty.\n\nInnumerable school boards across Canada have adopted the use of these products with excellent results, both in school rooms and gymnasiums. We would like to serve you too.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nA. C. HORN COMPANY LIMITED\n\nE.F.

Neary,\n\nI received a letter recently from Neale, Stothard & Chapman, Plumbers of Brandon, Manitoba. I had looked forward to seeing you personally, but shall write instead.\n\nIt appears that much of the work connected with your Department is now handled from Regina, and they are adopting the cost plus method of remuneration, and that the Regina office has largely gone into the wholesale business themselves, where the procedure used to be that would specify the work required and call for tenders, which we all know is the most businesslike way, and generally most economical way, of having this work done. I think it has been very well shown in recent years that the cost plus method, so far as cheapness is concerned, is a delusion and a snare.\n\nThe firm referred to complains that it is very difficult for them to supply labor to do some work that may come upon them unexpectedly or to do it as cheaply as if they had time to tender themselves and get their labor resources arranged accordingly. I can understand very well the awkwardness of the position in which they are liable to be placed. Furthermore, I think you will recall personally that this firm has always cooperated most willingly toward giving good service and in making suggestions wherever in their opinion an economy can be effected by suggesting some minor changes in the original plan. I am sure their record with your Department will justify a large measure of confidence in their ability and their reliability.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. E. Matthews, M.D.\nMEMORANDUM - Col. B.

With a view to avoiding situations of this nature during the coming year, and in order that full advantage may be taken of funds provided in the Welfare Appropriation, it is requested that all superintendents formulate their plans for the fiscal year 1950-51 and submit the same to the office of their Regional supervisors for approval as early as possible.\n\nIt is also noted that in many agencies little or no action was taken with respect to construction of Indian homes and repairs to existing dwellings until late in the year. This has necessitated construction during cold weather which is uneconomical and has resulted in delays in placing of orders for material due to congestion in the office of the Departmental Purchasing Agent, and inability of the Welfare Service staff to process requisitions for material and cash advances, tradesmen's accounts, etc., as expeditiously as is desirable. In order that these difficulties may be avoided during 1950-51 it is requested that all concerned give active consideration to the Welfare housing programme immediately.\n\nJust as soon as the programme for the year has been arranged, it is requested that requisitions be prepared listing all building material required, and that the same be submitted through the offices of the Regional Supervisors and the Indian Commissioner for B.C., for approval and further departmental action.\n\nRequests for Accountable Advances to pay labour should be submitted through the offices of the Regional supervisors and the Indian Commissioner for B.C., for approval, and if at all possible, these should be submitted in sufficient time to allow this office ten days from the date of the receipt of the request until the funds are required.\n\nAccountable Advances should not be requested too long before they are required, however, and should not be in excess of requirements. If found in excess of requirements the excess should be refunded immediately under cover of a letter of explanation. If for any reason, an advance has been received which because of a change in plans is not required, it should be refunded immediately; not held until the end of the fiscal year or until the Branch has written numerous letters regarding the matter. Funds provided for a specific purpose must not be diverted to any other purpose.\nIn accordance with approved Departmental procedure, funds are advanced to pay wages on a day-labour basis only. If work of any nature is contemplated on a contract basis, the following regulations must be observed:\n\n1. Except in emergencies all contracts involving expenditures in excess of $100 should be referred to this office for approval through the office of the Regional supervisor.\n\n2. In emergencies the Regional Supervisor may authorize contracts up to a maximum of $500 provided the circumstances are reported to this office immediately.\n\n3. In the event of contracts up to a maximum of $5,000, with the exceptions noted above, competitive tenders should be obtained and the same should be submitted to this office for approval. All draft contracts covering construction of buildings should be accompanied by plans and specifications in duplicate.\n\n4. In the event of contracts involving expenditures in excess of $5,000 the same should be referred to this office before any other action is taken, as regulations covered by the Public Works Act stipulate that public works involving expenditures in excess of $5,000 must be advertised by public tender and that all tenders submitted must be accompanied by a deposit of 10% of the amount of the tender.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, contracts with Indians involving expenditures in excess of $100, but not exceeding $500, may be authorized by the Regional supervisor as a matter of routine, but all contracts should be numbered consecutively commencing with \"No. 1\" in each fiscal year, and the circumstances regarding each contract should be reported to this office immediately. If progress payments are made, the voucher or credit voucher covering each progress payment should show the consecutive progress payment number, the consecutive contract number, the total amount of the contract and the voucher covering the final payment should clearly indicate that it is the final payment.\n\nSeparate credit vouchers should be submitted covering payment of wages on a day-labour basis and progress payments on contracts.\n\nDepartmental regulations stipulate that except in emergencies orders for material or equipment involving expenditures in excess of $100 must be placed by the Departmental Purchasing Agent. In emergencies, Regional supervisors may authorize purchases up to $500 but every invoice covering an emergency purchase in excess of $100 must be submitted to the Departmental Purchasing Agent for a covering purchase order before it may be submitted to Treasury for payment; a detailed explanation of the circumstances is necessary.\nAccounts covering material purchased, services rendered (contracts), and credit vouchers covering payment of wages on a day-labour basis should be submitted as promptly as possible. Credit vouchers should be submitted, preferably at the end of each pay period, and under no circumstance should their submission be delayed past the end of the month in which expenditures were incurred, except when unavoidable, accounts for material purchased and accounts covering contracts should be submitted to Head Office for payment.\n\nWhen the Annual Welfare Estimates are being screened by the Treasury Board of the Privy Council in December each year preparatory to submission to Parliament it is difficult to argue successfully that certain items are necessary for the coming year if there are large unexpended balances in Allotments 10 and 15 at that date. It is imperative, therefore, that the building programme be commenced just as soon as weather conditions permit and that the main portion of it be completed by December 31st.\n\nH. H.

If the goods have not been received, or if the account has not been received, you should immediately communicate with the firm with whom the order was placed.\n\nAs you are aware, when the original Purchase Order is issued, the amount of the Purchase Order is immediately charged against our appropriation, and unless the account is received immediately, it will not be possible to pay it from our appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50, which ends on March 31st.\n\nTherefore, we trust that you will give us every possible cooperation in having the accounts reach us at the earliest possible date.

In each case, the account covering the cost of supplies was forwarded to your Indian Superintendent.\n\nWe have not yet received the account for payment, and this may be due to the fact that you have not notified your Superintendent that the goods mentioned on the Purchase Order have been received at the school.\n\nIf you have neglected to do so, you should notify your Superintendent immediately. If you have already notified him, we would appreciate your co-operation in notifying him again and advising him that you have heard from us and that we wish the account forwarded immediately so that payment can be made from the current year's appropriation.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nOttawa, March 22, 1950.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO FILE:\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES\n\nFunds will be required in the 1950-51 Supplementary Estimates for the following projects:\n\n(a) Wabasca C.E.

Hamlyn,\nAudit Supervisor,\n\"H\" Branch,\nOffice of the Auditor General,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Repairs to Schools\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 14th in which you have raised the fact that certain schools appear to have had repairs done by firms in excess of $5,000.00.\n\nI would like to clarify for you the situation which existed at these various projects.\n\nSt. Paul's Residential School\n\nWe are not exactly certain what vouchers you used to reach the total mentioned in your letter of $10,061.08. However, we are inclined to feel that this amount included Vouchers 420 and 596, which total $4,900.00. This expenditure of $4,900.00 covered a new roof on the main building of the St. Paul's School.\n\nIn the fall of 1948, we secured an airforce building from a nearby air station, and moved it to the site of the St. Paul's School to be used as a classroom block. An endeavour was made to secure competitive bids on converting this building to our purposes, but we were unsuccessful, and as the accommodation was urgently required arrangements were made with Mr. Weston whom we had employed on previous occasions and whose work was always satisfactory.\n\nI may add that Mr. Weston was the only contractor available in the district at that time who would go to the Reserve to work.\nPayment of $2,739.00 covered the cost of providing a full basement. It was subsequently found necessary to provide extra windows and erect extra pillars in the building in order to strengthen it.\n\nAt first we did not intend to provide a tunnel from the main building to the classroom block, but subsequent investigation by our field officials resulted in a decision to provide this tunnel. This involved an expenditure of $701.81.\n\nOther expenditures in connection with the classroom block followed as a result of endeavouring to convert a building intended for one purpose to an absolutely different purpose, and the actual work was done at different times in spite of the fact that when forwarding certain vouchers, the Indian Superintendent gave the same date on each voucher, although the expenditures had been authorized at different periods.\n\nSacred Heart Residential School\n\nThis school is situated near Brocket, Alberta, and our files do not show that Mr. Weston ever did any work on this building during the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nR.C.M.P. Building\n\nWe have no knowledge of this project, and the matter should be referred to Miss Walton.\n\nU.C. Day School, Caughnawaga\n\nWhen the new Roman Catholic school was completed during the past summer, it was decided to renovate two buildings which had been used for school purposes (these were known locally as Caughnawaga U.C. School and Caughnawaga Eastern School). There was an increased enrollment at the Caughnawaga U.C. School, and it was found that by renovating the Caughnawaga Eastern School, suitable additional classroom space could be provided.\nThis necessitated the employment of three teachers and it was decided to convert the former Caughnawaga U.C. School into a residence for the teachers. Both of these were old buildings, and in converting them we experienced the usual difficulties, namely, that when one change is made others are necessitated and could not be foreseen.\n\nWe tried to get a contractor to give us a firm bid on the work, but were unsuccessful. We then obtained the services of Mr. Jean Bedard to act as a general contractor in securing the labour and carrying out the work required. We feel that good value has been obtained for the expenditure incurred, and we now have two buildings which will meet the requirements of the teachers and pupils at the Caughnawaga U.C. School for some years to come, at a much lower cost than if we had endeavoured to erect a new building.\n\nCarcross Residential School\n\nThe financial situation which arose at this school was due to an inexperienced Indian Superintendent who arranged for a contract without first obtaining proper authority, although lack of communication facilities to Carcross was partially to blame for his error.\n\nFor your information, I quote the following extract received from the Superintendent:\n\n\"May I first remind you that the Yukon Agency has been more or less dormant for a number of years during which no building has taken place; there was, therefore, no precedent for the sort of project I was asked to undertake. I consulted Part X (Construction and Engineering) of Indian Agent's Reference and Regulations, but apparently did not interpret Para 152 (Financial) right. The Director's letter of June 2nd, 1943, file 166-1-5 (E) stated that funds had been provided for the purchase of a prefabricated house, and I assumed, whether rightly or wrongly, that construction costs had been provided for in the Estimates by Headquarters.\"\n\"Robert Campbell of Whitehorse is the Yukon Agent for Prefabricated Structures, the firm supplying the house, and it is only natural that I referred to him for the erection of the Principal's residence. As this was a departure from the usual construction in the Yukon, being the first one erected, Mr. Campbell would not give me a firm estimate. He stated that he would superintend the construction of the building for cost of wages and materials purchased by him, plus 10 per cent. I regret to say, owing to my very frequent absences in the field during the summer months, I did not report this to you, but was under the impression I had done so. This error is the crux of the unfortunate subsequent happenings. There is no written contract with Robert Campbell.\"\n\nOur Minister is aware of the contents of the above letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

School\n\nWhen the new Roman Catholic school was completed, we were able to make the following adjustments in our school facilities on this reserve:\n\n(a) Conversion of the Kateri School for manual training and as a teacher's residence.\n\n(b) Conversion of the Eastern School for United Church children, thereby providing an increased enrolment without the erection of a new building.\n\n(c) Conversion of the former U.C. school into a teacherage for the Principal and the teachers at the U.C. School.\n\nDetails re other contract\n\n(5) Carcross Residential School\n\nThis matter was due to an inexperienced Indian Agent who arranged for a contract without proper authority being received.

Labour and materials re crating, as well as transportation charges from St. Clair School to the station and freight charges to Sioux Lookout, would be considerable. It is possible that the total costs would amount to almost as much as the desks are worth. As there are only four of them it is considered that they might be used in the St. Clair School later on, although at the moment they are surplus.\n\nAfter discussing this with Regional Supervisor Mr. Morris it was decided to ask your approval to retain the desks at the St. Clair School.

I feel that there is little advantage in eliminating the full basement in regard to cost. There is definitely disadvantage as far as space is concerned.\n\n3. I am not favourably inclined to the hot water heating system.\n\n4. By getting away from the approximately square building there is definitely a loss of material.\n\n5. I fear the system of toilets will not prove satisfactory. There being a good well at the school an adequate system of flush toilets can be provided.\n\n6.

Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDevelopment Services Branch,\nDepartment of Resources and Development,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nTwo Classroom Indian Day School\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 17. We have examined carefully the drawing of the two-room day school and wish to make the following points, which have already been mentioned in letters sent to you in December of 1949:\n\n1. Cupboards must be shown in the classroom as in plan 888. These should reach to the ceiling; should be made of plywood and should contain shelves for the storage of books, scribblers, etc. One cupboard should also be in the back of the room for the storage of sports equipment, chalk and heavier supplies.\n\n2. A shelf for library books should extend under the windows in each room with similar shelves under it forming an open cupboard. This would be for paste, scissors, drawing books and other activity materials.\n\n3. As previously pointed out, it is difficult to have forced hot water because our teachers are often absent from the schools over the week-ends. In the winter this presents a freeze-up difficulty. Unfortunately, we therefore can see no alternative to the gravity feed hot air system for the schools where hydro is not available and forced hot\nair for schools where hydro is available. This type of hot air system has proven satisfactory in the one and two-room schools which we presently have.\n\n4. It is felt that an additional room would be preferable to the large porch area shown for the teachers.\n\n5. In the hall a shelf should be provided for the storage of children's lunches, etc.\n\n6. A wash table should also be shown in both the boys' and girls' lavatories.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nYour attention is directed to the following direction from the Deputy Minister dated March 27th:\n\n\"Whenever advertisements are placed in newspapers by any Branch of this Department requesting tenders for construction or equipment, copies of the advertisement should be forwarded to this office. If the advertisement is placed in French newspapers, French copies should be forwarded also.\"\n\nWill you please ensure that this instruction is complied with.\n\n[Signature]\nfor Director.\nTo: Indian Commissioner for British Columbia; Regional Supervisors, and Indian Superintendents:\n\nREPAIRS and MAINTENANCE TO INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nGENERAL POLICY\n\nEach Indian Superintendent is regarded as the official School Trustee for the Indian Day Schools in his Agency. Therefore, it is his direct responsibility to ensure that the principals and teachers of these schools maintain the building and that premises are clean and neat at all times. Each principal or teacher of an Indian day school has more responsibility than the corresponding principal or teacher of a provincial school. They have no Board of School Trustees immediately available and must therefore exercise greater supervision and control over the Indian school concerned.\n\nRegional Supervisors are naturally expected to inspect the classrooms and teacherages in the course of their routine visits.\n\nMAINTENANCE\n\n(a) CARETAKING\n\nIn the small one-room school this is usually done either by (a) hiring a part-time janitor or by (b) paying the teacher for janitor services. A small amount per classroom is usually allowed in return for sweeping and fuelling. Many of the small chores SHOULD be done by the school children, on a monitor basis, as is done in nearly all well conducted public schools. The Department is paying all the school operating expenses and surely the older Indian children can do some of the cleaning work.\n\nMany teachers might use the last hour of the school week on Friday afternoon for a thorough schoolroom cleaning. The older pupils set to and each, with his or her own task, scrub the floor, the desks, wash the windows, dust and generally freshen up the schoolroom. This takes some organization ahead of time by the teacher, by dividing the class into working gangs, having the hot water and janitor supplies ready, etc. Under (b) compensation for those who perform truly janitorial duties should be made from the \"janitor allowance\".\n\nIf this is laid down as a definite part of the weekly programme, many of the caretaking worries can be eliminated. In some schools we have more correspondence on the files about caretaking than about teaching the pupils or any other topic.\n\nIndian Superintendents must therefore impress upon teachers the need for a little energy on their part in solving this cleaning problem. It will not do for them to merely sit back and blame the Indian janitor if things are not clean. They must co-operate by training the children to accept the responsibility for housekeeping activities which will lighten the burden on janitors.\nWhen school closes each day, the various monitors should proceed with the cleaning of the blackboards, the checking of the toilets, the filling of the water cooler, etc. This must be done in an organized way with a list of monitors for each duty posted weekly. Where the teacher is aided by monitor devices, some teachers might wish to reward these children. The cleanliness of the room can easily be ensured by having each child responsible for the space under or near his or her own desk. The children should NEVER be dismissed at recess, noon or the close of the day without a check being made of the floor near their desks. In fact, a row should not be dismissed until the floors near their desks are clean. If children know they are being held responsible for keeping the floor clear from paper, peelings, etc., they will see to it that they put such scraps in the waste paper basket.\n\nAn article on this will appear in the next issue of the School Bulletin. When it appears, Indian Superintendents should regularly check on their monthly visits into this matter of classroom, toilet and playground cleanliness. No excuses should be accepted for carelessness in this matter. We are paying our teachers good salaries and expect that they will help in this way. Furthermore, this will do a great deal towards impressing upon Indian children the need for cleanliness in their persons and in their surroundings.\n\n(b) PAINTING\n\nThis is a major item each year in our schools. We can effect a great saving by buying the paint needed through the Departmental Purchasing Agent. This may take longer but if there is an intelligent anticipation of your requirements, we can get the paint to you in time for the school holiday period. Each year the Education Division is literally swamped with requisitions for paint, brushes, etc. This reaches its climax in August when some Superintendents suddenly realize that the summer holidays are half over and that their school or schools have not yet been painted. Then they sit back and wonder why it takes so long for the paint to arrive. If they could only see us in Ottawa during those two months with our desks piled high with requisitions for paint, etc., from many other Superintendents, they would realize why such delays occur. This is not fair to the Education Division and just when we are trying to locate new teachers, to get on with the building of new schools, and other immediate business, we get requisitions for paint and requests for accountable advances, etc., from Indian Superintendents who have forgotten to forward such requests during the spring months.\n\nAPRIL is the month during which all Superintendents should forward their requests for items needed to keep their day schools in good condition. All officials needing paint for their schools can requisition NOW for the supplies which they will require. An example as to the savings which can be made by buying our paint through the Purchasing Agent and then arranging for an Indian or a painter to apply it is the following:\n\nAn Indian Superintendent got local prices from a painter for a school, as follows:\n\n| Item       | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| Gallons of paint | 93       | $5.75      | $534.75     |\n| Undercoat  | 20       | $5.25      | $105.00     |\n| Sealer     | 6        | $5.80      | $34.80      |\n| Enamel     | 16       | $10.00     | $160.00     |\n| Turps      | 7        | $2.00      | $14.00      |\n|            |          |            | $848.55     |\n\nThe Departmental Purchasing Agent secured tenders for the same type of paint, as follows:\n\n| Item       | Company A | Company B |\n|------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Gallons of paint | $2.95    | $274.35   |\n| Undercoat  | $4.12     | $4.14     |\n| Sealer     | $3.40     | $3.42     |\n| Enamel     | $5.20     | $5.04     |\n| Turps      | $1.37     | $1.10     |\n| Containers |           | $1.91     |\n|            | $469.74   | $378.59   |\nIt only requires simple arithmetic to note that the Department would have saved $378.61, or nearly 45% by buying the paint from Company A. This company is one of the largest manufacturers of paint in Canada and supplies a product which meets our government specifications. (We could have saved enough money to paint two small schools by buying through the Purchasing Agent).\n\nEach year, we have a large number of schools to paint. From the above illustration you can therefore appreciate the fact that the most economical way of doing the job is by purchasing the paint directly from the manufacturer through the Departmental Purchasing Agent. In this way we can use our money to best advantage and it will enable us to paint more schools each year.\n\nCOLOUR SCHEME:\n\nWhile we have no particular interest in the colour scheme as requested by individual teachers for their teacherages, we must insist on pastel colours and light shades in the classrooms. We would recommend the following shades:\n\n(1) Classroom Ceiling White or off white\n(2) Classroom Upper Walls Pale green such as pastel green Arcadian light green.\n(3) Lower Walls Darker green, equivalent to Milen green or Thistle green.\n\nNOTE:\nWhere classrooms have lower walls of plywood, this should be left in light Oak varnish.\n\nREPAIRS\n\nIn submitting requests for repairs such as replacement of verandahs, etc., there are two methods of procedure:\n\n(a) By purchasing the materials and having the work done by day labour;\n(b) By letting a contract.\n\nWhen submitting a requisition for the materials required in following plan (a), be sure to give specific details of the lumber required and also to advise the name of local suppliers who could be contacted by the Purchasing Agent.\n\nIn following plan (b), try to obtain more than one fixed tender and be sure to give the name and address and to attach a written bid from the firm or firms concerned. If you cannot obtain more than one tender, you must state this in your covering letter.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nSubmit NOW:\n(a) All paint requirements for your day schools, classifying under exterior paint, interior paint, varnishes, etc.;\n(b) All requisitions for desks, blackboards, cement, lumber, etc.\n\nSubmit LATER:\n(a) All labour tenders for painting and repairs;\n(b) All tenders for major alterations, etc.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMontreal, P. Q.\n\nApril 3, 1950.\n\nColonel Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\n220 Queen Street,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI would like to sincerely apologize to you for the seemingly lengthy delay in obtaining information for you relative to the service we can provide for Sheppard Diesel Driven Generating Sets purchased through your office for use primarily throughout remote areas of the Prairie Provinces.\n\nThis delay was caused, not through any neglect on our part but, in an effort to complete arrangements whereby we could provide you with the least expensive but most efficient service, and that you will now find that the R. H. Sheppard Company whom we represent in Eastern Canada are equally as well represented in Western Canada and that no further difficulties should be experienced in the servicing of our equipment.\n\nI hope to have the opportunity of discussing this further with you personally in the not too distant future.\n\nIn the meantime, should you have any enquiries for diesel driven generating sets, you may rest assured that we would be very pleased to receive them and that they will receive our most prompt attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRUSSEL-HIPWELL ENGINES LIMITED.\n\nJ.

Indian Residential School.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nPP/ST\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration.\nOttawa, April 27th, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: P.C. 56/222 of January 19th, 1950.\nPurchase and Maintenance of Equipment,\nRepairs and Improvements to Church-Owned Indian Residential Schools\n\nIt has been found necessary to amend the above Order-in-Council.\n\nThe amounts requested in Section 1 apply to schools owned by the Church of England. At the time the 1949-50 Estimates were prepared, it was expected that arrangements would be made for the purchase of the Fort George C.E. and Wabasca C.E. Indian Residential Schools. It was not possible to carry out this arrangement, but in order to assist the M.S.C.C., it was necessary to expend an amount of $689.36 at Fort George and $439.92 at Wabasca during the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nWe provided in the 1949-50 Estimates an amount of $3,500.00 for expenditures at Carcross C.E. Indian Residential School, but it was found necessary to only expend part of this amount.\n\nThe amounts requested in Section 2 for Joussard R.C. and Christie R.C. Indian Residential Schools, represent small amounts for the purchase of materials over and above the amounts specifically provided for these two schools. The Squamish R.C. Residential School was in very poor condition, and in order to keep it in operation, it was essential that the amount we expended was much larger than the amount specifically mentioned in the Order in Council.\nWe were unable to complete all the work at the Cariboo R.C. Residential School that we contemplated when preparing the 1949-50 Estimates.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION\n\nProposed Design No. 929\n\nCommendable features are:\n\n(1) Nine feet of cupboard (horizontal measurement). These cupboards should be not less than six feet in height. Eight feet is not too high.\n\n(2) Blackboard at the front and side is adequate. The rear wall should be display board.\n\n(3) The shelves below the window are an advantage. They should be equipped with sliding doors.\n\nWould it be possible to include an exit on the same side of the building as the window-bank? The window nearest the blackboard might be the panic door and thus allow three feet of blackboard on the opposite wall where it would be most convenient. This would avoid a hole in what is presumed to become the west wall.\n\nThe lavatories are shown as having only one type of fixture. The design should allow for tables on which to stand wash basins with mirrors above. The lavatory next to the bedroom is reserved for the teachers. No wash stand or bath-tub is shown. Because of the roundabout way to the kitchen a hot bath is likely to involve a good deal of inconvenience. Perhaps the linen closet between the halls could be abandoned and a door inserted there. Otherwise the living-room must be traversed at all times.\nIn the bedrooms windows are shown in one wall only. Most people would, in a corner bedroom, prefer windows on both walls.\n\nIt is noted that the classroom windows face the east. I suppose we could turn the building a little toward the south-east in northern latitudes.\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\nOttawa, 19 April, 1950.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAttached are three (3) copies of a proposed standard one classroom Indian Day School (Index 929 Sheet P.1) as requested by your Branch.\n\nThough this design was completed more than a month ago, it was lost by the blueprinters and has been redrawn.\n\nYour suggestions of the 30th of March have been incorporated; we would be glad to have one copy returned marked approved or with your comments so that working drawings can be put in hand.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Gibson,\nDirector.\n\nEncl.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, April 27, 1950.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nOne-room Day School and Attached Teacher's Residence\n\nPlease find attached the new design for the standard one-room classroom Indian day school and attached teacher's residence (your Index 929).\n\nIt is presumed that the heating and plumbing sheets will indicate that in certain areas running water will be installed in these schools. As previously advised you, it is our intention to install such facilities when Hydro is immediately available. When such is the case, a wash basin should be shown in the girls and boys lavatories with a small shower in the teacher's lavatory.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDevelopment Services Branch,\nDept. of Resources & Development,\nNorlite Building,\nOttawa.\n\nEnclosure\nMay 5, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMISS WALTON\n\nNew Buildings\nEngineering and Construction Service\n\nThe projects which we would like to have handled by the new Engineering and Construction Division are as follows:\n\n| School                  | Agency          | Amount   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|----------|\n| Tobique                 | Addition Tobique| $28,000. |\n| Restigouche             | Restigouche     | ?        |\n| Moose Fort (4 rooms)    | James Bay       | $70,000. |\n| Six Nations #2          | Six Nations     | $46,000. |\n| Cowessess (Classroom Crooked Lake Block) | | $50,000. |\n| Hobbema                 | Hobbema         | ?        |\n| Alert Bay               | Kwawkewth       | $60,000. |\n| Alberni                 | West Coast      | $60,000. |\n| Cariboo                 | Williams Lake   | $60,000. |\n\nThe two items where question marks have been placed indicate our intention to request an amount in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\nI do not know whether Mr. Buck intends to leave the supervision of the Seven Islands Residential School with his former department or whether he will supervise it from here.\n\nYou will note that the above is a list only of new building projects. We have already advised Mr. Buck previously of the repairs required to existing Indian day and residential schools.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 5, 1950.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nFour-Room School Plan\n\nWe have had officials of our Education Division check this plan and they are quite pleased with the general design.\n\nIn our letter of December 6, 1949, we requested that a small glassed-in manual training and domestic science room be provided at the end of the two classrooms.\n\nThis is not shown on the plan and it is presumed that the cloak rooms at the end of the two rooms could be adapted for this purpose. We have previously requested also that some cupboard facilities be provided in the classrooms with small shelves also being erected under the windows. These have not been provided.\n\nWe have now received preliminary copies of all plans requested in our letter of December 6, 1949 with the following exceptions:\n\n(a) One-room school without teacherage\n(b) Two-room school without teacherage\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.A.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nSTANDARD FOUR CLASSROOM DAY SCHOOL, INDEX NO. 931.\n\nAttached are three copies of preliminary drawings of the proposed new design, Index No. 931, for the above.\n\nOn a recent visit to our Architectural Division, your Superintendent of Education gave oral approval to this design and accordingly working drawings have been started. Unless advised to the contrary we will continue this work.\n\nFor all standard plans the provision of mechanical services is entirely dependent on the location of the building and while a series of designs for these services will be prepared, each case should be referred to the engineers concerned, before a final selection is made.\n\nIn this connection, our suggestion with regard to heating plant would be, preferably forced hot water in areas where power and water supply is available, forced warm air being utilized as an alternative.\n\nMajor P.M. MacKay,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWhere electric current cannot be supplied, we recommend a gravity hot water heating plant.\n\nYou will note we have made no reference to your suggestion regarding gravity warm air installations. For the building as planned, having only a partial basement, it would not be satisfactory or practicable to attempt heating by that method.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Gibson,\nDirector.\n\nEncs.\nDear Major MacKay:\n\n1950-51 FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS,\nINDIAN EDUCATION PROJECTS\n\nColonel Neary of Indian Education was promised a detailed report on 1950-51 financial requirements, in a telephone conversation of March 16th with Mr. Nielsen of the Engineering and Construction Service, covering projects begun during the 1949-50 fiscal season. The following information should enable you to estimate the amounts you will have to request in the supplementary estimates if the necessary funds were not included in the main estimates:\n\n1 - Brandon Residential School, Repairs.\nAll of the work recommended in a report dated July 21st, which was forwarded to you, has been completed except the installation of taps, and payment will be made in full from 1949-50 funds. Mr. W.W. Perrie recommends that the following work be undertaken during the 1950-51 season:\n\nSidewalk repairs\nInstallation of taps\nInstallation of fans\nRoofing and minor repairs\n\nThe estimated cost is $3,000.00, and if the work is to be done the necessary funds should be transferred to the Engineering and Construction Service at an early date.\n\n..... 2\n2 - Edmonton Indian Residential School\nRepairs and revisions to heating and plumbing system, etc., Contract, H. Kelly & Company Ltd., $31,600.00.\n\nProgress Estimates in the amount of $2,700.00 only will be paid out of 1949-50 funds. Nineteen fifty-fifty one requirements are therefore as follows:\n\nBalance of Contract . . . . . . . . . . $28,900.00\nContingency for Extra Work . . . . . . . . 2,500.00\nEngineering (Inspection) expenses . . . . . . . . 500.00\n\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $31,900.00\n\nThe work is in progress, and a considerable portion of the above amount should be transferred to the Engineering and Construction Service as soon as possible. The Contingency for extra work is necessary due to the nature of the work, as unforeseen additional repairs are usually brought to light during the process of tearing down the old system.\n\n3 - Muscowequan Indian Residential School,\nHeating and roof repairs.\nThe work cannot be completed in time to pay the final claim out of 1949-50 funds. The amount of $600.00 will be needed in 1950-51, and this amount should be transferred to the Engineering and Construction Service as soon as possible.\n\n4 - Whitefish Bay Indian Residential School,\nGeneral Repairs.\nA total of $33,203.08 has been paid to the Contractor out of 1949-50 funds, leaving an unpaid balance of $4,731.12. It will therefore be necessary to provide funds as follows in the 1950-51 season:\n\nBalance of Contract . . . . . . . . . . $ 4,731.12\nContingency for Extra Work . . . . . . . . 268.88\nEngineering (Inspection) Expenses . . . . . . . . 300.00\n\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 5,300.00\n\nThe above amount should be transferred to the Engineering and Construction Service as soon as possible.\n5 - Sioux Lockout Residential School, Heating and Plumbing Repairs.\n\nThe work was completed prior to March 31, 1950, but not according to the specifications. Mr. Gow recommends that the 10% Holdback should be retained to guarantee satisfactory work. It had been hoped that it would be possible to release the holdback and retain the security deposit only but the Supervising Engineer's recommendations make such a course inadvisable. Nineteen fifty-fifty one requirements are therefore as follows:\n\nHoldback on Contracts ........ $825.20\nEngineering (Inspection) Expenses . . . 174.80\n\nTotal .......... $1,000.00\n\nThe above amount should be transferred to the Engineering and Construction Service as soon as possible.\n\n6 - Birtle Indian Residential School, Water Supply System.\n\nThe tank and some pipe were delivered and paid for out of 1949-50 funds, the total expenditure being $1,576.81. Three thousand dollars will be needed in 1950-51 for installation of tank and pipe to barn.\n\n7 - Gordon's Indian Residential School, Water Supply System.\n\nThe original water supply system was completed and paid for last summer. However, $1,500.00 will be required in 1950-51 for investigating additional water sources and for contingencies.\n\n8 - Pine Creek Indian Residential School, Repairs\n\nThe original schedule of repairs was completed and paid for out of 1949-50 funds. Plans for a new roof were completed, and if this work is to be undertaken in 1950-51, a minimum of $32,000.00 will be required.\n\n9 - Seven Islands Indian Residential School New Building\n\nThe Architect, Mr. Noffke, was paid $6,093.75, which is 75% of 2/3 of his estimated cost of $325,000.00. Total 1949-50 expenditures will not be more than $6,500.00.\nAlthough the Architect estimates the cost of the School at $325,000.00, the lowest responsible tender will probably be about $350,000.00 at least. Nineteen fifty-five one requirements will therefore be as follows:\n\nConstruction of School . . . . . . . . $ 350,000.00\nContingencies for extra work and increased costs . . . . . . . . 30,000.00\nArchitects Amyot and Noffke,\n2\u00bd% fee each on $380,000.00 - $19,000.00\nless amount paid to date . . . 6,093.75 12,906.25\nEngineering (Inspection) expenses . . . . . . . 1,500.00\n\nTotal . . . . . . . . . $ 394,406.25\n\nThe above maximum figures may have to be adjusted downward if a tender under $350,000.00 is received and accepted. The $394,406.25 figure is based on the assumption that the School will be finished by March 31, 1951.\n\n10. - The following projects have been completed or will be completed in time to pay in full out of 1949-50 funds:\n\nAlert Bay, St. Michael's School\nThe waterproofing and roof repairs were completed and paid for. The plumbing and mechanical services repairs will be completed in time to pay the final Progress Estimate out of 1949-50 funds according to assurances received from Mr. Arneil.\n\nThe work originally scheduled did not include cleaning stack or conversion to oil firing. The estimated minimum cost for this extra work is $2,284.80 and $2,800.00 respectively, to which should be added 20%. If the decision is made to undertake the work in 1950-51, funds will of course be required in the amount of $6,150.00.\n\nSechelt Indian Residential School\nPlumbing Repairs - Mr. Arneil assures us that the final Progress Estimate will reach Ottawa in time for payment in full out of 1949-50 funds.\n\nLejac Indian Residential School,\nPlumbing and Heating Repairs - This work will also be completed by March 31, 1950 and paid for in full out of 1949-50 funds, according to Mr. Arneil.\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School,\nPlumbing and Heating Repairs.\nThe work was completed and paid for in full.\n\nFort Frances Indian Residential School,\nWalk-in Refrigerator.\nThe work was completed and paid for in full.\n\nCaughnawaga Indian Day School and\nBoiler House - New Construction.\nAll accounts will be settled out of 1949-50 funds.\nExtra Work orders have kept this job going all winter, and\nthe only unfinished work is the installation of a grille\nin Boiler House door. The Contractor will be paid in full,\nhowever, since the unfinished work totals $133.00 only in\nvalue, and we hold a security deposit of $5,000.00 against\nthe work.\n\nWabasca Indian Dormitory - New Construction.\nThe final Progress Claim has not been received, but\nassurances have been given that the final Claim will reach\nOttawa by the end of April. Every effort will be made to\nfinalize payment out of 1949-50 funds. The actual work was\ncompleted last June.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nOttawa, May 10th, 1950.\n\nR.A.

Brandon Indian Residential School\n   Amount required $3,000.00 - This has been transferred to you.\n\n2. Edmonton Indian Residential School\n   Amount required $31,900.00 - We are including this amount in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\n3. Muscowequan Indian Residential School\n   Amount required $600.00 - This has been transferred to you.\n\n4. Whitefish Bay Indian Residential School\n   Amount required $5,300.00 - This amount is being included in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\n5. Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School\n   Amount required $1,000.00 - This amount has been transferred to you.\n6. Birtle Indian Residential School\nAmount required $3,000.00 - This amount has been transferred to you.\n\n7. Gordon's Indian Residential School\nAmount required $1,500.00 - This is being transferred to you today.\n\n8. Pine Creek Indian Residential School\nAmount requested $32,000.00. In your memorandum of April 22 (File I.A. 1456-11) you advised us regarding three tenders which you had received. The largest of these was in an amount of $29,125.00, but from the contents of your letter it is evident that the firm was quoting on considerably more work than we intend to do during the coming season. In this connection I would refer you to my letter of May 3rd in which you were advised that we are prepared to provide at the present time, the funds required for the new roof only. It would, therefore, appear that less than $32,000.00 will be required at the Pine Creek Residential School, and I would appreciate it if you would let us have a new estimate of the expenditure required as soon as possible, so that the amount may be included in the supplementary Estimates.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\nMay 11, 1950.\n\nMemorandum to\n\nMR. J. A. STANTON\n\nPlan 888 - One-room School/Teacher's quarters.\n\nThis will confirm our recent conversation in which I advised you that the Director had suggested I contact you directly concerning a matter of some urgency.\n\nThis is to provide certain changes in plan 888 which provides a one-room school and teacher's residence without a basement and using only space heaters for providing heat.\n\nWe are now ready to advertise at least eight projects following this plan but two of our Regional Supervisors (Messrs. Ostrander and Gooderham) have strongly recommended that we provide a partial basement and install hot air furnaces.\n\nCould you please therefore make sketches showing the following alterations:\n\n(1) Enlargement of main vestibule to provide for angle stairs leading to proposed basement area;\n\n(2) Indicate partial basement sufficiently large to provide for a hot air furnace and fuel storage space. This partial basement could extend the width of the school and be about 16 to 20 ft. in width. The positioning of the partial basement would depend on the piping of the heat to the classroom and the positioning of the cold air returns.\n\nBernard F.

While technically it might be claimed that after one tender had been received the conditions laid down by the Cabinet had been met, I imagine that that was not what was intended. It may not always be practicable to secure more than one bid, but it is thought that in future when a recommendation is being made to the Deputy Minister that a contract be let, it be stated whether public tenders are invited, and if not, what the circumstances are that justify the acceptance of an individual tender.\n\n(sgd) W.J.F.

Gooderham\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\n507 Public Building\nCalgary, Alberta\n\nRe: One Room Day School, Plan 888\n\nWith reference to your 205-6-1-2 of January 27th regarding suggestions to improvement of plan number 888, I beg to report as follows:\n\n1. I consider the lack of a full basement a great handicap. The installation of a furnace is the major expense which is evidently to be provided for in the next basement. It was our considered opinion in the construction of the Louis Bull Day School that a full basement would have cost no more than the existing foundation construction. In conversation with Mr. B. F. Neary, Superintendent of Education, the added cost was considered in likely installations such as furnace and water system. The advantage of a full basement in the Hobbema Day School is quite evident. In this building, the children are able to use the basement as a play room and cloak room which is utilized fully during the cold winter months, which make up the bulk of the school term. A workshop could also be installed.\n\n2. The Hobbema Day School has yeast toilets which are installed in the basement and are very efficient. Mr. F.F. Neary has asked me to supply the name of the company installing this efficient, sanitary arrangement.\n\n3. The addition of another room to the teacherage should be provided for. It is my opinion that our best teachers, especially in isolated day schools, will be married men with families.\n\n4. There is a great lack of cupboard and storage space in plan number 888. It is quite evident in the Louis Bull Day School that the school supplies, janitor supplies and numerous other items utilized in a day school set up, will have to be stored under lock and key. No such storage space is provided and certainly will have to be. Mr. Neary verbally authorized me to provide such space under the windows or in the halls. Whatever arrangements are made now should certainly be included in a plan.\n\n5. The preparation and supplying of the noon hot drink and biscuit involves the use of facilities of what we expect to be an over-crowded classroom. Again, the use of a common room in the basement would be of great advantage. I have noted that when the lunch is furnished in the class room, efficiency and cleanliness are involved.\n\nH.N. Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent,\nHobbema Indian Agency,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration\n\nHNW/ehg\nMEMORANDUM TO COLONEL NEARY:\n\nThis is a copy of instructions from Justice on the subject which you spoke to me about this morning on the telephone.\n\nLegal Adviser\n\nEno.\nOttawa, 4th May, 1949.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nAttached hereto for your consideration is a copy of a letter from the Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice, dated the 23rd ultimo, referring to Orders in Council authorizing the purchase of land or payment of compensation for expropriated land.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Jacklett suggests that when authority is being sought from the Governor in Council for such transactions the Report to Council should be so framed as to seek authority to pay the purchase money upon obtaining a good title free from all encumbrances, reservations or encroachments other than such encumbrances, reservations or encroachments as, in the opinion of the Minister, do not affect the use of the land for the purpose for which it is being acquired.\n\n(sgd) W. M. Cory\n\nLegal Adviser.\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, CANADA\n\nOTTAWA April 23, 1949.\n\nPLEASE ADDRESS\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER OF JUSTICE\nOTTAWA\n\nRe: Orders in Council authorizing the Purchase of Land or Payment of Compensation for Expropriated Land\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOrders in Council authorizing the acquisition of land almost invariably require that a good title, free from all encumbrances, be acquired as a condition precedent to payment of the purchase moneys. It frequently appears, upon title to land being searched by agents of the Minister of Justice, that the vendor's title is subject to a reservation in respect of mines or minerals or to easements or encroachments which do not affect the use of the land for which it is being acquired. In such cases, it has, in the past, been necessary to have the Order in Council amended to permit the purchase price to be paid for the land subject to the reservation, encumbrance or encroachment.\n\nTo avoid delays and inconvenience, I suggest, for your consideration, that when authority is being sought from the Governor in Council for such transactions, the Report to Council should be so framed as to seek authority to pay the purchase money upon obtaining a good title free from all encumbrances, reservations or encroachments other than such encumbrances, reservations or encroachments as, in the opinion of your Minister, do not affect the use of the land for the purpose for which it is being acquired.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) W.

It would provide for electricity and running water and the outhouse toilets would not be provided. You will recall that I made the following comments on this plan previously:\n\n(1) A wash basin should be shown in the boys and girls lavatories.\n\n(2) A shower should be shown in the teacher's lavatory with space being taken if necessary from the bedroom.\n\n(3) As electricity will be provided, the building can be heated by forced hot air.\n\n(4) The walls of the classrooms and of the halls should have a plywood dado up to at least four feet. This will prevent the gyprock being dirty and will avoid constant painting.\n\n(5) A shelf for lunches should be placed in the hall along all possible sides including those behind the swinging entrance doors.\n\n(6) A basement is required only under the central section of the building containing the kitchen, living-room, hall and lavatories.\n\n...2\n(7) As this building will be provided only where facilities are available, the flat roof can be built under normal contracting conditions.\n\nBernard P.

The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\u2014\n\nAPPROVED\u2014\n\nDirector\n\n(1) Group requisitions for equipment, supplies, and material according to commodity, i.e., books, stationery, printing, electrical goods, hardware, machinery, provisions, transportation equipment, etc.\n(2) Avoid issuing requisitions for one item, only, except in cases of emergent necessity.\n(3) Furnish exact details of product required.\n\nForm 37\nJune 24, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nSeptic Toilets\n\nIn our new one-room day school (plan 933) it is our intention to install septic toilet combinations. At present under plan 886 it costs over $1,000 to provide a combination toilet and storage shed.\n\nIn our new plan No. 933, copies of which I attach, you will note that the toilet and storage shed has been completely eliminated. Instead, septic toilet combinations are called for. These are provided where no running water or electricity is available and shall be installed by lowering pipes down the unit. You will note in the plans that two toilet bowls are provided for boys, two toilet bowls for girls, and one for the teacher. This means that a five bowl system is required with correspondingly sized septic tank, ventilator, vent pipes, etc.\n\nAs we will be needing a number of these units for these new schools, I have recommended that they be purchased through your office rather than through the contractor. In this way we will ensure that a proper septic tank is provided and also that the piping is of good quality. Otherwise, contractors can obtain cheaper units with narrow gauge septic tanks, galvanized piping, etc., which while suitable for homes and churches, would not be satisfactory for school use.\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\nIn securing tenders, you should obtain two types:\n\n(a) for installation in Ontario - for schools of this type which we will be erecting in this province;\n\n(b) f.s.o.b. Toronto - for shipping to Western and Northern Canada where installation will have to be made by local contractors in accordance with instructions to be issued by the company concerned.\nThere are only two companies to my knowledge which manufacture this equipment:\n\n(1) Rural Sewage Disposal Equipment, 2067 Dundas St. W., Toronto,\n(2) Caustic Sanitation Limited, 21 Ridley Blvd., Toronto.\n\nI attach copies of advertising folders. I would be pleased to have Mr. Simard drop over and discuss with me the attached specification or to provide any information which you might require.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\n\nEnc.\nJune 23, 1950.\n\nMr. W.S. Arnott, Indian Commissioner for N.E.,\nMr. G.H. Goodenough, Regional Supervisor, Alberta,\nMr. J.P.R. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor, Saskatchewan,\nMr. R.G. Davis, Regional Supervisor, Manitoba,\nMr. F. Hatters, Regional Supervisor, Ontario.\n\nNew One-room Bay School Plan\n\nPlease find herein the plan for the one-room Bay school with attached teacher's residence which is to replace SSE.\n\nIn accordance with recommendations made previously by Regional Supervisors we have made three major changes:\n\n(1) A basement has been provided under the main school building. This will provide ample storage space for fuel, etc.\n\n(2) The outside toilet unit has been eliminated entirely and attached to one end of the school is a septic toilet system. These are the septic toilets in wide use now in schools in Ontario and to some lesser extent in Western Canada. They provide for a disposal system which should eliminate many of the caretaking worries in our rural one-room schools. I am attaching descriptive folders as prepared by one company and will shortly send you similar folders prepared by another company.\n\nThese units operate similarly to a septic tank although only require the addition of one pail of water per day. The steel in the septic tank unit is provided by the company with all fixtures. When a school is being erected by contract, the Department will provide these units. There are certain specifications clearly laid down for the same.\nof steel to be provided for the school service tanks and we wish to ensure that an inferior product is not substituted.\n\nYou will note that these toilets are placed on the teaching end of the building so that the teacher would have access to her toilet without leaving the building.\n\nThis will mean that only one building will be provided so that the entire school plant is under one roof.\n\n(3) The stoves used in heating the school have been eliminated and a hot air furnace is substituted. This is also in accordance with your recommendations and not only eliminates two stoves but also provides a larger classroom space.\n\nYou will note that the drawings call for artificial brick siding. Asbestos shingles or cedar siding can be substituted for this at the discretion of the Regional Supervisors.\n\nYou will notice minor points of improvement such as the elimination of one chimney; plywood dadoes below blackboards and in corridors; double shelving under the window ledges and large cupboards; and ventilators for the attics.\n\nUnder separate cover I will be writing to each of you concerning the reserves on which we feel this plan should be advertised for tenders immediately.\n\nBernard F.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nOne-room Day School Plan 933.\n\nBy now, you will have received copies of the plans for this new type of one-room day school with attached teacher's residence. This plan is designed for the following reserves:\n\n(a) where a low pupilage or irregular attendance does not warrant the construction of an expensive school,\n\n(b) where hydro is not immediately available.\n\nIt will be noted, however, that electricity can easily be installed in this school either immediately or at a later date and that the septic toilets can be replaced by regular flush units.\n\nOur Architects now have on the boards another one-room school plan with attached teacherage. This is being designed for the following types of reserves:\n\n(a) where the attendance is high and regular.\n\nThis new plan will permit of easy expansion to a two-room school. In fact the second classroom will be sketched in on the plan and the blue-print can be used for both a one and a two-room school. The teacherage already has the additional bedroom and living space for a second teacher. In other words it is designed\nfor reserves where a two-room school is now definitely needed or where a second classroom might be required in three or four years. This school has been designed for electrical installations and for running water. It is expected that it will be completed in the near future and will be mailed to you immediately it is ready. Major Clark has already told you of this plan.\n\nIn the meantime there are several reserves in your region for which we should advertise immediately for tenders for plan 933. It is suggested that the following might be built following this plan 933:\n\nMoosomin\nJohn Smith\n\nI feel that the following project should be delayed for advertising following the expandable plan:\n\nCote No. 2.\n\nBernard F.

The Monel washer has a cylinder of 18 gauge Monel, with an outer casing, or shell, of 14 gauge Monel. The brass cylinder machine has a cylinder of 14 gauge hard brass, nickel plated and highly polished, and an outer casing of 12 gauge galvanized iron. No. 7 washers are available with casing and cylinder of Monel only.\nREVERSING MOTOR SIMPLIFIES OPERATION\n\nAlternating revolutions of the cylinder are controlled by a ball bearing, high reactance reversing motor, which, eliminating the header and header belts, simplifies operation and reduces service. The motor driven timer insures uniform cylinder revolutions, six in one direction, then reversing for six revolutions. Controller and timer are enclosed in a steel cabinet mounted beside the motor.\n\nDOUBLE END DRIVE INCREASES POWER AND REDUCES STRAIN\n\nA counter shaft runs the length of the machine at the rear. At either end three V-belts connect countershaft and main cylinder drive pulleys, equalizing the drive power on either end of the cylinder, and reducing the strain on cylinder, trunions and end bearings. All belts and pulleys are completely enclosed for safety.\n\nThe push button station for inching the cylinder and controlling the machine is located conveniently on the end casting, and provides for the following controls: \"Start\", \"Stop\", \"Inch Up\", \"Inch Down\", and \"Safety\". The motor is mounted on an adjustable plate, and three V-belts connect motor and countershaft. The adjustable motor mounting simplifies correction of belt tension, if necessary.\nTHE CYLINDERS are sturdily constructed and smoothly engineered for complete satisfaction and to minimize wear on linens. The cylinder heads are of cast iron, treated with corrosion resisting coating, and lined with Monel or nickelled brass. Heads are accurately machined to accept the cylinder sheets.\n\nCYLINDER SHEETS of Monel or nickelled brass are perforated, with 11.32 inch perforations, embossed on the outside and perfectly smooth on the inside. On the No. 7 washer the two compartments are separated by a sturdy spider double-faced with Monel.\n\nSIX LIFTING RIBS running the full length of the cylinder assure positive water action and high cleansing qualities. There are three high ribs and three low ribs, the high ribs being of six inch depth. They are die formed and rivetted to the cylinder sheets.\n\nCYLINDER TRUNIONS are of cast steel, 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches in diameter, of detachable type, and accurately machined to run true with the cylinder.\n\nCLEARANCE between cylinder and casing is 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches. A hinged bridging apron spans the space between cylinder and casing.\n\nTHE CYLINDER DOOR is hinged, and reinforced, with a reinforced round rib enclosing external door latches, which are wedge-type and spring actuated. No part of the latch is exposed inside the cylinder.\n\nTHE SHELL DOOR slides in a slotted groove, and carries a conveniently located soap box.\n\nSHELL HEADS are of cast iron, coated with a rust resistant to prevent corrosion and staining of the linens.\n\nEND CASTINGS and legs of solid cast iron assure rigidity and sturdiness.\nCYLINDER MOUNTING\n\nThis drawing illustrates the construction of the cylinder mounting used on both ends of the cylinder. It shows the steel shaft and large ball bearings that carry the load and reduce the power required to operate the machine. It also illustrates the packing that protects the bearings from water and also prevents water from leaking out of the machine, or oil getting into the water from the bearings.\n\nWATER AND STEAM CONNECTIONS\n\nA 3\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)-inch water inlet is located at the back of the machine, and a steam inlet at the base of the shell. A six inch dump valve, foot actuated, empties the machine quickly and thoroughly. A thermometer and water gauge are conveniently located at the left end.\n\nMODEL SPECIFICATIONS\n\n| Model | Cylinder (inches) | Capacity (dry wt.) | Outside Shell | Cylinder | Motor Countershaft | Floor Space (inches) | Shipping Weight (approx.) |\n|-------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|----------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| 6 B   | 36 x 54          | 150 lbs.           | galv. iron    | nickelled brass | 2                 | 18\" x 128            | 45 x 92                  | 2500 lbs.                |\n| 6 BE  | 36 x 54          | 150 \"              | \"             | \"         | 2                 | 18\" x 128            | 45 x 92                  | 2500 \"                   |\n| 6 M   | 36 x 54          | 150 \"              | Monel         | Monel     | 2                 | 18\" x 128            | 45 x 92                  | 2500 \"                   |\n| 6 ME  | 36 x 54          | 150 \"              | \"             | \"         | 2                 | 18\" x 128            | 45 x 92                  | 2600 \"                   |\n| 7 M   | 36 x 72          | 200 \"              | \"             | \"         | 3                 | 18\" x 128            | 45 x 110                 | 2925 \"                   |\n| 7 ME  | 36 x 72          | 200 \"              | \"             | \"         | 3                 | 18\" x 128            | 45 x 110                 | 3025 \"                   |\n\n* For best results washers should not be loaded to more than 80% of maximum dry weight capacity.\nCONNOR SERIES \"28\" WASHERS\n\nFor Medium Size Laundries, Institutions and Hotels\n\nWILL MEET LAUNDRY REQUIREMENTS WITH SPEED...SATISFACTION...ECONOMY\n\nTWO CONVENIENT SIZES\n\nThe Series \"28\" Washer is available in two sizes.

Washes 36 pounds of dry clothes each load equal to 94 average size sheets or 150 to 175 towels.\n\nThe inner cylinder is 40 inches long and 24 inches in diameter. It is made of nickel plated brass, highly polished and balanced for smooth operation. The cylinder door is easily located by means of a locating wheel to the left of the washer.\n\nA 1/2 h.p. motor operates both washer and wringer. All the mechanism is enclosed for the protection of the operator.\n\nIT'S THE DESIGN OF THE Snow White THAT MAKES IT SO EFFICIENT\n\n1. Quiet and smooth in operation, it is the best machine available in its size for faster, cleaner washings and thorough rinsing.\n\n2. The Cast Ends. Built on the same lines as the largest laundry washers with heavy cast ends.\n\n3. The Header has three pulleys. The centre pulley is the tight pulley. The two side pulleys are loose pulleys or idlers. The straight and cross belts shift alternately over the tight pulley, driving the cylinder 2\u00bd times in one direction, then in the opposite direction 2\u00bd times, 30 revolutions per minute.\n\n(See reverse)\n4. Water Connections. Water pipe fittings to which cold and hot water supply pipes can be connected make it convenient for the operator to let water into the washer.\n\n5. The Wringer. Snow White Washers are equipped with the Connor double automatic wringer with solid cast iron base, porcelain enamel finish and large resilient rubber rolls 12\" x 2\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\". The controlled pressure of four enclosed coiled springs extracts the water from both large and small articles efficiently. Instant safety release opens the rolls four inches apart.\n\n---\n\nThe No. 1 Snow White is the same in design and principle as the No. 2 Snow White but is 52 inches in length compared to the 64 inch overall length of the No. 2.\n\nIt washes 94 pounds of dry clothes each load, the equal of 16 average size sheets or 100 towels.\n\nThe inner cylinder is 24 inches deep and 38 inches long, and is made of 16 gauge nickel plated hard brass. The brass sheeting is riveted to the cast iron ends\u2014the same principle of construction as that used on the largest laundry washers.\n\nThe cylinder revolves on Timken roller bearings.\n\nA one-third horse power motor operates both the washer and the Connor double-automatic cast iron wringer.\n\nThe comparative value of a laundry washer can be determined by its weight. Snow White Washers are sturdily constructed of heavy material to give many years of silent, efficient operation.\n\n---\n\n**SPECIFICATIONS OF THE SNOW WHITE WASHERS**\n\n| Model | Cylinder (inches) | Maximum Capacity (dry wt.) | Outside Shell | Cylinder Motor H.P. | Floor Space (inches) | Shipping Weight (approx.) | Cubic Content (approx.) |\n|-------|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| 1 BE  | 24 x 28          | 94 lbs.                     | galv. iron    | 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)    | 38 x 52              | 800 lbs.                 | 79.9 c.ft.             |\n| 1 BEW | 24 x 28          | 94                          | galv. iron    | 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)    | 38 x 52              | 900                      | 79.9                   |\n| 1 ME  | 24 x 28          | 24                          | Monel         | 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)    | 38 x 52              | 800                      | 79.9                   |\n| 1 MEW | 24 x 28          | 24                          | Monel         | 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)    | 38 x 52              | 900                      | 79.9                   |\n| 2 BE  | 24 x 40          | 36                          | galv. iron    | 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)    | 38 x 64              | 950                      | 106.5                  |\n| 2 BEW | 24 x 40          | 36                          | galv. iron    | 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)    | 38 x 64              | 1050                     | 106.5                  |\n| 2 ME  | 24 x 40          | 36                          | Monel         | 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)    | 38 x 64              | 950                      | 106.5                  |\n| 2 MEW | 24 x 40          | 36                          | Monel         | 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)    | 38 x 64              | 1050                     | 106.5                  |\n\nModels 1 BE, 1 ME, 2 BE and 2 ME are supplied without wringer attached.\n\nNote:\u2014These machines are available equipped with gasoline engines instead of electric motors, making them ideal units where electric power is not available.\n\n---\n\n**The Guarantee**\n\nAny part or parts of the No. 1 or No. 2 Snow White Washers proving defective within one year from date of delivery will be supplied free of charge, f.o.b. our factory at Ottawa, with the exception of the gasoline engine, which carries the guarantee of its maker.\n\n---\n\n**BUILT TO GIVE A LIFETIME OF LAUNDRY SERVICE**\n\nBranches or Factory Representatives at MONCTON \u2022 MONTREAL \u2022 TORONTO \u2022 HAMILTON \u2022 WINNIPEG \u2022 CALGARY \u2022 VANCOUVER\nTHE CONNOR RAPID TUMBLER DRYER\n\nA REMARKABLE TUMBLER which both large and small plants will find valuable in their drying department.

It seems to me that the most convenient way of disposing of the language problem would be to arrange for some children, during the next year, to attend residential school so that when a day school is built and the teacher appointed, the teacher will not face an entirely primitive situation. It is too difficult to find teachers who are able to face and to control successfully such situations. A lowering of the population in the manner of James Bay and Abitibi areas appears to be indicated before we embark on a full-fledged, full-scale school.\n\nC.A.F.

We do not know what type of school these will be installed in but presume they are the basementless type and have different measurements than those shown in your plan number 888.\n\nWe are enclosing for your files a complete set of literature on the Van-Packer.\n\nThanking you again and assuring you of our desire to be of service, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDAVIDSON-McROBERT LIMITED\n\nF. R. Stewart,\nManager.\nThe VAN-PACKER\n\nCHIMNEY\n\npre-cast\n\nsectional\n\nlight weight\n\nFOR ONE AND TWO STORY HOUSES\n\n- A packaged chimney shipped complete and ready for installation.\n- Weighs less than 1/5 as much as a brick chimney. Can be suspended from floor or ceiling.\n- Complete chimney made in sections \u2014 easy to handle and install.\n\n- Underwriters' listed for all fuels in one and two story houses. Has National Housing Act Official acceptance.\n- A tile lined \u2014 insulated \u2014 reinforced \u2014 lightweight masonry chimney which is permanent, safe, efficient and low in cost.\nAPPROVED BY UNDER-WRITERS LABORATORY FOR USE WITH ALL FUELS\n\nEach Van-Packer Chimney carries the U.L. Label - is approved for use in place of brick chimneys in one- and two-story houses (with or without a basement). It is not limited to gas, but is approved for use with any fuel - oil, wood, gas, etc. Under the U.L. reexamination service, the Van-Packer chimney is frequently checked by Underwriters to assure its safety and quality of production. (Each chimney carries the U.L. label.)\n\nUnderwriters' tested the chimney for many months under all conditions of service. These tests conclusively proved that the Van-Packer chimney is completely safe, durable, practical and permanent.\n\nIt was tested for (1) extremely high flue gas temperature (2) heat shock, (3) freezing and thawing, (4) structural overload, (5) acid corrosion, (6) smoke leakage, (7) mishandling, (8) performance and durability, efficiency, etc. Repeated tests were made with a flue gas temperature of 1000\u00b0 for more than eight hours and all wood temperatures were well below safe limits. Compared to brick chimney performance, these tests proved that the Van-Packer chimney transmits only heat to the adjacent combustible materials.\n\nUnderwriters' tested for heat shock by raising the flue gas to 1000\u00b0 for thirty minutes and abruptly cooled to room temperature. This reverse heating and cooling cycle was repeated over one hundred times without any damage whatsoever to any part of the Van-Packer chimney.\n\nIt was subjected to forty-five days of alternate freezing and thawing with\nThe Van-Packer chimney is Safe . . .\nLightweight . . . Complete . . . Economical\n\nno chipping, cracking or evidence of deterioration whatsoever.\n\nThe Van-Packer floor support (chimney base) was overloaded in excess of four times its rated weight. There was no failure or deflection.\n\nThe lining and wall were boiled in acid solution continuously for four days and were unscathed. Repeated acid and water tests were run to prove that the entire chimney, including all joints, was permanently gas-tight, smoke-tight and leak proof. All parts of the Van-Packer chimney will stand severe mishandling which might occur in shipment.\n\nALL FUELS\n\nAll fuels may be used with the insulated, acid proof Van-Packer chimney. High temperatures incidental to most fires, badly adjusted heaters or flue defects are not a problem with Van-Packer chimneys. The long series of Underwriters' tests prove conclusively that the Van-Packer chimney is completely and permanently safe for use with all fuels.\n\nLOW COST\n\nIt can be easily installed by the average workman even after the house is built, thus eliminating very laborious and overhead due to delays in construction. It is shipped complete, packaged and ready for immediate installation.\n\nLIGHT-WEIGHT\n\nMany times lighter than brick (+10 lbs. against 220 lbs.), the lightweight Van-Packer chimney is suspended between the ceiling joists when used with a floor furnace or basement furnace. It is suspended between the ceiling joists when a utility room below is used. Supported over the heater it requires no floor space, eliminates the need of a foundation.\n\nJOINTS\n\nThe average brick chimney has about 5000 joints which are loosely made with various mortars. Weather and corrosive flue gases eat holes in the mortar joints, resulting in low draft, poor heater operation and fire hazard.\n\nThe Van-Packer chimney has an average of only five joints, made in the simplest and most effective way. Set in acid proof cement, they form perfect flames, and permanently bonded with acid proof cement. To prevent expansion and shrinkage, the sections are clamped together with joint bands, thus assuring perfect alignment and permanent sealing of joints. These joints are not affected by building settlement.\n\nTests prove that the Van-Packer joint is not affected by extreme temperature, boiling acid solutions, freezing and thawing, heat shock or harsh treatment during construction. This joint construction results in a continuous chimney wall which is permanently leakproof.\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nEasy to install. The Van-Packer chimney is packaged and shipped complete\u2014ready for quick and easy assembly and installation. Requires no special tools.\n\n1. Cut holes in floor, ceiling and roof.\n2. Nest chimney support in place and set first section with joint cement provided.\n3. Set second section with joint cement and lock joint with joint bands provided. Repeat until all sections are installed.\n4. Set roof housing in place and flash to roof.\n5. Set cap on top section with joint cement and fasten to housing with sheet-metal screws.\n\nWINTER INSTALLATION\n\nCan be installed during the winter. Only 3 hours from delivery to completed chimney ready for fire in heater.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nHeating plant performance depends on chimney draft. The hotter the gas in the chimney the better the draft. After gases enter the chimney they should be kept as hot as possible to preserve draft. The Van-Packer insulated chimney wall does this.\n\nMasonry chimneys not being insulated, cool the flue gases quickly. This cooling produces much less draft than the Van-Packer chimney produces because of its insulated wall.\n\nThe 3\" Van-Packer chimney wall has an insulating value equal to a 2\u00bd\" brick chimney wall or 50\u00b0 concrete chimney wall. The Van-Packer chimney produces adequate and better draft, for safer and more efficient operation of the heating equipment.\n\nPERMANENCE\n\nAll materials used have a long record of field performance with proven quality and permanence. The best of these materials have been combined and molded into the safer and more efficient Van-Packer chimney.\n\nAcids produced in the combustion of all fuels do not affect and eat masonry in the Van-Packer chimney, gases contact only fire clay tile which is impervious to acids, heat shock, freezing and thawing. This tile lining is easily cast into the light weight refractory concrete wall.\n\nThe Van-Packer chimney is built to last as long as the house it serves.\n\nAPPEARANCE\n\nThe decorative roof housing of the Van-Packer chimney is furnished in conventional chimney designs which harmonize with most roofs. They may be painted on the job in any color preferred. They are designed in pleasing proportions to replace conventional square chimney lines and are available in a variety of dimensions to suit requirements.\n\nSAFETY\n\nEach Van-Packer chimney carries the U.L. label\u2014has an insulating wall equivalent to 2\u00bd\" of brick. The lining is made of fire clay refractory. Joints are permanently sealed, leak-proof and gas-tight. It is floor or ceiling suspended so as to remain permanent and intact regardless of building settlement or vibration.\ntypical installations\n\nOne Story Utility Room\nOne Story With Basement\nOne Story Floor Furnace\n\nTwo Story Pier Foundation\nOutside Chimney\nCabin or Garage\n\nFor prices, send chimney dimensions shown in blue.\n\nInstall chimney base in floor or ceiling.\nSet chimney section in base.\nPour VanPacker joint cement on face of section.\nManufactured by\nC.

Those tests were performed at Buda, Illinois on chimneys erected by the Van-Packer Corporation.\n\nTest Conditions:\n\nThe chimneys used in this test were erected next to each other to a height of 17' 12\" above the grate. The code chimney consisted of one course of 4\" brick around a standard 8\" x 12\" flue liner. The inside dimensions of the flue liner were 10.02\" x 6.17\" with an area of 61.8 square inches.\n\nThe Van-Packer chimney consisted of seven 2 foot lengths supported on a stand to bring the tops of the chimneys to the same height. The inside diameter of the Van-Packer flue was 7.25 inches with a flue area of 41.30 square inches.\n\nConclusions:\n\n1. The Van-Packer chimney develops 34% more draft than a code chimney under identical firing conditions when burning Southern Illinois bituminous coal.\n2. The Van-Packer chimney shows considerably less heat loss than the code chimney.\n3. The Van-Packer chimney is far less subject to condensation than the code chimney since during a four minute interval from zero fire it had an average exit flue gas temperature of 470\u00b0F compared to an average of 304\u00b0F on the code chimney during the same interval.\n4. The Van-Packer chimney is more suitable for intermittent firing with either coal or oil because it develops maximum draft in less than one-half the time required by the code chimney.\n5. The Van-Packer chimney has a maximum coal burning rate equal to 1.9 times the burning rate of a code chimney.\n6. The Van-Packer flue has a venting capacity far in excess of the code flue as is shown by the coal burning rate test.\n\nTWIN CITY TESTING AND\nENGINEERING LABORATORY\n\n(sgd) H. E.

L. Armstrong, Esq.,\nInspector of Public Schools,\nPictou, N.S.\nRiver Bourgeois N. S., Dec. 23 1912.\n\nJ. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nYour letter in reference to Indian Schools has been lying on my desk so long unanswered that I owe you an apology and an explanation.\n\nA good many years ago, I used to visit those schools till I found that I had little or no influence over them or control over their teachers; so I ceased to inspect them. In recent years, I was under the impression that Mr. Boyd, the Superintendent of Agencies, was doing the necessary inspection.\n\nThere being no Trustees or other local control, over these schools, I should like to be informed as to:\n\n(a) What are supposed to be the relations between the teacher and the inspector,\n\n(b) How far is the former responsible to the latter for the management of the school, and\n\n(c) On whose recommendation is a teacher to be appointed or liable to be dismissed?\n\nI may state that I have just been informed that the teacher of the Salmon River school, this County, Miss Devereaux, has been dismissed to make room for a young man having neither license...\nexperience nor professional training; whereas the deposed teacher is an experienced and capable one, having a Normal College Diploma\u2014a young lady of irreproachable character in every respect, and (tho, I presume, this does not count) an orphan\u2014fatherless and motherless. Is it too much to ask the reason for this change and at whose instance it was made? Because if it is as is commonly reported, I would like to say that I should much prefer to have nothing to do with these schools if they are to be controlled by political influence. The schools of Nova Scotia are not managed on those principles.\n\nI was informed by Mr. Boyd, some weeks ago, that the school at Malagawatch, Inverness County, was closed, not to be re-opened till some time in January. Hence I should not have been able to visit that one, i.e., any case, before now, so I decided to visit neither till I heard from you.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, January 7, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo in reference to the inspection of the Indian schools in your inspectorate.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department desires to have these schools inspected by you under the arrangement made with the Department of Education of Nova Scotia.\n\nIn reply to your questions I would say that the duty of the Public School Inspector is to visit the school, as stated in official letter to you of June 29th, last, report fully upon the class-room work as performed by the teacher and condition of the building, etc., using forms provided by this Department for the purpose, a supply of which is being sent you.\n\nWhile the teacher is not directly responsible to the Public School Inspector, as the school is conducted and managed solely by this Department, nevertheless teachers are supposed to carry out the instructions of Inspectors in regard to their work and general management of the school and any failure to do this should be reported to the Department.\n\nWith regard to the appointments and dismissals of teachers, I may say that these are matters which rest solely with the Department. Recommendations for the appointments of teachers may be made by any person interested, but, as stated\n\nM. J. T. Macneil, Esq., B.A.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nstated above, final decision rests with this Department.\n\nWith regard to the discharge of Miss Devereaux I beg to say that the action was taken by the Department on a report made by its Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMarch 24th, 1915.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Dr. Roche -\n\nIn the debate on the Indian Estimates (page 1389, Hansard of March 22nd.) Mr. Kyte, M.P., makes the following remarks:\n\n\"Mr. Kyte: Are these schools inspected by the public school inspectors?\n\n\"Mr. Roche: I understand that Indian schools in all the provinces are inspected by the public and separate school inspectors.\n\n\"Mr. Kyte: Can the Minister speak definitely as to Chapel Island Reserve in Nova Scotia?\n\n\"Mr. Roche: Not specially, but I understand the rule applies there also.\n\n\"Mr. Kyte: I understand that two years ago the school inspector of the district objected to performing the duty of inspection of this school on the ground that while he had influence over...\"\nother teachers the teachers in this school were not employed according to the provisions of the public school law, and that competent teachers were dismissed and partisans appointed in their places. Unless the department changed its policy in this respect he would not undertake the inspection. Has the minister had any communication with that gentleman recently?\"\n\nI find that the letter from Inspector M. J. Macneil, to which he refers was dated 23rd, December, 1912. We wrote an explanatory letter to him dated January 7th, 1913, showing the relations of the public school inspectors to the teacher of an Indian day school. It evidently satisfied Inspector Macneil because he has since made two inspections of the Chapel Island school to which Mr. Kyte, M.P., specially referred, one on May 9th, 1913, and the other on April 29th, 1914. I send herewith copies of these reports.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDecember 5, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nUnder the agreement entered into with the Government of the Province of Nova Scotia for the securing to the Indian schools in that province the same system of inspection at the hands of the government officers as the public schools there enjoy, and which agreement is still in existence and working satisfactorily, the fee allowed to each inspector was at the rate of $5.00 per class-room inspected, together with actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on the inspector's regular route of inspection.\n\nAs the fees allowed have remained at the same rate during the past thirty-five years, it is considered that the time has arrived when an increase should be granted for the work performed by the inspectors, which has been invariably satisfactory. I have, therefore, to inform you that, from January 1st, next, the fee allowed will be at the rate of $7.50 for the inspection of each class-room, as well as the payment of the actual travelling expenses of the inspectors from the nearest point on their regular route, schools to be inspected semi-annually as in the past; such fees and expenses to be paid, as in the past, upon receipt of accounts for the amount due at the above rate.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform your inspectors in whose districts Indian schools are located of the increase in the fees allowed and that they should render their accounts accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Scott, F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have very much pleasure in conveying your information of the 8th instant to the Inspectors interested, respecting increased allowance for the inspection of Indian Schools.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE\n\nAbout 1885 an arrangement was made with the Ontario Department of Education for the inspection of the Indian schools. It was agreed that the remuneration paid to the inspectors would be at the rate of $6.00 per room, plus the actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on their regular route. This arrangement obtains today. Inspections are made semi-annually.\n\nIn Quebec and the Maritime Provinces an arrangement was made in 1886 with the Departments of Education on similar lines as for Ontario. The rate of remuneration was $5.00 per room plus expenses. Since January 1, 1921, in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces the inspectors have received $7.50 per room plus expenses. Inspections are made semi-annually.\n\nArrangements have been concluded this year with the Prairie Provinces. In Manitoba we have agreed to pay the inspectors at the rate of $15.00 per classroom plus expenses. In Saskatchewan and Alberta a flat rate of $20.00 per school is being charged for one inspection per year. In the case of the last two provinces, no allowances are made in connection with expenses.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to inform you that I have been recently appointed Inspector of Schools for Richmond Co. & Suroness South, etc., as successor to Mr. MacNeil.\n\nI also find on my school directory three Indian reserve schools; two in Richmond Co. and one in Suroness South.\n\nKindly send me Inspector's Report forms with directions if you have any.\n\nAnd oblige,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.

Under arrangements made with the Department of Education for Nova Scotia, these schools are visited semi-annually and a report submitted to the Department after each inspection on one of the forms which will be forwarded to you for that purpose.\n\nThe Department allows $7.50 for each inspection, plus actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on your regular inspection route. When submitting your report you should also enclose your account in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.

I do not understand why he has given up the Inspection of these schools, for which I suppose your department pays the expenses. As soon as I hear from him I shall transmit any information which may be obtained.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Education.\nRussell E. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHalifax, N.S.,\n10 July, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn further reply to your communication of June 27 in reference to the inspection of the Indian Day Schools at Whyconagh and Middle River, I beg to say in continuation of my note of July 3 that Mr. James MacKinnon, Inspector of Schools at Baddeck, N.S., has written me in reply to your correspondence as follows:\n\n\"After repeated visits to these schools, followed by continued disregard for the recommendations made by me in connection with them, I came to the conclusion that nobody was telling us seriously the matter of the education of the Indians in this part of the country, and I did not want to continue to be party to what appeared to me to be nothing but a farce.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs has my reports covering several years and by comparison of them with the conditions they can now find in the schools referred to they can see just what I mean in the rather strong statement in the foregoing paragraph.\n\nI may say however, that if the Department wishes me to give it another trial, I shall do so, but I cannot promise to continue from year to year, reporting the same old deficiencies and inefficiencies, with no hope of improvement.\n\nYou will see that Inspector MacKinnon takes an interest in the schools and has been desirous of making improvements. He evidently considers the equipment of these schools to be insufficient and not creditable to the inspecting official who would continue to supervise them without being able to bring them into a creditable condition. You cannot do better than to co-operate with an honest and competent Inspector. I presume your difficulty will be of the same class as our own -- the lack of sufficient funds provided by Parliament.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, July 14, 1925.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, in further reference to the inspection of the Whycocomagh and Middle River Indian Day Schools.\n\nI may say that I have reviewed Mr. Inspector McKinnon's report and his chief criticism of these Indian schools was the irregularity in the attendance of the pupils. This is a matter which is very difficult to overcome, owing to the indifference to many of the Indian parents.\n\nI am pleased to note, however, that Mr. Inspector McKinnon will resume inspection of the schools mentioned and every possible consideration will be given to the inspector's suggestions for improvements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

D'Entremont \u2014 for many years the position was held by Inspector J.F. Macmillan \u2014 has forwarded me all documents pertaining to his case, and I believe that you had arranged for the inspection of the schools at Malagawatch and Salmon River. If you desire to have me take over these duties kindly advise me. I already have inspected all the public schools in the region of Malagawatch, but did not visit the Indian school of the Salmon River referred to in\nRichmond County could include it in my inspection tour next week.\n\nIs the Indian school at the Retiree here provided for?\n\nJames Taylor\nJ.H. Bandic\nOttawa, November 5, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the first instant, I beg to say that the Indian schools examined by Mr. L. A. d'Antremon were:\n\nSalmon River - 8 miles from St. Peter's.\nWhycoomagh - 1 mile from Whycoomagh.\nMalagawatch - 12 miles from Orangesdale Station.\n\nIf these schools are now in your inspectorate, the Department would be pleased if you would visit them regularly.\n\nInspector of Schools W. R. Campbell formerly visited the following Indian schools:\n\nShubenacadie - 5 miles from Shubenacadie.\nMillbrook - 2\u00bd miles from Truro.\n\nI note that this inspector has not forwarded reports on these schools since November, 1924. If the two schools named are also in your district, you may inspect them. If, however, Mr. Campbell is still on active duty, they should be left for his inspection. By arrangement with the Provincial Department of Education, we allow $7.50 for each inspection, plus actual travelling expenses from the nearest point on your regular inspection trip to the nearest Indian school visited. Two inspections are made each year - one in the spring and the other in the fall. Forms for making your report are enclosed. When forwarding reports, you should also enclose an account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the inspection and your expenses.\n\nJ. A. Bencot, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nTruro, N. S.\n\n- In inspecting -\nIn inspecting Indian schools, you should pay particular attention to the academic qualifications of the teacher; the progress of the pupils and offer recommendations concerning buildings or equipment with a view to making the instruction more attractive and efficient. It should be remembered that the teacher of an Indian day school is not directly responsible to the public school inspector, as Indian day schools are controlled and managed solely by this Department.\n\nHowever, a teacher is expected to carry out the instructions of the inspector in regard to the work and the general management of the school. You should feel at liberty to report to this Department any failure on the part of the teacher to carry out any reasonable suggestions made by you.\n\nThe appointment and dismissal of teachers rests solely with the Department of Indian Affairs. Recommendations from you in this connection, however, will receive consideration. The course of study prescribed by the Nova Scotia Department of Education should be followed as far as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Campbell's successor is Mr. W.E. Stapleton, Dartmouth, N.S. Will you desire me to inspect the Tatamagouche and Shubenacadie schools? I could do so by charging travelling expenses merely from Nova Scotia. Shubenacadie is these are places I have occasion to pass them more twice per year.\n\nI shall visit the Salmon River school in the near future, and Tatamagouche and We'cocannah in the spring unless otherwise instructed by you. As to the remaining two, it will be as you say.\n\nTo B.T. Farmer, Esq.,\nDept. Indic.
