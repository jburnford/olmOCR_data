A. Henry visited us to inspect pressure vessels. He found that the large water pressure tank installed by the Surveys and Engineering Branch of the Department at Banff early in 1947 was buried deep in the ground and he could not inspect same. He stated that this was a pressure vessel carrying 80 lbs. pressure and has been installed contrary to all the laws and regulations regarding high pressure vessels, that it had to be inspected once each year and must be set on concrete trunnions in a concrete pit so that it could be inspected. This is the tank we had trouble with last September when it sank further in the clay soil shearing off the connecting pipes.\n\n\"The new well, of course, had to be drilled outside the existing building and is now sitting out in the open without protection of any kind. A building will have to be...\"\nerected over this and as it is near the pressure vessel, and if Mr. Henry is correct, one structure can be built to house both the pump and the pressure tank. Excavation and cement work would have to be done around the tank, and I would suggest that the building be constructed of cinder blocks and frame and shingle roof, approximately 24 x 30 feet. I am quite aware that this school has had their full share, and more, of improvements this fiscal year, but I see no alternative but to erect this building. If you concur in this I shall procure tenders and costs.\"\n\nIn connection with the above, I would refer you to memorandum from your Branch dated October 29, 1947, and previous correspondence.\n\nThe last paragraph of your memorandum of October 29 read as follows:\n\n\"It would seem quite likely to us that it was the air pipe and not the tank that settled, as the tank should have been placed on solid ground and, of course the air pipe would be placed through the unconsolidated fill material and the extra weight of water from the roof might have possibly sheared off a weak thread at the tank.

We are requesting the Lands and Development Services Branch to have one of their men visit the school at the earliest possible date with reference to the pressure tank and the erection of the building which you consider will be required to house both the pump and the pressure tank.

Indian Residential School.\n\nReference your 103-10-8 of June 10 -\n\nIncluded in our supplementary estimates for 1948/49 is the sum of $12,000.00 for the moving and setting up of these classroom blocks. We have already approved a tender from A. Kaughman & Sons amounting to $6,500.00 for the moving of these two buildings. This leaves an amount of $5,500.00.\n\nMajor Clark has specifically recommended the installation of full basements under these buildings and the Department concurs in his recommendation. The lowest tender for the installation of these basements is that of H. Weston and it amounts to $6,640 (broken down into two separate bids of $2,739 and $3,901). This means that an additional amount is required over and above our estimates of $1,440 and will necessitate a transfer of funds in this amount.\n\nBefore proceeding with such a transfer it is essential that we know what additional funds will be required for:\n\n(a) Stair wells,\n(b) Posts and/or pillars for bracing,\n(c) Laying of drain and water pipe,\n(d) Installation of electrical wiring.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nClassroom Blocks - Blood Reserve Schools\nYour Files: 103-2-5 and 103-1-5\n\nAfter much difficulty and travel we are now able to enclose herewith competitive tenders on foundations on basements needed at the proposed sites of our new classroom blocks.\n\nWe would recommend, if at all possible, that full basements be put under these buildings and we have had each contractor tender on the full basement as well as surface foundation so that comparisons may be made. The advantages of full basements was discussed with Major Clark while he was on the Blood Reserve.\n\nContractors were asked to tender on full basements with 8\" walls, 8' high, 4\" floor with footings and installing ten windows and frames. Stairwells have not been included, nor has any posts or pillars for bracing; drains and laying of water pipe and electrical wiring will also be extra.\n\nFollowing is a comparison of the tenders as submitted:\n\n|                | R. Weston | T. Weston | D. Watson |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Full Basement - St. Paul's - | $2759.00 | $2740.00 | $3000.00 |\n| Surface Foundation - St. Paul's - | 496.00 | 659.00 | 735.00 |\n| Full Basement - R.

School - | 1268.00 | 1333.00 | 950.00 |\n\nEach contractor has stated that he would be glad to do the work on a cost plus 10% basis, with the Department furnishing all material.\n\nA. Kaughman and Sons now have both buildings ready to truck to sites, but are held up on account of the swollen condition of the river. This condition in all probability, will not get back to normal for another month yet.\n\nIt is hoped that one contractor can be given the entire work, and that authority to proceed can be given at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(R. D. Ragam)\nSuperintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6373, file 764-5, part 10)\nYou can readily appreciate the fact that if a transfer is to be arranged through Treasury Board, it is essential that we have the one transfer arranged and not a series of small transfers. Therefore, before anything can be done with regard to the basements, we must have an approximation of all additional expenditures which will be required in order to set these classroom blocks up as operating units.\n\nBernard F.

Anthracene Oil) has over quite a few similar products on the market, is that it does not form crystals in the bottom of the container when allowed to set for a long period of time.\n\nD.T. Wood Preserver (Containing D.T. Anthracene Oil) is also free of lumps, dregs, sediment and other foreign particles that stop up spray guns.\n\nD.T. Wood Preserver (Containing D.T. Anthracene Oil) works exceptionally well in a regular paint spray gun. In cold weather it will have to be thinned by adding 20% kerosene. This will not reduce the effectiveness of the product so long as a heavy coat is applied. The kerosene will dry and the active ingredients will remain in the wood.\n\nThis feature of D.T. Wood Preserver (Containing D.T.

It will be my suggestion that money be allotted for this roof instead of the farm instructor residence. I am enclosing some literature on the wood preserver which is sold in Cardston and seems to me to be what we would want. The price of this wood preserver is $1.79 per gallon less 5% and we would need approximately 200 gallons to give the St. Paul's roof the coating, amounting to $340.10 for the preserver. Mr. S.D. Wolff of Cardston has agreed to supply this material on the roof for the sum of $300.00 making a total expense for the job $640.10.\n\nIf the Department are in agreement, may a purchase order be issued to Mr. R.

Middleton,\nSt. Paul's Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nDear Archdeacon Middleton,\n\nRe: Refrigeration.\n\nIn one of the letters General Turner has sent into the office he emphasized your school's need for adequate refrigeration.\n\nYesterday morning I was able to sell the idea to the Indian Affairs Branch and I am quite sure that they are now prepared to install the refrigeration unit at your school. However, they do require full details as to the adequate cubic contents of such a refrigerator and whether or not a walk-in refrigerator would be of service. May I suggest that you, in cooperation with the Agent, go into this matter fully and both submit your recommendations to your principals.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSgd.\"Henry G. Cook\"\nSuperintendent.\nVenerable Archdeacon S.H. Middleton,\nSt. Paul's Anglican Indian School,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nFurther to the inquiry re refrigeration for the St. Paul's School, and also further to my visit and conversation with Mr. Charles Middleton, please be advised of the following quotations in respect to the reach-in cabinet for the kitchen, and the walk-in cooler for storage.\n\nYour reach-in cabinet in the kitchen can be built to any size required up to the following dimensions. That is the actual size of the compartment you will store food in. The size could be 3 ft. in width, 4 ft. in height, and 7 ft. in length inside box measurements. This cabinet should be so constructed that you have at least 3 inches of insulation all around. The doors will also have to be insulated and have rubber stripping around the outside edge so that they will fit tightly against the face of the box proper. The insulation would be of rock wool and comes in five cubic feet per bag.\n\nThe price of the condensing unit complete with a fin coil and drip trays, the necessary refrigeration controls and tubing, the electrical installation and refrigeration installation would be $412.50. The above price does not include the cost of the rock wool insulation or the necessary door hinges and door latches. The rock wool insulation would cost you a $1.85 per 5 cubic feet bag F.O.B. Calgary, and the door latch and hinges would be approximately $8.00 per set.\n\nIn respect to the walk-in cooler, I suggested to Mr. Charles Middleton that you would build an anti-room adjacent to the walk-in cooler where we could install a fin coil for cooling the beef before it is hung in the freezer proper. It will also be necessary to have at least 8 inches of rock wool insulation laid on the concrete floor, and wood floor laid on top of that. Also the wall of the refrigerator proper and anti-room will also have to be insulated with rock wool. We can again supply the necessary rock wool for this purpose at $1.85 per 5 cubic feet bag, F.O.B. Calgary. In estimating the equipment that would be required for this walk-in refrigerator, we have estimated that you would be freezing 200 pounds of beef per day, and having a total storage of 3000 pounds. Therefore, the walk-in refrigerator will require a 1 H.P. condensing unit, dole plate, controls, etc., and we could install same complete with the necessary electrical installation and refrigeration, and also the fin coil required, installed in the anti-room, for the sum of $1,372.00.\nThe equipment that would be used in most installations would be the Universal Cooler Company of Canada Condensing Units, and also the highest grade of controls and other equipment that are necessary for us to install and give you the best of service in refrigeration for your reach-in cabinet in the kitchen and walk-in cooler for storage.\n\nI would ask that you please give this your consideration and either notify Mr. John Woslyng of Cardston or ourselves of your decision in respect to the above equipment. Please be advised that we could install this equipment immediately, as we can give you delivery from our own stock and also another thought to keep in mind is that once our stock of equipment is sold from Calgary, any new equipment that we will have to bring from the factory will be a higher price as we now understand there has been an increase of 25% on all refrigeration equipment.\n\nHoping to receive a favourable reply, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nELECTRIC CRAFTS LIMITED\n\nSgd. \"J.

We have reviewed our file and we can not find any requisition that has been forwarded to us for payment.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nPP/HM.\nAugust 5, 1948.\n\nMr. R.D.

The erection of full basements will amount to $6,640. This brings preliminary work to a total amount of $13,440.00. Of this, only $12,000.00 is provided in our Estimates and we will have to seek transfers to the amount of $1,440.00. In addition, it would seem that other large expenditures must be made and that in all this project will cost approximately $30,000.00, (a figure much higher than that originally estimated). However, we have recommended to the Minister the acceptance of Mr. R. Weston's tender for the establishment of the basements. If you will note the final paragraph of my letter of June 17, I advised you that such approval would have to be obtained. If this approval is forthcoming, you will be sent an Army Signal, through Mr. Gooderham's office.\n\nI would also ask that you obtain firm tenders from\n\nCOPY SENT TO MR.

Mr. R. Weston has this basement practically completed and ready to receive the building which will be moved on to the foundation next week. We have gone ahead here, as the Contractor was available now and might not have been later, and also if we are to have these buildings ready for classes Sept. 1st we could not delay longer. Unless advised otherwise, Mr. Weston will be moving to the St. Mary's R.C. School site the 1st of August.\n\nWe shall itemize additional costs by schools, as follows:\n\nSt. Paul's School\n\n(a) Passageway or tunnel connecting the existing school building with the new block, 150' long and 8' wide. This to allow children to go from one building to other without necessity of going outside, to make place for steam and water pipes to new block, and to conserve heat.\n\nTotal Cost. $600.00\n\n(b) Sewer. Figured at 150' of 6\" pipe @ $150; $100.00 for digging and filling and $25.00 for connecting to existing septic tank.\n\nTotal Cost. $275.00\n\n(c) Tile drain under basement floor to drain and eliminate buckling and cracking of floor.\n\nTotal Cost. $100.00\n\n(d) Stairwells and doors\n\nTotal Cost. $150.00\n\n(e) Only ten windows were figured in original basement tender - it is now found that many more will be needed - 25 windows and frames @ $16.00 each complete $400.00\nElectrical Wiring $75.00\n\nAll necessary Stringers and pillars installed $250.00\n\nPainting of building (tender enclosed) $302.00\n\nHeating and plumbing. To include all necessary pipe, radiators, connections, etc., for steam heating of newblock from existing boilers and connecting and supplying of all necessary pipe etc. to toilets and sinks.\n\nEstimated outside cost $3500.00\n\nThe heating expert who gave me this figure also recommends that a stoker be installed at St. Paul's School to increase the capacity and to conserve fuel - this would be an additional $1500.00 or thereabouts.\n\nEstimated total for St. Paul's School........$5,652.00\n\nSt. Mary's School\n\n(a) Passageway $600.00\nSewer $150.00\nStairwells and Doors $150.00\nExtra Windows - 40 at $16.00 $640.00\nElectrical Wiring $100.00\nStringers and Pillars $500.00\nPainting (Tender attached) $647.00\nHeating and Plumbing $6000.00\n\nEstimated total for St. Mary's School $8,757.00\n\nOr Estimated additional total for both schools for all necessary work.......$14,500.00\n\nThis total is very large and was a shock to me as no doubt it will be to you, but, when it is considered that it gives us buildings with full basements which are light enough and big enough to be used for manual training or any other purpose, and that the same building to be constructed would cost probably twice as much, it seems like sound business.\n\nThe Contractors have told me that the work as enumerated above will have to be done on a cost plus basis - due to changing conditions etc., they cannot tender on it. They have assured me, however, that they believe they have considered every eventuality and the total given should be above the actual cost.\nIt also must be considered that the majority of this extra cost would have to be borne whether or not we had full basements as the sewage, heating, wiring, plumbing, etc., would have to be constructed anyhow.\n\nAs stated earlier, the full basement at the St. Paul's School is practically complete and ready to receive the building which will be moved on to it next week. It is hoped that authority can be given to complete all work as enumerated, and that we can have this all finished by September first.\n\nIt might be added that the Schools could probably get along without the painting and passageways, but we certainly would not recommend it; we believe all work as suggested is necessary.\n\n(R.D.

Regan)\nSuperintendent.\n\n(RDR/S)\nOttawa, August 5, 1948.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Water Supply and Pressure Tank\nSt. Paul's Indian Residential School\nCardston, Alberta\n\nReferring to the memorandum from Indian Affairs dated June 22nd, 1948, we have now received a report from Mr. Cornish dated July 16th, duplicate copies of which are attached herewith.\n\nYou will note that the pressure tank is being operated at a maximum pressure of 50 pounds per square inch, so inspection by the Alberta Boiler Inspector is not apparently obligatory. As a pressure of only 25 pounds per square inch is available on the top floor of the school, fire protection there will not be as satisfactory as might be obtained if a higher pressure were maintained in the tank and in the pipes. Before the installation of the pressure tank last year the elevated outside gravity tank only provided 15 pounds per square inch pressure on the top floor, so under present conditions fire protection has been improved throughout the building.\n\nIt would seem advisable, however, to replace the weak pipes and fittings in the school whenever an opportunity occurs to do so, so that a more satisfactory fire pressure could be maintained.\n\nMr. Cornish suggests that the urgent work required consists of the erection of a house for the pump at a cost of $100.00, to be heated by a radiator at present on hand at the school. This house for the pump would be temporary only, and has been suggested in order to provide a cover for the pump and wall if the more permanent construction of a concrete wall for the pressure tank and a larger pumphouse with extra garage space for two cars cannot be built this year at a cost of $300.00 plus $900.00 = $1400.00. If only $100.00 can be provided this year the more permanent work, costing $1400.00, could be included in next year's estimates.\n\nIf the temporary work only is to be done this year it would appear that the local representative of Indian Affairs could handle the work of building the small 8 x 8 pump shelter, and any necessary instructions could be obtained by mail from Mr. G.H. Cornish, Inspecting Engineer, Department of Mines and Resources, Banff, Alberta.\n\nWill you kindly advise what decision is reached by Indian Affairs in this matter.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6373, file 764-5, part 10)\nDivision\n\nLands and Development Services Branch.\n\nBanff, Alberta,\nJuly 16, 1948.\n\nRe: Pressure Tank,\nSt. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nFollowing the instructions of your letter of June 26th, an inspection was made of the above installation on July 6th, 1948.\n\nA sketch plan of the area containing the pressure tank and pump is attached. Also attached is a copy of an estimate received by Superintendent Ragan from a Cardston contractor quoting a price of $1286.00 for a building to house pressure tank and pump and also to provide garage space.\n\nThe pressure tank is buried under approximately three feet of earth cover and with the head some twelve feet outside the basement wall. The exact position of the tank was not ascertained. The change from the original intention of placing the head of the tank in the boiler room was explained in Mr. Snelson's memorandum of May 30th, 1947, from which I quote:\n\n\"The large tank was installed in the only location on the outside of the boiler room basement wall not occupied by coal bin, ash hoist or chimney foundations. In this location at a depth of six feet below ground surface, the 4\" pipeline from the pump to the outside tank was uncovered. This line crossed the trench at such an angle that it was necessary to place the end of the tank at a distance of twelve feet from the outside boiler room wall so that the bottom of the tank could be set at an elevation of eight feet below ground surface. It was not advisable to cut the 4\" pipe as it was at the time under pressure supplying water to the school.\"\n\nAt the time of my visit, the pressure tank was being operated at a pressure range between 40 and 50 p.s.i., the school authorities being doubtful of the strength of the old fixtures under higher pressure. Operation of the tank has been quite satisfactory since the air line was repaired. The present pressure range will only supply approximately 25 p.s.i., at the top floor of the school which is inadequate for fire streams.\n\nI was unable to see Boiler Inspector.............\n\nT.S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nI was unable to see Boiler Inspector Henry at Lethbridge but visited the Boiler Inspector's office at the Alberta Public Works in Calgary on July 9th. No one in that office could find any regulations governing the installation and inspection of pneumatic pressure tanks. However, I was informed that they usually inspected such tanks, with internal pressure exceeding 50 p.s.i., once every two years, and require access to outside and inside for inspection purposes. In order to obtain further information on this point, I visited the office of the Resident Architect, Dominion Public Works Department, and was unable to find any regulations covering installation of pneumatic pressure tanks. The Boiler Inspector for the Dominion Public Works is stationed in Victoria, B.C. I might add that I acquired a copy of the Alberta Rollers Act and Regulations and have perused them without finding any regulations re installation, access or inspection of such tanks.\n\nIt appears fairly evident that the existing installation transgresses no regulations if the upper range of operation is kept at 50 p.s.i., nor does it constitute a source of danger to the school population. However, it does not appear to be good practice to install a pressure tank without means of access for inspection and since we have to depend on Alberta Government inspection, a tank should be installed according to their requirements. Consequently I would recommend that the existing tank be placed in a concrete lined excavation and set on concrete trunnions to raise it above the floor.\n\nThe proper method of housing the tank would be to insert the head through the basement wall as originally planned and obtain access to the containing pit by way of the basement. It would be necessary to place a fairly heavy beam lintel over the opening cut out for the tank as a large window opening occurs above as shown on the sketch. Heating for the tank pit would hardly be necessary; if it proves necessary, steam and radiation are available. It is estimated that the tank housing as indicated by red lines on the sketch would cost approximately $600.00.\n\nUnder the circumstances there seems to be no great necessity for building this housing immediately, and if funds are short it could be estimated for from next year's appropriation. Any work in connection with the tank should be done during the summer vacation period.\n\nThere appears to be no need for the large garage building indicated in the contractor's drawings. No good purpose seems to be served by trying to combine this building with the tank housing. The large building would require demolition of the present work shop and probably necessitate its replacement later.\n\nIt is recommended that a building approximately 22' x 24' with a roof pitching from 8 feet to 6 feet be erected if funds are available. This would house the pump, provide storage for two cars, allow retention of the work shop and also prevent blocking light from the basement window. School authorities state that radiators are available and steam supply ample for heating the addition. It is estimated that a structure as indicated would cost approximately $800.00.\n\nIf the above funds are not...........................\nIf the above funds are not available, the essential item at this time is heated housing for the pump. A shelter 8 feet by 8 feet with a wood flooring and steam radiator would probably cost $100.00 but could not be used as part of a future garage building.\n\nThe contractor's bid for his suggested plan of garage etc., appears to be very reasonable, and he should be asked to bid on the revised plans.\n\nC.R. Cornish,\nInspecting Engineer.\nAugust 9, 1948.\n\nMr. R.D. Regan, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Cardston, Alta.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of May 28th we communicated with the Lands and Development Services Branch and we have today received a reply from them stating that Mr. Cornish has reported regarding a recent visit to the school. The memorandum that we have received reads in part as follows:\n\n\"You will note that the pressure tank is being operated at a maximum pressure of 50 pounds per square inch, so inspection by the Alberta Boiler Inspector is not apparently obligatory. As a pressure of only 25 pounds per square inch is available on the top floor of the school, fire protection there will not be as satisfactory as might be obtained if a higher pressure were maintained in the tank and in the pipes.

Kaughman, son of Andy Kaughman, deceased, and now in charge of the recent firm Kaughman & Sons, hereby agree to accept all terms and figures as set out below regarding the moving of Bldg. No. 38 and will contract to do the work at the price stated.\n\nRe: Moving R.C.A.F. Bldg. #38,\nMacleod to Cardston, Alta.\n\nL.W. KAUGHMAN\n\nAt your request my men and myself have inspected the above building with a view to moving it to the Blood Indian Reserve; we have also inspected the road over which it will have to be moved.\n\nWe will contract to move Building No. 38, now situated at Macleod, and set on your foundation at the Blood R.C. School, near Cardston, Alberta as follows:\n\nWe will move this building and place on your foundation and tie together; we will move the large hot water boiler that goes with the building and place where wanted; we will salvage all gas, water and sewer lines; we will cap all water and gas mains; we will move all cement piers to your site if needed; we will haul all debris from site and restore present site as called for by War Assets Corporation regulations; we will make arrangements with proper authorities re permission to move over roads; we will bulldoze necessary roads, where needed, at our expense and will guarantee a satisfactory job on the above for the total sum of thirty nine hundred dollars ($3,900.00).\n\nFor reference we would refer you to the Canadian Sugar Factories at Raymond or to Mr. Mark Mann of the P.F.R.A. for whom we have moved many buildings, with complete satisfaction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nKAUGHMAN & SONS,\nPer: Andy Kaughman\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.,\n9 September, 1948.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nReference your letter, file LOS-1-5 (E1) of June 25, with attached forms to be completed with regard to buildings purchased from Was Assets Corporation for use at the Blood and St. Paul's Indian Residential Schools.\n\nHerewith completed form regarding building No. 38 which was moved from Macleod to the R.C. Residential School, Cardston.\n\nThis completes the moving of these buildings and placing on foundations. The contractor, Mr. L.W. Kaughman, has done a wonderful job. Although he has been working on this for the last three months, paying a large crew, not to mention other expenses, he has yet to receive a dime from the Department.\n\nOn June 25th by voucher No.379 I asked for an advance to Mr. Kaughman of $2000.00; the Department's answer was that they did not believe this could legally be done. By my letter of July 20th I forwarded the countersigned contract and asked that if this would not allow the advance payment to Kaughman, to please advise what legal documents would be needed - to date we have had no reply. We have since, on the 25th August forwarded voucher No.477 in the amount of $2900.00 for the moving of building No.12 from Pearce, Alta.\n\nAs it is only fair that Mr. L.W. Kaughman have some payment for the very good work he has done, we hope that this payment can be made very soon. We will forward a voucher for moving building No.38 at once.\n\n(R.D.

You will recall that Mr. C.R. Cornish, Inspecting Engineer of Lands and Developments Branch inspected this. His memorandum was quoted in your letter, even file of August 9th. He states in this memorandum, that inspection is not absolutely obligatory; however, your letter of the 15th states that pressure tanks must be placed so that they can be inspected from all surfaces. We certainly do not want to go to this extra expense, if the Department feels that inspection is not necessary, and it would be appreciated if we could get a definite ruling on this.\n\nRegarding number 2, the building of a pump house and a separate building for car storage would entail more expense than the garage-pump house unit of which we forwarded plans. However, if the Department feels that because of the fire hazard, the two buildings should be constructed, we are certainly agreeable. The two car garage can be constructed at a very reasonable cost. It is the excavating and cementing in of the pressure tank which is costing the big money in this instance.\n\nThe only buildings that could be used for car storage at St. Paul's School, are sheds situated adjacent to the barns and the fire hazard here would be magnified many times. Separate heating units would have to be installed and I would not recommend this procedure. The Assistant Principal is leaving this School at the end of September, however, this will not alter the need of a two car garage as this School operates two cars.\nFinally, our recommendations are:\n\n(1) That if it is not necessary to excavate the pressure tank, that this be eliminated.\n\n(2) That the combination two-car garage and pump house be built to attach to the brick school building.\n\nWe believe this to be the most economical and satisfactory from the standpoint of usefulness. We do not believe the danger of fire would be great and could eliminate this even more by building a concrete block garage. However, we will await the Department's wishes and recommendations regarding all this.\n\n(R.D. Ragan)\nSuperintendent.\n\nRDR/S\n\nTo: G.H.

Regan,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nWe received your letter of August 24th with reference to the class room blocks at the St. Paul's and Blood Schools.\n\nIt is noted that you are unable to obtain firm tenders from local contractors for plumbing, heating, etc.\n\nIn view of the contents of official letter of September 8th, we will wait for a reply to that letter before making any final decision.\n\nIn connection with the second paragraph of your letter regarding the passageways, our understanding is that if we finally decide to heat these class room blocks with hot air furnaces, passageways will not be necessary for carrying steam pipes.\n\nIt is possible that we have not explained fully to you the reasons why we do not favour the passageways. The provision of separate class room blocks at residential schools is a new policy which we have just adopted and one of the primary reasons for the action is that we felt that if the class rooms were set apart from the main building, it would have a tendency to improve conditions at the residential schools where the class room blocks were provided, as the pupils would be leaving the main building for periods each day to go to the class rooms.\nIt might be inferred from your letter that the management of the schools consider it unnecessary work to have the children dress to go to a separate building. We feel that this is in the best interests of the pupils and the school management as well.\n\nIf we finally decide to heat these buildings by hot air, it is presumed it will not be necessary to purchase the stoker for the St. Paul's School.\n\nBernard F.

F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nOn Saturday morning I received a hurried letter from the Principal of the St. Paul's Residential School, Cardston, stating that the Indian Agent for that particular Reserve had received authority to erect a building covering an exposed electric water-pump. The cost of the shelter was to be no more than $100.00.\n\nI would like to point out that a perfectly good two-car garage was dismantled to allow for room to drill the new well. Also, a cheaply constructed building would be very hard to heat and there always would be danger of the pumping plant freezing up. Since March, when the garage (which also acted as a covering for the pump) was dismantled, dust, heat and rain have been responsible for unnecessary wear and tear to the motor brushes and belting, resulting in a very heavy bill for power to operate the plant.\n\nOn the above mentioned grounds, I would respectfully urge that a substantial building be erected to replace the former two-car garage.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nReference your letter of the 5th instant, file\n103-1-5 (E.l) regarding work done on the roof of the\nSt. Paul's Indian Residential School, Blood Reserve.\n\nArchdeacon S.H.

I bring this to your attention now because I had an interview with the plumbing and heating contractor, Calgary, who had been asked by the Cardston company to give a price on material and labor. He stated that since the wholesalers can give him no fixed price, and since labor is so uncertain, it is impossible to give a tender that is of any value unless it is unreasonably high to protect any eventualities.\n\nThis is mentioned now as Superintendent Regan should be given some leeway in securing such and allowed to get estimates from reliable sources.

In your letter of the 3rd instant you asked us to obtain firm tenders from local contractors for plumbing, heating, etc. In my letter of the 23rd July when I submitted estimated costs for the work at both schools, it was stated that due to the changing prices this work would have to be done on a cost plus basis; I have gone to the plumbing and heating contractors again and they tell me that it is impossible for them to give a firm tender. Costs given in my letter of the 23rd July, are outside costs as we have tried to anticipate everything and it is recommended that these be taken as a basis for contracting on a cost plus basis.\n\nI agree that the painting of these buildings will have to wait, but I do not believe it is wise to get along without the passageways. These passageways are the entrance for plumbing and heating pipes from the existing building and prices were figured on this method of heating. Besides this, however, this passageway is the only means of traffic from one building to the other without the necessity of the children putting on heavy clothing and tracking snow and mud into both buildings as they move from building to the other. It is certainly recommended that these passageways be included with the other necessary work.\n\nIn regard to the heating of these blocks, the Blood R.C. School already has a stoker installed, but the St. Paul's School has none. The heating contractor recommends that a stoker be supplied to the St. Paul's School, this would give both Schools a stoker for the increased capacity.\n\nMay we have your instructions regarding the obtaining of tenders on a cost plus basis and the passageways, please.\n\n(R.D.

It is understood that the garage is to act as a protective covering for the electric water pump as well.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent.\nMr. Weston's tender in the amount of $1,288.00, also attached sketch, sent to the Deputy Minister under cover of our memorandum of October 16, 1948.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA,\n\nRe: St. Paul's Residential School-Pump Building.\n\nI have your letters of the 25th August, file 103-1-5 (E), regarding refrigeration and the erection of a garage-pump building for the above school.\n\nI discussed this matter with the Principal of the School yesterday and he tells me that he has already wired Canon Cook that he would rather have the garage pump building this year than the refrigeration unit.\n\nTo be honest with you, this school is so run down and needs so many things that it is hard to decide what should be done first. The school certainly needs refrigeration but as the basement of our classroom block will provide an excellent Manual Training shop and release the cold storage building which is now being used for that purpose, it would probably be best to wait for refrigeration until next year. The question of procuring the proper equipment in these times of scarcity would also enter into this decision. Next year, I believe, the present Manual Training room could be restored and equipped to serve its original purpose of a refrigeration unit. Therefore, I am concurring in Canon Middleton's wish and recommend that the garage-pump building, at the cost of approximately $1400.00 be erected.\n\nAttached hereto is a rough plan and estimate drawn up by Mr. T.E. Weston, Contractor of Cardston, to build this combination garage and pump house. Mr. Weston agrees for the sum of $1288.00 to excavate the pressure tank, build a concrete basement around it and place the pressure tank on concrete footings. To build a two car garage and pump house 32 x 34, 2 x 4 studs and 2 x 6 rafters, concrete foundation and floor with shiplap sheathing and rubberoid roofing. This is the lowest tender on which Mr. Cornish of Banff based his estimate of $1400.00 added to the price of $1288.00 would be the heating of the building which would amount to another $200.00 at least.\n\nIf the Department concur in this, it is hoped that authority can be granted so that work can be started before freeze-up.\n\nAtt: RDR/S\n\n(R.D.

Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Heating Plant for Classroom Blocks, Residential Schools, Blood Indian Reserve.\n\nMr. R. W. Snyder of the firm, Snyder & Boon, Plumbing and Heating Contractors, Calgary, informed me today that he had been to Cardston when he was approached by the principals of the plumbing and heating business, which he formerly owned, in regard to the heating of these classroom blocks. It was their understanding that a definite tender for this work must be given.\n\nMr. Snyder stated that his successors were not capable of figuring on such a plant, and that he would be required to do so for them. In fact, he would send a qualified engineer to make plans, from which he could figure the costs. The plan of heating would be based on the assumption that the buildings were properly insulated and that the heating of them would be supplied from the existing boilers of the main buildings.\n\nHe stated further that an escape clause in the contract might be required, as there is always a possibility of unforeseen increases in freight rates and material costs.\n\nMr. Snyder stated that to prepare these plans and submit a contract was costly. Naturally this firm was anxious to get the business, but he felt that there should be some assurance that the work would not be lost.\n\nMr. Snyder is well acquainted with the buildings that have been moved from the Airports, as he installed the heating plants when they were erected. He stressed that the buildings should be inspected for insulation, and, if the insulation as originally put into them has been impoverished or is missing, it must be replaced or replenished, as it would be impossible to heat them from the residential school plants. He stated that it would be preferable to have a passage-way between the blocks and the main buildings. However, a compressing pump must be set up at each school to carry the steam or hot water to distant points.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Regan, the Superintendent. I hope you can give him instructions that he may proceed with confidence that the contract will finally be approved.\n\nG. H.

Ragan,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the St. Paul's Residential School.\n\nBefore considering Mr. Weston's tender, we would like to have the following information:\n\n(1) Why is it suggested that the pressure tank should be excavated and a concrete basement placed around it?\n\n(2) Have you considered the advisability of building a pump house and a separate building for car storage?\n\nWith reference to No. (2) above, we are inclined to feel that a separate building for the cars would be better than combining it with the pump house. There is always a certain danger of fire around a building where cars are stored and if such occurred in a combined building, it might effect the water installation.\n\nIt should be possible to construct a garage for two cars at a very reasonable cost. It has been intimated by some of our officials who have visited the school recently, that there are some vacant buildings that could easily be used for car storage without the necessity of building a new garage.\n\nWith the above in mind, we would appreciate it if you would reconsider the whole matter very carefully and let us hear from you again.\n\nBernard F.

Our Lands and Development Services Branch have carried out the necessary repairs and in so doing it was necessary to tear down the old building used as a garage for the car and truck which are the property of the school.\n\nIt is now necessary to erect a combination pump house and garage as a covering for the pump, the well, and the garage.\n\nThe report received from our Lands and Development Services Branch reads as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Cornish suggests that the urgent work required consists of the erection of a house for the pump at a cost of $100.00, to be heated by a radiator at present on hand at the school. This house for the pump would be temporary only, and has been suggested in order to provide a cover for the pump and well if the more permanent construction of a concrete well for the pressure tank and a larger pumphouse with extra garage space for two cars cannot be built this year at a cost of $600.00 plus $800.00 = $1,400.00. If only $100.00...\"\ncan be provided this year the more permanent work, costing $1,400.00 could be included in next year's estimates.\"\n\nOur Superintendent of Education, during his recent visit to this school, was advised that the Boiler Inspector for the Province has insisted that the pressure tank be raised from its present low position and that a concrete basement be erected under it.\n\nA tender has already been received from Mr. T.E. Weston of Cardston, Alberta, for this work in the amount of $1,288.00. Mr. Weston has previously done satisfactory work for the Department and the acceptance of his tender in this amount is recommended.\n\nActing Director.\nT. E.

The passageway has been completed in good weather and the building fastened together and patched with shingles where needed. We have been awaiting word from the Department regarding their wishes on the open east end of the building, as to the size of a coal bin which should be placed here, and whether or not this open frame building should be floored and made weather tight. This work should be done as soon as possible, in order to protect the inside of the building, and it is hoped that this work will not be included in the advertised tender, but that Mr. Ralph Weston can be given authority to proceed with this work at once, so that the building will be weather tight.\n\nIt is hoped that in the heating tender provisions are being made for the stripping and covering of the basement walls; we are also wondering what is to be done with regard to the electrical work.\n\n(R.D.

(RG 10, Volume 6373, file 764-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, November 1, 1948.\n\nRe: St. Paul's C.E. Indian Residential School, St. Mary's R.C. Indian Residential School, Blood Reserve, Alberta.\n\nYou are advised that as a result of a verbal request from the Indian Affairs Branch, supported by a memorandum from Major MacKay, dated October 23rd, which bears your notation of the 26th instant; our heating engineer carried out an inspection on the 24th, 25th and 26th instances, to determine the best means of heating the new classroom blocks in connection with the above schools.\n\nOne \"T\" shape R.C.A.F. Link Trainer Building was moved from a nearby camp and set up on a previously prepared concrete foundation at St. Paul's C.E. School for use as a classroom block, and a walking passage has been constructed to join the two buildings.\n\nOne \"H\" shape R.C.A.F. Link Trainer Building was moved from the camp and set up on a previously prepared concrete foundation at St. Mary's R.C. School for use as a classroom block, and a walking passage between the two buildings is now under construction. All this work is being carried out under the direction of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nFull size basements under each building have been completed and the design of the suitable heating system for each block in addition to the plumbing connections, is now being carried out by this Division.\n\nIt had been suggested by local authorities and the School Principals that a steam line from the residential school boiler plant in each school, be carried through the passage and connected to a heating system in the new classroom blocks. Upon investigating the boiler plants, it was found that there was no excess capacity in either plant to handle any additional load. The boiler plants in each of the above residential schools, are over 25 years old and it is estimated that they may continue to function for a period of approximately 5 to 10 years before replacement will be necessary.\n\nThe individual heating plants which originally served the R.C.A.F. blocks, are not suitable for re-use. They were designed to heat one floor only and with the addition of a full basement, their capacity is under that which is required. In addition, one boiler is fitted for gas firing and both units were designed for use with special hot blast heating equipment, including plenum chambers, fans, controls, etc., all of which, before assembly, would require extensive adjustments and would not be economically feasible or suitable for the present requirements. Some vital parts of this equipment were found to be missing.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIt is recommended that a separate forced hot water heating system be installed in each of the new classroom blocks; including square sectional cast iron hot water heating boilers, circulating pumps, radiation, piping and elementary controls. Such systems can be readily installed with the least amount of delay and expense.\n\nAt such time in the future when the residential school boiler plants are replaced, the new boilers can be selected with sufficient capacity to serve the residential school, the domestic hot water load for winter service, and the heating in the classroom blocks. The only change required in the classroom blocks, will be the addition of a steam fed convertor to replace the hot water heating boiler along with minor piping revisions in the boiler room. The hot water heating boiler can then be put to use in the residential schools to heat domestic hot water, as by that time, the present methods now inadequate, will be totally deficient.\n\nThe plumbing from each of the new blocks, will be connected into the existing services from the residential schools and full instructions were outlined to the general contractor on the job.\n\nActing on a verbal request from the Indian Affairs Branch which will be confirmed by a memorandum from Major MacKay, this Division is now preparing plans and specifications covering the heating and plumbing at both the above schools and when complete, they will be forwarded to the Indian Affairs Branch who have undertaken to award the contract and have the installations carried out under their direction.\n\nChief Engineer.\nRe: St. Paul's C.E. Indian Residential School,\nSt. Mary's R.C. Indian Residential School, Blood Reserve,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nWe are forwarding under separate cover four (4) sets of plans and specifications outlining the plumbing and heating systems for the new classroom blocks in connection with the above.\n\nIt is understood that your Branch will engage a contractor, and that the work will be carried out under the nominal supervision of Indian Superintendent Ragan, in which case it will not be necessary to transfer funds to this Division.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackey,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nRe: St. Paul's C.E., Indian Residential School,\nSt. Mary's R.C., Indian Residential School, Blood Reserve,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to Major MacKey's memorandum of November 1st, bearing your marginal notation of the 3rd instant, in connection with the above, you are advised that we are forwarding today to the Indian Affairs Branch, four (4) sets of plans and specifications for the two new classroom blocks at the above, covering the heating and plumbing requirements.\n\nIt is understood that the Indian Affairs Branch will procure tenders and have the work carried out under the supervision of one of their officers, and that no funds for this work will be transferred to this Division.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

Neary, Superintendent of Education.\n\nI have your letter of December 29th, file 764-5 (E) quoting a letter from Canon Cook of the M.S.C.C. regarding electrical service to the Anglican Church on the Blood Indian Reserve.\n\nThe electrical line to the Church at the St. Paul's School was in very bad shape, moving contractors took down some wire and no more than one or two posts; this could have been reconnected by the school engineer in less than half an hour.\n\nArchdeacon Middleton came to me in December requesting that this line be entirely rebuilt. He was told that we could not do this - if it was to be rebuilt to the Church, it was a Church responsibility. He was told that his Engineer would have to reconnect the wires - a simple job. I was then told that all the wire was missing - as were the posts - where they went to I do not know. It was then learned that posts alone would cost over $100.00, and wire and labor = approximately $150.00. I advised Archdeacon Middleton to get in touch with M.S.C.C. authorities as I considered it their responsibility.\n\nThe M.S.C.C. responded with a telegram to buy the posts - but this was only half the job - who was going to buy the wire and who was going to pay labor? As it was near Christmas, I instructed the Modern Home Electric to furnish wire and labor so that electricity might be available for the holidays, and this was done. I assured Archdeacon Middleton that if his authorities would not pay for the lighting of his Church, I would ask the Department to do so. The Modern Home Electric have been instructed to submit their account to Archdeacon Middleton.\n\n(R.D. Regan)\nSuperintendent.\n\ncc to: G.H.

When this Classroom Block was moved to the Reserve there was a lean-to on the building which housed the heating plant for the R.C.A.F.. This lean-to had no floor, and the original contract for the basement of this block did not take into account this lean-to. As this part of the building was certainly worth salvaging, and as we must have a place for fuel storage, we deemed it best to complete the foundation under this lean-to, put in joists and floor it.\n\nThis we have done and the attached voucher is in payment of the cementing work and flooring of the lean-to.

When Mr. Weston completed this work, the question was raised of joining the new classroom blocks with the main building, preparatory to the installation of the heating units required.

There, they have been set up on cement foundations and will provide satisfactory classroom accommodation.\n\nPast experience convinced us that care must be taken with regard to the installation of heating in such units. Therefore, the Lands and Development Services Branch was requested to send a heating engineer to thoroughly survey the situation at both schools. He has now returned and has prepared the necessary specifications for the plumbing, drainage and forced circulated hot water heating systems in both these classroom blocks.\n\nIt is my recommendation that we now advertise for tenders for the installation of these systems. Therefore, I have had prepared the following documents:-\n\n(1) Advertisement forms.\n(2) General instructions to tenderers.\n(3) Tender forms.\n\nI am attaching a requisition for the Departmental Purchasing Agent's action in having these advertisements published in the newspapers as shown: Both Mr. Regional Supervisor Goderich and Mr. Beck of the Lands and Development Services Branch have examined and passed these documents.\n\nActing Director.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cook\nSuperintendent\nMarch 10th, 1949\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nOn 15th October, 1947, we submitted to you a list of requirements at the above school for inclusion in your 1948-49 Estimates and this list contained, among others, an estimate of $1,803.10 for labour and materials for interior painting. In your letter 103-1-5 (W.T.L) of 23rd October, 1947, you advised us that this would be given careful consideration when your estimates for the fiscal year 1948-49 were being prepared.\n\nIn the anticipation that the above service would be carried out during the fiscal year 1948-49, we advised you on 28th August, 1948 (acknowledged by your 103-1-5 (E.1) of 21st September, 1948, that only $125.00 need be provided for interior painting in your 1949-50 estimates.\n\nThe Principal reports that nothing has been done in the matter of this interior painting and in describing the interior of the building he writes that \"never since the School was built in 1924 has it been in such a poor state and run down condition. Every room presents a beggarly appearance.\"\n\nIt is understood that a contractor in Cardston submitted a tender for this interior painting to your Mr. Ragan early last summer.\n\nIt is appreciated that you have expended a considerable amount at this School during the current fiscal year on new roof, etc. (and in this connection it is pointed out that the old leaky roof contributed largely to the damage to the interior decoration) but as rooms badly in need of decoration are unattractive and depressing from the standpoint of staff, pupils and the public who may visit the school, it seems most desirable that the interior painting required be carried out as early as possible.\n\nWill you please advise me what you plan on doing in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA.\n\nReference your letter of January 25th, file 764-6(E) regarding the school well at the St. Paul's Residential School, Blood Reserve.\n\nNew pipe has been placed in this well and two new well rods also installed by Mr. Maughan, Well Driller of Lethbridge, Alta. Attached hereto are Vouchers No. 148 in the amount of $235.72, in payment of the well pipe, and Voucher No. 149 in the amount of $9.38 for freight on this pipe. If the Department are agreeable, I have agreed with Mr. Maughan, to exchange the old pipe taken from the well, for his labour in pulling the well and installing the new pipe; he also has supplied two lengths of well rod.\n\nIf this exchange is authorized, the attached Vouchers are the only ones it will be necessary to submit against this well.\n\n(R.D.

As a consequence, special protection regarding the covering of the unit etc. were employed.\n\nTo avoid danger of this pump freezing in the future, I have conferred with the contractor and we have agreed that the pumping unit should be closed off from the rest of the garage by a partition, the walls of which should be insulated. This small room should definitely be heated and all danger of frost eliminated.\n\nMr. T. Weston has given me his estimate to complete this work, which is attached, and which amounts to $108.17.

We have moved two Air Force buildings from nearby camps and have them now set up on full basement foundations at these schools. These buildings were former Link Trainer units and are already fitted up with classrooms. They will provide ideal classroom blocks at these two schools.\n\nBy converting the present classrooms into extra dormitories and by using the new classroom blocks, we will be able to provide accommodation for many more children at each of these schools. At present we are not providing any additional facilities whatsoever for over 100 children on this reserve.\n\nOur Superintendent of Education found on his recent visit that the only serious problem now remaining before these classroom blocks can be opened is that of heating them. Our Regional Supervisor for Alberta and the local Indian Superintendent both made strong representations that a heating engineer should recommend the best way in which these buildings can be heated, in view of the magnitude of the tenders which will probably be involved.\n\nOur field officials are agreed that the calling in of local heating contractors would not have solved the problem.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6373, file 764-5, part 10)\nas each one would have presented his own ideas on the solution of the problem. Only the visit of a heating engineer will provide a sound and satisfactory solution.

If the item is allowed, there is no reason why building operations can not be commenced early this coming season; and, in view of these facts, I question the advisability of farming operations on any site not intended as the school farm.\n\nIf church officials and department representatives determine the site for the new buildings by the end of April, do you not think it better to prepare the land and, perhaps, put in a crop on the new farm. I realize that you might reap a smaller harvest; but your energies would be spent on fields that you would use in the future. You will arrange to have a tentative plan, or a rough sketch, of the proposed building prepared and directed to you for suggestions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. S.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy-minister Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nIn view of the contemplated erection of a new C. of E. School on the Blood Reserve this summer, the thought has occurred to me, that it would be advisable to make preparations for farming operations this spring. With this idea in mind, I approached Mr. Faunt (Ind. Agent) and asked if he had any available land on the Reserve which would answer the purpose of providing a crop this year.\n\nHe informed me that such a tract of land was available, but advised that I communicate with you hence this request. The land spoken of is between Farm 4 and the greater Production. Should the new school not materialise, then of course the matter would be held in abeyance. But if a new school is erected, then we would need feed, roots, grain etc., with which to supply the new institution.\n\nThe land would naturally revert to the Department when the school farm is once established. We would also be prepared to pay for the improvements on the land, such as the summer fallow of last year.\n\nThanking you in anticipation.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nToronto, Ontario, Feb. 5th 1923,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the possibility of a new school being erected for our Church on the Blood Reserve this year, it is a matter of great and urgent importance that the most suitable site available should be procured.\n\nDuring the early part of January of this year, I motored with Mr. Middleton, the Principal of the School, and Mr. Faunt, the Indian Agent, over the southern part of the Reserve, and examined two sites at the extreme south end. As all the Blood Indians, with the exception of a few families, are now living on the southern half of the Reserve, it seems to me that the new school should be located somewhere in that area, and in order that farming operations may be begun in the Spring, it is important that the site should be fixed at as early a date as possible.\n\nSo far as I myself have considered the question of sites, I am of the opinion that the most suitable place for the school would be about from two to three miles southwest of Cardston. Should you, however, consider it advisable for a representative of your Department to co-operate with a representative of our Society in the matter of locating the best site, I shall gladly make arrangements in this respect upon receipt of a further communication from you.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary & Acting General Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/FEC.\nOttawa, Feb. 10, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nYour letter of the 5th instant, with reference to a site for the new Blood C. of E. Indian Residential School, has been brought to my attention. I am seized with the importance of an early decision in this connection, and I have directed Mr. Indian Agent Faunt, under date of the 5th instant, to pave the way by securing a resolution from the members of the Band, offering to the Department a block of land of at least 320 acres. I informed him that church representatives and department officials would determine the location at a later date.\n\nSection 11 of our Act permits of an expropriation of reserve lands for school purposes; but I am desirous of having an offer from the Band. If the Department does not hear from our representative within a reasonable time, I will direct a second communication, urging despatch in this effort to secure a resolution.\n\nThe site should be chosen by the Rev.

Residential School, and would ask you to make a recommendation with reference to this site after consulting with Rev. Dr. Westgate and Indian Agent Faunt.\n\nI have noted your recommendation that the selecting of the site be postponed until such time as the snow has disappeared.\n\nWhen we have definitely decided on a location, instructions will be sent you with reference to the well drilling operations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina - SASK.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, No. 103-1-9, informing me that Mr. Agent Faunt, at your request, has secured a resolution of the Indian Band, offering a block of 640 acres, or more, for a farm and site for the new Blood Church of England Boarding School, and requesting me to make arrangements with Mr. Westgate, of Winnipeg, to visit the reserve and select the farm.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your instructions will be carried out, but in view of the fact that the ground is at present covered with snow, it would be very risky indeed to select a farm now owing to the impossibility of ascertaining the nature of the land. I think, therefore, that the visit of Mr. Westgate and myself to the reserve should be deferred for a month by which time the snow will probably have disappeared, and the weather will also be more suitable for travelling.\n\nI have to advise that I recently received a communication from Mr. Westgate in regard to this matter, to which I replied that I had not heard further from you in regard to it. He also called on me here on his way West prior to the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo above referred to. I trust that he has not already made up his mind as to where the/\n\nDuncan G.

I may add that it will be advisable to choose two sites in each case for the school and Agency Headquarters so that if water is not found on those first chosen, we can have drilling operations put underway without loss of time on the other locations selected.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

I shall try near the town of Carleton where I believe there will be a way for the Indians to come to the nearest bus stop at the same time. I have in mind a site about half a mile from town. I doubt whether it will be any closer. With regard to the school I think it would be a good thing to have the school within a mile or so of the town so we do not want to see too much building to take up too much of their land. So what will the children of the school if it were built near the town. However, I will wire you from Carleton after I have chosen the site and will expect to complete an estimate book to have the building started within a month. As a matter of fact I have written to the Board today for him to look as well as locate so that no time will be lost in any case when it comes to water.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Affairs.

Faunt is now the agent.\n\nI met Mr. Faunt and the Rev. Middleton, on the ground, and they pointed out the proposed site and the spring from which it is proposed to get a water supply. The school site is on the SW corner of the NW\u00bc sec. 24-3-16-4, and the spring is on the SE\u00bc of sec. 23-3-16-4, as shown on accompanying sketch.\n\nThe flow of the spring at date of inspection was at the rate of 1,400 gallons per day (24 hours), and it might be much less during a dry summer. This is the only nearby spring on the reserve. The spring is in a small creek bed and 100 feet below the spring the creek bed was dry.\n\nI was informed that there might be sixty (60) head of stock at the school therefore the requirements for this alone, at 10 gallons per head, would be 1,200 gallons per day, leaving only 200 gallons for all other requirements.\n\nThe supply from the spring is altogether inadequate and would afford no protection in the case of fire.\n\nAt the date of inspection there was no flow in Bullhorn or Layton creeks.\n\nThe farms on the reserve that are not near the Belly or St. Mary rivers, obtain their water supply from wells.\n\nThe well for farm No. 3 is on the SE corner of sec. 31-3-15-4, 1\u00bd miles north and two miles east of the proposed school site. This well is 180 feet deep and has a 6\" casing. In order to get 1,400 gallons here the pump would have to operate 24 hours. This water tastes badly of alkali.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Esq., D.C.L.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nSeveral Indians came to see me a few days ago, about a Memorial which had been presented to them on the reserve, with the request that they affix their signatures to the Petition. They went on to explain that the Memorial was asking that the agency be not moved pending a visit of Hon. G. Stewart, and that the proposed new C. of E. school be not built on the site chosen, but at a point some 14 miles north of the present hospital, far removed from the haunts of the Indians. (As a matter of fact there is not an Indian residing within ten miles of this location.) They refused to sign the Petition.\n\nPersonally I did not see the Memorial, but am led to believe, such was forwarded to the Department for consideration.\n\nLet me say by way of explanation, that the Petition (if received) was signed wholly by Romanists, and they as an aggregation, resent very strongly our admittance to the Reserve as a permanent Institution.\n\nThe Old Boys of St. Paul's immediately called a meeting and the attached resolution dealing with the question was carried unanimously.\n\nI was pleased to see the Well Boring machine commencing operations at the proposed Agency site this afternoon. If successful they are to move to the new school site during the coming week.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nSince writing you on Nov. 21st, we have made all arrangements possible under existing circumstances, for commencing the work and are now anxiously waiting for instructions that will warrant us in moving men, equipment and materials to the site.\n\nAs partly explained in our letters of Nov. 17th and 21st, our tender for the Cardston School was given special consideration and a corresponding saving in cost, resultant on our just concluding an almost exactly similar contract near Edmonton. This made for economical handling of plant and all of the work generally.\n\nOur work at Edmonton is so nearly completed, that we wish to make arrangements for removal of plant and surplus materials. We expect our representatives will be leaving there by Dec. 20th at the latest, possibly earlier. All items of work will be complete and we would like to ship our plant to Cardston before they leave, otherwise, other special arrangements of a more expensive nature will be necessary, before it can be loaded.\n\nIs it possible for site to be decided on, so that our materials may be shipped. Assuming that we load it next week, arrangements for its arrival at Cardston about the 20th inst. could be made and if the present mild weather holds, the excavation at least could be done in readiness for an early resumption of work in 1924.\n\nSeveral of the quotations given us were based on preparing materials during November and December, and before next spring. We ourselves, expected to buy and have shipped before January 1st, all the materials except finish flooring.\nand plaster. We made these arrangements in order to escape the increased sales tax which becomes effective January 1st.\n\nAnother feature in favor of commencing the work at once is, that it is a step in the right direction towards solving the unemployment problem of the prairie provinces. It seems very public news that contract has been awarded us and we are constantly receiving applications for work.\n\nWe have in the past, gone considerably out of our way to try and provide winter work for some of our men and to prevent as far as possible, the exodus of our best Canadian mechanics to the United States. Our work generally, this year, was finished early and some of our best men have already gone South.\n\nTo date, we have not received any intimations of a withdrawal of price, but some of the firms with whom we expect to deal, are getting uneasy about losing what they thought would be a help during the slackness of the winter.\n\nWe are not putting these features before you in any fear that we would be unfairly dealt with in adjusting any disadvantages that may arise through delay in starting work, but merely wish to bring to your notice, how much it would be appreciated if the final word to go ahead can be given without further loss of time.\n\nAs stated in a former letter, we will gladly assist in any way we can toward choosing a site, if it has not been decided on by the time you receive this letter. In any case, we would like to have word from you by wire if possible, when we can go ahead with the placing of orders and the movement of plant from Edmonton to Cardston, and so avoid the building up of another organization instead of using the existing one at Edmonton, as planned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\nE. Clayton\nPresident.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-9, part 1)\nDec. 11, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Peunt:\n\nWith further reference to the site for the new St. Paul's School it is the Minister's wish that we endeavour to secure a new site for this building farther away from the town of Cardston than either of the two sites already considered, but as near as possible to the railway, in order to facilitate the handling of building materials and also supplies such as coal, etc., for the school after same is built.\n\nI am sending you herewith a plan on which I have marked in red the locality in which the Minister would like to locate the school, providing a suitable site is obtainable, also an adequate supply of water and proper drainage facilities. I would ask you to consult with Mr. Gardner Smith and the Reverend Principal and that the three of you visit this section of the reserve and make a recommendation to me at the earliest possible date for a site for the building. When selecting the site consideration should be given to a location on the railroad where a siding could be built for the school.\n\nPlease return the plan I am sending you with the site you select marked on and a full report regarding same. This report should mention the distance from the main road, railroad, river, etc. Please give this matter your immediate attention, as I wish to give instructions to Claydon Company to proceed with the erection of this building at the earliest possible date.

Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Chief General\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI wired you today, stating that the drilling on the new site for St. Paul's School had reached a depth of 250', and that we appeared to have missed the main water vein; and were starting a 2nd well 100' to one side of the 1st hole. The last 150' was in a shale formation, with no indication of water. Only a weak water vein had been struck, giving about 300 gals. per day; this vein was reached at a depth of about 125 ft.\n\nThe well driller is a man who has drilled wells for the past 12 years and appears very competent in this line of work. He expressed the opinion that it would be useless to drill deeper in the shale formation, and advised us to drill a 2nd well to one side of the 1st hole, where he thinks we will have a fair chance of striking a stronger flow at the level of the weak vein encountered at the 125 ft. level.\n\nThe Indian Agent Mr. Faunt, and the Rev. Principal Mr. Middleton came here today at my request, and we all conferred most earnestly on the situation. We decided to act on the driller's advice and try the 2nd well, as stated. By working...\na day and night shift we hope to reach the water level within the next few days. It is not the intention to drill deeply into the shale again.\n\nI need scarcely say how deeply disappointed we all are over our first failure to get water\u2014especially as the locality gave promise of the opposite result. However, we can only persevere until we succeed in tapping the water supply which we feel certain underlies the locality. The site is such a pre-eminently fine one from every standpoint that we feel it would be almost a crime to abandon it unless we find it impossible to secure an ample water supply. Realizing the urgency of the case, we will push the drilling ahead, working day and night.\n\nThe driller will draw the casing from the 1st well, and use it again.\n\nThe Mayor & Council of Gadsdon have officially informed me that, in the event of our being unable to obtain sufficient water by drilling, they will be pleased to furnish water from their town mains. I thanked them for the kind offer, on behalf of the Indian Department, and told them it would be borne in mind. This would mean a long expensive extension, and otherwise not so desirable as having our own independent system.\n\nI am leaving for Gleichen in the morning but will keep in close touch with the drilling by phone. I hope to have better news for you very soon. Our weather continues remarkably fine & mild.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Gardner Smith\n\nIndian Affairs.

It may be a little while before we can decide on the exact site. Matter under consideration now.\"\n\nThe news contained in this telegram, which was very pleasing, together with the fact that our deposit cheque has been cashed by the Government, warrants us in believing contract will be awarded to us and encourages us to organize for carrying out the work.\n\nWe will make such a disposal of our equipment and supplies at Edmonton, as will fit the work at Cardston and make all the preparations we can, short of an actual start at work.\n\nOur intention when putting in tender and we accordingly figured to that end, was to get sufficient work done this fall, so that if the weather conditions led to closing down the work for a time, we would be ready as a first start early in 1924, to commence with brick-work. This we think, will be the most economical way of handling it from a contractors side and we trust the decision with regard to site, will be made in time to enable this programme to be carried out. If we can be of any assistance with regard to the matter of site, we would be glad to have a representative discuss it with an official of your Department and to go over the location with him, if necessary.\nWhile the matter is standing in abeyance and there is no work going forward, our deposit cheque is somewhat of a frozen credit. It would be appreciated, while this condition lasts, if the payments on the Edmonton work could be made as promptly as possible and in this connection, we would be very pleased to receive payment of our progress statement No.11 by return mail.\n\nAssuring you of our best attention to all work submitted to our care and again thanking you for your telegram, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\nPresident\n\nEC/A.\nCARDSTON, ALTA, NOV 22ND. 23.\n\nDEPT.

Scott,\nDeputy Sup't General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nAt my special request, Mr. Guerney Orr, the Department's Architect, accompanied me to the Blood Reserve on the 29th inst., with reference to the proposed site of St. Paul's School. I felt that the site selected might not be the very best available for the placing of such an important and beautiful building. I will not take time now to dwell on what appeared to be the disadvantages of the site selected; Mr. Orr can give the reasons better than I can.\n\nMr. Faunt showed us two other suggested sites. The first one of the alternatives he showed us lacked sufficient fall for drainage. The second site shown us seemed in every way suitable, and a change to this site was concurred in by the Rev. Principal Mr. Middleton, and by Mr. Faunt. Realizing the seriousness of changing a site, after calling for tenders, we only took this step after most careful deliberation, and subject, of course, to your approval. Mr. Orr wired asking your permission to change the site, and I am advised that you have agreed to the change, subject to the finding of a good supply of water.\n\nMr. Faunt left to get the well-drillers to return and sink the required well on the newly approved school site, and I have promised to return to Cardston on Monday, the 5th inst., and do all possible to push this work ahead rapidly. It is expected that water will be got readily. I will wire you at once on reaching a good water supply; and will write again on my return to Cardston on the 5th.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nIndian Office.\nGleichen, Alta. Nov. 9th, 1923.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Sup't General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Site of St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nUpon returning to Gleichen today I found the following telegram awaiting me:\n\nOttawa, Nov. 7th, 1923\n\nE. Gardner Smith,\nGleichen.\nReference your letter 3rd as Mr. Orr will not return to Ottawa before end of month please advise me fully as to objections to site originally chosen for Blood school and reasons for preferring site now recommended.\n\n(Signed) D.C. Scott.\n\nPerhaps I should have given the reasons for advising the change of site in my letter of the 3rd inst. and my only reason for not doing so was because I thought that, as my superior officer, the report would more properly come from Mr. Orr.\n\nWhen first shown the site that had been selected for the School I noted that the ground fell away in two directions. This would entail considerable filling in, and additional concrete. The location was on the edge of a series of hills to the West, which largely obstructed the view of the mountains. There might also be a seepage from melting snow, or heavy rains, coming from the higher levels to the West. To the South of the site the surrounding land is very rough and broken with shallow coulees, which would make the approach to the School difficult with loads, and almost impassable in the Springtime, owing to the spongy nature of a considerable portion of the land that would have to be travelled over before a main roadway could be reached.\n\nThe site had the disadvantage of being from one to two miles from a well-travelled highway, and, I should judge, about four miles from the railway station and town. Economically,\nThis would be a considerable handicap in the hauling of fuel and supplies, and subsequently in the marketing of the products of the School farm.\n\nAnother objection to the site, - a sentimental one, if you like, - was the consideration that, in putting the School there, we would be practically burying it. It would be invisible from the line of railway, and would be scarcely noticeable from the trunk roadways. In providing this important and beautiful building for the education and training of the Indian children, I do not think it was the intention to place it practically out of sight of the travelling public. Rather, should it not be placed so that all who pass through the district may see the outward and visible evidence of what the Canadian Government is doing for its Indian wards?\n\nWhen Mr. Orr visited the site I said but very little to him, as I wanted him to form his own impressions. This he very quickly did, with the result that he wired for authority to have the site changed. Before doing this, however, we fully consulted with Rev. Mr. Middleton, and Mr. Faunt. We desired that any step taken should be completely unanimous. Mr. Middleton was quick to see the objections to the site when they were pointed out to him, and concurred in the decision arrived at. Mr. Faunt said that he had already been of the opinion that a more suitable site could readily be found.\n\nMr. Faunt then showed us an alternative site he had in mind, about one mile N.E. of Cardston on the main highway to Lethbridge. The same amount of land was available there as had been voted for the use of the School at the first site. No other buildings are in the locality, and the School will be entirely free from encroachment of any kind. Mr. Faunt reports the soil to be fully as good as at the first site, and local opinion confirms this. The building will face directly on the main highway, and distant about 250 yards from same. It will be in full view of passing trains about half a mile away. The building will be placed in the centre of a very slight knoll, with a gentle fall away in all directions. There will be plenty of room at the rear of the school for the barn and other outbuildings which may be needed. I have surveyed the site with an instrument, with special attention to drainage facilities and sewage disposal. The School will face S.E.by S. - almost due South. Mr. Orr planted a stake to mark the North East corner of the School, which I have taken as my datum in laying out the site. From this stake we have a fall of 15 feet to a small dried-up lake bed, which will be the final outlet for the sewer, at a distance of 450 feet from the School. The sewage will pass through a septic tank and filter bed before being discharged in the lake bed, and should then be practically clear water. I will be pleased\nto prepare and submit plans for sewage disposal, to meet the local conditions.\n\nThe view from the new site is superb, and beyond my power to adequately describe. There is an uninterrupted view of the Rocky Mountains, with their towering peaks piercing the sky. Chief Mountain, the largest of them all, seems to stand as a great sentinel in its majesty and grandeur. Such a view should tend to develop poets and philosophers among those privileged to gaze on this stupendous handiwork of Nature, the outcome of her birth-throes in the formation of our world.\n\nThe drilling for water on the new site is now going on, as advised in my letter written from Cardston. I have asked the driller to send me a wire as soon as water is reached. I will then return, and set up an engine and pump, and give the well a good test before reporting the water supply as assured. When satisfied on this point I will promptly send you a telegram. I am hopeful of being able to send you this message by about the 15th inst.\n\nFrom a contractor's standpoint, the new site will be very advantageous. The cost of sand and gravel will be cut in two, and a very considerable saving effected in the haulage of all the materials. The successful tenderer should make some reduction in consequence of the lessened haulage charges as compared with the cost of haulage to the further site on which the tenders were based. If so instructed, I might negotiate with the successful tenderer in this respect at the time the contract is being let, in the interests of the Department.\n\nTrusting that the foregoing information may be considered satisfactory reasons for advising the changing of the School site,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nH.\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\n\nREGINA, SASK., November 5, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to confirm the following Night\n\nLetter -\n\n\"I exceedingly regret that a change of site at Blood Reserve has been decided upon. A great mistake has been made in deciding to build so near town of Cardston. Cannot imagine what objection could be raised to site decided upon by Doctor Westgate and myself.\"\n\nThis telegram was sent in reply to your letter of the 2nd instant and it is hard for me to understand what objection Mr. Orr could find to the site selected for the school, surely it has nothing to do with the situation of the land and Mr. Orr's opinion is not to be put up against mine in this respect. Water no doubt could be obtained as easily on the site selected by Doctor Westgate and as it could on the site selected by Mr. Orr.\n\nMy main objection is that no school should be situated within a mile of town. It means that the staff go to town more frequently than they should. It also means, and I consider this a more serious objection, that every Indian who goes to see his children at the school will go to town. Another objection to the school being so close to town is that people will visit it all hours and at all times which is not in the interest of the work.\n\nI am a little disappointed that I was not consulted before this change was made. I certainly\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nthink my opinion on matters of this kind should be before Mr. Orr's. I do not know the Mr. Smith you refer to. I presume however he is the Smith from the Blackfoot Reserve and he knows nothing at all of the land or the advantages of having a school three miles from a town.\n\nI hope Mr. Smith has not been engaged to carry on the work of supervising these buildings. If he has it means prolonging the work and adding extras as he succeeded in doing very successfully on the Blackfoot Reserve in connection with the work he had charge of. I would not call him a practical man, he may know something of building but he does not know much of finance or cost.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nAs it is highly important for our Society that at least 100 acres of the land to be attached to the new Blood School should be broken this Fall in order that it may be ready for seeding in the Spring, I shall be deeply obliged if you will take the necessary steps to have this done. From my letters of June 23 and 28 and your reply of July 9, No. 103-1-9 you will see that the delay in accomplishing this in the past was due to some uncertainty as to the water supply for the new School but as this uncertainty has since been removed I earnestly hope that the authorization for the breaking may now be given. As our Society has already engaged a graduate of the Ontario Agricultural College at Guelph to be the Farm Instructor on the staff at the new Blood School I feel confident that that Department of the School's activities will be managed with satisfaction to all concerned.\n\nShould it be found, and I am inclined to think it may be, that it is now too late to have 100 acres broken I should like to request that 100 acres of the block of land which lies on the East side of the School site and extending to the Cardston road, now held by lease but which I am informed is about to be cancelled, be Fall ploughed and placed at the disposal of the School for one year in order that farming operations may not be suspended in connection with this Institution for any longer than can possibly be helped.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.B.R.

Dec.16th, 1923.\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Sup't General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Site St.Paul's Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., with accompanying plan on the above subject, and have very carefully noted the instructions contained therein.\n\nI immediately communicated with the Reverend Principal, Mr. Middleton, and with the Building Inspector, Mr. Gardner Smith, and the three of us spent part of yesterday and all day today going over the ground. We explored the entire area indicated by the curved red line on the plan, keeping particularly in mind the special features mentioned in your letter, viz., nearness to railway where a siding might be put in, distance from a main road, distance from the river, distance from Agency buildings, drainage facilities, and water supply.\n\nWe were unable to find a suitable site within the marked area. Starting at the South end of said area the land was generally low lying, and would be very wet and boggy during the Spring months. As we travelled farther North we came to better land, but there did not seem to be any really good sites, the country there being generally level without any suitable outlet for drainage. Also we were getting farther and farther from the railway. At the North end of the marked area the land became rougher in which locality the drifting snow makes deep snow-fields. We would be then far from the main roads and cut off from railway facilities. To get to the nearest railway station it would be necessary to travel over heavy hills and ford the St.Mary's river to Riley, a distance of four or five miles.\n\nHaving failed to find a site within the suggested area that we could conscientiously recommend for your approval, we proceeded South of the marked area. Here we met with better land again, and, at the point indicated on the plan, we came upon a site which seemed to meet with all the required conditions. Here we have hundreds of acres of excellent black loam soil gently sloping South Easterly towards the river. The school could be placed about 300 yds. from the edge of this table land where there is a moderate drop of about 50 feet to a meadow-like depression below. At the head of this natural meadow is a running spring which would provide water for stock the year round. The drainage conditions for the school could scarcely be better.\n\nThe school building, if erected on this site, would command a magnificent view of the mountains and of the river. It would be plainly in view of passing trains half a mile away, and would be distinctly seen from the main trunk road one and one half miles distant. There is also a good existing trail from the proposed site to the main highway. Thus possessing the advantages of easy accessibility, the school, if placed here, would be peculiarly well secluded and entirely apart by itself, and would, I believe, fully meet with the honourable Minister's approval in this respect. It would be distant by road from Cardston less than five miles, and from the Agency buildings about three miles. There is a suitable place on the railway line for a siding half a mile away. This would be of untold advantage to the school, and would also prove advantageous for the Agency. The building could be best placed to face due South. This would give it the exposure desired by the Architect. The approach to the school would be a gentle ascent, and the conditions would be favourable for the planting of trees and the beautifying of the grounds.\n\nI might mention, Sir, that in expressing the foregoing views and recommendations I am in full accord and harmony with the Rev. Mr. Middleton and Mr. Gardner Smith, and the views herein expressed may therefore be deemed to be the unanimous conclusions of the three of us, respectfully submitted after carefully noting your valued letter of instructions.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-9, part 1)\nI considered it advisable to let you know at once of our selection of the site, and to ask authority to commence drilling for water,\u2014hence our joint lettergram sent this evening.\n\nOur weather continues wonderfully mild. There is no snow, and no frost in the ground. The excavating for the building might yet be accomplished before freeze-up.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent\nIndian Office.\nGleichen, Alta.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe-St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your lettergram as follows:\n\nOttawa, Ont. 20th Dec.\n\nE. Gardner Smith, Gleichen.\nWith reference to railway siding for Blood School please consult with railway officials in Calgary and advise me if arrangements can be made to have siding built as soon as site has been approved. (Sgd) Duncan C. Scott.\n\nI will return to Calgary to-night (Saturday) and will call on the C.P.R. officials on Monday, as instructed, and will report to you promptly as to the result of the interview. I have taken notes as to the exact distance of the suggested location of the siding from the nearest numbered mile-post on the railway, so I can indicate exactly where we would like the siding in the event of the supply of water being assured, and the site officially approved.\n\nImmediately upon receiving your telegraphed authority to start drilling for water on the new location for the school, I got hold of the well-driller, and saw his derrick set up ready to start drilling on the morning of the 21st inst. He has agreed to work long hours, including Christmas day, so we hope soon to know what Fate has in store for us in this vital respect.\n\nThere is not much to add to what was said in the Report sent to you on the 18th inst. If we succeed in getting an ample supply of water on this suggested new site, then I think we will have a happy issue out of all our difficulties. The Reverend Principal is much enthused over the new location, and appreciates the advantages that will follow having a railway siding at the edge of the school farm, and within half a mile of the proposed school site. The Indian Agent is equally well pleased with the location, and states that it will fit in well with the farming developments he has in view. It\nwill be within easy reach of the Agency administration. From the standpoint of building construction the site is very favourable. The drainage conditions are excellent. I feel certain that had the Department's Architect seen this site it would have met with his approval, as it is free from the objections met with at the first site. The location is a commanding one, yet it will be private and secluded in consequence of being somewhat in a corner of the Reserve, 1\u00bd miles from the main highway to Lethbridge, and a number of miles from the town of Cardston.\n\nFrom the Contractor's standpoint I do not think the cost of building would be materially altered by changing from the original site on which the tenders were based, to the present proposed site. Though the distance for hauling most of the materials would be greater yet this would be offset by the road being much better, and also because sand and gravel would be obtained very much nearer. The Contractor would, in my opinion, benefit by the change. Should a siding be put in, as expected, then the Contractor's haulage costs would be more than cut in half as compared with haulage costs to the first site.\n\nI have arranged with the well-driller to notify me as soon as water is reached. I will then return and test the water supply thoroughly and continuously for a period long enough to tell us beyond all doubt as to the extent of the supply. I will advise you immediately by wire when this information is definitely available. It would seem that everything now hinges on the water question.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nKindly accept my very best\n\nSeason's greetings\n\n[Signature]\nCARDSTON, ALTA, DEC 28TH.23.\n\nDUNCAN C.

GARDNER SMITH.\n\n1045PM.\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nI beg to report that on the 11th instant I addressed a letter to Indian Agent Faunt with reference to the securing of a new site for the proposed new St. Paul's Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve. In making his recommendation with reference to this site I asked him to consult with Mr. Gardner Smith and with the Reverend Mr. Middleton, Principal of the St. Paul's School. I enclosed with my letter a plan of the reserve and indicated in red the locality in which you desired that the building be located, if a suitable site were obtainable. I also advised him that the site for the building should be chosen as near as possible to railway, in order to facilitate the handling of building materials and also supplies for the school, such as coal, after same is built.\n\nOn the 18th instant I received a letter from Indian Agent Faunt reporting that after having explored the entire area indicated by the red line on the plan, keeping in mind the special features mentioned, that is nearness to the railway, distance from the main road, distance from the river, distance from the agency buildings, and drainage and water supply that they were unable to find a favourable site within the area marked on the plan. Starting at the south end of the said area the land was generally low lying and would be very wet and boggy during the spring months. Further north he reported that the land was better, but that there were no good sites for the building, the country being generally level and not suitable for drainage, also that they were getting farther and farther away from the railway. At the extreme north of the area marked the land became rugged in which locality the drifting snow makes deep snow fields. This portion is far from the main roads and cut off from railroad facilities.\n\nHaving failed to find a suitable site within the area marked they proceeded south of the suggested area. Here they met with better land and at the point indicated on the plan which is located where the railway crosses the river and enters the reserve a good site was obtainable. There are hundreds of acres of excellent black loam gently sloping south easterly towards the river. The school could be placed about 200 yards from the edge of this table land where there is a moderate drop of about fifty feet of a meadow. At the head of this natural meadow is a running spring which would provide water for the stock the year round. The building, if located here, would command a magnificent view of the surrounding country, would be easily accessible from road and railway, well secluded and entirely apart by itself. It would be approximately five miles from Cardston and three miles from the new Agency buildings. In recommending this site Mr. Faunt was in full accord and harmony with the reverend Mr. Middleton and Mr. Gardner Smith and the views submitted by them were unanimous conclusions after carefully going over the entire property.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-9, part 1)\nMr. Gardner Smith was given authority to drill for water on this site and was also asked to consult with the railway officials in Calgary and see what arrangements could be made for the building of a siding. I have today received a telegram from Mr. Smith in which he states that an ample supply of good water has been reached at a depth of sixty feet, also that the Divisional Engineer of the Railway visited the site of the proposed spur and reported favourably and that the spur could probably be installed immediately.\n\nIt would appear from Mr. Faunt's report that they have selected the best site obtainable and I would ask you to please advise me if you approve of the site as selected by Mr. Faunt, Mr. Middleton and Mr. Gardner Smith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\nCardston, Alberta\nDec. 28th, 1923.\n\nDr. Duffield C. Scott,\nDeputy Sect. General\nMin. Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nRe: St. Paul's School\n\nIn pursuance of your telegraphed instructions of the 20th inst., I duly called on the railway officials in Calgary with reference to the proposed siding for St. Paul's School. The matter was given sympathetic attention by the Railway Sect. Mr. Cameron, and I was referred to the Lethbridge Divisional Engineer, Mr. Miles, who was instructed to accompany me to the point on the railway nearest the School site and make a report to the Sect. Today we visited the proposed location of the siding, and Mr. Miles stated that the conditions are very favourable for placing a siding there, and that he will recommend that it be done as soon as possible after the final approval of the school site by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThere is ample room for a suitable siding within the right-of-way, so that it will not be necessary to obtain the consent of the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-9, part 1)\nBoard of Railway Commissioners. Very little grading will be necessary, and, if the ground is too rough for grading, the siding can be brought up to the required level by using about a car-load of cinders which the railway Co. can supply.\n\nThe Engineer suggests that we should have a six-car spur instead of a complete siding, on grounds of economy. Will you kindly instruct me as to whether such a spur would meet the Department's needs. We can have a complete siding, with a switch from the main track at each end, if desired, but the cost would be greater.\n\nI understand that the practice of the railway company is to charge an annual rental in the form of interest on the value of the steel tracks, switches, etc., and that the customer pay for the grading and ties. I will have more definite information on the cost question tomorrow, and may then be able to submit an approximate estimate of the cost of such a spur as is suggested by the Engineer.\n\nAs stated in my telegram of today, water has been obtained on the proposed new school site. This is most fortunate, and is a happy sequel to the disappointment felt on failing to get water in previous drilling. The water was\nmet with in a gravel formation at a depth of 60 feet, and is of good quality. I have tested the supply carefully and find that the yield is at the rate of 7000 gals per 24 hours. The water rises in the casing to within 25 feet of the surface of the ground. The well is located on the school site so that it may be beneath the machinery room when the building is properly placed on its site.\n\nThe conditions now seem most favourable for St. Paul's School, and one can almost discern the hand of Providence guiding and directing us to the most suitable spot. With an ample supply of pure water, a railway siding, the best of soil, superb view of mountains and river, good drainage, good road, ease of accessibility yet with entire seclusion,\u2014what more could we ask for? The location is reasonably close to the new Agency buildings, and not far from the principal farming area of the Reserve. The building can be best placed to face due South.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nE.

I have not yet received this estimate from the Divisional Engineer, but expect to obtain it tomorrow when I will call at the Superintendent's office in Calgary. I will then forward same to Ottawa.\n\nThe Railway Superintendent stated that in order to obtain action in connection with the proposed siding it was necessary that a formal application should be made for same on their usual printed form used for the purpose. I therefore filled in the form, as directed, and I explained that the application which I was making on behalf of the Department, was subject to cancellation in the event of the Department not approving of the school site or for any other reason.\n\nNo doubt the contractors for the school building would be willing to contribute towards the cost of the railway siding rather than have to haul their materials from Cardston.\n\nI will write on the subject again as soon as I have the estimated cost of the siding furnished me.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.

In my opinion there is no comparison in the two sites, the first one selected is better in every respect, land is better, pasturage is better also the roads leading to the school. The matter of handling the work can be done from the first site better. If the matter were left to me I would recommend the first site and I might say that Mr. Faunt Indian Agent, Mr. Middleton Principal, and Mr. Christianson Inspector, who has been with me on both occasions, all agree with me that the first site is the best. I have written the Minister regarding this matter also.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner\n\nIndian Affairs.

I visited the Blood, Peigan, Sarcee, Blackfoot, Hobbema and Edmonton Agencies and eight Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nBLOOD RESERVE. While on the Blood Reserve I went over the site that was selected by Mr. Faunt and Mr. Middleton within the circle on the map sent to them from Ottawa. After giving careful consideration to this, there was no doubt in my mind but the original site chosen had advantages, and I wired you to this effect, and have received approval of my recommendation. I then, in company with the Principal of the school, the Indian Agent and Inspector Christianson, drove over the Reserve, and made a selection of a site for the proposed Roman Catholic School, that will probably be built on this Reserve next year. A splendid site was chosen within half a mile of the new Agency buildings, and about seven and a half miles straight north of the town of Cardston. The Principal of the School and the Sisters in charge were greatly pleased. I have arranged to have a well drilled at this point, so as to satisfy ourselves that there is an ample supply of water, before any steps are taken to build. There is a slope from the actual building site that will afford excellent drainage.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) W.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Sup't General,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCardston, Alta. April 9th, 1924.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St.Paul's School Site.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department will be aware that Commissioner Graham, of Regina, visited the Blood Reserve on the 17th ultimo, and made another selection of a site for St.Paul's school. The site he chose is situated in the locality of the original site, and distant about 300 yards from it. It is North of the former site, and nearer the Hillspring road; about 2 miles from the Macleod highway, and about 5 miles from Cardston. The general characteristics of this site are practically identical with those of the original site,-excepting, possibly, slightly better drainage conditions exist at the latter site.\n\nThe Commissioner made arrangements for the drilling of a well on the new site, and this work started about a week ago. Yesterday water was reached at a depth of 140'. I was present and supervised the careful testing of the capacity of this well. The showing was truly remarkable. After baling steadily for 30 minutes, with a 14' baler, during which time we discharged 525 gals. of water, we were unable to lower the level of the water in the casing below the 100' mark,-that is to say we still had 100' of water in the casing. This means that our well has the extraordinary capacity of quite 1000 gals. per hour! Whatever else the new school site may lack, there will be no scarcity of water! Thinking that you should have information regarding water supply as soon as possible, I have sent you the following telegram;\n\nThe Secretary.\nDep't of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAbundance water secured on school site selected by Commissioner Graham.\n\n(Sgd) E.Gardner Smith.\n\nI sent a similar message to Claydon Company Limited, at their request to be notified as soon as water was assured. The water seems of good quality, being probably fed from springs situated in the adjoining ridges. Mr.Faunt, the Indian Agent, informed me that he has received authority to have a second well drilled for the outbuildings and stock, which will be done while the drill is in the locality.\nThis means that we must now form some tentative plans as to the approximate location of future outbuildings, so that the second well may be most conveniently located. We have given some thought to this, and have decided on a site for the second well, keeping in mind the avoidance of fire hazard, so that in the event of an outbuilding catching fire, the prevailing West wind would not be likely to carry the fire to the school building.\n\nMr. Fairchild, of the Ottawa office of the Department, is now at work on this Reserve. I assisted him in taking the levels for sewage disposal from the prospective new school. The conditions, though none too favourable, are not impossible. We have a fall from grade at school site to the outlet in a small gully, of 14.80' in a run of 750', the \"run\" being the distance from the well (which we took as our datum) to the said outlet. Assuming that our sewer will be 6' below grade where it will emerge from the rear of the school, and continuing the fall of \u00bc\" to the foot for 100' until the septic tank is reached, we will have our sewer about 3' below school grade at point of inlet to septic tank. We will next lose about 2' in getting through the siphon chamber, thus giving us a depth of sewer of about 10' below grade at this point. We now have only about 5' fall left for our remaining run of nearly 650', which means that our sewer from siphon chamber to final outlet can only have a fall of about 1/10\" to the foot. Having got rid of the solids at the septic tank, I believe the remaining effluent will flow away even with so slight a fall in the sewer, especially when assisted by the impulse received from the siphonic discharge. The little gully into which the discharge will take place is a sluggish water course, with very slight fall to the N.E. As stated before, the conditions for drainage, though not ideal, are not impossible, and a sewage disposal system, if carefully installed, should function all right.\n\nMr. Faunt informs me that the Commissioner is having a 2nd hand Ford car fitted up for the use of the building inspector, which will be a boon to me in getting to my jobs.\n\nWe have had some squally weather recently, accompanied with snow flurries, but today the weather appears to have cleared off, and the indications are that Spring is at hand. The cream of the year for building construction is now before us.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the time of my last visit to your Department, in company with the General Secretary of our Society, (February 19) I was informed that the site of the new Blood School had not then been fixed but that Mr. Commissioner Graham had been authorized to examine the last site chosen and furnish you with a report in this connexion. As this is a matter of very great interest to our Society, and we have not received any information either from your Department or from the Commissioner's office, I shall be obliged if you will kindly let me know what action, if any, has been taken.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cardston.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to advise that the Indian Department have decided that the above spur will not be required, owing to a change in the location of the new Indian Residential School about to be erected.\n\nI would, therefore, ask you to kindly cancel the application for same. Thanking you for your kind compliance with the representations which were made, I am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI spent all yesterday at the new school site, and judging from the amount of stock now grazing on the land, it is time the land was handed over to us; literally, the \"cattle of a thousand hills\" were there, including Mormon, Indian and Gentile. It is known that the school is to be built; hence the rush for the pasture while there is yet time. Unless the stock is kept off and the fences put in good repair, we shall be minus both hay and pasture; therefore the desire to have sections 23 and 24, in township 3, range 25, West of the 6th, set aside at once for the new St. Paul School. Once this is done officially, I can act; until it is done, I have no jurisdiction.\n\nWhen this is being taken up, the question of having Call Robe moved to other lands would be most advisable, as he and his followers dominate the greater part of the half section 23.\n\nRegarding the name of the School; several of the old boys have mentioned to me recently, of adding \"Collegiate\" after St. Paul's thus making it \"St. Paul's Collegiate\" or \"St. Paul's Indian College\". I am very much in favour of the idea, and can see no objection, although I fully admit the advisability of retaining the standard of \"Residential School\", as adopted. Probably this is a matter of local opinion, but thought it wise to mention it.\n\nIn addition to the 100 acres we are to have broken this summer in preparation for next year's crop, I would fain suggest that a sum of four hundred ($400) be voted for breaking another 100 acres thus giving us two hundred acres for crop next summer. If there is any possible chance whatever of obtaining $400 for breaking more land this year, I would strongly recommend that the money be granted, despite the general financial condition. The outlay would more than double itself the first year, and it would give the school the basis of self support from its inception; the main thing we so much desire. This is well worth careful consideration.\n\nThe Indian Agent is prepared to endorse our request for the two sections of land indicated.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n\"S.H. Middleton.\"\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further relation to the epidemic of measles I mentioned in a recent letter, I regret to state that since that date, many more cases have developed; with the result that the School is now under quarantine, and we have nine pupils under the Doctor's care here at St. Paul's, and five more at the Government Hospital.\n\nI was able to obtain a registered nurse at the expense of the Ind. Department. I brought her from town last Tuesday, and so far as I can see we shall be under the ban for at least a month. Fortunately, none are severe cases, although there has been a shocking scourge on the Reserve; more than thirty children have already died from the effects of measles.\n\nThe information given me by the Indian Agent a few days ago, in connection with the land available for our use this spring, being assigned to Indian farmers, was not in the least assuring. The eighty acres given over to us was adjacent to the new site down by the river; now, that has been abandoned; the parcel of land has been incorporated in the lease of a white man. Meanwhile no provision has been made for us, other than what was mentioned in my letter to the Commissioner yesterday. We must have a piece of land for spring seeding. It may be a case of forcing the hands of the Indian Agent to relinquish a tract near the school, but he is determined, if possible, to keep us off that piece. I am likewise determined to secure a suitable tract for spring planting; otherwise we shall be minus a crop next fall.\n\nHad there been any attention paid to our concerted appeals last summer for breaking 100 acres, the present apparent difficulty would not have arisen. However, I will write you again immediately on hearing from Mr. Graham. Water has been secured at the last site chosen by the Commissioner at a depth of 140 feet.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n\"S.H. Middleton\".\n\nPrincipal\nW.M.Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, SASK.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 17th inst. In replying let me first express thanks for the eighty acres (80) of land you have ordered to be set aside for our use this year, also for the four horse team and outfit under recommendation.\n\nImmediately on receiving the outfit no time will be lost in commencing farming operations.\n\nOwing to the sandy soil here at the school, and the difficulty of access, we grow no grain other than oats. If we are fortunate in having a surplus of feed, there is always a ready market for it.\n\nAgain extending thanks for your personal interest in this matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n\"S.H.Middleton\".\nPrincipal.\nAttention Dr. Westgate\n\nNote the 'Green Feed' clause.\n\nI presume we have the right to plant what we wish once we have the land.\n\nAm hoping to have at least 50 acres seeded to wheat for threshing. Correspondence was commenced with this request on Feb. 28. Two valuable months have passed and we are still waiting. It seems to be a repetition of the \"breaking\" request last summer.\n\nS.H.M.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\nCANADA.\n\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have your letter of the 10th inst., regarding land to crop this year for school purposes. Am I to understand from your letter that you are going to use the old school farm for cropping this year? Why do you do this, is it not a very long haul for green feed?\n\nI do not suppose you will thresh any grain up there. It seems to me the expense would be tremendous. I am quite willing to let you have eighty acres of land where it can be had for a year; but I am not prepared to take this off the Cardston Farming Company's land. I have already sent them the lease and they have no doubt signed it. I am writing to Mr. Faunt, and asking him if he would try and secure for you a piece of land, so that you could grow green feed for this year only. I would not attempt to grow anything else but green feed at present.\n\nI am quite prepared to ask the Department to allow you four work horses, and this is all I will recommend; with all the horses you have now, I think this is as many as you will require. We do not want you to farm more than a half section at any one time, and eight horses will be sufficient to do this.\n\nThe department are not prepared at all to grant half of the articles you asked for in your list. This, however, has been submitted to them.\n\nWhat I propose doing now is, to see that you get a four horse team and plough. You can arrange to have the man you speak of go down and plough your land and look after the team where the buildings are to be erected. It is only with this understanding I would buy a team at all. When I get the necessary authority I will wire the agent, so that he can give you instructions what to do.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"W.M.Graham\"\n\nRev. S.H.

Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nREGINA, SASK.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have just returned from the Indian Agent's office, where Mr. Faunt and I have been discussing the need and advisability of obtaining a tract of land for spring seeding for the new school project.\n\nMr. Faunt informed me that he has assigned all the available ploughed land to the Indian farmers; but stated that, owing to the imperative need of the school securing a crop this summer he would suggest that a block of some eighty (80) acres or these abouts be retained for school purposes, for this summer only, from the Cardston Farming Co.'s lease on the North West corner of section 20, and suggested that a clause to that effect be incorporated in their Lease.\n\nImmediately after your visit, 1st May, as suggested, I brought this matter to the attention of the Indian Department, and they authorized breaking 100 acres, but owing to the extended time in tapping the well on the school site, it was not until September 12th, 1923 that authority was received from Ottawa to proceed with breaking which, of course, was too late in the year to carry out such operations.\n\nWe are therefore confronted with the position of having no land available for spring seeding, unless the request as above mentioned be granted, or other provision made adjacent to the School.\n\nIt is a matter of keen regret that there was no breaking done last year, as that would have given us the necessary land for cropping.\n\nI therefore beg, in consequence thereof, that a suitable tract of land be assigned for our use this spring. The Indian Agent is fully cognizant of the details contained herein. Thanking you for past favours, kindest regards.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"S.H. Middleton\"\nPrincipal.\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nThe question of the amount of land to be set apart for the new Blood School is an important one; and now that the site appears to have been fixed and the building operations begun, it will be to our advantage to have it settled as soon as possible.\n\nOn the last of the enclosed sheets you will find the area suggested by Mr. Middleton. This is quite in keeping with the recommendation made in my report on my visit to this Blood School in May 1923 (P.5, sec.4) and adopted by the Commission at their meeting held on May 29, 1923 (see Page 1 under Reports).\n\nThe enclosed copies of correspondence will help you to understand some of the problems which are confronting us in that quarter. When the site was selected last May, the Commissioner expressed a readiness to recommend that we be given the sections of land now mentioned; and was prepared to go so far as to have leases cancelled in order that we might have possession the sooner. I am doubtful however, whether that same good-will towards us still exists. The land we are requesting the Department to give us is exceptionally good, and as the Agent has been using part of it for what they call the \"greater production\" purposes, he appears reluctant to let it go. We should, however, press for it; and it is for this reason that I am forwarding the enclosed copies in order that you may fully understand the situation before approaching the authorities at Ottawa.\nWhen we have the land assigned to us, we will be in a position to grow any grain or fodder we may wish, and the Commissioner's suggestions will be followed out just as far as they coincide with our own intentions.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/K.\n\nEncs.\ncorrespondence.

(RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-9, part 1)\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Land to be attached to the new Blood School\n\nWith further reference to the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of May 31, 1924, No.103-1-9, addressed to the Rev. Canon Gould, General Secretary of our Society, relative to the land to be set apart for the use of our Society's new Blood School, I beg to state that this letter having been referred to our Commission for any further action necessary, I have been instructed to inform you that in the opinion of our Society not less than two Sections of land will be required for this purpose, the Sections most suitable being 23 and 24 in Township 3, Range 26 West of the 4th Meridian.\n\nAt the beginning of last year (1923) the Blood Band passed the following Resolution in this connexion:\n\n\"Resolved that we the assembled Blood Band of Indians resident on the Blood Reserve, offer to the Indian Department, a block of land on the said Blood Reserve, of 640 acres, or whatever more may be deemed necessary for the carrying on of the enterprises of the School\"\n\nIt would appear from this that the Indians as a Band are not averse to having more than one Section of land set apart for the use of this School, while a Resolution recently passed by ex-pupils of St. Paul's School who had assembled at the suggestion of Mr. Middleton to assist in breaking up land in readiness for crop next year, and actually broke up 70 acres free of cost before they dispersed, requests that steps be taken to\nhave \"two sections of land at least, and if possible, three sections, set apart for school purposes.\"\n\nWhen I visited the Blood Reserve in May of last year along with Mr. Commissioner Graham for the purpose of selecting the site for the new School, the two Sections referred to above namely, 23 and 24, were the ones I requested at that time should be set apart for the School's use, and this request both the Commissioner and Mr. Indian Agent Faunt agreed to support.\n\nFrom the rough sketch attached to this letter you will observe that the west half of Section 23 is in the hills. That half section will be very valuable to the School as pasture or grazing land and by being attached to the School other parties would be prevented from building too close up to the School buildings. I beg to request, therefore, on behalf of our Society that:\n\n(a) The whole of the two Sections mentioned, namely 23 and 24 in Township 3, Range 26, West 4th M., be set apart at the earliest date possible for the use of the new Blood School.\n\n(b) That steps be taken to have the Indian named Calf Robe, who has now a small holding on Section 23, compensated for any improvements he may have made on his present holding and transferred to some other location.\n\n(c) That steps be taken to have the men who held leases on any part of either Sections 23 and 24 and built fences thereon, compensated according to the present value of the fencing left standing, in order that our Society may not be left liable to any claim in this connexion when the land in question has been set apart for the use of the School.\n\n(d) That steps be taken to have the necessary fencing required for protecting farm and garden crops or for enclosing pasture, made this year. It is thought by our Commission that an initial expenditure of $600, would meet immediate requirements in this respect and our Commission trust that as this is a matter of more than ordinary urgency you may be able to authorize action in the way suggested in the immediate future.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTERW/ILC.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Canon Gould) relative to the setting apart of at least two sections of land for the new Blood School, I beg to enclose herewith the copy of a letter just received from Mr. Macdonald, the Principal, as it indicates some of the serious disadvantages and difficulties which delayed action in this connexion is causing, and will be greatly obliged if you will kindly give this important matter your earliest consideration.\n\nBelieve me\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.B.R.

Has anything been decided yet? By not having any land attached to the school that we can call our own, much difficulty is being encountered.\n\nWe have not even a pasture in which to turn our horses, as the section on which the school is built is not fenced completely, and our horses in company with many more strays, often get beyond the bounds of the hills. One team has already been absent since July 1st.\n\nHaving received no word from you about the matter I rather thought that the question was still under consideration at Ottawa, but was wondering if something could not be done to facilitate matters.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(signed) S.H.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOn July 9 and Aug. 23 I addressed to your Department important letters relating to the land to be set apart for the use of the new Blood School, but up to date have not been informed that any action has been taken in this connexion.\n\nIn a letter recently received from Mr. Middleton the Principal, and dated September 11, he states as follows:\n\n\"Extreme difficulty is being experienced daily on account of not knowing which land is ours and which is not. An Indian is moving hay immediately in front of the School, and has already hauled many tons away and sold it. I have no power to stop him, and we have to go out to odd places and get an odd load wherever we can. Calf Robe still retains the land all around the School and he also is taking off hay.\"\n\nAs you will see from this quotation that it is important to have this matter arranged at the earliest date possible I shall be very grateful if you will give it your immediate attention, and have the sections set apart for the use of the School which are described in my letter of July 9th last.\n\nBelieve me\nYours very truly,\n\nT.B.R.

Following a strong request from the Church authorities, I have decided that both Sections 23 and 24, T. 3, R. 25, W. 4, should be set aside for the St. Paul's Institution and I should be pleased if you would give an official intimation to the Rev. Principal in this connection. I understand that there are some improvements on this property, and you should inform the Indian or Indians who have been located there that the land is to be used for school purposes and that compensation will be made to them. Let me have a comprehensive report, relative to the Indians interested and indicating the most satisfactory arrangements you can make in the matter of compensation. Action can be taken under Section II A of the Act, if there is any difficulty.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. T.

Competitive prices should, if possible, be secured, and the purchase of the posts and wire made from the firm quoting the lowest price. All labour in erecting the fence should as far as possible be performed by the staff of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M.

Almost a year ago instructions were issued by the Indian Department that he was to vacate the land now assigned to the School. Several moves have been made but he is still at the same place. His stock are a considerable trouble and annoyance to us, and they have been pasturing on our land all summer. We cannot use the piece of land where he is situated, and for many reasons it is desirable that he be requested to vacate the property before the winter really starts, otherwise our land will be overrun with his stock, and we have suffered enough already from the presence of his stock. Hoping you may be able to take up and settle this matter at an early date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) S.

In a letter just received from the Rev. Canon Middleton, the Principal of St. Paul's School, he writes in part, as follows:\n\n\"The matter has been discussed with the Indian Agent, who, so far as I can see, has done nothing towards removing Calf Robe to other lands. The Agent says it is a matter for the Department to settle, and apparently leaves it at that. Two years have passed since this was first taken up, and the Indian still reigns supreme on the school land. His stock roam over the school property at leisure, and this naturally produces constant friction.\"\n\nIn the light of this information I shall be very grateful if you will give this important matter your early and careful consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/JF.\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nFile No. 103-1-9.\n\nReplying to your letter of December 28th, I was under the impression that I had written you in May last suggesting that a small house be erected for Calf Robe on a half section of land which had previously been leased\u2014which lease had been cancelled. I cannot find my copy however although I see references to it in my correspondence with Mr Middleton.\n\nCalf Robe has a house & stable on the school land. These are of log construction & the house is lined up inside with lumber. To take the house down however would render it useless as a habitation as the logs are decayed in many places & although it is habitable now, the taking of it down would render these decayed logs useless.\n\nI would suggest that a house be erected for him on the half section above referred to at a cost of around $400.00 & that he be moved there at as early a date as possible & I might say that he is quite willing to move as soon as he has a place to move to.\n\nI might say that Calf Robe has quite a little fencing also & this would remain on the ground as the half section which I suggest he should be moved to is already fenced.\n\nWishing you the Compliments of the Season & hoping that your trip has benefited you.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 15, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Faunt:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to removing the Indian Calf Robe from the farm set aside for the St. Paul's Indian Residential School and placing him on a half section, the lease on which has been cancelled. I am unable to find any trace of your letter of May last, in this connection.\n\nI note your recommendation that a house be erected for this Indian and that the cost will be approximately $400. Funds are available for this purpose in the Appropriation for Indian Education and you may make arrangements for the erection of the house and have Calf Robe removed from the school farm as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Before any action is taken, I would be glad to know just what fencing is necessary and what is being asked for by the school authorities. You might consult with the Principal and let me have your opinion.\n\nThere is a question of whether the existing fence, which was held under lease before the building was erected, belongs to the tenant or to the Department.

Scott, Esq., D.Litt.,\nDeputy-Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nMay I crave your indulgence regarding the condition of the road from the main Highway through the Reserve, up to the school. You will recall that a gravelled motor road has just been completed through the Reserve from Cardston to Stand-Off. This leaves two miles of the usual dirt road still unimproved between the school and the front gate. Despite several attempts which have been made locally to fill in several of the holes (veritable quagmires in wet weather) the road still continues to be one of the worst in the whole country side, and with so much traffic, both public and otherwise to the school, it becomes very embarrassing to be requested to bring out a team of horses in order to have cars come to the Institution. Such moreover greatly militates against the publicity of so desirable a public and Government Building.\n\nWith the end in view of having the road made passable and presentable for the general public, also for ourselves, I have approached the Provincial authorities with the request that the road be graded and gravelled similar to the main Highway. I was immediately informed that this two miles of road did not come under the purview of a 'Main Highway' and that no estimates could be considered for such improvements. On pressing the matter it was thought that probably a joint action should be considered for a fifty-fifty proposition between the Indian Department and the Provincial Government.\n\nIt would cost an approximate amount of Two Thousand dollars ($2000.00) to grade and gravel the road.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIn order to reduce the cost in the aggregate I would gladly put on two teams and a man. From your own personal experience you will readily see the dire necessity of having an improved road up to the school, this would also then coincide with the general improvement now made through the Reserve, but apparently unless we can get a joint action, nothing can be done.\n\nI therefore submit this question, in the hope that something tangible may be done in the near future, first, to provide a passable road in all weather, and second, to remove the stigma of having \"an unpassable road to a good school\".\n\nYours faithfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. It is quite possible too, that should this be considered favourable and a Grant be given, that I could solicit the services of some of the Indians in this endeavour.\n\nS.H.M.\nOctober 30, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh:\n\nCanon Middleton has written concerning the road from the main highway to the St. Paul's School. He estimates that it will cost $2,000 to grade and surface it and states that the Provincial Government might share the cost with us. You might look into this matter at your convenience and let me have a report and recommendation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nJ. H. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston,\nAlta.\nOctober 30, 1928.\n\nDear Canon Middleton:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to the condition of the dirt road from the highway to the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. I note your estimate of $2,000 for the grading and surfacing of this road and that the Provincial Government might assist. I am writing to Mr. Pugh in the matter, and, at a later date, I shall know if anything can be done to effect this improvement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Canon S. Middleton, B. Sc.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Paul's Indian Res. School,\nCardston, Alta.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.103-1-9, of the 30th of October, concerning a road from the main highway to the St. Paul's School, and in reply I beg to state that I have taken this matter up with the Minister of Public Works of this Province, and I am advised that they are not in a position to assist us in the construction of this piece of road. I have, however, entered into the detail of cost and find such cost as follows.\n\nGrading, $350.00, Culverts, $85.00.\nGravel, approximately, 1500 cu.yards for two miles of road, with a two mile haul @ $2.00 per yard, $3000.00. A total cost of $3435.00.\n\nIn connection with the grading, I might say that this covers the pulling of the dirt from the side of road to the centre by means of graders, and I am advised that it will take, approximately, 22 rounds of the grader on this two mile length to make this a reasonable road, and the sum of $350.00 covers that work.\n\nThe gravel will have to be hauled two miles to an average point, and will require, approximately, 750 yards to the mile. I might say that in placing less than this amount of gravel on the road would only mean further maintenance within a short period. Canon Middleton advises me that he can place one or two teams on this work. This, however, will not reduce the cost to any great extent. The road, no doubt, would be an asset to the school. In view of the cost, however, I rather hesitate to make a recommendation.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-9, part 1)\nSt. Paul's Residential School\nRev. Canon S. H.

I personally interviewed the Minister of Public Works of the Province in connection with the project, and he promised ready assistance in co-operation with the Indian Department. His Deputy however seems to have taken a different view, and states that no provision is being made for the second class roads.\n\nThis would appear to leave the matter entirely with ourselves. Mr. Pugh has submitted figures covering the estimated cost, and while the sum of $3000.00 for gravel seems rather prohibitive, the road thus completed would stand for all time. The grading alone, including the culverts, can be done for $435.00. To have the two miles gravelled would give us the same advantage as the Agency and the R.C. School, it would also ensure a uniformity of roads between these points.\n\nIf the whole scheme be considered too expensive, would it be possible to have the grading and culverts repaired according to the figures submitted?\n\nOn my next visit to Edmonton, I intend taking up the matter again with the Minister of Public Works.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.G.

(RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-9, part 1)\nDecember 27th, 1928.\n\nDear Canon Middleton,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th December with reference to the repairing of the road leading to the School. I note that on the occasion of your next visit to Edmonton you intend to see the Minister of Public Works, and I shall be glad if you will write me the result of your interview.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Canon S. Middleton, B.Sc.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Paul's Indian Res. School,\nCardston, Alta.\nJanuary 28, 1929.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nThe M.S.C.G requests for Estimates, 1929-30, include 4 miles of fencing, at an estimated cost of $250, and $350 of better fencing for around the school buildings at the St. Paul's Institution on the Blood reserve.\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nWith further reference to our correspondence regarding the grading of the two miles of road leading from the main highway up to the school. Since receiving your letter of last December 27th, have interviewed Mr. Stringer a local M. L. A. who personally took up this matter with Mr. MacPherson, Minister of Public Works, Edmonton. The policy now maintained in connection with these roads according to the Minister and Mr. Stringer, is for each party concerned to work on a fifty per cent basis and the Province will then maintain the road to completion. From what I can gather from recent interview with the Minister, he is very anxious to know what assistance to expect from the Indian Department towards the grading and graveling of this two miles now under discussion. I feel convinced that if we could make the Minister a definite offer as to what we were prepared to do he would be inclined to give a similar grant. He seems very reluctant to make a statement regarding the amount voted until a definite amount has been voted by the Indian Department. In this connection both Mr. Indian Agent Pugh and myself discussed this matter only last week with Mr. Stringer, because the road at the present time is almost impassable and in addition to the culverts which sadly need repairing, the road is gradually getting worse and worse in so far that cars coming from town and elsewhere will not come to the school but rather phone ahead asking if a team can meet them at the end of the two mile road. Can assure you that anything that can be done in the immediate future towards the re-construction of these two miles will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nApril 27, 1929.\n\nDear Canon Middleton:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the road from the main highway to the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. No matter what arrangements are made for improvement, it will be first necessary to do the grading and replace the culverts. I am today authorizing Mr. Indian Agent Pugh to attend to this part of the work. He has estimated the cost at $435.00.\n\nConcerning graveling this road, the cost of which has been estimated at $3,000.00, the Department has arranged for a grant of $1,500.00. Would you ascertain if the Provincial Minister of Public Works would secure a like appropriation, so that the work could be satisfactorily completed? I add, for your information, that the $1,000.00 which was available for fencing and other improvements at this school will be assigned for this purpose and that it will be necessary to postpone the fencing, etc., until next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Middleton, B. Sc.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Paul's Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alta.\nApril 27, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh:\n\nWith reference to your 402-11 C.E. of December 15th, last, I have to inform you that Canon Middleton is hopeful that he can arrange with the Provincial Minister of Public Works to divide the cost. I have asked him to look into this question further and have promised a grant of $1,500.00 from this Department towards the graveling of the two mile road, the total cost of which you have estimated at $3,000.00.\n\nIn the meantime, I have to authorize you to expend $435.00 for grading and culverts. This preparatory work will have to be done anyway, and the Department would be pleased if you would attend to the matter at the earliest suitable date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-9, part 1)\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nSince writing you on April the 12th regarding the grading of the two miles of road leading from the main highway to the school, I have now received a letter from Mr. MacPherson, Minister of Public Works, Edmonton in which he states:\n\n\"You appreciate the fact that if the Province undertakes the graveling of this particular road as far as the school, that the remaining portion of the same road to Hillspring which is within the Reserve would, in the ordinary course, be left to Province to develop, and continuation west from the school would seem to be of real service to the Indians concerned. If I could get any assurance from your Department of their willingness to assume responsibility in such cases as this I would be glad to make a start on the road which you suggest. Trusting that you and your Department will see the reasonableness of this suggestion.\"\n\n(Signed) O. L. MacPherson,\nMinister.\n\nMay I say in connection with the above, that this is the answer of the Minister to a course of representations which I have consistently followed since first taking up the matter with you, and it would now appear that the Province is apparently willing to undertake their share of the responsibility of the grading and graveling of this two miles of road.\n\nThanking you in anticipation for your good services in this connection.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-9, part 1)\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nWith further reference to our correspondence in connection with grading the road leading up to the School, and to your letter of April 27th, 29.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that I have been able to arrange with the Minister of Public Works for the satisfactory completion of their part of the work. He has greatly exceeded the amount designated (1500.00) and has put in extra culverts in addition to making the road a Standard Grade.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Pugh and myself have been over the road and are well satisfied with the work done.

E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nSt. Paul's Residential School\nRev. Canon S. H. Middleton, B. Sc.,\nPrincipal\nBlood Reserve - Cardston, Alberta\n\nMay 12, 1934.\n\nJ.E. Pugh, Esq.\nIndian Agent.\nBlood Reserve, Bardston, Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of May 4th, in which you state\u2014\n\n\"the Department advises that in view of the fact that Ray and Madeline Cross Child, are baptised Roman Catholics, and that their father is a recognised Catholic, that the Department is not prepared to approve of their admission to the St. Paul's School.\"\n\nMay I call your attention to the following points;-\n\n1. The parents of the above named children are Anglicans. The mother was baptised and Confirmed in the Anglican Church, and is a graduate of this school. The father was publicly admitted into membership of the Anglican Church at an open service on September 13th, 1925. He subsequently deserted his wife and had the children baptised by the Roman priest, much against the wishes of the mother.\n\n2. Under date of October 16th, 1922, a Departmental letter was issued which states as follows\u2014\n\n\"A Protestant child means a child of parents who are Protestants; and a Roman Catholic child is one who has been baptised as a Roman Catholic, or is born of Catholic parents; but the father has a right to direct and regulate the religious faith in which his child shall be brought up and that his wishes must be regarded unless there is some strong reason for disregarding them. In accordance with this view if a Protestant parent wishes his child placed in a Roman Catholic school and brought up in the Roman Catholic religion, or a Roman Catholic parent his child in a Protestant School and brought up in the Protestant religion, he may do so, but for the protection of the Department, we demand in such cases an affidavit to that effect by the father. Such affidavit must be made before a justice of peace, Indian Agent, or other person authorised to take affidavits, and the\nperson who takes such affidavit must certify that the statements set forth in the affidavit were read over or interpreted and explained to the deponent, who thoroughly understood the same. In cases of bona fide adoption, the religion and wishes of the foster father will be recognised by the Department.\n\nOn February 16th, 1934, all the points indicated above regarding the wishes of the father and the foster-father were duly signed and attested in a sworn affidavit, made by the father in the presence of Mr. Indian Agent Pugh. J.P. Such answered every qualification demanded by the Department, and clearly stated the wishes of the parties concerned.\n\n3. James Low Horn, the foster-father of these two children, has been duly informed of the present ruling to the effect that their admission to this School has not been approved by the Department. He naturally asks \"WHY?\", and states his reasons on the following grounds.\n\nWhen the boy Ray Gross Child was one month old he was handed over to Mr. and Mrs. Low Horn, by the parents, to be brought up as their own child. When the girl was one year old she was likewise given to the Low Horns' to be brought up in a similar manner. The parents in each case severing all rights of their children. J. L. Horn has supported these two children entirely and no support whatever has been given by Cross Child\u2014the father.\n\nThe Low Horns are Anglicans\u2014-the Gross Childs are Anglicans. Then for what reason, in view of what is stated above, are these two children refused admittance to the Anglican School?.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 103-1-10, of the 10th May last, with reference to the application for admission to the St. Paul's Indian Residential School of Dan Bad Arm.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that the date of Dan's birth is April 2nd, 1929, and therefore was an infant when his father died.\n\nI am of the opinion that the procedure of having a child signed in for school at that is an unusual action, and no doubt no other motive existed than to be prepared. No doubt the Principal of the St. Paul's School would advance as an argument that so many promises have been made in the hospital to the Catholic School, through the medium of the Sisters, when Indians have been near death or dying, that he was guarding against similar action. There are, no doubt, many unusual practises carried on in respect of pupilage for the schools, of which I know little until the applications come to for submission to the Department.\n\nI am informed by the Principal that he now has a new form completed for the admission by Mrs. Bad Arm, the mother of the boy, now married to Peory Plain Woman, but in view of the fact that the child is considered too young by the Department, I am so advising the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E.

He must have been only an infant when his father died. Was it not unusual to have an application form signed at that time and were there any special reasons for this action?\n\nThis boy is under age for admission to a residential school, and the Department does not see any necessity for placing him in any school at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. E.

I was personally aware that Bad Arm signed the application form. The application form was in the possession of the Principal since Bad Arm's death.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

In view of the instructions contained in circular letter of November 12th, 1926, these children should not have been allowed to enter the St. Paul's School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nDr. H. McGill,\nDeputy-Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill,\n\nI was pleased to receive yours of the 15th inst., together with the Circular letter, addressed to all residential schools. May I answer the last paragraph of your letter first.\n\nAm convinced, after many years of hard and laborious work amongst Indians, especially the Bloods, that any education imparted (higher or otherwise) is more than justified, by the future potential results. To be specific;\n\nFrom sixteen to eighteen years is the most plastic and impressionable age of an Indian student. It is during this period that character can be produced. Up to 14-16 years, all that is done remains very much in the embryonic stage and the discharge of a student at that age, with the expectation of satisfactory and abiding results, is very speculative indeed. Case after case could be cited where parents have insisted that their children leave school, for farming and other purposes, where the result obtained has been of a very mediocre type, as a matter of fact, the average type of an Indian, showing no indication of the education received.\n\nWhere however, the extra two years have been spent in school, under discipline and supervision, the results have been so favourable, that same have been remarked upon by both Indian Agent and Inspector, that I would fain urge, that the age of leaving School be extended to eighteen years.\n\nThe most striking cases amongst the Bloods, and the men and women who are the recognised progressives on the Reserve, are those who, while not having attained a definite high academic standing, remained in school until they were at least eighteen years of age. The extra one or two years in school is the most eventful period of an Indian's education. A foundation has been laid during the earlier years, but during this time there is always that appeal to the development of personality, which is impossible in the earlier stages. My experience has taught me that it is advisable to leave an open door for the Indian's educational development, for many, yea, too many, have no aspiration or ambition to proceed beyond the official requirements, but the few who are enthused with the zeal for definite progress, should be given every encouragement to attain their desire.\nAt least, such has been my experience, and the results under this system, must I am sure, be well known to you.\n\nI do most strongly and sympathetically appeal for a continuance of higher education. Such is the only salvation for an Indian, where he may attain a standing with his white brother, and the hope of future citizenship.\n\nIn connection with the former students, about whom you make enquiries, relative to the high school work taken, as to whether the results are commensurate with the time and energy expended. All are justified;-\n\n1. Albert Mountain Horse. Took his Commission as Lieutenant in the Canadian Militia. Was killed Overseas.\n\n2. M.E. Speaker. Graduated from the Claresholm Agricultural College. Returned to the Reserve. Built his own house, is a good farmer, and a writer of ability.\n\n3. Olive Davis. Won Diplomas under the Royal Academy of Music. Has since married and lives in one of the best homes on the Reserve. A home which in many respects not only equals the average white farm-house, but eclipses it.\n\n4. Bella Healy. Is now a nurse with the Indian Department.\n\nHave attached herewith list of students, sixteen years and over, with recommendations for their disposition.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nEnc.\nST.

They are still in the St. Paul's Anglican School, vide my school report for October, 1934. I quoted these cases in conjunction with my letter No. 402-11B of the 16th instant, on the children of John Red Crane, in which I quoted all correspondence in connection with the Cross Child children Ray and Madeline. These two children, I may add, are still in the assumed parentage of James Low Horn, since the parting of Billie Cross Child from his legal wife, Mrs. Lizzie Cross Child, the latter now living with John Red Crane.\n\nThis case of the Cross Child children is parallel to that of the Red Crane children, and the Department will concur, is quite complicated, as are other cases that arise from time to time, where the morals of the Indians are somewhat loose, though not appearing to be so when the school and religious status has to be dealt with. Will the Department kindly instruct me further as to these two children.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Blood Reserve,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nRe - Ray and Madeline Cross Child.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I call your attention to the fact that no reply has yet been received to my letter of May 9th, '34, which was prompted by your letter of May 4th, giving information regarding the above named children.\n\nThe facts as stated therein surely demand recognition.\n\nYours faithfully\n\nS.H. Middleton\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 22nd, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 402-11B of the 30th ultimo, with further reference to the application for the admission of Ray and Madeline Cross Child to the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn your letter of April 10th, you stated that the father of these children was a Catholic and that both the children have been baptized Catholics. In view of this information, you were informed in official letter of April 24th, last, that the Department was not prepared to approve their admission to the St. Paul's School. In this regard, I may point out that the Department considers that it is in the best interests of all parties concerned to adhere as strictly as possible to the intention of Section 10 (2) of the Indian Act.\n\nWhen your letter of May 18th, enclosing letter which Reverend Mr. Middleton had sent to you, was received, it was noted that he claimed that the parents of the children are Anglicans. As this statement was absolutely different from the statement made in your letter of April 10th and as you did not make any comment on Mr. Middleton's letter, the Department presumed that you did not agree with his contention regarding the religious affiliation of the parents. It was, therefore, considered unnecessary to reply to your letter as the Department had already given its decision in official letter of April 24th.\n\nI would, therefore, appreciate your again informing the Principal of the St. Paul's School that the children should be discharged at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCARDSTON, ALTA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nSt. Paul's Residential School\nRev. Canon S. H. Middleton, B.Sc.,\nPrincipal\nBlood Reserve - Cardston, Alberta\nJanuary 17, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\nI received quite recently a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Pugh stating;-\n\n\"I wish to advise that the Department have again requested that Ray and Madeline Cross Child be discharged at once\".\n\nThis is in reply to my letter wherein it was stated that every statute, edict, regulation and ruling, officially required by the Department, concerning these children had been legitimately and adequately fulfilled. No reason was given why these children should not be admitted to the Anglican School. If however, the fact that they were baptised by the Roman Church, acts as a hindrance to their admittance, then I must of necessity, in order to safeguard our Anglican position, seek that a similar privilege be extended to the Anglicans.\n\nIt would appear from recent happenings, that an Anglican has the right to place his children in the Roman School, but when a Roman Catholic desires to have his children admitted to the Anglican School, his wish is not granted, thus militating in no small measure against the recruiting for the Anglican School. Many cases could be cited from past correspondence.\n\nMay I call your attention to one specific instance which happened during December. One Bernard Weasel Fatt, son of Fred and Minnie Weasel Fatt (who have two boys in this school) born July 8th, 1926, and baptised by the Anglican Church, August 22, 1926, was two or three years ago, handed over by the parents, to the father's mother, (now deceased) for future upbringing. The woman was married to Tall Man, a Romanist. During December this boy was placed in the Roman School, not by the parents, but by the step-father. Here is the analogy; The Cross Child children are denied admittance to the Anglican School. Will the Weasel Fatt case receive similar treatment?\nI know it is customary to decide each case on its merits, but do you not think that if an Anglican child is granted admittance to the Roman School, then the Roman child should be obviously admitted to the Anglican School.\n\nThis is not conjecture, but reality, and I write in the hope that due cognizance will be given by your Department.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(Rev. Canon S.H. Middleton.)\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 25th, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, with regard to the admission of children to Indian residential schools.\n\nI note that you refer to a boy named Bernard Weasel Fat who, you state, has been placed in the Blood Residential School. No application for a boy of this name has been submitted to the Department and I am writing Mr. Indian Agent Pugh today to give us full particulars.\n\nRegarding the application for the admission of Ray and Madeline Cross Child to the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, when this was first received the Indian Agent was requested to obtain full information and forward same for the Department's consideration. The report that we received showed that these two children were baptized as Roman Catholics and that their father is recognized as a Roman Catholic. The intention of the Indian Act is that Roman Catholic children should be placed in schools conducted under the auspices of that Church and Protestant children placed in schools conducted under Protestant auspices. The Department considers that it is in the best interests of all parties concerned to adhere as strictly as possible to the intention of the Act. Consequently, Mr. Pugh was informed that we are not prepared to approve the admission of the two children mentioned above to the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nPermit me to point out that, last November, the Department received an application for the admission of William Rabbit to the Blood Residential School. In this case, also, Mr. Pugh was requested to forward full information for our consideration. The report indicated that, although there was also an assumed adoption, the father of the boy is recognized as a Protestant and, consequently, the Indian Agent was instructed to inform the Principal of the Blood School that the Department was not prepared to approve of his admission.\n\nIn view of the information given in this letter, you will see that the Department has acted fairly in both cases. I regret that you question our good faith in considering cases such as the above. Such action on your part is not conducive to the mutual good will and understanding which should exist between the Department and its Principals.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Canon S. H. Middleton, B. Sc.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Paul's Indian Res.

The father - Cross Child - of his own free will and accord, was received into the Anglican Church at a public service on September 3, 1925. The baptismal record of this admission has been presented to Mr. J.E. Pugh.\n\nFurther - on September 14th, 1925 - Cross Child - Anglican - was married in the Anglican Church to Lizzie S. Alone - Anglican - who is now the mother of the two children in question. Subsequently, against the wishes of his wife, the father took his two children and had them baptized by the Roman priests. Since a few months after the birth of the youngest child, Cross Child has not lived with his wife, nor given any support whatsoever towards his children. They were adopted by James and Mrs. Low Horn - Anglicans - who have brought them up as their own children. They now desire to place the children of Anglican parents in the Anglican School and in consequence obtained the father's written consent, (which has been submitted to you) to place the children in this School.\n\nAll the necessary edicts, rules and regulations demanded by the Department have been fully met. . . I submit that I am at a loss to understand, in view of the foregoing, why they should not be admitted to this School.\n\nRegarding the second paragraph of your letter relating to William Rabbit, I am fully conversant with all the details connected therewith. The fact remains, nevertheless, that he is only one turned from the Romans, while many have been turned from the Anglicans.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIf, as you state, \"The Department considers that it is in the best interests of all parties concerned to adhere as strictly as possible to the intentions of the Act\" namely, that Roman children attend the Roman School and Protestant children likewise their School.\n\nIf such a policy were followed, so far as we are concerned harmony would reign supreme.\n\nThere is no desire whatever to question your \"good faith\" in rendering decisions. Just the opposite, but as I am the appointed representative of the Anglican cause on this Reserve you must, of necessity, admit that I am only doing my duty.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg to state further to your letter No. 103-1-10, of the 25th of January, with reference to correspondence to you from the Rev. Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican School regarding the Weasel Fat boy and the children of Billy Cross Child, Ray and Madeline, who are residing with James Low Horn and wife, that I am now in receipt of a copy of letter from the Principal of St. Paul's School addressed to you, quoting further in the matter.\n\nI have at various times given the Department the history of these children and parents, but there has now come further complications in this manner.\n\nThe father, Billy Cross Child, has deserted his wife and is now living with a Mrs. Louis Owl Boy, (at present in the United States) and the mother, Mrs. Billy Cross Child, is now living with John Red Crane, and both father and mother have now practically no contact with Ray and Madeline Cross Child. These two children having resided with the Low Horns. There is no question but that this is also a case of re-baptism, firstly Anglican and then Roman Catholic. The father is an ex-pupil of the Blood R.C. School, and the mother ex-pupil Anglican. Obviously from the Principal's letter, Billy Cross Child was received into the Anglican Faith and then married Lizzie Standing Alone in that faith. Later they were accepted into the Roman Catholic Faith and the children also baptized into that faith. It would appear that Low Horns have and will have the responsibility of these two children for the future, and they are unquestionably Anglican.\n\nI hesitate to make definite recommendations in a matter such as this, where the religious issue has become so complicated as in this case, through mixed marriages subsequent disruption.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As will be noted, Billy Cross Child is a Catholic, and both children have been baptized into the R.C. Faith. James Low Horn has exercised parental control of the children for a year or more, as Cross Child and his wife parted, and Low Horn took charge of these two children.\"\n\nReverend Canon Middleton, in a letter dated February 2nd, 1935, writes, as follows, regarding the above children:\n\n\"May I once again state and reiterate without prejudice that both mother and father of the two Cross Child children are Anglicans.\n\n\"The mother is a baptized and confirmed member of our Church and is also a graduate of this School.

A statement taken February 9th, 1934, is attached to the applications, also the notation of the Principal, Canon S.H. Macdonald, in respect of their religion at this time. This, apparently, infers that they have been re-baptized into the Anglican faith. I may say that the father and mother are still of the same expression as related in the statement attached. The children have been in the school for some time but not enrolled.\n\nOne other application is also enclosed, that of Louise Cole (Treaty list \"Coal\") which is also in order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

I now desire that these two children shall be brought up in the Anglican Faith, and educated in that faith, and it is my intention that they shall be re-baptized into that faith.\n\nI have at no time received any promise of any kind from any person in respect of my wish.\n\nI am Ex pupil of the Anglican School, and that is my sole reason for making this request.\n\nMy wife, Mary Wells, is a Catholic, and it also her wish that our children be brought up in that faith.\n\nVictor Chief Moon\n\nIndian Agent and JP for Prov of Alberta.\n\nFebruary 9th 1934.\n\nWitness.\n| No. | Name                  | Periods in the School | State of Education | On Discharge | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------|\n|     |                       |                      |                    |              |                       |\n| 176 | Peter Mary Fingers    | Sept. 1.             | M11                | Good         | Farming               |\n| 180 | Frank Good Striker    | Sept. 1.             | M11                |              |                       |\n| 181 | Albert M.

If they are not successful in certain cases, they will, no doubt, report to you and you can then make full inquiries in such cases.

The list contains ten children, presumably of Anglican faith, while a further list has four of doubtful religion.\n\nI have up to the present time issued truant notices in delinquent cases of children, eligible for school and not attending, under Section 10, s.s., but as some doubt exists as to the desirability or use of this section, I am requesting advice and authority to invoke the section mentioned, in obtaining the attendance of potential pupils of the age of seven years and over.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.

For this reason, paragraph 2 was inserted in circular letter of March 30th, 1937. For your information, I may add that the various Church officials were consulted previous to the issuance of the circular letter just mentioned and they expressed their concurrence.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that it has been the practice for many years to allow certain holidays at both the residential schools on the Blood Reserve and the Department does not wish to make any change in this regard, provided the Inspector of Indian Agencies, yourself, the Principals of the schools and the parents feel that it is advisable to continue this practice. Please discuss this matter further and make a definite recommendation regarding what holidays over and above the two months annual leave you consider should be allowed the pupils at the two schools on the Blood Reserve. In making such a recommendation, you should state distinctly the duration of these special holidays in order that all parties concerned may have a definite understanding regarding them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nCopy of this letter placed on File 150-37.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 1)\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your file No. 103-1-10, of the 6th instant, together with enclosure of a petition from the Blood Band of Indians, in which report is requested on the matter.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that the petition refers to circular letter No. 159-37 of the 30th of March last, which had reference to school holidays. My information is that, after I had personally informed the Chief and Council of the Blood Band of the contents of the Circular, in so far as the paragraph dealing with the actual holiday question, the matter was talked over by the Indians generally and an attempt was made to have the Council deal with the matter. This I politely informed the Council, was not at the time quite a right policy to follow, in that it was an instruction that should have have the support of both Indian Agent and Council, being an instruction from the Department. I further stated that individually of course, that it was a matter for their own conscience.\n\nOne of the Indians, Ben Strangling Wolf, interviewed me in my office, and stated that they were circulating a petition, and said that he felt it was only right that I should be made aware of the fact that they intended sending this to the Department, instead of doing so behind my back.\n\nAs far as my information goes, the objection seems to be that the instructions in the circular will cancel the monthly holiday, the Christmas holiday and such holidays that may occur when annuity and lease monies are paid out.\n\nClassification of these holidays have been as follows:- Monthly holiday was usually the granting of a Saturday and Sunday when the parents could take their children home. Christmas holidays were from Christmas day festiv-\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\nties till New Year's day, a week.\n\nPayment holidays were usually on the day appointed for lease and annuity payments, three per year. The parents having their children out for two days at these payments.\n\nAll of the holidays have been enjoyed by this band since the new schools were opened, a privilege not enjoyed by other reserves.\n\nI may say that on Inspector Mr. C.P. Schmidt's recent inspection visit, this matter was discussed with the Principals of both schools and myself, and perhaps, Mr. Schmidt has formed an opinion in the matter after the consultation.\n\nI may say that I am enclosing a copy of this report to Mr. Schmidt at Calgary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\nSir:\n\nI beg to state that the matter of admission of the following children to the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School, Blood Indian Reserve, has been brought to my attention by the Principal of that school.\n\nRay Cross Child, age 10; Madeline Cross Child, age 8, shown on Ticket No. 175 Blood Band. These applications were dealt with by this office in Letter No. 402-11B, of March 6th, 1935, and the Department's reply was dated May 1st, 1935, No. 103-1-10. The matter has, therefore, been in abeyance since that time, in so far as the applications were concerned. The children have, however, been in the school since the Summer holidays of 1935.\n\nI may add that since my letter, Billy Cross Child has been living with many Many Bears in marital state, and is now shown on his ticket, while the mother of the children still lives with John Red Crane, No. 247, and she is shown on this ticket as Lizzie Standing Alone. I am having the Principal obtain further applications for the above children.\n\nDan Bad Arm, age 9. This boy is shown under Ticket No. 228, Blood Band, Percy Plain Woman. Plain Woman having married Mrs. Bad Arm. The family of Bad Arm being Anglican, while Plain Woman is of the Catholic faith. This boy has been in the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School for about three years, June 1934.\n\nGrace Chief Moon, age 8; Helen Chief Moon, age 10. These two children are of Ticket No. 321, Blood Band. Victor Chief Moon, are as follows as to Religion: Father Anglican, Mother Catholic. Both children have been in school since 1935 Summer holidays. Applications are being prepared for these two children. Correspondence in regard to these children has passed before, and the Department's last letter on the subject of these two children is No. 103-1-10, of July 6th, 1935.\n\nI have, as a matter of precaution, again questioned Victor Chief Moon in regard to his statement attached to my letter of June 22nd, 1935, and the information is as follows: Father Anglican, Mother Roman Catholic, children baptized R.C., firstly and admitted to Anglican Church later. Parents are now and have been attending the Anglican Church for four years. Parents are living in marital relationship in Indian custom. Both father and mother are desirous of their children being brought up in the Anglican Faith.\n\nAll of these children have been resident in the Anglican School as from the dates mentioned, and the matter, therefore, presents some difficulty although the parents in each case have and do now express their attitude towards desiring their children educated at the Anglican School.\n\nThe matter is submitted for instructions, and new applications will be sent forward if desired.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may inform the Principal that the admission of these children is approved.\n\nYou should again point out to the Principals of both schools on the Blood Reserve that children whose eligibility is doubtful on any grounds must not be admitted to either school without the express permission of the Department, even though, for compassionate reasons, the Principal might consider their immediate admission advisable. These instructions have been previously issued and are extremely definite and the Department will expect that Principals of both schools on the Blood Reserve will adhere strictly to these instructions in future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nBlood Indian Agency, Cardston, Man.,\nJanuary 31st, 1938.\n\nREPORT FOR MONTH OF JANUARY.\n\nThe two schools were visited during the month and the attendance at both schools in classes good. There was however truancy at both schools this month.\n\nAt the St Paul's Anglican school, three pupils left early in the month, were returned by the parents and two of these went out again, 190 Luke Small Eyes and Laurence M. Chief No. 227 and Luke Small Eyes was returned by his father and Laurence brought back by the school. Later Thomas Bull Shields No. 209 truant and Lawrence Weasel Fat No. 207 and Victor Chief Body, No. 214. The R.C.M.P. brought back the Weasel Fat boy and I returned the Chief Body boy. Truancy notices were served of these cases on the Parents of Mistaken Chief, Bull Shields and Small Eyes, no prosecutions made by the parents.\n\nThe principals of both schools are at a loss to know why this epidemic of truancy. I made a point of talking to the classes on the matter when making my monthly visit.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., February 4th, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your file No. 103-1-10, of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the applications for the admission of the following children to the St. Paul's Anglican Residential School, Blood Reserve:\n\nHelen Chief Moon\nGrace Chief Moon\nMadeline Cross Child\nRay Cross Child.\n\nIn reply to your letter I wish to advise that I discussed, and questioned the Principal of St. Paul's School relative to the admission of the above children, contrary to instructions.\n\nThe Principal informs me that these children were taken in on compassionate grounds, the Cross Child children being left with James Low Horn family, and were almost destitute, and the Chief Moon children taken in last year because of their condition.\n\nThere is no change in the attitude of the parents of these children.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances surrounding these children, I would have no hesitation in recommending their admission to this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 28, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, also your letter of October 12 last, with reference to the applications for the admission of the following children to the St. Paul's Residential School:\n\nHelen Chief Moon\nGrace Chief Moon\nMadeline Cross Child\nRay Cross Child\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to the information contained in your letters but before making a definite decision the Department would appreciate your advising why the Principal of the St. Paul's Residential School has kept these children in residence especially in view of the very definite instructions contained in the last paragraph of official letter of July 6, 1936.\n\nIn replying you might also state if the parents of these children have recently expressed any different wish from that contained in your letter of October 12.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

(RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 1)\nOttawa,\nJune 17, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with reference to special leave that has been granted by the Principal of the St. Paul's Residential School to certain pupils of that institution.\n\nI feel certain that you received our circular letter of March 30 but in any case I enclose an extra copy for yourself as well as a copy for each of the Principals of the two Residential Schools in your Agency.\n\nIt is quite evident from this circular that it is the wish of the Department that all special leave be discontinued especially in view of the fact that we are now allowing pupils of Residential Schools two months' annual holidays. The only possible exception is in cases of emergency or where the older pupils can help at home in farming. Such cases should, of course, be submitted for the Department's approval as far as circumstances will permit.\n\nI am pleased to note from the fourth paragraph of your letter that it is the intention of the Principal of the St. Paul's School to discontinue granting weekend holidays. I believe that such action is very advisable as all Residential Schools are expected to conform with the instructions contained in circular letter of March 30.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCrowsnest, Alta., June 28th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to state that I have today received the enclosed letter addressed to me from an Indian of the Blood Band, with reference to school holidays at the schools on this Agency.\n\nThe letter speaks for itself, and is a complaint by the Indians of the Blood R.C. School regarding children of the St. Paul's Anglican School being allowed out at week-ends.\n\nIn this connection I may say that I have been approached by the Principal of the Blood R.C. School regarding this same matter, and I requested a letter in this regard, so that it could be placed before the Department. This I have not had as yet.\n\nI have approached the Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican School in the matter, and find that certain children have been permitted to go home at week-ends, and I have spoken to one family, Mrs. Fred Tail Feathers, and she insists on having her children home in evenings, and informed me that she would go to jail before giving up this privilege.\n\nI am informed by the Principal of St. Paul's School that two or three families, adjacent to the school, have been getting their children out, and that he intends after the Summer holidays stop in the practice, even for Mrs. Tail Feathers, and letting the Department decide the matter.\n\nPersonally, I refuse permission, except for cases of emergency or where the older pupils can help their fathers at home in farming, such cases being passed on to the Department, but have no control over the school or schools in enforcing.\n\nYour perusal and comments in the matter will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

School have not been able to obtain permission to get our children at any time except except at Xmas and we do not see why the circular letter should be enforced only at the P.C. School and not at both Schools.\n\nIn proof of the above statements that we have seen children with their parents at home the following instances may be enlightening:\n\nI have seen Mr. Wilson camping at my place and having his daughters out on two different occasions around the 16th of May and the end of April.\n\nI have seen Chief have seen Diets Soup's children in town with their parents during April.\n\nI have seen Henry Standing Alone's children and two other children on Saturday May the 28th going to town.\nAlso I.C. Shute have seen at least six boys assisting at our Easter concert and many others at different times have been seen by the undersigned. We would like to bring this matter before you in order to have the matter settled.\n\nHarry Big Throat\n\nJoe Young Jim\nPete Black Rabbit\nJim Mary Feather\nJim Shute Both Side\nJulius Don Horn\nDora Mills\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that in conjunction with the Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican School, I have permitted Fred Wenzel Fat, No. 192, to go home to help his father on the farm.\n\nIn this case, the father was conveyed by myself to hospital in rather a bad way and I deemed it advisable to have Fred Jr. go out to the farm to complete the cropping.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E.

School, namely:\n\nEdwin Calf Robe, Pupil No. 194 and Allen \" late \" 205, who died in 1936.\n\nThis child is the offspring of Common Law wife, Jean Wolf Plume, ex-pupil of St. Paul's School. His former wife, Alice Howling in the Night, now lives with Joe Wolf Child.\n\nThe other application is that of Bertha Wolf Child, Treaty No. 328. The mother of this child is referred to above.\n\nIt will be recalled that the pupils Edwin and Allen Calf Robe were the subject of considerable correspondence at the time of their admission to the Blood R.C. School, and I am now informed by the Principal of that school that Ben Calf Robe spoke to the former regarding this boy Hugh, but I note that Ben Calf Robe signed the application.

Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 9, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 12th ultimo was mislaid and consequently I regret there has been some delay in replying to it. With reference to the boys mentioned in your letter I feel that you should investigate each case and if you consider that the boy concerned would be of assistance to his parents in farming operations I feel that special leave should be granted to him. It is not possible to give blanket authority as each case will have to be considered on its own merits. You are on the ground and are in the best position to decide whether or not leave should be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ.E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of\nWelfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWhen I visited our St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve in February of this year, the following Indian parents asked me to endeavour to secure for them the privilege of having their children now at this school, spend part of the weekends at home: Mr. and Mrs. Tailfeathers, Mr. Percy Creighton, and Mr. James Gladstone.\n\nIn support of their request they stated that they all lived comparatively near to the school, and that it would be quite an easy matter for them to take their children home Friday evening and bring them back on Sunday afternoon. A special reason was given by Mrs. Tailfeathers in support of her request, namely, that her children were specially gifted in the matter of drawing, and she felt that they would make greater progress in this art if they spent the weekend at home under her direct supervision. She informed me that she had given you one or two of the drawings made by one of her boys, and that you had authorized a short course in special instruction under an artist in the United States last year. From one of the drawings which I myself saw, I feel convinced that every encouragement possible should be given to the Tailfeather children, but I felt unable to assure any of the parents who came to see me that their request could be granted. I pointed out, and the Principal was present at the time, that if a concession of this kind were made to a few parents, we might reasonably expect many others to ask for the same consideration, and endless confusion might follow.\nFrom the standpoint of administration, our Commission cannot afford to lose the grant which would be deducted for any children who were absent from the school during the weekends, but I promised to write to you in the matter hence this letter.\n\nIt is my opinion, and the Principal concurs in this, that the request should not now be granted, but that it might be further discussed with the parents by yourself, or any representative of your branch of Government whenever you happen to be visiting the Blood Reserve.\n\nAs I promised the parents who approached me to lay their request before you, and to advise them of your decision in the matter, I will be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nMay 11, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI regret that my reply to your communication of the 3rd ultimo has been delayed.\n\nThe question of allowing weekend holidays has been before the Department on several occasions. After giving very careful consideration to the various circumstances it has been decided that such permission would work to the detriment of the general administration of our residential schools. Under these circumstances the permission requested by the Indians on the Blood Reserve cannot be favourably considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

All parents are well advised of the opening of the schools on September 1st.\n\nI did not check the rolls until the 5th, and found the situation as reported. The St. Paul's School report today (the 9th) that 60 children are now in, leaving 83 to return. The Principal attributed this to laxity of the parents. At the Blood School only fourteen remain out.\n\nThere is no doubt that a number of parents of the Anglican School children are lax, and perhaps take advantage that no action has been taken by way of the Truancy Section since 1931-32. I have no other reason to offer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

The writer appreciates that both Churches have their separate and distinct functions, but one feels that the ultimate objects, hopeful of attainment, are those of granting to the Indians soulful good, repose and education.\n\nWith that tantamount in mind, coupled with a desire to a fuller cooperation of the forces for good that we consider exist on the reserve, I desire to ascertain if you would in conjunction with the Principal of our other school, consider establishing a line of demarcation.\n\nThis would entail, if considered, the listing of Indians of your faith and then those of a mixed marriage, and then a conclave between Principals and assisting Principals with the Indian Agent, to reach agreement in the matter.\n\nThis is suggested to you in good faith, only with a view of creating a leadership to the Indians, that might be convincingly apparent to them that our services are for their good as an equitable whole.\n\nThe matter is now approached, as a number of applications have now been submitted in which variance is noted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Middleton, B.Sc.\nPrincipal\nBlood Reserve - Cardston, Alberta\nJanuary 18 1940.\n\nJohn E. Pugh Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBlood Reserve,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh:\n\nI have been informed that Bob Sorrel Horse and Violer Creighton, whom I married by license in this Church on April 9 1928, have recently undergone a similar ceremony in the Roman Church of the Reserve. The act was performed by the resident Roman priest.\n\nI have written to Edmonton seeking information from the Registrar as to whether they accept the official registration of this re-marriage. Will write you again regarding this.\n\nYou are well acquainted with the antecedent causes which led this couple to take so precipitate an action. The sum total, as you have gleaned from their many interviews is simply due to personal spite and pique against an influential Indian family and is in no way attributed to myself personally or the Church.\n\nThe point I wish to bring to your attention is that this couple are Anglican and were legally married in their own Church. (Bob Sorrel Horse was originally a Roman, but has officially renounced Rome, and was publicly received into the Anglican Church prior to his marriage.) I have baptised all their children and two are now students in this School.\n\nMay I further state, that the Roman marriage cannot be legally recognised, as such is contrary to statutory law.\n\nFurther, if on the grounds, that this couple may now term themselves as Romans, and that they make any application to have their children transferred from this School to the Roman Institution, I hasten to state that such action will be officially protested, first in the interests of the family itself, as it is quite possible that in the near future the parents may reverse their untimely act and return to their former allegiance, and second, it would tend to create and establish a system of vicious intimidation which would be detrimental to the best interests and future harmony of the Blood Indians.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSHM/AB\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moreover, as you know, 'Coal' is more or less \"Non Compos Mentis\", and for anyone to take such an advantage, is exhibiting a flagrant disregard of even common ethics, in addition to the child being a non-Roman.\n\nI therefore, beg to protest against the child being admitted to the Roman School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Section 10, Sub-section 2 rules that no Protestant child is to be assigned to a Roman Catholic School, or a School conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and vice versa.\n\nQuite recently many of our Anglican families have received various sums of money, from a resident Roman priest, for signing Anglican children into the Roman School.\n\nThis is a direct contravention to the Indian Act. I therefore enter a most emphatic protest against Anglican children being placed in the Roman school, especially, when such a questionable method of recruiting has been adopted.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

School of his son. The Department's reply dated May 9th, 1933, No. 103-2-10, made comment on the procedure of gifts or money as outlined in the letter of Canon Middleton.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E.

Pugh, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh;-\n\nReplying to yours of the 14th, inst., regarding \"Brown Day Chief\". This is the boy whom you and I have discussed on many occasions. He was first signed in this School by his father \"Brown\" Ronald Day Chief who has custody of the boy, objected to bringing the boy to school unless he was assured of guardianship by signing the Application Form for Admitance himself.\n\nOn May 31st, 1938 Day Chief made formal application in person, and the form was duly witnessed by 'Joe Chief Body.' Day Chief stated he would bring the boy to school after the summer holidays. He failed to do so, which as mentioned above, has brought about many discussions regarding the manner he was adopting. I have suggested, as you will recall, having a warrant issued. Dozen of times I have requested that he be brought to School, but always met with the same excuse, 'wait till after the holidays - after spring - after Treaty - after sickness,\" and infintum. At last I managed to persuade Day Chief to bring the boy before Christmas; to this he reluctantly agreed. Nevertheless, the moment the festivities were over, he came along and asked that he take the boy to town, and would bring him back.\n\nAgain - he failed to do so. Week after week, we have visited his home in order to have the boy return to School, until at last he gave it out that he was being 'annoyed' by our persistent visitations. He was then given a definite time limit in which to return the child. He then used this time limit by placing the boy in the Roman School, simply an act of sheer defiance. \"Brown Day Chief\" is a recognised student of this school. May we anticipate his speedy return.\n\nYours faithfully\n\nS.H. Middleton\nPrincipal.\nCOPY.\n\nST. PAUL'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nBlood Reserve Cardston, Alberta.\n\nFeb. 20, 1940,\n\nJ.E.

I find on looking over the Quarterly Returns, that he is marked as being in attendance during the whole term. Such was not the case. The error must have arisen in copying. This apparent oversight can be rectified by making the necessary deduction at the end of current Quarter.\n\nHe was in residence just over the Christmas week-end.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS.H. Middleton\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nMarch 14, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 22nd ultimo enclosing two letters received from the Reverend Principal of the St. Paul's Residential School.\n\nI presume that Rita Coal whom you have been instructed to return to her parents is a member of the family to which Rev. Canon Middleton refers.\n\nThe charges contained in Canon Middleton's letters of February 15 and 20 are extremely serious but it is exceedingly difficult for us to pass judgment without complete information. Consequently you should ascertain from Canon Middleton the name of the Priest who he states visited the Coal home. You should then interview this gentleman and advise him of the charge that has been made against him and obtain a statement from him. When you have received this you should forward it for our consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMarch 14, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of January 9 with reference to application received for the admission of children to the St. Paul's Residential School.\n\nThe information that you supply regarding Allan Small Face is not sufficiently definite to permit our making a decision. Is the legal wife of Emile Small Face still living and is Allan Small Face a legitimate or an illegitimate child? Has Emile Small Face any older children in a residential school and, if so, in what school did he have them placed? Any other information that you have available in connection with this case should also be forwarded.\n\nI am returning the 5 application forms for the other children mentioned in your letter. The admission of Dan Across the Mountains and Reggie Across the Mountains to the Blood Residential School is being approved by concurrent letter. As you do not give any specific information regarding the other 3 applications it is not possible to make any decision regarding them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J. E.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMarch 12, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th ultimo you may inform the Principal of the St. Paul's Residential School that the admission of Chris Strangling Wolf and Elizabeth Across the Mountains is approved.\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 9 the admission of the following children to the St. Paul's Residential School is approved:\n\nClarence Melting Tallow\nMona Chief Moon\nElizabeth Healy\nRuth Panther Bone\nJohn Edward Healy\nDorothy Good Striker\nGeorgina Davis\n\nYou will be advised under separate cover regarding the other children mentioned in your letter of January 9.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith certain correspondence received from the Principals of the Blood R.C. and St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential Schools of this Agency, all of which correspondence pertains to Pupil No. 264 \"Brown Day Chief,\" St. Paul's Anglican School, admitted May 31st, 1938.\n\nTo make this correspondence clear, I may say that it came to my attention that this boy \"Brown Day Chief\" whose father is Brown Chief Calf, or Fair, Treaty No. 127, Blood Band, was taken into the Blood R.C. School this month, and an application dated February 8th is attached herewith. On receipt of this information, February 14th, I phoned the Rev. Principal of the Blood R.C. School and requested that the boy be sent home, as he was an \"admitted pupil\" of the Anglican School. This was confirmed in writing, Ronald Day Chief, who took Brown Chief Calf's wife and this child in one of the marital disputes of this Agency, then filed complaint as per the correspondence attached.\n\nI then took the matter up with the Rev. Principal of the Anglican School as to attendance, and his correspondence is also attached, and the Principal of that school informs that the boy in question only attended for a few days at Christmas week end 1939. The Principal also states that the boy was examined by a Doctor, as shown on the form of application, on the 14th of June, 1938, at 3 PM. This Doctor being Dr. Hurtig, who was at that time in temporary partnership with Dr. J.K. Mulloy, the Medical Officer for the Reserve at that time.\n\nIt will be noted that Ronald Day Chief is not the father, but in assuming marital relationship with Brown Chief Calf, or Fair's wife, he is exercising control of the child. Brown Chief Calf, the father, took another woman and children, but is at present in the U.S.A.\n\nThe boy is now at the home of Ronald Day Chief, and if the Department rule that he is an admitted pupil of the St. Paul's Anglican School, it is now obvious that only a truancy notice will cause the child to be placed in school, and then undoubtedly we shall have difficulty, in view of the manner in which the whole matter has occurred.\n\nCopies of letters etc. in this matter is attached.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E.

(RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 1)\nOttawa,\nMarch 18, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with reference to Brown Day Chief, pupil No. 264, of the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. I am also in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Blood Residential School requesting the boy's admission to that school and submitting a letter from Ronald Day Chief dated February 14, 1940, which reads as follows:\n\n\"I Ronald Day Chief do hereby testify that I have never taken my child to St. Paul's School; he has never been examined by a doctor and therefore I consider the first application that I have made to have the child admitted in St. Paul's School as void and null. I want my boy to be admitted in St. Mary's School. I have signed the papers and he has now and for the first time been examined by the doctor.\"\n\nAn application for the admission of Brown Day Chief to the St. Paul's Anglican Residential School was forwarded to the Department under cover of your letter of August 30, 1938. The application form stated that the boy was an Anglican and the Medical form indicates that he was examined on June 14, 1938, by Dr. A. Hurlig. The application was approved by yourself and under these circumstances it is difficult to understand why Ronald Day Chief now states that the boy was not previously examined by a Medical Officer.\n\nI have also reviewed the copies of the letters which you received from the Principal of the St. Paul's Residential School in connection with this boy. Mr. Middleton's letter of February 20 is not very clear.\n\nMr. J. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nbut it might be inferred from this letter that the boy only attended the St. Paul's School for a short time previous to Christmas, 1939. However, in reviewing the quarterly returns submitted by the St. Paul's School it is found that on the return for the quarter ended June 30, 1938, Mr. Middleton showed this boy as having entered the school on May 31, 1938, and on that return requested grant for him for 30 days. Subsequent returns received from this school also showed the name of this boy and grant was requested for him as follows:\n\nSeptember quarter, 1938 - 70 days\nDecember \" \" - 92 \"\nMarch \" 1939 - 90 \"\nJune \" \" - 91 \"\nSeptember \" \" - 90 \"\nDecember \" \" - 92 \"\n\nIf, as stated above, our inference from the Principal's letter is correct, namely, that the boy has only been in the school for a short time in December, 1939, the Department cannot understand why the Reverend Principal of this school has requested grant for him every quarter since the application was first submitted for our consideration. I may add that the average attendance for the quarters ended June 30, 1938, September 30, 1938 and September 30, 1939, was larger than the authorized enrolment and consequently the inclusion of his name on those three quarters did not affect the amount of grant paid but if the boy was not in the school during the other four quarters shown above an overpayment has been made.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would again discuss this phase of the matter with the Reverend Principal and let me have definite information regarding this boy as if he was not present in the school it will be necessary to make a deduction from the March quarter grant. I hope there are no other children in this category shown on the return from the St. Paul's School. You should again point out to the Principal that grant should not be requested for any pupil during the time such pupil is absent from a residential school.\nAs mentioned above the original application submitted with your letter of August 30, 1938, stated that this boy was an Anglican. Is he still recognized as a member of that Church?\n\nWhen you reply to this letter further consideration will be given to what action should be taken regarding him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey, Supt. of Welfare and Training, Re File No. 103-1-10, March 14, 1940.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the above file re certain unfinished application forms sent forward in my file 402-11 C.E. of January 9th, 1940, from the Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School. I wish to submit the following details:\n\n1/ Cecille Black Plume, Daughter of Bob Black Plume, Treaty No. 11, Blood Band.\n\nBob Black Plume and his wife were married into the Roman Catholic Church on August 19th, 1935. Previous child, a girl, Dora, now discharged and married to Wilfred Morning Owl, Treaty No. 394, was educated at the St. Paul's Anglican School.\n\nApplication for Cecille Black Plume has been forwarded to the Department under cover of letter No. 402-11 R.C. of the 15th instant and recommended for admission to the Blood R.C. School. I made this recommendation in view of the fact that the parents were married into the R.C. Faith, and on an interview with Bob, the father, he advises that he has embraced that faith. Questioned closely on the matter, he stated that the application is being made in good faith, with no influence being brought to bear.\n\n2/ Benedict Morning Owl, Father, Tom Morning Owl, Treaty No. 190, brother of Joseph Morning Owl whose admission to the Blood R.C. Residential School has now been approved.\n\nNo application made as yet by father for this boy's admission to the Blood R.C. School. Family R.C. and all children so far educated at R.C. School.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 1)\nThe above two cases are those referred to in the last paragraph of your file, and only two cases remained doubtful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Fugh,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hosy, Supt. Welfare & Training.\n\nFile No. 103-1-10 of 14/3/40.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the above file with reference to the application of Allan Small Face to the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply may I submit the more definite details as requested.\n\n1/ The legal wife, Augustine, is still living, and is now living as common law wife with Jack Hind Bull, Treaty No. 165.\n\n2/ Allan Small Face, in view of the answer to question No. 1, would be the illegitimate child of the common law, or Indian custom, of the living together of Emil Small Face and Olive Davis.\n\n3/ Of the legal union of Emil Small Face and Augustine, there is one child living, Elaine, shown on the Hind Bull ticket, No. 165.\n\n4/ Elaine was a pupil of the Blood R.C. Indian Residential School, and received her full education at that institution.\n\n5/ Small Face's common law wife now is Olive Davis, who was a pupil of St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School, and of this union there are the following children: Allan Small Face, Mary, Emil and Charles Ross, in order of birth.\n\n6/ Allan is the first applicant of the union of Emil Small Face and Olive Davis.\n\nThis applicant, Allan Small Face, is the boy referred to in my report dated February 12th, 1940, File No. 402-11B, which covered an investigation into morals at the St. Paul's Anglican Residential School, and the father, Emil Small Face, took the boy home and he has not attended school since the investigation.\n\n7/ All of the children of the present union of E. Small Face and Olive Davis were baptized into the Anglican Faith, and have not been baptized by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nI may conclude by stating that Emil Small Face about a year ago, was endeavouring to get this boy, Allen, into the Kindergarten School of Cardston, but on the recommendation of the Medical Officer for the Cardston School Board,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 1)\nthe application was turned down. Small Face at that time, intimated to me that it was because of the difficulty of his wife being Anglican and he being Roman Catholic, that he had tried to enter his boy in the Cardston School.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 30, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant with reference to Allan Small Face. In view of the information given in your letter and the recent trouble at the St. Paul's Residential School in which he was involved the Department considers that it would not be advisable to place this boy in any Indian residential school at the present time. You might make a further recommendation regarding this boy in about six months' time and when writing you should make a definite recommendation regarding the religious auspices under which you consider he should be educated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

PAUL'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nCardston, Alberta,\nMarch 21 1940.\n\nJohn E. Pugh Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to yours of March 19,\nin which you return five application forms\nand state that three out of the five have\nbeen assigned to the Roman School and the\nother two are \"not yet dealt with\".\n\nFor your information may I state that\nJohn A Mountain is a graduate of this School,\nand voluntarily requested that his child\nbe admitted to St. Paul's.\n\nFurther, the Black plumes have been\nalways members of this School and Church,\nthe parents were confirmed by the Bishop\nof Calgary on May 4 1930. Within the past\nsix months two of the Black Plume children\nhave been baptised by the Anglican Church,\nand the only daughter this couple has is a\ngraduate of the School and was married by the\nsame Church.\n\nI am writing this in order that there\nmay be no lack of evidence in support of\nour claim that the child now under discussion\nhas been properly signed into St. Paul's.\n\nWe have no desire to trespass on\nthe preserves or rights of other Bodies, in\nthe matter of recruiting, but we do maintain\nthat our similar rights and privileges be\nsafeguarded.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS.H. Middleton,\nPrincipal.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., March 26th, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of letter received from the Rev. Canon Middleton of the St. Paul's Anglican School. In effect it is inferred that the child of John Across the Mountains, Treaty No. 4 (Dan Across the Mountains) now of the Blood R.C. School was signed in for the Anglican School. The admission to the Blood R.C. School was recently approved in letter No. 102-1-10 of the 14th instant.\n\nThe Principal's letter does not infer that the father, while a graduate of the St. Paul's School is still of that faith. My information is that the father has adopted the faith of the Roman Catholic religion, and the boy in question was baptized an Anglican, and the Principal of the Blood R.C. School advises that he was conditionally baptized into the Roman Catholic Faith.\n\nIn regard to the statement regarding the Black Plume family, I wish to state that in our register of Births Deaths and Marriages, there appears the registration of the marriage of Bob Black Plume and Susie Touch Bread at the Blood R.C. Church on the 18th August, 1935, by the Rev. Father Hudoux.\n\nBob Black Plume was questioned by the writer in regard to his religious affiliation and he informed me that he was now practising the Roman Catholic Faith.\n\nThe reference here is in regard to the recent application of Cecille Black Plume, dated December 29th, 1939, under cover of my letter No. 402-11R.C. of March 15th, 1940, pending decision.\n\nIt is suggested that the transference of religious affiliations by Indians render school admissions difficult of solution, and is a conversion principle over which an Agent has no control, and if a Principal offers an application for admission and the religion is shown as belonging to that particular religious affiliation on the application form, it is then apparent that re-baptism or change of affiliation in religion has taken place.\n\nAny interference by an Agent in religious matters of this kind is open to criticism, and while the Indian Act does contain Sec. 10 ss2, regarding religious affiliation, the interpretation is surmounted by transference as stated above.\n\nThese comments are offered for consideration by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

P. Charron, Principal of the Blood R.C. School, in regard to the children of Small Face of the union with Olive Davis, and he informs me that none of these children have been taken into the Roman Catholic Faith, and have not been baptized. It would, therefore, appear that Small Face has made his decision in regard to this boy and his other children of this union, all of whom have been taken into the Anglican Faith, and the matter is therefore re-directed for your consideration. I would recommend, in view of the foregoing, that the pupil in question be allowed to remain in the St. Paul's Anglican School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E.

Consequently unless the Principal intends to apply for the discharge of all of the above-mentioned children at the end of June, 1940, you should advise me why it is considered necessary to keep them in the school after that date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Pugh, Esqr.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to yours of the 19th Inst. in which you request me \"to furnish the name of the Priest referred to in letter of the 20th ultimo.\n\nI visited the Cole home today accompanied by an Indian Witness -- T. P. Chicken, and in order to verify the information which had already been given me by several Indians, and which was transmitted to you in my letter of Feb. 20th, I had all the conversation carried on through the aid of an interpreter.\n\nBear Shim Bone, father of Mrs. Cole was in the house, with Cole and his wife, when I arrived.\n\nAll three stated in corroboration, that a few days before Christmas a resident Roman priest by the Indian name of \"Natoyi - Kokatose\" meaning Holy Star, by which appellation Rev. Father Charron is known to the Indians, paid to Cole the sum of five dollars for having signed the application form of his daughter Mary, as a candidate to be admitted to the Roman School.\n\nThe Priest therefore referred to is Rev. Father Charron.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS.H. Middleton,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 18, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, you may inform the Principal of the St. Paul's residential school that the admission of the following children is approved:\n\nJosephine Tallow,\nMarjorie Tallow.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alberta.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., April 8th, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nAttention Mr. R.A.Hoey, Supt. Welfare and Training. File No. 103-1-10. March 14th, 1940.\n\nI beg to state that acting upon instructions contained in the above file, I made request for the information required and attached is copy of Rev. Canon Middleton's letter. On receipt of this information I interviewed the Rev. Father P. Charon and I quote here-with his words in this respect.\n\n\"I gave $5.00 to Coal to purchase clothing for the child Rita Coal, for admission to the School. I advised them at the time that the money was to be used solely for the purchase of clothing for the pupil in order that he may buy proper clothes to enter school, knowing that they, the parents, were very hard up.\"\n\nThis is carried out in practically all cases. In most cases it is noted that the money has purchased clothes, dresses, shoes and stockings, caps and other clothing and the children presented at school have always had clothing that they would not have at home.\"\n\nIn regard to this Coal family, I may state that at the close of 1938 term, in July, 1939, Coal had a girl, Minnie Coal, discharged September 30th, 1939, age 16 years, who had attended the St. Paul's Anglican School, and the Principal desired to keep her during the Summer holidays, to which the father and the girl objected. The Principal phoned me at the time, saying to use truancy methods to hold her; this I refused to do. I did, however, see the father and Minnie at my office, and their attitude was very antagonistic. Coal said at that time that he would not send Minnie back or have anything to do with the school again.\n\nI quote this matter, as it has some bearing in the case.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 23, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to Brown Day Chief. It is noted that both this boy's father and foster father are stated to be Anglicans and in view of this information the boy is eligible for admission to the St. Paul's Residential School and his admission to that school is approved.\n\nIt is noted that the Principal has advised you that his name was inadvertently included on the quarterly returns for this school. The necessary deduction is being made from the March quarter grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., April 12th, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey, Supt. Welfare & Training.\n\nI beg to acknowledge your file No. 103-1-10 of March 18th last, with reference to \"Brown Day Chief\", pupil No. 264, St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply thereto I wish to state that the Principal advises and I quote \"The question of his attendance, which was inadvertently recorded, has now been duly credited as the number of days indicated were deducted from the aggregate total of the January-March return.\"\n\nThe Principal has been advised not to record attendance again where pupils are absent.\n\nThe attendance record of the boy is as quoted in your letter, less three days at Christmas, 1939, but I note the deduction made in St. Paul's School return is shown as 365 days, and I think this should read 525 days less 252 days for September-December quarter, 1938, and 90 days for December 1939, less 3 days in at Christmas, total deductible days of 270.\n\nIn regard to the boy's religion, the Principal states \"The boy is Anglican. He was signed in by his Anglican father on September 11th, 1936, and again by his Anglican Foster father on May 31st, 1938.\"\n\nI trust this is the information required in the case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

None are signed in the presence of myself.\n\nMelvin is one of the two children for whom Sam Creighton is responsible, the other child is Olive Creighton, Pupil No. 0265, admitted April 5th, 1937, when the father and mother were living together, which application was also made by Sam Creighton at that time.\n\nThere has been a definite break in this family, the mother, now with her parents, has the two younger children of the family, Rosabella and Winold. The parents are Roman Catholic, and no doubt when they attain school age, it is probable that request will be made for the Blood R.C. School for their education.\n\nThe father is now in jail for assault upon his mother, Mrs. Percy Creighton, and was sentenced to two months.\n\nMy reason for bringing up this matter was because of the marital disruption, and the fact that the parents were married into the R.C. Faith.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 1)\nThe Rev.

School, protest may be made by the Anglican School.\n\nAt this juncture, however, I would recommend that Melvin be admitted to the Anglican School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

Is the Department to infer from this that the father did not sign the application form in your presence? In cases where the religious affiliation is doubtful I am inclined to feel that you should insist on having application forms signed in your office in order that you may be definitely aware of the wishes of the person signing the form. I also note that the parents are separated. Is Melvin one of the children for whose maintenance the father is responsible?\n\nFurther consideration will be given to this application when your reply is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.

Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School, particularly in regard to the number of over age pupils remaining in that school. The Principal's reply will be forwarded.\n\nIn regard to the applications of:\n1/ Melvin Creighton, and 2/ Mary Cole, I wish to forward the applications for these two pupils.\n\nIn the case of the former, Melvin Creighton, I wish to point out that Sam Creighton is the father of this boy, but is of mixed marriage class, his wife being an R.C. ex-pupil, and they were married in the R.C. Church April 6th, 1931. Sam Creighton being a graduate of St. Paul's School.\n\nThis application was held up by me, pending any complaints. There has been no comment in the matter, either from the Principal of the Blood R.C. School or the mother. I have, however, not asked or consulted either.\n\nThe parents are now separated, and Sam has kept three of the children, and his wife the youngest child of the family.\n\nIn the matter of Mary Cole, this was the subject matter of correspondence when the application of Rita Cole came up for consideration, and your file No. 103-1-10 of March 14th last, and my reply thereto, of April 8th, File No. 40-11B. The name as shown in our Treaty records should be Mary Cole and is the same girl quoted on the application form from the Blood R.C. School as \"Rita\". The School history of this family is quoted in my above file. I may add that the father \"Coal\" is in a mental state.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.W. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 1)\nST. PAUL'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nRev. Canon S. H. Middleton, B. Sc.,\nPrincipal.\n\nBlood Reserve - Cardston, Alberta\n\nApril 26, 1940.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 25th inst., regarding Elizabeth Healy.\n\nThis girl was voluntarily brought to school some months ago by her mother and officially admitted. In the early part of the year, Mrs. Healy came here and waited to take the girl out for a prolonged visit. When I refused she became very abusive. Later, on a pretext of going to Cardston, her parents sent a car to the school, and she was surreptitiously taken home and placed in the Roman School, without my knowledge.\n\nTime and again, I and other members of the school staff called at the Healy home, to bring the girl back to school. On every occasion we were met with the statement that the child was ill, and could not be seen and that on her recovery she would be returned to St. Paul's. After numerous and repeated visits to the Healy household I demanded from the mother the nature of the child's illness. On pressing the question she eventually stated that her daughter had long since been a pupil in the Roman School.\n\nI informed you the next day of the action taken by the parents and requested that the girl be returned to this school. Weeks have passed and now your letter states that:\n\n\"this party is now contesting placing his children at St. Paul's\";\n\nIt is not a question of contesting, rather it is a matter of legal and departmental rights. The Healys as you well know are all Anglicans, there never has been a Roman Healy on the reserve and there is not one today. Mrs. Jim Healy is a confirmed member of the Anglican Church, all their children to date have been baptised here, and educated in the same school.\n\nRegarding the statement \"Jim Healy did not sign this application form himself\". Of this I am fully aware, because I signed the form myself, at the personal request of Mrs. Jim Healy, in the same manner that I have signed dozens and dozens in the past, owing to the confidence that has been developed between church and...\npeople through many years of service. When Mrs. Healy brought the girl to school last autumn, I asked her to sign the application form, as a matter of course. She replied that Jim, her husband, would be visiting the school during the next month or so, and he would then sign his name. I informed her that no grant could be obtained until the child was officially signed in, and would it be satisfactory if I signed on his behalf? To this she gave an affirmative reply without any further thought.\n\nOn that authority I signed the Form, which was quite orthodox and legitimate, (because we both know that with this particular couple the husband always carried out his wife's orders), and asked F. G. Striker, as he happened to be in the office a short time later, to affix his signature, which was done without further question. All this was done in perfectly good faith. Had I any idea that such an act of trust would have been violated in the way in which you now state, the Form would have been held over. Two of the Healy children had been in school for a number of years; it was therefore obvious, when Mrs. Healy open stated that it would be quite satisfactory to sign the Form, that it was their intention for the girl to remain where placed.\n\nIf you desire to extend the case, I would suggest that you discuss the matter with either P. Creighton or J. Gladstone, as both know the details. Your own official records will give you the character and standing of Mrs. J. Healy. She resorted to secretive and untruthful methods to have her child meet her in Cardston, and then deliberately placed her as a pupil in the Roman School.\n\nPersonally I regret most sincerely the iniquitous system of undermining the influence of various families on the Reserve, which has become so dominant during the past few months. To allow this pernicious practice to continue will be tantamount to admitting that the Indian is a law unto himself, and that he can flagrantly oppose any ruling which is not beneficial to his own or party interests. The fact of bringing the girl to school, leaving her here for several months, and then break all good faith and contract by secretly placing her in another school, is conduct deserving of severe censure. Shall be pleased to have the girl returned as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd.) S. H. Middleton,\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI beg to state that Jim Healy, Treaty No. 158, of the Blood Band has recently made request to have pupil No. 0285, Elizabeth Healy of the St. Paul's Anglican School, admitted to the Blood R.C. School.\n\nThis pupil was admitted to the St. Paul's School by authority of the Department, letter No. 103-1-10, dated March 12th, 1940.\n\nHealy now protests that he did not sign the application, and states that he has now changed his religious affiliation, and not having signed in for the child for its admission to the St. Paul's School, he protests its admission.\n\nI wrote the Principal of St. Paul's Anglican School, and I attach herewith his letter regarding the matter.\n\nIt is quite obvious from the attached letter, that when a child goes out of school, the responsibility of a difficult case is passed to the Agent's hands, as in this case, where the Principal states that \"I informed you next day etc.\" Apparently it was my duty to issue a warrant for this child's return to St. Paul's, but in as much as this practice is not too desirable, I have for the past few years been reluctant in this. However, it appears that no matter what type of truancy of this nature, the truancy section of the Indian Act will have to be invoked.\n\nIn this case, therefore, I am asking the Department for their consideration of the case, its attitude to the changing of religious affiliation over which, of course, an Indian Agent has no control, and its instructions in dealing with this case of Healy's.\n\nIt will be necessary in this case to issue warrant for this child's return to school, and the Prin-\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\ncipal's letter conveys the situation in full, and accordingly warrant is being issued for truancy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 16, 1940.\n\nRe: Admission of Elizabeth Healy to St. Paul's Residential School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 10th instant and also a letter relating to the above noted subject, received by you from the Principal of the St. Paul's residential school.\n\nThe officials here are greatly disturbed by Canon Middleton's statement to you, which reads:\n\n\"Jim Healy did not sign this application form himself. Of this I am fully aware because I signed the form myself at the personal request of Mrs. Jim Healy, in the same manner that I have signed dozens and dozens in the past, owing to the confidence that has been developed between church and people through many years of service. When Mrs. Healy brought the girl to school last autumn, I asked her to sign the application form as a matter of course. She replied that Jim, her husband, would be visiting the school during the next month or so and would then sign his name. I informed her that no grant could be obtained until the child was officially signed in and would it be satisfactory if I signed on his behalf. To this she gave an affirmative reply without any further thought.\n\n\"On that authority I signed the form, which was quite orthodox and legitimate, because we both know that with this particular couple the husband always carries out his wife's orders, and asked F. G. Striker, as he happened to be in the office a short time later, to affix his signature, which was done without further question\".\n\nAm I to understand that the Principal of the St. Paul's School not only signed Healy's name in the absence of Healy but also asked a man named Striker, who visited the office later, to sign a document which reads:\n\n\"I hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document\".\n\nThe Principal states that this procedure in his judgment was orthodox and legitimate. Let me state very frankly\n\nthat in -\n\nMr. J. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alberta.\nthat in the judgment of the Department his action was neither legal, orthodox nor legitimate and that this Department is not prepared to co-operate with a principal who follows this procedure in the enrolment of pupils at his school. May I point out further that if other applications have been sent in, signed by the Principal rather than by the parent in each case, these application forms, in the judgment of the Department, are null and void and that new application forms should be sent in at once.\n\nIt should be comparatively easy for you to determine the religious status of Elizabeth Healy. If the parents of this pupil have left the Anglican Church and have become Roman Catholics, you should receive from the father, in writing, a statement to this effect; and you should also receive a statement in writing from the Priest of the Roman Catholic Church which he is now attending to the effect that the parents of this pupil have joined the Roman Catholic Church and are at this date members of that church. If, on the other hand, the parents of the pupil are still Anglicans, steps should be taken to have this pupil regularly enrolled at the St. Paul's School.\n\nI am exceedingly anxious that you should discuss very fully and very frankly with the Principal not only the case of Elizabeth Healy but the general practice which appears to have been followed at the St. Paul's School in the enrolment of pupils. If the proper care were exercised by the principals in a great many of these cases, disputes that arise from time to time could in my judgment be easily avoided. It has always seemed to me regrettable that so much of the agent's time is taken up in dealing with the religious status of certain pupils seeking enrolment at residential schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

The subject matter of this correspondence, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nReverend T.B.R.

School Comm., M.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 17, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant reporting the number of children who have not returned to the Blood and St. Paul's Residential Schools following the summer holidays.\n\nThe number who have not returned to the St. Paul's School is surprisingly large. What efforts are made by the school management to induce the pupils to return promptly upon the expiry of their leave? This is not the first time that this condition has prevailed and it is my intention to take up the matter with the officers of the M.S.C.C. The apparent lack of co-operation between the management of the St. Paul's School and the Indian parents whose children should attend the school makes it necessary for the Department to seriously consider keeping the school closed during September each year. In this event the school would lose the grant for that month.\n\nWe are not prepared to authorize the issuing of truant notices as it is considered that if the management of the school displayed the interest that is expected from them the number of pupils who do not return promptly after the holidays would be negligible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCarleton, Alta., September 10th, 1940.\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to state that on checking up attendance rolls at both the schools on the Blood Reserve on the 9th instant, one week after schools had opened, I found the following number of pupils absent:\n\nBlood R.C. Residential School, 9 boys, 5 girls\nSt. Paul's Ang. \" \" \" 50 \" 50 \"\n\nI desire to know if the Department would concur in my issuing of truant notices in order that these children may be returned to their respective schools at once. To do so 152 truant notices will be required as we have none on hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., July 6th, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nAttention of Mr. R.A. Hoey, Supt. Welfare and Training, File No. 103-1-10, May 16th, 1940.\n\nI beg to state, with reference to the above file, re the matter of James Healy and his children's admission to the St. Paul's Anglican School and the irregularity in the application form, that I have now been able to contact Healy and I enclose herewith statement from Healy, and a further statement from the Principal of the Blood R.C. School.\n\nThese are submitted in compliance with the above letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E.

Welfare & Training,\nFile 103-1-10, dated Sept. 17th, 1940.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the above file re the return of children to schools of the Blood Reserve after the Summer holidays, and in reply wish to state that a considerable number of pupils have now come in to the St. Paul's School, and at this date 13 boys and 12 girls are still absent. The majority of these are Indians of the North end of the reserve, who are out working in beet and harvest fields, and no doubt are difficult to contact.\n\nI may say the school does spend a lot of time and gas for autos getting in pupils who are not brought in by their parents, but I may add that this tribe is difficult in the matter of school attendance after holidays.\n\nFor some years it was a practice to issue truant notices, and when this was carried out the delinquency was cut down. However, since this has not been the practice, it would appear that the Indians take advantage of both the school and Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E.

Should any exceptional circumstances arise in connexion with any particular case, you should confer with the Government's local representative in the person of the Indian Agent, and ask him to deal with the same.\n\nWith very good wishes,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBW/KH\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of Sept. 18th, No. 103-1-10, with enclosures, and have already written to the Principal of our St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve in connexion with the subject matter of the same. As soon as his reply has been received and laid before our Commission, I will write to you again.\n\nIn the meantime, and with a view to preventing any further misunderstanding regarding the signing of official application forms for the admission of Indian children to the Residential Schools, I am sending a circular letter to all the Principals of the schools administered by our Society and enclose herewith a copy for your information.\n\nWith regard to the regulation of your Department that all applications must be signed by the Indian parent, I may say that as I have been unable to locate any specific reference to this in the Indian Act (1927) I will be obliged if you will let me know the section in which it appears. Should it not be given in the Act, I will be glad if you will send me a copy of the Regulation, so that I may have it on hand for future reference.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW/KH\nEncl. 1.\nOttawa,\nOctober 15, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letters of the 3rd instant and the 24th ultimo you may inform the Principal of the St. Paul's Residential School that the admission of the following children is approved:\n\nDonald Gros Ventre Boy\nBeatty Gros Ventre Boy\nPercy Old Shoes\n\nThe Department approves the discharge of pupils numbered as follows:\n\nNo. 189 No. 248 No. 0190\n\" 203 \" 0179 \" 0210\n\" 206 \" 0182 \" 0235\n\nThe name of Clarence M.

(RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 2)\nOctober 25, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant enclosing copy of letter which you recently issued to the Principals of the schools conducted under the auspices of the M.S.C.C. pointing out to them the necessity of having the official application form for the admission of an Indian child to a residential school signed by the Indian parent himself.\n\nThere is no clause in the Indian Act requiring application forms to be signed by the parent nor has any special regulation been issued in this regard.\n\nHowever, I would point out that the application form is directed to the Director of Indian Affairs and requires the signature of the father. The importance of securing this is emphasized by the following notation appearing on the application form:\n\n\"If mother or guardian signs Agent must forward full explanatory note.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOctober 28, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 11 and also copies of certain correspondence relating to the enrolment of pupils at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, Blood Reserve, Alberta, attached thereto.\n\nI desire to thank you for your courtesy in sending forward this information so promptly. I am particularly interested in Canon Middleton's assurance in his letter to you of September 27, which reads:\n\n\"you may rest assured that no application form will in future be submitted without the personal signature of the father or guardian indicated, even though we may have to wait many months for the sanction of the grant\".\n\nThe Department is prepared to accept this assurance and the officials here can see no reason why any delay should result in the enrolment of pupils by following this procedure. There is nothing on file here to indicate that delays in this connection occur at other residential schools where the regular procedure has been followed for years.\n\nYour remarks with respect to the unsatisfactory attendance at the St. Paul's School, particularly during the month of September, are under consideration by the officials of the Training Division. In view of the existing conditions on this reserve, it might be advisable to revert to the policy in force a few years ago. It is our intention to communicate with the Indian Agent in respect to this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. D. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian & Eskimo\nRes. School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\nThe Bible House, Alexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\nOctober 11, 1940\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 18th ult., No. 103-1-10, and my reply to the same on the 4th inst., I beg to state that I wrote to the Principal of our St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve, (Rev. Canon Middleton) on the 23rd ult., and have received his reply. Copies of both letters are enclosed herewith.\n\nAlthough your letter of the 18th ult. dealt only with the question of the enrolment of Elizabeth Healy at our St. Paul's School, you will note that in my letter to the Rev. Principal Middleton I also directed his attention to the delay on the part of pupils in returning to the School after the summer holidays, and this will explain why he has dealt, at some length, with this question in the early part of his letter.\n\nIt would appear from the Principal's letter that \"the system which had been evolved\" and which he states \"was very effective, and produced splendid results\" was not followed either last year or this, and as the system mentioned would seem to be in keeping with Section 10 of the Indian Act, our Commission would suggest that your Department's local representative be requested to give the principal some further assistance in the matter of having the pupils return promptly, than he appears to have done during the last two years.\nWith regard to the enrolment of the Indian girl Elizabeth Healy at St. Paul's School, I beg to state that our Commission at a meeting held on the 8th inst., after hearing and carefully considering the correspondence you so kindly forwarded to me in this connexion, along with the letter I addressed to the Principal, and his reply, instructed me to thank your Department for bringing to their attention the case of this Indian girl, and to express their regret that the signing of the official application form by the Principal on behalf of the Indian parent, instead of having the parent sign it himself, was not in conformity with the Department's regulations.\n\nI was also instructed to ask your Department to accept the Principal's statements (a) that the action he took in this case was one \"of good faith\", and (b) that \"no application form will in future be submitted without the personal signature of the father or guardian.\"\n\nWhile our Commission sincerely regret the action of the Principal in signing the official application form in this case, the members believe that he did so, as he says \"in good faith\", being requested to sign it by the mother of the child in question. Now that his attention has been so clearly directed to the mistake made and as he himself has declared that it has taught him a lesson, our Commission feel able to assure you that a similar mistake will not be repeated in the future.\n\nThe members were pleased to note Mr. Hoey's instruction in the second last paragraph of his letter to Mr. Indian Agent Pugh on May 16th, regarding the establishment of the religious status of the Indian girl Elizabeth Healy, and they also took careful note of the Reverend Principal Middleton's statement regarding \"the general practice which appears to have been followed at St. Paul's School in the enrolment of pupils\". It would appear from his letter to our Commission on the 27th ult. that any action he took in the past with regard to the enrolment of pupils was taken with the knowledge of the local Indian Agent, and that any misapprehension which may have arisen in this connexion might be corrected by reference to the application forms signed over a course of years.\n\nThe Commission share the regret expressed by the Reverend Principal Middleton in the closing paragraph of his letter to Mr. Indian Agent Pugh on April 26th last, regarding the undermining of the influence of various families on the Reserve, and which he states had become so dominant during the past few months. In this connexion I may say that I have before me specific information with regard to the payment of a bribe to an Anglican Indian parent to have his child admitted to a school not under our Church's management, and while our Commission greatly depurate any such conduct, they would be reluctant under prevailing world conditions, and especially in view of the titanic struggle in which our country and Empire are now engaged, to take any specific action in connexion with the same.\nAt the same time the members feel that they and the managements of their respective schools should have whatever protection your Department may be able to give them against such activities amongst your wards, and that the wards themselves should be permitted to exercise their indefeasible right of individual judgement in religious matters without either pressure or inducement of the kind mentioned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEnc. 2.\n\nTBRW/KH\nSept. 23, 1940.\n\nRev. Canon S. Middleton, B.Sq.\nPrincipal, St. Paul's School,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nDear Canon Middleton:\n\nWhen I was in Ottawa on the 18th inst., my attention was very clearly directed to two important matters in connection with your School, and I promised to write to you re the same as soon as I returned to Winnipeg.\n\n(1) The first was in connection with the delay on the part of the pupils returning to the School when it re-opened after the summer holidays. I was informed that in 1939 and 1940 approximately 100 children failed to return to the School on time. It was also reported to me that all the pupils of the Roman Catholic School did not return punctually, but the number who failed to do so was very much smaller than those of St. Paul's being only about 14 or thereabouts.\n\nWhen Mr. Hoey mentioned this matter to me he expressed very real concern over the evil effects which the apparent lack of interest on the part of the Indian parents in their children's education might have on the Government's policy re the Indian Residential School system. He pointed out that despite the heavy expenditure incurred by the Government in providing buildings and equipment, and the lengthening of the summer vacation to two months, the failure of the parents to return their children promptly for the re-opening of School could only be interpreted as a lack of real interest in their educational welfare.\n\nIf you can furnish me with any specific cause why the children were not returned promptly, so that I may quote the same when writing to Ottawa, I will be grateful if you will do so.\n\n(2) The second matter was in connection with the signing by you of the father's name on the applications for admission of children to the School. This matter was brought to my attention by both Mr. Hoey and Mr. MacInnes, and I was given to understand by them that they took a decidedly serious view of this action on your part.\n\nI asked that copies of all correspondence relating to this matter be forwarded to me, and have just received the following, with a covering letter from Mr. MacInnes, the Secretary:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n(a) Your letter to Mr. Indian Agent Pugh on April 26th last.\n\n(b) Mr. Pugh's letter of May 10th last (apparently addressed to Ottawa) dealing specifically with the case of pupil no. 0285, Elizabeth Healy, of the St. Paul's Anglican School, admitted to the Blood R.C. School.\n\n(c) Mr. Hoey's letter of May 16th addressed to Mr. Pugh, one paragraph of which reads as follows:\n\n\"The Principal states that this procedure in his judgment was orthodox and legitimate. Let me state very frankly that in the judgment of the Department his action was neither legal, orthodox nor legitimate and that this Department is not prepared to cooperate with a principal who follows this procedure in the enrolment of pupils at his school. May I point out further that if other applications have been sent in, signed by the Principal rather than by the parent in each case these application forms, in the judgment of the Department, are null and void and that new application forms should be sent in at once.\"\n\nThe letter is quite a lengthy one and as I assume you have been advised of its contents by Mr. Pugh, I am not sending you a copy of it.\n\nFrom my conversation with the Departmental officials mentioned, I gathered that they considered your action in signing \"dozens and dozens in the past\" on behalf of the Indian parents on the application forms, was actionable. The word \"forgery\" was actually used to describe it.\n\nAs I had no previous knowledge whatever of the situation, I was unable to offer any satisfactory explanation and am now writing for the specific purpose of securing from you any explanations you may be able to give, and which I could forward to Ottawa in the hope of having the matter cleared up and settled.\n\nIf the course you have been following had the approval of any former Indian agent, I think it would be well to mention such. I also think it would be well for you to embody in your reply a promise that henceforth no Indian parent's name will be signed by you on any application form for the admission of children to your School.\n\nAs Mr. Hoey in his letter to Mr. Pugh on May 16th embodied the following statement:-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n\"I am exceedingly anxious that you should discuss very fully and very frankly with the principal not only the case of Elizabeth Healy, but the general practice which appears to have been followed at St. Paul's School in the enrolment of pupils\".\n\nI will be glad to know if the discussion suggested has already taken place, and if so, the result of the same.\n\nWhile I am very sorry indeed to have to trouble you with these matters, especially at a time when you are labouring under the handicap of impaired health, I feel sure you will realize that they are of sufficient importance to receive prompt and careful attention if we are to restore the confidence and maintain the good will of the officers of the Indian Affairs Branch of Government.\n\nTrusting that your health continues to improve and with kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nTBR*KH\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nST. PAUL'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nRev. Canon S.H. Middleton, B.Sc.\nPrincipal\n\nBLOOD RESERVE - CARDSTON, ALBERTA.\n\nSeptember 27, 1940.\n\nThe Secretary,\nInd. Res. Sc. Commission,\nThe Bible House, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMany thanks for your letter of the 23rd, inst.\nMay I reply to the last paragraph first, a part of the quo-\ntation which reads:\n\n\"to restore the confidence and\nmaintain the goodwill of the\nofficers\".\n\nUntil having read your letter I was totally\noblivious that there was any lack of confidence and goodwill.\nAs a matter of fact, judging from personal experience, I had\nalways considered it just the opposite. I am very pleased\nindeed that an opportunity has been given to discuss the\npoints mentioned.\n\n1. For many years past, there has always been a\nslackness in having the students returned to School after\nthe vacation, on time. In order to facilitate a speedy return\na system had been evolved, several years ago, that whenever\nparents were negligent in their duty, they were served with\na summons and given two days grace, failing to comply a\npenalty of two dollars was imposed. Such a policy was very\neffective, and produced splendid results. Last year, however,\nand again this year, for some reason or other, the Indian\nAgent did not issue the accustomed summons, and the Indians\ntook advantage of the apparent lack of law enforcement. An\nIndian (at least, the Bloods) will always respond to the\nlaw when he knows there is a penalty attached, but if there\nis the least possible loop-hole of escape he will trespass\nto the limit. The fact of non-issue of a summons gave the\nIndians the idea that they could more or less suit their own\nconvenience and time, and when they realised that no law would\napplied, it left them masters of the situation. Time or date\nis of no consequence to the Indian mind, and one day is just\nas good as another on which to return their children.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nThe figures quoted regarding the Roman and our School are quite arbitrary, and have no real significance. The Roman School has always been at more or less the centre of the Reserve. In our case we have been at the two extremes. The Romans had their recruits from their immediate vicinity\u2014ours were mostly from around the Old Agency, some forty miles north of here. Moreover, most of the absentees mentioned were working with the parents off the Reserve at and around Lethbridge\u2014Picture Butte\u2014Raymond\u2014Magrath and Stirling, in the Beet fields. Most of the Indians from around the Old Agency, amongst whom we have numerous students, are not resident farmers like those settled around the Schools; they are nomads, and follow that mode of life accordingly, which accounts for our peculiar difficulty by not having the children returned on time.\n\nI have sent riders and messengers out to these various Camps, beseeching the return of the children. Even today the car is again chasing through Picture Butte and Lethbridge to Taber, a distance of some hundred and twenty odd miles from the School, in order to pick up any absentees. Such is a costly procedure in both time and gasoline. Whereas, past experience proved, that the issue of a summons was effective. To state at the outset that approximately 100 students failed to return on time, leaves the matter unsettled, especially, when after driving several hundred miles, in search of them, the majority were in residence after the first two weeks. It takes time to travel through these neighbouring towns, and the difficulty is increased when Indians, having a boy earning a dollar or so a day, deliberately hide him on arrival.\n\nI am convinced after thirty years amongst the Bloods, that if the Students are to be returned on time, a penalty must be enforced for failure of observance. Such an Act is common with White Schools. For years past there has always been a Standing Departmental order, that in case of an absentee, the authorities of the School were requested to notify the Indian Agent, who in turn would exercise his authority and have the student returned. Such apparently is not now in force.\n\nAs you have a copy of my letter, April 26, addressed to the Indian Agent, there is nothing more to be said in that connection. Am rather inclined to think, however, the whole matter has been presented in the wrong light, and in consequence is being taken too literal and impersonal. The import of Mr. Hoey's letter May 16, written to the Indian Agent, is essentially legal and academic. Such an aspect has never occurred to me when complying with the numerous requests made to me by these Indians. When I used the term of \"signing dozens in the past\", it was made from the mental picture of office and camp procedure. Time and\nagain, when asking the Indian to sign the Application Form, he will remain seated, and state quite innocently\u2014\"Ksestoa, sotim sinakit\" \u2014meaning\u2014\"You sign it\". It was under such circumstances, that Mrs. Healy requested me to sign the Form indicated. Working with these people, day in and day out, year in and year out, a policy of trust and confidence must be acquired, otherwise one's labour is in vain. Never have I experienced an Indian recreant to his pledged word before. Such has taught me a lesson.\n\nThe term used in the quoted paragraph\u2014\"A principal who follows this procedure in the enrolment of his pupils\"\u2014is not very gratifying to a man who has given more than thirty years of bitter hard service on behalf of the Indian. My record amongst the Bloods is not to be judged by the weakness of one particular Indian, who was obviously coerced into this act of betrayal. If the act of my signing the Form was not legal, it was at the least, an act of good faith, and I am quite willing to accept the decision of the Department. Nevertheless, I wish to be quite frank and openly state, that I do not like to feel that something is being read into the signing of this application, which does not exist. There was no ulterior motive whatsoever, and had the Indian been allowed to follow his own inclination, he would never have made application to have his child transferred to the Roman School, especially when his other children were here and this was the School of himself and fore-bears.\n\nI ought to state that the sentiments expressed by Mr. Hoey had not been communicated to me, until I received your letter. I wish they had, as I would have hastened to write further. There is always the possibility when writing through the medium of the Agency Office of one's attitude and desire being unintentionally misinterpreted.\n\nYou may rest assured that no Application Form, will in future be submitted without the personal signature of the father or guardian indicated, even though we may have to wait many months for the sanction of the Grant.\n\nI cannot close without refuting the statement made by Mr. Hoey in his letter to the Indian Agent\u2014\"the general practice which appears to have been followed at St. Paul's School in the enrolment of pupils\".\u2014\u2014Mr. Pugh knows that such is not the practice, and I cannot understand why he has allowed the opinion to prevail.\n\nSuch is not and never has been the practice. I have always given the Indian the benefit of his inherent privileges.\nSecretary, Ind. Res. Commission,\n\nSeptember 27th, 1940.\n\nNo one has fought for the Indian's rights, more than I have done. I regret very deeply that such a construction has been placed where it was not deserved. One has only to turn back the Application Forms signed over a course of years, to correct the misapprehension. I am very thankful you wrote me about this matter, which has now given me an opportunity of correcting a situation which did not; has not, and never will exist while I remain at the School.\n\nI trust you will place the whole question before the Department in the same candid manner that I have stated the above. If there is anything further, I shall be only too pleased to state any facts and not fancies bearing on the case.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) Canon Middleton.\n(Principal)\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nJune 14th, 1960\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the St. Paul's Anglican Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child ..............................................................

(RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa,\nSeptember 3, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your telegram of the 2nd instant, requesting approval for transferring Grant Allen Tailfeathers, No. 224, from the St. Paul's Indian Residential School to the Shingwauk Residential School, in order that he might attend high school at the latter place.\n\nFor some years past the Department has been assisting Gerald Tailfeathers, who is a brother of Grant. As you are aware, there are approximately 19,000 Indian children attending Indian schools throughout Canada and the amount provided for advanced education is very limited. As a result the Department has not deemed it advisable to grant assistance to two children in the one family at the same time. Under the circumstances we are not prepared to approve the transfer of Grant Allen Tailfeathers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, September 4, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nRe: Allan Tail Feathers\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 2nd instant and note that Mr. Phelan has already communicated with you in respect to the transfer of the above-noted pupil to the Shingwauk Home Residential School.\n\nInasmuch, however, as requests similar to this one will reach you from time to time, I am anxious that you should understand the policy of the Department, for the time being at least, in respect to special grants to pupils proceeding with high school or vocational studies. We have, in the appropriations from year to year, a comparatively small amount of approximately $20,000.00 from which we assist deserving pupils and out of which we pay the cost of delinquent Indian boys and girls of school age who are committed to correctional institutions from time to time. At this season of the year, hundreds of requests for scholarship grants reach us, from church authorities, principals of residential schools and Indian agents. These requests are very, very carefully reviewed and the limited funds at our disposal disbursed with the utmost care. It is just possible that a larger sum should be placed at our disposal to encourage a greater number of pupils to proceed with advanced studies, but, at the present time, as you can readily imagine, it is exceedingly difficult to secure funds for services other than those directly connected with the war effort.\n\nI note your intention to transfer Allan Tail Feathers from the Blood Reserve to Shingwauk Home. Railway facilities at the present time are so congested that this season Civil Servants were not permitted to travel by rail unless special permission to do so had been\n\nReverend H. A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House, 184 Alexander Ave,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\ngranted. It would be exceedingly difficult, therefore, to transfer a boy this distance, by rail, to permit him to proceed with ordinary high school studies. I have had a feeling for some time\u2014and I still have it\u2014that our field officials, particularly in the outlying districts, do not fully realize the seriousness of the crisis in which we still find ourselves. In the case of this pupil, however, our decision not to transfer him was based mainly on the fact that we had helped his brother substantially during the last two or three years. We did not consider that it would be at all fair to help another member of the family with so many deserving cases asking for assistance. In discussing this matter with principals of residential schools, I think it should be emphasized that while the Department is prepared to help to the utmost extent possible, the parents of Indian pupils should also be encouraged to make a contribution. A large number of Indian pupils have been helped by the Department in recent years. I regret to state, however, that only a comparatively small number of these pupils made a success of life. My own opinion is that these pupils would realize more fully the privilege of attending high school or of taking advanced vocational courses if the parents made a contribution. Human beings seldom appreciate fully gifts bestowed upon them without effort on their own part.\n\nI have written at considerable length, with the feeling that you would be anxious to know the attitude of the Department in respect to this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

She is now taking Grade 9. She has attended Crescent Heights High School, Calgary, Alta., for her Grade 9 work to date. She obtained her Grade 8 standing from the Lacombe Home School, Midnapore, Alta. Her Grade 7 standing was obtained partly through our Day School and partly by the Dept. of Education Extension courses.

Rounds\nsee letter turned out\nRe: TRUANTS from St. Paul's School, Cardston\n\n1. On the 5th inst., Canon Middleton of the Blood Indian Reserve, Cardston, reported that the following Indian children had been absent from St. Paul's school since the Christmas holidays: Hugh CALF ROBE, Tiny CALF ROBE, Isabel SHADE, Ralph BOTTLE, Christine HEALY, Dora HEALY, and Henry STANDING LIONE. Canon Middleton requested that the parents of these children be instructed to return these children to school.\n\n2. On the afternoon of the 5th inst., I patrolled to the River Bottom near Lethbridge where a large number of Indians are camped, and interviewed Mrs. Calf Robe, Joe Shade and Mrs. Bull Shields where all of these children were located. In each case they stated that they did not have the bus fare to send the children back to school until such time as their husbands received their cheques, which would be on the afternoon of the 5th or the 6th, and that the children would be returned to Cardston on the afternoon bus of the 6th or 7th insts.\n\n3. When at the River Bottom on the afternoon of the 8th inst., I made further enquiries and learned that approximately 12 Indian children, pupils of the two Indian schools, on the Blood reserve had left by bus on the 6th and 7th January and would return to their respective schools on their return to Cardston. Included in this number were those referred to above.\n\n4.

It was learned that Ben Calf Robe left the River Bottom on the night of the 23rd, or morning of the 23rd, for Carleton and it is thought that he had the boy with him. The boy could not be located in the River Bottom or in Lethbridge where the Indians generally are found.\n\n3. Mrs. George Prairie Chicken also left on the morning of the 23rd May, for Carleton, she did not however take Gilbert Standing Alone with her. According to the information I received from the Indians, Gilbert Standing Alone works in the Cosmopolitan Cafe, Lethbridge where he has been employed for the past year. I questioned this Indian who stated his name was Gilbert Standing Alone and that he is 16 years of age. He stated however that he had a brother Henry Standing Alone who is going to School in Carleton. It was learned that Henry Standing Alone is in Mrs. George Prairie Chicken's Camp. Louise Prairie Chicken, daughter of Mrs. George Prairie Chicken, was warned to send Henry Standing Alone back to School, on the bus leaving Lethbridge on the afternoon of May 24th, this she has promised to do.\n\n4. Ben Calf Robe will be interviewed on his return to Lethbridge, and if he has not taken his boy back to the school he will be instructed to do so immediately.\n\nSTILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.\n\nJ.J.

Hunt stated he had no money at that time to send the child by bus, and wondered why the school did not pick the child up. I informed Hunt that it was his duty to get the child to the school, but if he could not get the money for bus fare to sell at this detachment the following day, and we would see what arrangements could be made. He did not sell, and I have not visited his camp since.\n\n2.

Police Sub-Division,\nLETHBRIDGE, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is advised that on Saturday evening I interviewed the N.C.O. 1/c of your CARDSTON Detachment with reference to the serving of Truancy Notices under Section 10 (Sub Sections 3, 4, 5, & 6) of the Indian Act as indicated in my letter to you of the 12th of Sept. last, File #4028.\n\nFrom the conversation with Corporal Pesce, it would appear that Departmental Circular #18-1 of June 25th, 1943, in effect, precludes utilizing the services of the R.C.M.P. Police except in rare and exceptional cases, and therefore explanation is desired as to what action the schools have taken in regard to absent children, and in this connection I may say that both schools and the agency have kept the subject matter before the Indians, and both Principals have done considerable driving and bringing in of children, but other than the use of moral persuasion, there is no authoritative action they can take, hence our request.\nRe: Indian Act (Truancy), Indian Residential School, Blood Indian Reserve, Alberta.\n\nWe forward herewith copies of correspondence received regarding truancy at Indian Residential Schools, Blood Indian Reserve, Alberta.\n\n2. May I draw your attention to your departmental circular No. 15-1 dated June 21, 1943, instructing school principals, Indian Agents and members of agency staffs to accept responsibility for the return of pupils absent without permission and only to request the services of this Force in rare and exceptional cases.\n\n3. Would you kindly advise whether you intended the Indian Agent at Cardston, Alberta, to turn over the entire 51 Truancy Notices to this Force for service, as it would appear that the appointment of a Truant Officer for the agency concerned would satisfactorily answer the problem of truancy of the degree indicated by the number of Truancy Notices handed over by Mr. Pugh at Cardston.\n\n4. It would be appreciated if we may receive your comments in this regard at your earliest convenience.\n\nH.M. Gagnon,\nAssistant Commissioner,\nDirector, Criminal Investigation.\n\nTO: The Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, 13th October, 1945.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Indian Act (Truancy), Indian Residential School, Blood Indian Reserve, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the action taken by the Indian Agent at Cardston, Alberta, in requesting your force to serve 51 Truancy Notices.\n\nAs we have experienced considerable difficulty in having the Indian children return to the two schools on the Blood Reserve, it is felt that this is an exceptional case and your usual kind co-operation would be very much appreciated.\n\nDirector.\nOFFICE ROUTINE.\n\nIn the general routine of the office, the work has been heavy also, with the additional work of Family Allowances. This has now been set up in concrete form, with copies of the original Application forms, indexed with their No. and Treaty numbers inserted on the same form, this has also been transferred to our Roll Records. All cheques are brought to the Agency mail box, and before distribution, the receipt of the cheque is indicated on a check list month by month. All changes by way of births and deaths are noted on the forms, and the copy of Vital Statistics sent forward to the Family Allowance branch at Edmonton. A list has now been sent forward showing the names and birth date of all children over the full age of 7 years, indication whether the child is at school or not, and if not in attendance, showing the reason for non-attendance.\n\nApplications at present in the hands of this Department number 217 families, with 742 children, as at Sept. 25th, 48 children have not been applied for at this date.\n\nOf the list of children who should attend school, to which we refer to above, it is found, that 127 attend St. Paul's School and 161 attend the Blood RC school according to their nominal rolls, and we find 135 children over the age of 7 full years are not in attendance at any school, with 23 children who are being discharged this quarter ending. The preparation of these statistics has entailed considerable extra work.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING SEPTEMBER 20th, 1945, ON BLOOD INDIAN AGENCY\n\nGENERAL ADMINISTRATION\n\nA close check up of the school attendance has been made and special letters to the branch have gone forward touching upon this subject. The attendance for the month was very disappointing, and we have had to resort to Truance notices, and some reluctance regarding the serving of the notices by the RCMP was dealt with, also by special letter.\n\nJ.E.

The Principal advises us that many Indians from the Blood Reserve have crossed the border by reason of high wages and that the children have not returned to school since the Summer. The break in their educational progress is serious and we are disappointed at the loss of income at a time when we are struggling to avoid still further increasing the heavy Bank Overdraft of our Commission.\n\nMay I request that you assist us by taking the matter up with the Agent concerned and giving him authority to put pressure upon those parents who are within reach and are failing in their duty. Principal Middleton tells us that the Agent is reluctant to act without support from the Department. Possibly under war conditions it was not wise to try to enforce attendance, but I cannot help feeling that any breakdown in the Indian recognition of authority will have serious consequences. When some can ignore the law with impunity others become unsettled and are emboldened to follow their example.\n\nCommending this situation to your usual consideration,\n\nand with kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nP.S.

Pugh, Indian Agent,\nBlood Indian Reserve,\nCARDSTON, Alberta.\n\nRe: MICHAEL PLUME - Aged 9 Years.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI examined the above named boy at the Blood Indian Hospital last evening and again this afternoon.\n\nHe was admitted to Hospital yesterday about 3.00 PM. with a nasty condition of both Feet. The underside of the Right Foot was inflamed and swollen from a First degree Frostbite. There were three denuded areas on the underside surface of the Right Foot that had been frozen and the skin worn off from walking on them. One raw surface under the ball of the Foot was an inch and a quarter wide by two and a half inches long; the one on the heel was the size of a silver dollar whilst that under the big toe was the size of a two-bit piece. The undersurface of the other toes of the right Foot had first degree frost-bites.\n\nOn the Left Foot the three middle toes showed first degree frost-bites on the undersurface, a denuded frosted area on the heel was the size of a silver dollar.\n\nHis temperature on Admission was 100.4; this morning it was normal; and at 2.00PM today it was 99.6. His Heart and Chest were both normal, his appetite good and he was quite stoical as he did not complain. His hair had been cropped quite short, but on examination I could find no evidence of nits or vermin, and the Nurse said that there was no evidence of any in his under-wear.\n\nWe are treating the Feet for the condition found, and also prophylactic for a possible pneumonic condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSIGNED: Jas.

Pugh, Esq.,\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCARDSTON, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is to inform you that yesterday afternoon, I inspected the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School, and found the children in a good state of health.\n\nThere are a few that require some minor treatments such as Tonsils and Teeth removed, and one large girl with a chronic appendicitis condition, this latter case is being operated upon tomorrow.\n\nI checked also re. Head and Body vermin, and find that the School is clear. It was explained to me that an occasional small child will come in from home with a vermin affliction, but that they attend to these cases at once. I noticed that one child had been so treated, and whose hair had been cropped.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd: Jas. A. Key. M.D.\nOttawa, March 20, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI desire to refer you to your letter of February 1st and my reply of February 9th with reference to securing additional pupils at the St. Paul's Residential School.\n\nIndian Agent Pugh reports that four of the five pupils taken to the United States by their parents have now returned and have been taken to the school. The Indian Agent also assures me that he is doing everything possible to secure more pupils for this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend H.A.

Dr. Alderwood, Secretary of the M.S.C.C., in connection with the pupilage at the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School, this Agency.\n\nIn reply it is advised that the matter has received the attention of this writer for some time, since my return to duty on this Agency, and I desire to make the following comments.\n\nIndians in U.S.A. The families effected were as follows:\n\nRound Woman - Treaty #416 - Pupils, Eve Delaney #263 & Adam 249.\nChas. Eagle Speaker #115 - Do. Eliza No. 0323 & Lula No. 0324.\nJoe Shade #269 - Do. Isabel No. 0322.\n\nOf these pupils, Eve and Adam Delaney - Elizabeth & Lula Eagle Speaker have returned to the School, the latter 2 pupils by Railway Warrant issued by this Office (P 860), the parents did not return.\n\nIn the case of Eve and Adam Delaney, the family returned just prior to Xmas, and the parents were served with Truancy Notices and are now in School. Isabel Shade is still in the U.S.A with her parents.\n\nYour Agent, at the beginning of the School Term, sent Truancy Notices signed by self - to Minor Chief Percy Creighton in the U.S.A. requesting that he serve same, but as the families were in different locations, this could not be done.\n\nThe Following children:\n\nIrwin Shade #318; Lillian Pig Sorrel Horse #267; Olive Creighton #0265; Ruth Wings #0278; Florence Jessel Fat #0297; Rosalie Tail Feather #0305; & Harvina Madsworth #0253, have all been excused by Medical Officer Jas. A. Key, M.D., C.M., as a result of T.B. Surveys, so 22 Truancy Notices have been served for Pupils of this School the following have not returned to the School: Wayne Plume & Isabel Shade; a total of 26 Absentees, the balance are children who have been in School or Truanted since since entering - 15.\n\nThere is a tendency among a number of Indians to keep their children out for Family Allowances reasons, and our Medical Officer advises me that his Office Calls doubled at the beginning of the School Term for Medical Certificates for children of School age.\n\nIt will be recalled that, under date of September 25th, 1945, File 402-11B, the matter of serving Truancy Notices was referred to the Branch, but no reply was received, the NGO i/c of the Carleton Detachment RCMP however informed me that he had received instructions from his Commanding Officer to serve Notices (I may add that the NGO did carry on serving Notices.)\n\nTo further the cause, I discussed the subject matter with the Council of the Blood Band (See Council Meeting Minutes of Jan. 10th, 1946), I was informed by one Councillor - Joe Bullshields, that the reason it was so difficult to get the children into School, was, that the Indians looked upon the School as a Penitentiary, all of which information I discussed with the Principal.\n\nIn contrast to this,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 2)\nIn contrast to this, the Branch will have noted that the Blood R.C. School proffered 20 Applications at the December end of quarter, and this was pointed out to the Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School in an effort to try and find out why the difference.\n\nI have prepared 32 Truancy Notices for 34 Pupils, some 7 of these are being served at Lethbridge, and the remainder I still hold at this Office. All of these are for new admissions, and I have been hesitant to have such Notices served by the Truancy method in the first instance of joining the School, especially so in view of the fact that an applicant has to be signed for Admission. This point was discussed by me with the Principal.\n\nThe matter of monthly Holidays I am also informed mitigates against enrollment of pupils, but such has been the case at the Blood R.C. School.\n\nI may also state that a number of boys have been escaping this School, usually in the late evening or early night, and Truancy Notices have been served in these instances. I attach herewith a report on a recent escapee from the School, by Doctor J.M.A. Key who I requested to examine the pupil after I had kicked the boy up and conveyed him to Hospital. This lad got out of the School by the \"sheet\" method, dressed in his under-wear and socks only, consequently he was in very poor condition. I noted that this lad had had his hair cropped short and I gained the impression that Hair Vermin were present in the School and I requested Doctor Key to visit the School and render me a Report, this also is attached.\n\nThe foregoing suggests that it has been a problem with both your Agent and the Principal, and the remedy does lie in \"Using Force\" Apparently. It is felt that if Family Allowances were cut-off at the age of Seven years, which was carried out by your Agent (but later instructed to re-instate payments), might assist somewhat.\n\nIf the Branch consider that Truancy Notices should be served on parents for the enrollment in the Schools in the first instance, the Notices that I have prepared will be handed to the R.C.M.P. Police for service, and Prosecutions will follow of parents not complying.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ. E.

The parents of the two Chief Moon families, Wayne Plume and father, and parents of Curly Rider, are directly responsible for the non-return of their children. I have visited these homes on many occasions - day and night - and some excuse is always made about their non-attendance.\n\nThe Police have served Warrants -- but all to no avail. Constituted law and authority are utterly disregarded. Repeated visits have been made after the Warrants have been issued -- and yet the children are withheld. The fact of these people defying the law month after month, has produced a similar reaction amongst other parents. If prosecution was carried into effect immediately the Statutory limit expired, an abiding respect for the School regulations would be established; but so long as they are allowed the indulgence of disregarding an official Police Warrant duly served -- respect and enforcement become in-effective.\n\nAnother factor which has contributed towards desertion is the refusal to allow an occasional -- festive -- or monthly holiday.\n\nThe Schools on the near-by and kindred Reserves have their weekly holiday. The Bloods, visiting backward and forward with their friends on these Reserves, resent their children being stigmatised by not receiving similar privileges to those of neighbouring Schools. The Chiefs -- the Head Men and Counsellors of the Tribe have, since the ban was placed on holidays, referred to our Schools as Prisons. Such is not conducive to mutual\ninterests, not does it tend to develop an acceptable esprit de corps.\n\nI am writing this as a matter of information.\n\nIf there is no improvement in the \"T.B.\" patients, now receiving treatment at the Edmonton Hospital, would recommend their discharge at the end of the School year. In the other cases, speedy apprehension and return to School.\n\nNumbers and names on Form #411 have been recorded as from the Returns.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSHM/PMH.

When forwarding these, he reports as follows:\n\n\"These applications have been completed with the exception of the signature of the father. Although these three children are attending the St. Paul's school at the present time the fathers, Victor and Dan Chief Moon will not sign the applications; they will give no reason for not doing so.\n\nThese applications are forwarded in duplicate at this time for your instructions regarding cases of this sort. We have others on the reserve who also refuse to sign and therefore would like to have your definite instructions.\"\n\nWe are in doubt about what action should be taken in this particular instance. We have always insisted on the parent or guardian signing the application form, not only for the purpose of showing that the admission of the child is desired by the one particularly interested in the child, but also for protection of the Department and the school management.\n\n.......2\nOnce the application form is signed by the parent or guardian, the Department has the right to decide the length of time the child shall remain in the school. If we accept children without the signed application forms, it would appear that legally we would have no control over them whatsoever, and any time their parent or guardian takes the opinion that the child should be taken out of the school, he would, presumably, have the legal right to do so. If such action is carried on by several persons, it would have a very upsetting effect on the school routine as well as on the child or children concerned.\n\nBefore making a final decision in this particular instance, we would like to have your views on the matter.\n\nPP/ST\n\nEncs.\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nRe: St. Paul's Residential School\n\nI have yours of the 21st, file 764-10 (El) to which you attached two applications for admission which have not been signed by a parent or guardian. From what information I have been able to obtain, Victor and Dan Chief Moon are peculiar in that they have invariably refused to sign application forms, even when they had no complaint with the school administration.\n\nAt the present time there are innumerable complaints about the school administration and recent reports from senior officers who have visited this school, are that it is not improving. Under such conditions I cannot recommend that the parents of these children be forced to comply with the requirements of admission.\n\nIt appears that the boy and the girl from these homes are attending and in residence at St. Paul's School, and that the parents are satisfied to leave them there. In our opinion the per capita grant should, therefore, be paid to the school.\n\nIn conclusion, it is my experience that at a well-administered residential school, where life is made attractive to the pupils and their progress and happiness is evident to the parents, there will rarely be any that will refuse to sign the application; in fact the reverse is becoming the rule; i.e., applications are made by parents for admission to schools which are over-crowded and they are forced to wait their turn.\n\nI am returning the application forms and would suggest that you file them and pay the per capita grant.\n\nG.H.

Ragan,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.,\n\nWith reference to the June Quarterly Return for the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, it is noted that the Principal has claimed 30 days grant for pupil # 0398 and has indicated that this pupil was admitted to the school on March 15, 1952.\n\nIt will be readily understood that there are 91 days in the quarter, consequently if this pupil was in residence for the full quarter, the Principal should have claimed 91 days. It is presumed, therefore, that the pupil was out of residence for a period of 61 days; however, the Principal has neglected to indicate the dates in this regard. Please inform the Principal that on all future returns he must show the dates and account for absences when he claims less than the prescribed number of days in the quarter.\n\nThe Principal has claimed 62 days grant for pupil # 0400. This should have read 61 days. We are amending the return in this respect. The Principal has claimed 61 days for pupil # 333 which is less than the prescribed number of days in the quarter. Please advise the date these pupils left the residence and later returned if they did.\n\nOn the Return the Principal has included a number of pupils who are either in a Public School or have been truant for three to seven quarters. We have one pupil who has been in the Charles Camsell Hospital for\nten quarters or a period of two and one-half years. It would be appreciated if on your next visit to the school you would review the Quarterly Return with the Principal and discuss the pupils concerned and if you decide that any of these pupils will not be returning to the St. Paul's school you should instruct the Principal to include them on the September Quarterly Return and Form I.A. 411 requesting their discharge and when their discharge is approved, these children should be dropped from future returns.\n\nYou may advise the Principal that we are allowing 213 days from September 1 to April 30, 1952 for Delphine Morning Owl as requested.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\n\nRe: George Good Striker, Aged - 16 years,\nTreaty No. 158.\n\nGeorge Good Striker graduated from the St. Paul's Anglican School last year. His father is deceased and his mother, who is living, is Anglican. His brother, Rufus Good Striker, is Anglican, but Rufus' wife is Roman Catholic and all the Rufus Good Striker children have been baptized Roman Catholic.\n\nGeorge Good Striker wishes to go to Day School at the Blood R.C. Residential School this year in Grade 8 and reside at his brother's home which is a \u00bc of a mile from the Blood R.C. School. George's mother and his brother both request that he be allowed to attend the R.C. School as a day pupil. Rev. D.S. Pitts, Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican Residential School, objects to George Good Striker attending the Blood R.C. School as a day pupil as he stated he could attend the St. Paul's Anglican School as a residential pupil and take Grade 8.\n\nAs a graduate of the Residential School, has Mr. Good Striker permission to attend any Day School he likes or should he attend the St. Paul's Anglican School as a residential pupil in Grade 8? The Goodstrikers, of course, state that they do not wish George to attend as a residential pupil.\n\nP.S. We agree to be\n\nR.D. Ragan,\nSuperintendent,\nBlood Indian Reserve,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration.\nOctober 1, 1952.\n\nMr. R.D. Regan,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 22nd regarding the admission of George Goodstriker to the Blood R.C. Indian Residential School as a day pupil in order that he may continue his grade eight education, you are advised that our records do not indicate that this boy was discharged from the St. Paul's Indian Residential School where he was previously enrolled as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nUnless we receive a request for the discharge of this boy from the St. Paul's Indian Residential School his admission to the Blood R.C. School can not be considered.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOctober 1, 1952.\n\nR.D. Ragan, Esq.,\nSuperintendent Blood Reserve,\nCARDSTON, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Ragan:\n\nRe 0349, Marion Rose Goodstriker, omitted from Quarterly Returns ending June 1952.\n\nThis girl's name, admittance, etc. is very similar to No. 0345, Doreen Goodstriker, and was inadvertently omitted from the returns. We would request that an adjustment be made on the present quarterly returns, so as to include grant for this pupil for the 91 days of the Second Quarter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.,\n\nWith reference to the September Quarterly Return for the St. Paul's Indian Residential School as we have not received the necessary applications for admission for pupils O4O2 and O4O5, the admission of these children to the St. Paul's School has not been approved. We have, therefore disallowed the Per Capita Grant for these children.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would obtain the necessary applications for admission for these children and forward them to this office for consideration. When the admissions are approved the Principal may then claim retroactive grant for these children on the December Quarterly Return.\n\nYou may also advise the Principal that we have allowed 183 days grant for pupil # 0349 as this pupil's name was inadvertently omitted from the June Quarterly Return.\n\nAs pupil # 335 was in residence during the month of June 1952, the school is entitled to sixty-two days grant for him on the September Quarterly Return. Please advise the Principal that we have allowed this grant.\n\nAs pupil # 403 was not in residence during June we have disallowed grant claimed for July and August. We are paying thirty days grant for this pupil on the September Return.\nIt is noted that pupils # 322, 331 and 383 have not been in residence for a considerable time. It would be appreciated if you would review this case with the Principal and if it is evident that these children will not be returning to school for some time, steps should be taken to ask for their discharge and removal from the Quarterly Returns.\n\nThe Department approves the admission of the following pupils to the St. Paul's School:\n\nStanley Healy\nDell Morris Healy\nGray Horses\nPatsy Darlene Good Striker\nAlice Old Shoes\nMartin Good Rider\n\nThe discharge of the following is approved:\n\n| #   | #   | #   |\n|-----|-----|-----|\n| 0362| 367 | 387 |\n| 0368| 382 | 0310|\n| 404 | 379 | 0311|\n| 362 | 384 | 0326|\n| 0343| 0352| 0353|\n| 0354| 0358| 0372|\n| 0383| 316 | 320 |\n| 333 | 334 | 341 |\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Emily Wesley - Morley Reserve.\n\nThis girl, 21 years of age, has recently been discharged from the Camsell Hospital with the recommendation that she continue with her schooling as a means of rehabilitation.

(RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-10, part 3)\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Eagle Speaker Family\n\nThis family is from the Blood Agency in the Province of Alberta. Both parents are living. In 1951 Peggy and Mary Elizabeth Eagle Speaker were admitted to the St. Paul (C.E.) Indian Residential School. Applications for admission received at that time indicated that the family was of the Anglican Faith. These applications were signed by the father, Tom Eagle Speaker.\n\nThese children remained in the St. Paul's (C.E.) School until June 30, 1952. They did not return to this school in September 1952 and as far as we know are not attending any school at the present time. Attached is a letter marked \"A\", signed by Tom Eagle Speaker requesting that his children Peggy and Mary Elizabeth attend the St. Mary's (R.C.) (Blood) Indian Residential School.\n\nAttached is a memorandum marked \"B\" signed by Father L. Lavern, O.M.I., of the Blood R.C. Residential School regarding the marriage and baptisms of the Eagle Speakers.\n\nAttached are copies of correspondence between Superintendent Regan and the Superintendent of Education regarding these children.\n\nIt would be appreciated if a ruling were given on Mr. Eagle Speaker's request that his children be placed in the Blood R.C. Indian Residential School.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM FOR:\n\nMAJOR MACKAY\n\nRe: Eagle Speaker Family\n\nPlease refer to your memorandum of November 21st regarding the above-mentioned family. It is noted that during the scholar year 1951-52 Peggy and Mary Elizabeth Eagle Speaker were admitted to the St. Paul (C.E.) Indian Residential School as at that time the application indicated that the family was of the Anglican faith.\n\nOn August 8, the father Tom Eagle Speaker signed a document requesting that his daughters attend the St. Mary Roman Catholic School during the 1952-53 school term.\n\nIn deciding what school these children should attend, it is necessary to determine the religion of the father. It would appear from the certificate signed by Father Lavern that the father and mother were baptized Roman Catholics and that they were married according to the Roman Catholic rites in 1937. From this evidence it would appear that both parents are Roman Catholics, and consequently their children should attend a school conducted under the Roman Catholic auspices.\n\n(Sgd) Laval Fortier.\nOttawa, December 22, 1952.\n\nMr. R.D. Ragan,\nSuperintendent Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nThe request for the admission of Peggy and Mary Elizabeth Eagle Speaker to the Blood R.C. Indian Residential School has been received and carefully considered. The following ruling has been made:\n\n\"It would appear from the certificate signed by Father Lavern that the father and mother were baptized Roman Catholics and that they were married according to the Roman Catholic rites in 1937. From this evidence it would appear that both parents are Roman Catholics, and consequently their children should attend a school conducted under the Roman Catholic auspices\".\n\nIn view of the above ruling the Department approves the admission of these children to the Blood R.C.

He advised me that he had made arrangements for Arthur Kodwat to be admitted to the St. Paul's School at Cardston. While in Calgary I interviewed the Principal Rev. de Wolf. He was quite willing to accept Arthur. Therefore, I advised him that we would arrange for his transfer. I trust this will not disrupt your plans. Arthur is an Anglican and we felt it might be advisable that he be admitted to this school instead of the United Church School near Edmonton.\n\nWe hope to transfer him within the next few days and will make arrangements to have the application form forwarded.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.L.

In your letter to Mr. Barnes, you recommended that he be sent to the Edmonton Residential School. Mr. Waller, in the meantime had made arrangements for him to go to St. Paul's. Mr. Barnes stated that his senior room was over-crowded and felt that Arthur would receive more opportunity at St. Paul's. Dr. Falconer was in Cardston last week and spoke to the Rev. de Wolfe. He feels that St. Paul's would be the best place for him.\n\nArthur will be going to St. Paul's within the next few days. I will write to Mr. de Wolfe and give a full educational report on Arthur.\n\nAs Arthur's father is dead and his mother is in Whitehorse, we have not signed the application where it says Signature of Father.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDr. W.L.

Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 20th regarding the admission of Cecil and Joseph Holy White Man to the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, we have now received a ruling on these applications. It was ruled:\n\n\"The parents of these children were married according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church and the children have been baptized in the Roman Catholic Church. The father has been baptized by a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. Since the mother is of the Roman Catholic Church the children should attend the Roman Catholic School\".\n\nIn view of this ruling the admission of the above-mentioned boys to the St. Paul's C.E. Indian Residential School is, therefore, denied.\n\nPlease advise Mrs. Holy White Man of this ruling.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nCardston, Alberta,\nJune 12th, 1953.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA,\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Cecil Jr. and Joseph Holy White Man.\n\nThis office wrote you on April 20th, even file, enclosing Application for Admission for the above children to the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School, Blood Reserve, together with other paper concerning this admission; as yet we have had no reply.\n\nAs the mother of these children is very anxious to know whether or not they can be admitted to the St. Paul's School, would it be possible, please, to review this case and give a ruling as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.D. Ragan,\nSuperintendent,\nBlood Indian Agency.\nMEMORANDUM FOR:\n\nTHE A/DIRECTOR OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nReference your memorandum of May 21 regarding the application for the admission of Joseph and Cecil Holy White Man to St. Paul (C.E.) Indian Residential School. The parents of these children were married according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church and the children have been baptized in the Roman Catholic Church. From the information supplied, it appears that the deceased father, Cecil Holy White Man would have been baptized by a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. Your memorandum indicates that Mrs. Holy White Man is now living in common-law relationship with Many Grey Horses, but the religion of the mother Bridget Black Water is not mentioned. If she is of the Roman Catholic faith, the children should attend a Roman Catholic school. However, if she is not a Roman Catholic, as she is the responsible parent and has signed an application for the admission of her children to St. Paul (C.E.) school, they should be admitted to a Protestant school.\n\n(Sgd) Laval-Fortier.\nOttawa, May 21, 1953.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Holy White Man Family\n\nThis family is from the Blood Agency in the Province of Alberta.\n\nMrs. Holy White Man completed applications, (marked \"A\") requesting the admission of Joseph and Cecil, aged five and six respectively to the St. Paul's (C.E.) Indian Residential School.\n\nAttached (marked \"B\") is an extract from the Church records indicating that the parents were married in the Blood (R.C.) Indian Residential School by Father J.L.

Dept. of Mines and Resources. Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI beg to submit herewith my report for the Quarter ending September 30th 1946.\n\nBoth schools have been visited during the opening month of Sept. for checking attendance records, but time has not permitted any further check than the rolls of both schools and urgent work as requested by the Principals.\n\nThe attendance is as follows:\nSt Paul's Anglican School, as at Sept 23rd 101 pupils in attendance.\nBlood R.C. School, \" \" \" 23rd 157 \" \" \"\n\nThe roll attendance should be as follows:\nSt Paul's School: 141, and the Blood R.C. School, 166.\n\nThis is a marked improvement over this period last year, and is accounted for by the fact that the Family Allowances have been held pending this check up, and the submission of attendance lists to that Department.\n\nThere are a number of pupils who have not returned to school who are absent in the U.S.A., these number 7 children, and of these two are not likely to return having crossed into the States consequent upon a family separation namely James Big Throat, this was called to the attention of the Branch, early this spring.\n\nYour Agent has no method of approachment to this problem. Still a number are out with their parents working off the reserve, and anticipate that conveyance will be sent for their children. The Anglican school are contributing to this by sending out for pupils. This does not affect the Blood R.C. School, as their pupils are fairly good at returning after summer holidays.\n\nI have commented under buildings on this phase of the schools, but attention is again drawn to the matter of the Water Tower at the St Paul's School, as they are now only able to hold about 15,000 gallons of water in the tower due to its condition.\n\nAttention will be given to the repairs authorized for the roof at the St Paul's School, and Mr Weston of Cardston has been asked to carry out this work.\n\nTeaching Staffs are at full strength at both schools, and I am assured that the children are settling down to class room work fairly well.\n\nJ.E.

From the conversation\nheld with the subject I gathered that he intends to move\nagain, although he has no certain plans, therefore in\norder to make a definite date, as requested for the re-\nmoval of Wallace to school, I felt that short notice\nwould prevent further locating of this family. I made\narrangements that Wallace Bottle be prepared for Thursday,\nJanuary 30th, next. The boy appeared anxious to go to\nschool and his father assured he would be ready. The\nsubject, John Bottle, also requested that Johnson Bottle,\na younger son age 8, also be taken to this school. This\nboy has not to date attended any school.

I asked the principal to have the girls make one, so that it could be sent to the department, as I believe that sales could be made of this type of well finished article, in fact some have already been sold.

Little was being done in the way of manual training in these schools. There is considerable trachoma and they are anxious to see Doctor Wall.

Doucet of this Branch visit your school during the past few months. At that time he outlined the policy of the Branch regarding manual training and endeavoured to explain the matter as fully as possible to your teachers.\n\nDue to present conditions it will not be possible for the Department to allow any large amount in order to encourage the teaching of manual training in your school. However, it is hoped that you will co-operate with us in having this work commence during the academic year 1941-42.\n\nTo assist you in this regard Mr. Doucet is preparing a curriculum covering woodwork especially which it is hoped will be followed at your school during the coming academic term.\n\nAt the time of his visit Mr. Doucet made a careful check on the equipment that you have and has made definite recommendations to me regarding the additional equipment which he considers should be supplied in order to carry out the curriculum that you will receive. The cost of these tools will be borne by the Department and in addition you may expend an amount of $25.00 for necessary material.\n\nRev. Can. S. Middleton,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Paul's Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alta.\nYou will realize that the Department's wishes in regard to manual training can only be carried out with the co-operation of yourself and I feel certain that you recognize the value of this training and that the school management will provide at their own expense the space required for the classes and arrange to have some member of the staff follow the curriculum that you will receive.\n\nI understand that you have a small shop that is available for this work and I presume that you are quite willing to arrange for a member of the staff to teach the pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Under these circumstances it will be necessary for you to let me know the exact tools which you consider are necessary.

When Mr. Dowdle, Instructor, (who is also the Manual Training Instructor for the Cardston High School) saw the size of his class and the number of tools provided, he remarked there was not enough tools to keep the boys actively engaged.\n\nEnclosed is a list of tools he recommended as being essential for his needs. May I point out that the sum of twenty-five dollars had already been sanctioned for the purchase of material. It is now only a matter of changing the authority from Material to Tools and we will gladly buy all the material necessary.\n\nWould strongly recommend this request, as Mr. Dowdle is a very efficient Instructor, and we are paying him at the rate of $7.50 per day. The present contract calls for his coming at 9 am and continuing until 4 pm every Saturday.\n\nWe could obtain the tools mentioned at a specially reduced price from a Lethbridge Firm.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSHM/AD.

If any difficulty should arise for the instructor, please write direct to me and I will do all I can to make his efforts a complete success.\n\nI am very much interested in the Dominion Youth Movement. In all probability you are familiar with this Movement. I think it would be conducive to very good results if this training were introduced in your school. This training is as beneficial to the girls as to the boys. I feel sure that if you would write to Mr. Ross, Director of the Dominion Youth Training Movement for Alberta, he would give you all the information and help required. They would probably also send an instructor to help you start this training. I would like to be advised of the possibilities of organising this for your boys and girls.

We have been most anxious to secure such a person at Elkhorn but have failed up to the present. A suitable man was ready to take the position but has been unable to secure his discharge from the Army. I wonder if you would feel disposed to transfer this offer to St. Paul's School, Cardston? We have regular instruction being given there by Mr. H. Dowdle. The Principal writes of him in these terms:\n\n\"This man is very efficient, and is a good teacher. He has introduced several lines of Training\u2014woodwork\u2014painting\u2014sewing\u2014leatherwork. This branch has already received the commendation of the Department.\n\nAs this is an 'extra' from the usual academic routine, would it be possible, as the Department requested this training be instituted, that they make a Grant, towards both equipment and the Salary of the Instructor.\"\n\nMr. Dowdle is engaged on a part-time service and receives a salary of \u00a336.00 per month but I believe your Agent would testify as to the quality and variety of the instruction being given.

Ragan\nSuperintendent.\nColonel Neary:\n\nBlood (C.E.) Indian Residential School:\n\nVocational Training\n\n(a) Woodwork: This is centred in a small (12' by 16') room that was intended for a refrigerator. There are two work benches. The boys are instructed at the rate of two per half-day with one boy only on Saturday morning; none, apparently, on Saturday afternoons or Sundays. According to a list made up on February 1st, twenty-one boys would, accordingly, receive the attention of the instructor for one half-day per week. But when the attested photos were taken on April 22nd, truancy had considerably reduced the number under instruction. (One boy not shown has gone to get the cows for milking.)\n\nThe instructor, Mr. J.W. Mould, is a carpenter of the old school, habituated to the apprentice system. It would be asking too much to expect him to conduct classes in the usual way, unless he were given more space, more equipment, and copies of the woodwork course designed by Mr. Doucet. His present salary of $30 compares favourably with the $52 average of the academic subjects teachers.\n\n(b) Handicrafts for Girls:\n\nEach afternoon a group of about ten girls assemble for instruction in knitting, loom-weaving, cut-work. The classes do not properly correspond with the grades, and thus do not afford a real lightening of the academic teachers' load. The room pictured is also used in the mornings by the smallest children for language lessons.\n\n(c) Needlework: No garments are made. Patching, mending and darnning are done by the girls (not on a class system) for the girls, and by the smaller boys for the boys. The product varies from good to pathetic, but it has to be worn.\n\n(d) Other activities: (Page two follows).\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6374, file 764-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nBlood (C.E.) Indian Residential School:\n\nVocational Training:\n\n(d) Other Activities: Boys and girls perform many of the ordinary housekeeping duties and other work incidental to a home on a farm. Most of this work is done at other than class-room hours. Lists of duties are published from time to time showing the names of pupils assigned thereto. Below is shown the latest list of boys' duties with the number of boys employed and my notes in some cases:\n\nFarm: Morning: 1 varying duties\nAfternoon 1 ashes\n\nEngine room: Morning: 1 ashes\n\nBake-room: Morning: 4; 6.15-8.45 A.M. They each knead a big tub of dough, lacking a bread-mixer.\n\nCow stables: 6\nPiggery: 2\n\nRectory: 1 - fetches fuel and milk for the principal's wife.\n\"Cottage\" 1 - fetches milk and eggs for the vice-principal's family.\n\nKitchen: 2 fetch-and-carry\nSenior dormitory: 2 tidying up\nIntermediate \" 2 \"\nJunior dorms(2) 5 \"\nWashroom 2 \"\nBasins 1 \"\nStairs - scrub 1\n- sweep 1\n- dust 1\nHalls #2 & 3 2 1\nMain floor and basement 1\nPlayroom 3 (they do the job with wet hand-cloths. Mops are said to be \"on order\".)\nBackdoor and path 1 Not clear what this boy does. Not much evidence of his being on the job.\n\n--------\n\nDuties above are for the boys' side and the outside.

Weiler of Cardston, a qualified manual training instructor, spent each Saturday at St. Paul's Residential School instructing pupils there in woodworking etc. Mr. Weiler did a good job at St. Paul's and I have approached him with the idea of working at both residential schools on this Reserve this year.\n\nIt would be my idea that Mr. Weiler spend each Saturday at St. Paul's Residential School and two evenings each week at the Blood R.C. Residential School; Saturday's time would be from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. and each evening from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. which would give each school approximately the same instructional hours. Mr. Weiler has stated that he would be glad to do this work at a charge of $10.00 per school per week or $20.00 each week. Would the Department authorize the securing of Mr. Weiler's services under this arrangement?\n\nIn replying we would like to know whether or not any arrangements are being made for full time manual training instructor for the Blood Indian Reserve as I believe Mr. Weiler might be interested; he is a young man, well qualified and interested in his work and would be a distinct asset if we could secure his services.\n\nI have asked Mr. Weiler to give me a list of the immediate requirements in woodworking tools which he considers necessary at each school and if his services are authorized, we will forward a requisition for this equipment.\n\nR.D. Regan,\nSuperintendent,\nBlood Indian Reserve.\nSeptember 21, 1949.\n\nMr. R.D. Ragan,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nManual Training Instructor - Blood Indian Reserve\n\nReference is to your letter of September 12.\n\nThe hours of instruction proposed should be further discussed with the school principals so that there may be some assurance that there will be classes large enough to justify the salary paid and that the individuals who compose the classes will attend consecutive sessions and work on a planned progressive programme.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the previous school year a salary of forty dollars ($40) a month was paid in respect of St. Paul's school. Attendance statistics were:\n\n| Month | Number of Pupils | Sessions | Pupil Hours |\n|-------|------------------|----------|-------------|\n| April | 26               | 4        | 114         |\n| May   | 22               | 4        | 76          |\n| June  | 26               | 4        | 284         |\n\nThere is an unevenness about the figures in the last column which invites such questions as:\n(1) Are all the older boys to attend regularly?\n(2) Do the pupils go home for week-ends?\n(3) Are Saturday afternoon sessions likely to compete with other activities?\n(4) Does parent reaction to this programme seem favourable?\n\nIn regard to the commencement of classes at the Roman Catholic Residential School there are questions on which\nfurther assurance is desired:\n\n(5) Is the instructor acceptable to the Principal?\n(6) How many pupils will receive this training?\n(7) Are the evening hours suggested likely to be convenient and educationally productive?\n\nYou will understand that our purpose is to increase and improve the work in manual training which of late years on this reserve has not been all that is desired. All suggestions for the employment of Mr. Weller are receiving the most sympathetic consideration, and we shall welcome the early receipt of the additional information requested above.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Manual Training Instructor - Blood Indian Reserve\n\nI have your letter of the 21st of September, file 764-11 (E 3) regarding the above.\n\nPlease be advised that before our letter of September 12th was written the subject of a manual training instructor for the Reserve was fully discussed between principals of both schools and myself. We are definitely of the opinion that with the present quarters, the increased pupilage and the enthusiasm of the pupils a full time manual training instructor should be obtained for this Reserve as soon as possible. However, as it seemed unlikely that this was to be a reality for this school year we felt that Mr. Weiler as a part-time instructor would be very valuable. As stated before hours of instruction, adequate classes and so forth was fully discussed with the principals before my letter of the 12th of September was written and the hours of instruction as set out met with the approval of both principals and there is no doubt that the classes will be large enough to justify the salary paid to Mr. Weiler.\n\nIn your letter you quote attendance statistics of the last quarter of the previous school year at St. Paul's School. It must be pointed out here that teaching was done last year in a small ice house where no more than six people could get into the building at one time, but even in these restricted quarters good results were shown and everyone was pleased. This year with rooms set aside in the basement of the new classroom block larger classes can be accommodated and better results are bound to occur.\n\nIn answer to your questions in the third paragraph of your letter of the 21st of September-\n\n1. The older boys are all attending Manual Training classes regularly.\n2. The pupils do not go home for weekends.\n3. There is great interest in manual training and Saturday afternoon sessions are not likely to compete with other activities.\n4. Parent reaction to this program is most favorable.\nIn reply to your questions regarding the Roman Catholic Residential School:\n\n5. The instructor is very acceptable to the Principal although, as stated before, both principals and myself feel that this Reserve should have a fulltime instructor.\n\n6. We plan on starting four classes of ten boys each at this school or a total of 40 pupils - more will be taken on as the work progresses.\n\n7. The evening hours as suggested will certainly be educational productive; again, they are not as convenient as would be if this Reserve had a fulltime instructor, but at the moment if we are to have Manual Training at all this seems to be the only alternative.\n\nWe would like to state again here that principals, pupils and parents are most enthusiastic over manual training. We now have excellent quarters for the carrying out of this training and we would earnestly recommend that a fulltime instructor be employed for this Reserve as soon as possible. However, in the meantime and until a full time instructor can be employed we would recommend the temporary employment of Mr. Weller to commence duties at the earliest possible moment.\n\nR.F. Ragan,\nSuperintendent,\nBlood Indian Reserve.\n\nRDR/MR\nOctober 20th, 1949.\n\nMr. R.D. Ragan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nRe: Manual Training Instructor -\nBlood Indian Reserve,\nYour File 103-2-33\n\nWe have your letter of the 12th instant,\nwith further reference to your letter of September\n12th.\n\nThe Department approves the employment of\nMr. F.R. Weiler at the rate of $20.00 a week to carry\nout the work outlined in both your letters of\nSeptember 12th and October 12th.\n\nPlease let us know the date on which he\nbegins duties.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Manual Training Instructor, Blood Indian Reserve.\n\nWe were pleased to get your letter of the 20th instant, file 764-11 (E.1) authorizing the employment of Mr. F.R. Weiler as temporary Manual Training Instructor on the Blood Indian Reserve. Please be advised that Mr. Weiler will begin duties at the Blood R.C. Residential School on October 29th and at the St. Paul's Anglican Residential School on November 1, 1948.\n\nBoth these residential schools have little or no basic woodworking tools and we estimate that $150.00 at each school would give them the tools necessary for basic instruction. Would it be possible to allow an expenditure of $150.00 for each school for tools for the manual training classes; it would be understood that Mr. Weiler would designate what tools were necessary and these would be purchased by this office wholesale not to exceed the amount allowed.\n\nR.D. Raglan\nSuperintendent,\nBlood Indian Reserve.\nNovember 1st, 1949.\n\nMr. R.D. Ragan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nRe: Manual Training - Blood Indian Reserve\nYour File 103/2-33\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 28th, you should have Mr. Weiler prepare a list of the tools which he considers are necessary at both the Blood and St. Paul's Indian Residential Schools. A separate list should be forwarded for each school, as we maintain separate files.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that our records show that we have in the past supplied some tools to the St. Paul's School, but that we have not supplied any to the Blood School. When these lists are ready, you should forward them to this office so that the tools may be ordered through the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nSuperintendent of Education: 11028\n\nManual Training\nBlood reserve schools:\n\nYou will now have Mr. Supt. Ragan's report on the arrangements that have been made.\n\nThis morning I discussed these arrangements with Rev. H. LeHane who expressed satisfaction with the Saturday sessions. I promised to visit his school later.\n\nLast night I saw two groups working at St. Paul's School (6-7:30 and 7:30-9:00).\n\nMr. F.R. Weiler, the instructor, is pleased with the room. He has the pupils making five two-pupil work-benches.\n\nHe also does not favour power tools but he considers it necessary to have a power-grinder for sharpening tools. This seems to be an aid which we should supply.\n\nMay Mr. Supt. Ragan have your instructions, please.\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor\nSupt., Blood Agency.\n\nO.A.T.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the P.C. Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19 ...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the R.C. Indian School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the P.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated: September 30, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1941.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake R.C. Ind.Pac. School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal Q.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Surgeon Lake Band P.C.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shuswap Lake R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sherrington Lake R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk Lake, N.E., Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: W. Clark\n\nDated September 30, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Ind.

(RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-2, part 1)**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake R.C. Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Q. W. A.\n\nDated Oct. 1st, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driffield Alta., this 7th October, 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake R.C. Band Res. School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 1st, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Bigfish, Alta., this 7th October, 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake H.C. Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 1st, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driffield Alta., this 7th October, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shingwauk Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: L.J. Fournier, O.M.I.\n\nDated: April 15, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driftwood, Ontario, this 21st April, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return, the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Surogon Lake Indian School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 24, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Driffield Alta\n\nOct. 24, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1st, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Swift Current, Oct. 24, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 5th, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated Driftside Alta.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonds No. I.A. 403\nRequ.
